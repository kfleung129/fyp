    "text": "Urges swift action to secure devices Srinagar, Feb 6:\u00a0Cybersecurity agency, Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In), Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, Government of India has issued a critical alert regarding potential vulnerabilities in Apple products, specifically iPhones and MacBooks and users have been asked to be vigilant. The advisory, identified as Vulnerability Note CIAD-2024-0007, sheds light on multiple security flaws that, if exploited, could result in unauthorised access to devices and data theft. The advisory underscores the gravity of the identified vulnerabilities, posing a significant risk to Apple users, particularly those using iPhones and MacBooks. Potential hackers could exploit these flaws to gain access to sensitive information, bypass security measures, execute arbitrary code, and attain elevated privileges on compromised devices. To mitigate the potential risks, CERT-In has urged Apple users to take immediate action to secure their devices and protect their data. The agency recommends implementing security measures to reduce exposure to these vulnerabilities. The advisory provides a comprehensive list of vulnerable Apple devices, spanning various products running different operating systems, including Apple TV, Apple Watch, macOS, iOS, and iPadOS. To address the identified risks on iPhones and MacBooks, CERT-In advises users to promptly apply security updates provided by Apple. These updates are designed to patch vulnerabilities and enhance overall device security. Additional security measures recommended by CERT-In include the implementation of strong passwords, regular software updates, exercising caution with emails and links, and maintaining regular backups. Users are encouraged to keep their software updated, enabling automatic updates for added convenience. Creating strong, unique passwords with special characters and implementing two-factor authentication for all accounts is emphasised to fortify security. Users are warned against clicking on unknown links or emails, especially from unfamiliar sources, to avoid falling victim to potential hacking attempts. Regular backups of important data to external storage or iCloud are recommended to safeguard against accidental loss, security breaches, or device failures. This proactive measure ensures easy data restoration, minimising potential losses in the event of an incident. iPhone and MacBook users have been urged to remain vigilant, follow the recommended security measures, and promptly apply updates to protect their devices and data from potential threats.  Staying Secure CERT-In emphasises the importance of user vigilance and proactive security measures to mitigate potential threats. Some key steps recommended for users to enhance the security of their Apple devices include:  KEEPING SOFTWARE UP TO DATE Regularly check for updates on Apple devices and install them promptly. This ensures that the device is equipped with the latest security patches and bug fixes. Enabling automated updates adds an extra layer of convenience to stay protected.  IMPLEMENT STRONG PASSWORDS Create strong and unique passwords for all accounts. Additionally, enable two-factor authentication whenever possible. This provides an additional security layer, significantly reducing the risk of unauthorised access, even if the password is compromised.  EXERCISE CAUTION WITH EMAILS AND LINKS Be cautious when dealing with emails and links, especially those from unfamiliar or suspicious sources. Phishing scams often exploit vulnerabilities through deceptive emails and links. Vigilance in this regard can prevent falling victim to such cyber threats.  REGULAR BACKUPS Back up essential files to external storage devices or iCloud regularly. This precautionary measure protects your data in the event of accidental loss, device failure, or security breaches. Having a recent backup enables a swift data restoration process, minimising potential losses. Your email address will not be published.
