By \n\n\tAlex Weprin Media & Business Writer The tech giant Apple is seeking a bigger piece of the live sports market, leaning into the iPhone\u2019s status as the primary second screen to launch a new app dedicated to real-time sports data. Called Apple Sports, the free app launches today in the U.S., U.K. and Canada and is focused on live scores, as well as other data around the games. Notably, that also includes real-time betting odds, though users will be able to turn those off at any time. At launch Apple Sports will have scores and stats from the NBA, NHL, MLS, NCAA basketball, Premier League, LaLiga, Serie A, Bundesliga and LigaMX, though the company notes that other leagues will be up and running by the time their seasons begin, including MLB, the NFL as well as NCAA football.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRelated Stories\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tBusiness\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAs DOJ Takes on Apple, Netflix and Spotify Could Stand to Benefit\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tLifestyle\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Best Deals on Apple AirPods Are at Amazon Right Now -- At Prices That Rival Black Friday Users will be able to select their favorite leagues and teams for a more personalized experience. The new app is a significant expansion of Apple\u2019s interest in the sports space. it already has a dedicated section within the Apple News app, and Apple TV+ is the exclusive streaming home of MLS, as well as Friday night MLB games. And Apple also sees sports as an obvious use case for its Vision Pro device, with CEO Tim Cook telling The Hollywood Reporter earlier this month that he had \u201cseen several demos of the output of different games, and it\u2019s just mind blowing, it\u2019s so much different.\u201c \u201cIt\u2019s hard to go back to the 2-D world after you\u2019ve been in the 3-D world, you just don\u2019t want to do it,\u201d Cook added. The new app, however, is clearly meant as a companion to that viewing, with a dedicated app allowing for the real-time data needed for live stats, odds and scores. For sports fans who aren\u2019t near a TV (or are, and are watching something else and want to check in on another game in progress), the Apple Sports app is meant to be an easy \u2014 and most importantly fast \u2014 way to do so. It will also work with other iPhone features like live widgets. The app will also have a clearly visible button letting users click to watch the game being played on their iPhones. In the case of MLS or MLB, that will switch over to Apple TV+, for other sports, it will bring the user to the Apple TV app, where games from some of Apple\u2019s content partners that stream live games (most likely via a subscription) will be easily accessible. \u201cWe created Apple Sports to give sports fans what they want \u2014 an app that delivers incredibly fast access to scores and stats,\u201d said Eddy Cue, Apple\u2019s senior VP of Services, in a statement. \u201cApple Sports is available for free in the App Store, and makes it easy for users to stay up to date with their favorite teams and leagues.\u201d Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter Send us a tip using our anonymous form.
