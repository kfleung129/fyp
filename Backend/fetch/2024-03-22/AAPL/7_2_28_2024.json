    "text": "Feb 28 \u2013 Apple ( AAPL.O ) is opening a new tab on plans to reveal more about its plans for generative artificial intelligence later this year, Chief Executive Tim Cook said at the company\u2019s annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday. Cook said the iPhone maker sees \u201cincredible breakthrough potential for generative artificial intelligence, which is why we\u2019re investing heavily in this area right now. We believe this will open up transformative openings for druggies when it comes to productivity, problem working, and more. \u201d Apple has been slower to deploy generative artificial intelligence, which can generate human responses to written prompts, than rivals such as Microsoft ( MSFT.O ), Opens a New Tab and Alphabet\u2019s Google ( GOOGL.O ), Opens a New Tab , which weave them into products. On Wednesday, Cook claimed that artificial intelligence was already at work behind the scenes in Apple products, but said there would be more news about overt AI features later this year. Bloomberg previously reported that Apple plans to use artificial intelligence to improve the ability to search data stored on Apple devices. \u201c Every Mac powered by Apple silicon is an extremely expressive device with Ai. In fact, there\u2019s no better AI computer on the request moment, \u201d Cook said. Apple shareholders on Wednesday rejected a measure that would have required the company to disclose more information about how it uses artificial intelligence in its business and its ethical principles regarding the technology. The proposal, which was rejected at the company\u2019s annual shareholder meeting, was put forward by the pension fund AFL-CIO, America\u2019s largest union federation, which has also proposed AI measures at other technology companies. A similar proposal will be heard at Walt Disney\u2019s ( DIS.N ) annual meeting, which opens a new tab in April. At Apple, the AFL-CIO asked for a report on the company\u2019s use of artificial intelligence\u201d in its business operations and exposure of any ethical principles espoused by the company regarding the company\u2019s use of artificial intelligence technology.\u201d In its affirmative statement in Apple\u2019s proxy materials, the AFL-CIO wrote that \u201cartificial intelligence systems cannot be trained on copyrighted works or the voices, images, and performances of professional performers without translucency, concurrence, and compensation to generators and rights holders.\u201d Apple resisted the step, saying the openness could affect its strategy as it competes with rivals in the zippy- affecting field of AI.
