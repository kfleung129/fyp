The overall PC market, however, has seen a more consistent year-over-year percent decline, though it's recovering.\rAccording to a J.P. Morgan note seen by AppleInsider based on IDC data, the PC market is still in decline with an atypical quarter-over-quarter drop for Q3 to Q4 2023. This decline shouldn't be news to analysts as brands like HP and Dell warned of such market conditions, but the year-over-year change shows a positive trend.\rTraditional PC shipments declined 2% from Q3 to Q4 2023, which is usually a positive change historically. Shipments declined 3% year-over-year in Q4 2023, the eighth consecutive quarter of declines.\r Traditional PC Shipments Y/Y % Change. Image source: JP Morgan However, that single-digit decline is a positive trend, as previous year-over-year compares were at 8%, 13%, and 29% declines. HP and Lenovo are the only PC makers that grew market share sequentially in Q4 2023.\rApple's market share remained relatively flat, moderating from 10.6% to 8.5% across the quarters. Looking at the full-year basis, Apple's market share declined to 8.8% from 9.6%.\r Y/Y % Change in Mac Revenue Shipments and market share changes are dependent on Apple's asymmetrical release cycle.

Inflation and the ridiculous price increases blamed on COVID are causing people and companies to slow down on computer purchases. It's the same with cars and trucks. Everything is overpriced. CEO's are getting too much money, workers still aren't getting enough and stock holders are getting way too much money. Anyone with a brain knows this was going to happen. This is simple to explain.

The conclusion therefore is to put all CEOs in jail.Nobody on this planet can enforce a $15/hr salary for you. If you can earn more, good for you! Similarly no one can tell a corporation that they can't raise their prices. Your philosophy fails to recognize that corporations are just groups of people like you and me.

It\u2019s amazing.\u00a0Apple has such a small market share, yet everywhere I go, from college campuses to small business, to churches, to coffee shops, to family and friends, the world appears to be run on Mac\u2019s.\u00a0I think the feather in the PC cap is the fact that windows and its ecosystem of junk has been entrenched in the enterprise space for a long time - since windows 95, 98. \u00a0The sad part is that these corporations hear from Microsoft about TCO over 5 years, etc. but the reality is, they spend much more than if they ran a Mac ecosystem. Not only would the computers last much longer in practical daily use, but they don\u2019t need the constant attention of the IT department. Work at HP, Verizon, and ATT was quite revealing. HP replaced workers computers every two years - always with cheap junk. Verizon didn\u2019t let their workers actually have workstations. It was all server based. ATT had a tiered system. Lower levels on thin clients and management/executive tiers on a mix of mainframe/personal. It\u2019s kind of a mess actually.\u00a0And then you\u2019ve got big corporations that have been operating on autopilot, ordering fleets from the hp, Dell, Lenovo reps every couple of years, never stopping to think there must be a better way - from hardware longevity and usefulness to uptime, to stable software, to user satisfaction, etc. ROI and TCO are a game of charades. With Apple, you get a rock solid, satisfying to use, fair total cost of ownership with solid return on investment that doesn\u2019t need to be handled on the daily by IT to keep your employees useful. The IT industry is so huge on the windows/PC side because it\u2019s necessary. Microsoft had to establish a ministry unto itself just to keep its core business (windows+office) propped up.\u00a0But it does seem that with new generations growing into not only entrepreneurship, but leadership roles in large corporations, more common sense changes could be afoot.
