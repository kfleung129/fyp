But circumstances led to a very different kind of drenching, sitting in his local park in the rain contemplating the demise of his business during the dotcom crash. \u201cI lost everything. I had young children. I was embarrassed, upset that I\u2019d let my family down. I couldn\u2019t look them in the face,\u201d he recalls. His nadir came just before the emergence of a patent battle with Apple that would define his life. Nearly two decades on, he remains at loggerheads with the company and the US courts. He presents an intriguing figure: a credible, established British inventor who first gained wealth and success in the 1980s, but clearly bruised and angry after years of a David v Goliath dogfight that now dominates his online reputation and leaves onlookers questioning whether Racz or Apple is in the right. Racz was the man behind the Triflow \u2013 the world\u2019s first three-way mixer tap. The system took a typical sink mixer and added a extra waterway and valve to supply filtered water alongside hot and cold. A \u201cmultimillion-pound\u201d sale in 1998 locked in his gains after expanding the business to sell in 45\u00a0countries. However, he says his second chapter turned sour as his dotcom-era venture \u2013 a filesharing and payment tech company \u2013 was usurped by Apple\u2019s iTunes store. He claims the US corporation stole his system. \u201cI went through a period of deep depression,\u201d Racz says, opening up on the emotional toll for the first time. \u201cI\u2019m ashamed to say I hit the bottle. I was totally lost in a haze of time and I couldn\u2019t remember a lot.\u201d What gave him a \u201cnew lease of life\u201d was patents for the tech that were first lodged in 1999 and granted nearly a decade later, teeing up a huge court battle that is still playing out as he targets $18bn in\u00a0damages. Apple is no stranger to fighting such patent disputes: a standoff with medical technology company Masimo led to sales of Apple\u2019s Series\u00a09 and Ultra 2 smartwatches being paused in the US before Christmas. Racz has won some of his rounds in court against the company, but there is no guarantee of ultimate victory for either side. The only certainty is that the road ahead will be long, winding and costly. Racz grew up on a strawberry farm in Jersey and spent his early career in sales. When he sold his tap business, Avilion, he pursued the digital download market, just as Napster upended the music industry with illegal filesharing. Racz quickly filed for patents for his anti-piracy alternative Smartflash, and accompanying systems to allow payments and secure downloads. He lined up deals with retailers and manufacturers, including Gemplus, a French sim card company. Pop star Britney Spears signed up as a brand ambassador. But in the fallout from 9/11 and the dotcom crash, Spears and Gemplus pulled out, and Racz says in court that Gemplus \u2013 also a partner to Apple \u2013 then claimed the product as its own. His blood boiled as he saw late Apple boss Steve Jobs \u201csoak up the praise\u201d for a series of products marrying hardware and software in the way Racz claims he first devised, starting with iTunes in 2003. After receiving patent approval in 2008, he scored an unlikely victory \u2013 landing $533m in damages in 2015 after suing Apple in Texas. It was one of the biggest jury awards to a private inventor, Racz says. But the court\u2019s decision was later unwound: first hurt by a ruling by the US Patent Trial and Appeal Board that his patents were invalid, and then losing as Apple appealed in the commercial courts. He has since lost his own appeals, but has vowed to fight on. He has faced a sizeable backlash online among Apple supporters in recent years, which even included death threats, emailed by unknown individuals. \u201cThose things start to sting \u2013 when you\u2019re told that your kids should be burned at the stake and that you should be beheaded for what you\u2019re doing. My kid was being bullied \u2013 with kids saying: \u2018Your dad say he invented this, he didn\u2019t he stole it, Apple invented it. Your dad\u2019s a liar,\u2019\u201d Racz says over coffee in London. Tall, burly and with a short crop of dark hair, he is visibly still riled as he retells his story. Racz\u2019s latest tussle is with the US Patent Office, which he is suing for refusal to disclose uncensored emails and documents related to his intellectual property. He is attempting to prove that panels of judges were intentionally stacked with ex-lawyers and close supporters of Apple. Racz argues the company has used its \u201cwealth and power\u201d to influence the US patent system. Approached for comment, Apple pointed to a previous statement, issued in 2015, which said: \u201cSmartflash makes no products, has no employees, creates no jobs, has no US presence, and is exploiting our patent system to seek royalties for technology Apple invented. \u201cWe refused to pay off this company for the ideas our employees spent years innovating and unfortunately we have been left with no choice but to take this fight up through the court system.\u201d Gemplus did not respond to a request for comment. Away from his legal pursuits, he is a backer of Regent Sounds, a musical instrument shop in central London\u2019s Denmark Street once used by the Rolling Stones as a studio and which engaged in its own tussle with the landlord behind the huge development by media venture Outernet. His main mission remains telling his story. He\u2019s written Smartflash, an autobiography, and says he has interest from publishers. His friend Simon Morris, the ex-global chief creative officer at Amazon and the man behind Amazon Prime Video, has signed up to sell the rights to a documentary about Racz\u2019s life and is pitching the project to studios. Meanwhile, Racz remains focused on his legal campaign, which is backed by private investors who would share in any winnings. \u201cThey say what doesn\u2019t kill you makes you stronger \u2013 it\u2019s made me even more\u00a0determined.\u201d "
