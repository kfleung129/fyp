    "text": "After a solid year regarding the value gains to its stock with over 35% in the green, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) posted another significant milestone that hasn\u2019t been achieved in over a decade. In 2023, Apple Inc.\u2019s iPhone surpassed Samsung Electronics Co. devices, claiming the title of the best-selling smartphone series. This marks the first time South Korea\u2019s largest company has relinquished the top spot since 2010, as reported on January 17. Apple reaped the rewards of compelling promotions that successfully prompted a transition towards premium devices. Despite a tepid response to the iPhone 15 in China, its largest international market, Apple still managed to increase shipments in 2023. The challenging market dynamics included Huawei Technologies Co.\u2019s rising popularity and an expanding ban on government use, which contributed to declining sales. At the time of press, AAPL stock was worth $183.63, following a decrease of 1.23% since the previous closure, while also declining by -0.16% over the last five trading sessions. This stock has lost -1.08% since the beginning of 2024. Notably, Wall Street analysts\u2019 average 12-month price objective for AAPL currently stands at $203.35, implying around 10.74% further upside compared to the current share price. The stock has an average analyst rating of \u2018Moderate Buy,\u2019 based on 23 \u2018Buy\u2019 recommendations, 9 advised \u2018Hold,\u2019 and one suggested a \u2018Sell.\u2019 Forecasts suggest moderate optimism from analysts, with predictions going as high as $250, which is a 10.73% increase in stock worth, and the lowest prediction still spells out a decrease from its current price by -18.31%.
