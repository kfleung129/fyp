    "text": "Apple Inc AAPL has reportedly decided to discontinue its electric vehicle (EV) project, codenamed Titan. This decision has been met with approval from a prominent analyst, who believes that the move is in the best interest of the company. What Happened: Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, on social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, reacted to the news of Apple\u2019s decision to halt its EV project. Ives, who is known for his insights into the tech industry, expressed his support for Apple\u2019s move, citing the rapidly evolving EV landscape as a significant factor. Apple has cancelled its decade-long effort to build an EV. The writing was on the wall for Apple with a much different EV landscape forming that would have made this an uphill battle. Most of these Project Titan engineers now all focused on AI at Apple which is the right move\ud83c\udf4e See Also: Trump-Inspired MAGA Coin Shines, Bitcoin Advocate Predicts Market Crash, \u2018Dogecoin Killer\u2019 Shiba Inu\u2019s Burn Rate Soars And More: Top Crypto Updates This Week Apple\u2019s EV project, which has been in the works for over ten years, has now been officially abandoned, as per a report by Bloomberg. The company has informed nearly 2,000 employees working on the project about this decision. Many of these employees will be redirected to Apple\u2019s generative AI division, with layoffs expected but the exact number of affected workers still unclear. Apple\u2019s EV project has faced numerous setbacks, including delays and changes in leadership and strategy. Despite these challenges, the company had previously shifted its focus to a less ambitious EV design, similar to that of Tesla Inc. However, the project has now been completely scrapped. The decision to abandon the EV project was reportedly finalized by Apple\u2019s top executives in response to ongoing pressure from the company\u2019s board. Why It Matters: The decision to abandon the EV project has been met with mixed reactions. Renowned investment figure\u00a0Ross Gerber\u00a0expressed his relief at Apple\u2019s decision, stating that the company had \u201cmissed their big opportunity to invest in Tesla.\u201d On the other hand,\u00a0Jim Cramer, the host of CNBC\u2019s \u201cMad Money,\u201d has suggested that Google\u2019s parent company\u00a0Alphabet Inc\u00a0should streamline its business operations, following Apple\u2019s example. Cramer believes that a more focused approach could potentially boost Alphabet\u2019s stock performance.
