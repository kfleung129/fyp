Prabhu Ram, Head, Industry Intelligence Group at market intelligence firm CMR, told IANS that the country is adding more upstream capabilities to the electronics ecosystem. \u201cApple has been a prime beneficiary of this conducive policy environment. At Cybermedia research, our market estimates point to Apple recording a significant 40 per cent year on year growth in iPhone shipments in 2023,\u201d he said.
