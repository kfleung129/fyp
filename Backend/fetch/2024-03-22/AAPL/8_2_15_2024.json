    "text": "Apple is widely rumored to be working on major new artificial intelligence features coming later this year. In a new report today, Bloomberg says that Apple is \u201cnearing the completion of\u201d an update to its Xcode development platform that will use AI to streamline coding and testing for developers. The report says that Apple\u2019s new system in Xcode will work along the lines of Microsoft\u2019s GitHub Copilot platform. It will reportedly \u201cuse artificial intelligence to predict and complete blocks of code\u201d in an effort to simplify the work required for software development. Bloomberg also says that Apple is exploring how to use AI to \u201cgenerate code for testing applications.\u201d Apple\u2019s goal is to release the new AI features in Xcode as soon as later this year for third-party developers. Right now, it is \u201cpushing some engineers to try these new AI features internally\u201d as it aims to meet its launch goals. The new system will operate similarly to Microsoft\u2019s GitHub Copilot and use artificial intelligence to predict and complete blocks of code, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the plans are private. That simplifies the programming process for software development, potentially saving time and money. Apple is also exploring the use of AI to generate code for testing applications, an often tedious process. Currently, Apple is pushing some engineers to try these new AI features internally as part of a \u201cdogfooding\u201d effort \u2014 when a company uses its own products \u2014 to make sure they work properly before releasing them to outside developers. During Apple\u2019s earnings call earlier this month, Apple CEO Tim Cook promised that the company would share more details about its AI work this year.
