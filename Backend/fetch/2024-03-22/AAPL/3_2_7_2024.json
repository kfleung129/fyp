    "text": "Still dreaming of a foldable iPhone? We've got good news and bad news for you. According to a new report by The Information (via 9to5Mac), Apple is actively developing several foldable devices, and has at least two prototypes of clamshell folding models. The bad news: The foldable iPhone appears to be in early development, and it may not launch very soon. Worse news: Apple still seems to be hitting all the old roadblocks that cause the company to halt the foldable phone development back in 2020. According to the report, Apple wanted this phone to be really thin when unfolded, about half the thickness of the current phone models, and the company also looked into adding an outward-facing display. But it appears the company's designers and engineers were unable to achieve these goals. They're also working on a way for the phone's display to be fully flat when unfolded, but there's no word on whether they've achieved this, either. All of this means that the foldable iPhone likely isn't coming this year or the next. Maybe 2026 is the year? Apple is also reportedly working on a larger device, a foldable iPad if you will. The report says that this device would have an 8-inch, inward folding display; so you'd get something that's as large as an iPad mini when folded, and close to the larger iPad Pro when unfolded. Such a device might actually be closer to production than the iPhone, as Apple's standards regarding thickness may not be as strict when it comes to a larger, tablet-like device.
