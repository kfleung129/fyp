    "text": "Apple released a new iPhone setting called Stolen Device Protection in the iOS 17.3 software update. This setting makes it harder for thieves to access your personal information if they steal your iPhone and know your passcode. They get it by watching you enter your code in a public place, as the Wall Street Journal has reported. Normally, someone with your passcode can change your Apple ID password, disable Find My iPhone, access saved passwords, and erase your data. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Rich DeMuro (@richontech) The new setting requires biometrics (Face ID or Touch ID) or a 1-hour delay before thieves can make major changes on a stolen iPhone. To turn it on: On iPhone, go to Settings > Face ID & Passcode > Stolen Device Protection If you don\u2019t see the new setting, make sure your phone is updated to the latest iOS 17.3 software. You can check Settings > General > Software Update. For the latest news, weather, sports, and streaming video, head to KTLA. "
