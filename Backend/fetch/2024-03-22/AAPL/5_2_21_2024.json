Markets wavered as latest data showed inflation in January 2024 was hotter-than-expected. But many analysts believe the markets overreacted as a single month's data can only delay the Fed's planned rate cuts for 2024. UBS Global Wealth Management on February 20 said it expects the Federal Reserve to begin cutting rates in June instead of May. UBS expects the first rate cut to be of 25 basis points. \"Given the upside surprises to both payrolls and inflation, we now expect the Fed to wait a bit longer before cutting rates,\" UBS economists said in a note. UBS is expecting 75 bps of cuts in 2024, lower than its previous estimate of 100 bps cuts. The era of elevated interest rates might be prolonged amid a resilient labor market and stubborn inflation but sooner or later the Fed will begin to cut rates. That means good times might be coming for small-cap stocks or risky equities, including penny stocks, which have hitherto suffered as investors' shunned smaller companies to find refuge in high quality stocks like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA). Historical data showed small-cap stocks perform exceptionally well in the first 12 months of the Fed's first rate cut. Lord Abbett in its December 2023 report took a detailed look at what the private investment management company called a dovish \"pivot\" of the Federal Reserve where it hinted that its interest rate cycle might have peaked. The Lord Abbett report also said small-cap companies perform well during rate cuts. \"Currently, in fixed income, we find the short duration space to be attractive and underallocated. A \u201cbull-steepening\u201d environment, like what we\u2019ve seen when the Fed turns dovish on policy, favors short duration. At the same time, the normalized rate environment can make active, opportunistic credit an attractive diversifier with expected returns at current yields rivaling equities. Equities, particularly small caps, historically have done very well when inflation falls and in Fed rate-cut cycles while growth equities have done well when growth slows. Finally, a more normalized rate environment means less of the \u201cfinancing for everyone\u201d that was prevalent in the zero-interest-rate era. Going forward, quality companies with greater financial strength should be able to differentiate in terms of financial performance and demand a premium. All in all, the Fed\u2019s dovish December pivot shocked the markets and set the table for better performance by risk assets in 2024. What a difference a week can make,\" the report added.

Earlier this week in New Delhi, my team held a signing ceremony with Rahul Bhatia, the Group Managing Director of InterGlobe, to announce our plans to work with InterGlobe to bring safe, sustainable and low-noise electric air taxi services to some of the most highly populated cities in the world.

In these cities, traffic congestion contributes to 20% to 25% of the outdoor pollution, and I hope that Archer can be a part of reducing that over the next decade. I founded Archer to help give back time to millions of people and to make cities smarter, better, cleaner, more efficient places to live.
