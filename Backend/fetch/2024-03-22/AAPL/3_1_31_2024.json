    "text": "While some may have thought the Epic Games versus Apple battle ended when the US Supreme Court decided the existing App Store ruling would stand, and it would not hear appeals from either side, it quickly became clear that this isn\u2019t the case. Epic Games has now followed through with its threat to contest Apple\u2019s \u201cbad-faith compliance plan\u201d \u2013 which would see the company charge 27% commission on app sales made outside of its own App Store \u2026 That decision meant the original court rulings stand, and Apple promptly responded with an announcement that, sure, it would allow third-party app sales \u2013 but it would still charge a 27% commission on them (12% for small developers). It seems clear that antitrust regulators will not be satisfied with this, with the US Department of Justice reportedly close to initiating legal proceedings against Apple. Apple has take almost exactly the same stance in response to European antitrust legislation, and is again likely to face the wrath of regulators there. As soon as Apple announced its plans, Epic accused the company of bad faith, arguing that it was not in fact complying with the original court ruling. The company\u2019s chief exec told us that it went against the entire intention of the judge\u2019s decision. Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney isn\u2019t happy with the final terms and says the company will contest Apple\u2019s \u201cbad-faith compliance plan\u201d [\u2026] In a statement to\u00a09to5Mac, Sweeney pointed out that Apple\u2019s solution is \u201canticompetitive\u201d since developers can\u2019t offer digital items more cheaply on the web after having to pay both Apple and another platform. Bloomberg reports that Epic has indeed filed an official complaint to this effect. Apple Inc. hasn\u2019t properly complied with a court order to open its App Store to allow outside payment options weeks after its bid to resist those changes hit a dead end, Epic Games Inc. told a judge [\u2026] Epic said in a filing Tuesday that it \u201cdisputes Apple\u2019s compliance\u201d with previously ordered changes and said it will explain the \u201cnon-compliance\u201d in a forthcoming filing. Apple didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment. (While the Supreme Court decision means neither side can challenge the ruling itself, what Epic is doing here is claiming that Apple is not complying \u2013 which is a matter which will need to be settled in court.) Apple\u2019s position is that the court confirmed it is entitled to charge a commission (though expressed no view on the amount); that all developers benefit from the support the company provides through APIs and the like; and, rather randomly, that it doesn\u2019t charge anything if a user taps an external purchase link and for some inexplicable reason waits seven days before buying the app. Photo by\u00a0Markus Spiske\u00a0on\u00a0Unsplash FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.
