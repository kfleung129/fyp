Americas+1 212 318 2000 EMEA+44 20 7330 7500 Asia Pacific+65 6212 1000 By Mike Vilensky Apple Inc. didn\u2019t misrepresent the value of stock-based compensation for Tim Cook and other executives to shareholders ahead of a vote on Cook\u2019s pay, a federal judge said, dismissing an investor\u2019s lawsuit against the tech giant and its top leaders. Apple\u2019s disclosures to shareholders didn\u2019t unlawfully lead the Teamsters pension fund that brought the lawsuit to lose money through inflated executive pay, Judge Jennifer L. Rochon said, because the investor only took a non-binding vote on executive pay after reviewing the proxy statement. The International Brotherhood of Teamsters pension fund, an institutional investor in Apple, sued Cook and other high-level Apple executives in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York last year, alleging violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and SEC regulations. Apple directors failed to use the proper, \u201csomewhat complicated\u201d analytical model to determine the values of performance-based stock compensation for Cook and others, the Teamsters said in the complaint. Apple then presented the lower values in part of a proxy statement to stockholders ahead of a non-binding shareholder vote on Cook\u2019s pay, \u201cgrossly understat[ing] the known costs of this compensation,\u201d the Teamsters had said. Instead of awarding $77.5 million for several executives per fiscal year, Apple actually awarded about $92.7 million in restricted stock units for FY 2021 and about $94 million in FY 2022. The plaintiffs had sought a reduction of the executives\u2019 compensation and damages. Rochon rejected as \u201cimpermissibly speculative\u201d the fund\u2019s cause of action based on the theory that had Apple calculated executive compensation with a different model and presented that calculation in the proxy statement, then shareholders would have voiced feedback that would have caused Apple to change the compensation. The value of stock-based executive compensation in Apple\u2019s proxy statement doesn\u2019t constitute an actionable material misrepresentation, the judge said. The fund alleges \u201conly that the method of calculation employed is \u2018improper,\u2019 but not that it was in any way inaccurate,\u201d Rochon said. \u201cThere is no SEC rule requiring that a specific method for determining executive compensation be used, so long as the chosen method is disclosed...Apple did precisely what [SEC rules] require\u2014presented its compensation process and methods.\u201d The case was dismissed with prejudice.
