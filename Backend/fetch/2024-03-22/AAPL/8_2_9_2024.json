Here\u2019s Morningstar\u2019s take on Apple\u2019s earnings and stock.\nKey Morningstar Metrics for Apple\n\nFair Value Estimate: $160.00\nCurrent price: $188\nMorningstar Rating: 2 stars\nMorningstar\u00a0Economic Moat Rating: Wide\nMorningstar\u00a0Uncertainty Rating: Medium\n\nWhat We Thought of Apple\u2019s Q4 Earnings\nApple\u2019s results showed better iPhone revenue in the December quarter than we expected, as well as better profitability. iPhone revenue was driven by the launch of the iPhone 15 lineup, and the improved profitability stems from a higher mix of services and higher-end products like the iPhone Pro models. However, revenue guidance for the March quarter fell below our expectations.\nIn the short term, we see demand headwinds for Apple relating to elongating personal device replacement cycles and more aggressive domestic alternatives in China. In the long term, we maintain our view that Apple can drive growth from its unique combination of hardware, software, and services, which also elicits steep customer switching costs and underpins our wide moat rating.\nWe believe guidance for weaker iPhone revenue in the March quarter portends weaker iPhone revenue for fiscal 2024 (ending in September). In our view, Apple\u2019s current share price reflects overly rosy expectations for iPhone sales over the next five years, and our more modest forecast leads us to see the stock as overvalued.\nAAPL Bulls Say\n\nApple offers an expansive ecosystem of tightly integrated hardware, software, and services, which locks in customers and generates strong profitability.\nWe like Apple\u2019s move to in-house chip development, which we think has accelerated its product development and increased its differentiation.\nApple has a stellar balance sheet and sends great amounts of cash flow back to shareholders.\n\nAAPL Bears Say\n\nApple is prone to consumer spending and preferences, which creates cyclicality and opens the firm to disruption.\nApple\u2019s supply chain is highly concentrated in China and Taiwan, which leaves the firm vulnerable to geopolitical risk. Attempts to diversify into other regions may pressure profitability or efficiency.\nRegulators have a keen eye on Apple, and recent regulations have chipped away at parts of its sticky ecosystem.\n\n\n\nIs Apple Stock Fairly Valued?\nWith its 2-star rating, we believe Apple\u2019s stock is overvalued compared with our long-term fair value estimate of $160 per share. Our valuation implies a fiscal 2024 adjusted price/earnings multiple of 25 times, a fiscal 2024 enterprise value/sales multiple of 7 times, and a fiscal 2024 free cash flow yield of 4%.\nWe project 6% compound annual revenue growth for Apple through fiscal 2028. The iPhone will be the greatest contributor to revenue over our forecast, and we project 3% growth for iPhone revenue over the next five years. We expect this to be driven primarily by unit sales growth, with modest pricing increases. We think pricing increases will be driven primarily by higher features and a mix shift toward the more premium Pro models.\nServices are Apple\u2019s next biggest revenue contributor over our forecast, and we predict 8% revenue growth in this segment. Services are driven in large part by revenue from Google, thanks to its status as the default search engine on the Safari browser, as well as Apple\u2019s cut of App Store sales. We expect solid growth in Google revenue, but we see a more mixed outlook for App Store results. There we forecast growth in overall app revenue but progressively lower cuts going toward Apple as the result of regulatory pressures. Elsewhere, we see roughly high-single-digit growth across revenue from Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Pay, AppleCare, and Apple\u2019s other services.\nWe see the highest growth opportunity in Apple\u2019s wearables revenue, to the tune of 18% through fiscal 2028, primarily driven by our expectations for the ramp of the new Vision Pro headset. We project a rapid ramp for Vision Pro, approaching 10 million unit sales and $30 billion in revenue in fiscal 2028. We see high-single-digit growth for Apple Watch and AirPods sales, with both products continuing to gain share. Apple (AAPL)\u00a0released its fiscal Q1 earnings report on February 1.

It is projection/opinion and not a statement of fact. Morningstar assigns star ratings based on an analyst\u2019s estimate of a stock's fair value. Four components drive the Star Rating: (1) our assessment of the firm\u2019s economic moat, (2) our estimate of the stock\u2019s fair value, (3) our uncertainty around that fair value estimate and (4) the current market price. This process culminates in a single-point star rating that is updated daily. A 5-star represents a belief that the stock is a good value at its current price; a 1-star stock isn't. If our base-case assumptions are true the market price will converge on our fair value estimate over time, generally within three years. Investments in securities are subject to market and other risks. Past performance of a security may or may not be sustained in future and is no indication of future performance. For detail information about the Morningstar Star Rating for Stocks, please visit here Quantitative Fair Value Estimate represents Morningstar\u2019s estimate of the per share dollar amount that a company\u2019s equity is worth today. The Quantitative Fair Value Estimate is based on a statistical model derived from the Fair Value Estimate Morningstar\u2019s equity analysts assign to companies which includes a financial forecast of the company. The Quantitative Fair Value Estimate is calculated daily. It is a projection/opinion and not a statement of fact. Investments in securities are subject to market and other risks. Past performance of a security may or may not be sustained in future and is no indication of future performance. For detail information about the Quantiative Fair Value Estimate, please visit here The Morningstar Medalist Rating is the summary expression of Morningstar\u2019s forward-looking analysis of investment strategies as offered via specific vehicles using a rating scale of Gold, Silver, Bronze, Neutral, and Negative. The Medalist Ratings indicate which investments Morningstar believes are likely to outperform a relevant index or peer group average on a risk-adjusted basis over time. Investment products are evaluated on three key pillars (People, Parent, and Process) which, when coupled with a fee assessment, forms the basis for Morningstar\u2019s conviction in those products\u2019 investment merits and determines the Medalist Rating they\u2019re assigned. Pillar ratings take the form of Low, Below Average, Average, Above Average, and High. Pillars may be evaluated via an analyst\u2019s qualitative assessment (either directly to a vehicle the analyst covers or indirectly when the pillar ratings of a covered vehicle are mapped to a related uncovered vehicle) or using algorithmic techniques. Vehicles are sorted by their expected performance into rating groups defined by their Morningstar Category and their active or passive status. When analysts directly cover a vehicle, they assign the three pillar ratings based on their qualitative assessment, subject to the oversight of the Analyst Rating Committee, and monitor and reevaluate them at least every 14 months. When the vehicles are covered either indirectly by analysts or by algorithm, the ratings are assigned monthly. For more detailed information about these ratings, including their methodology, please go to here The Morningstar Medalist Ratings are not statements of fact, nor are they credit or risk ratings. The Morningstar Medalist Rating (i) should not be used as the sole basis in evaluating an investment product, (ii) involves unknown risks and uncertainties which may cause expectations not to occur or to differ significantly from what was expected, (iii) are not guaranteed to be based on complete or accurate assumptions or models when determined algorithmically, (iv) involve the risk that the return target will not be met due to such things as unforeseen changes in changes in management, technology, economic development, interest rate development, operating and/or material costs, competitive pressure, supervisory law, exchange rate, tax rates, exchange rate changes, and/or changes in political and social conditions, and (v) should not be considered an offer or solicitation to buy or sell the investment product. A change in the fundamental factors underlying the Morningstar Medalist Rating can mean that the rating is subsequently no longer accurate.
