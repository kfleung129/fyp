According to a report by Morgan Stanley, the company\u2019s revenue in India surged 42% year-on-year in 2023 to $8.7 billion. iPhone shipments grew 39% year-on-year, to 9.2 million units, making it iPhone\u2019s fifth-largest smartphone market.

This compares to China iPhone shipments, which represented 20% of iPhone shipments and revenue in CY23 (down 1-2 points Y/Y, respectively). \u201cUltimately, this means that India as a standalone market is still not big enough to offset the declines we are seeing in the Chinese market today, but if India continues to grow at the same trajectory while China iPhone shipments stay flat, India would be a bigger iPhone market than China by 2027.\u201d Driving India\u2019s iPhone growth is increasing consumer demand for premium devices with more storage capacity rather than the latest models. The average iPhone sold in India last year had around 260GB of memory, a 26% increase over 2022, Morgan Stanley said. India became Apple\u2019s fifth-largest iPhone market in the second quarter of 2023,\u00a0 for the first time, overtaking France and Germany. India contributed close to 4% of all iPhone sales in the second quarter, growing 50% year-on-year. The top five iPhone models shipped in the country were the iPhone 13, iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Plus, iPhone 14 Pro, and iPhone 15 and they made up 86% of total sales. Apple\u2019s significant revenue growth in India is coming after the Cupertino giant in 2023, opened two Apple stores, a significant milestone for the company, roughly 25 years after entering the South Asian market. The tech giant has been touting India as its next big growth driver amid declining sales of its flagship device. Its suppliers have also been ramping up manufacturing operations in the region amid weakening demand and regulatory pressure in China. Last year, Morgan Stanley predicted that India will likely be a major driver of Apple\u2019s five-year revenue and installed base growth, citing Apple\u2019s investment in manufacturing in India and the country\u2019s economic boom. The establishment of Apple\u2019s first retail stores and the company\u2019s increased efforts to assemble iPhones and other products in India underscore the importance of the South Asian market, as the company\u2019s big bet on India is already beginning to pay off. Analysts forecast that India in the next five years can account for 15 percent of Apple\u2019s major revenue growth. This suggests that India will be just as important to Apple\u2019s growth algorithm over the next 5+ years as China was in the last 5 years.
