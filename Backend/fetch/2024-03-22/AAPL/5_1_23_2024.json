Login Apple wants the Albanese government to clarify when the Reserve Bank would be able to deploy new powers allowing it to create rules on bank access to the tech giant\u2019s tap-and-go mobile payment system, after Apple said it would allow European bank apps to make payments with iPhones without sending them through Apple\u2019s digital wallet. Apple provided the concessions in Europe as part of moves to settle antitrust charges brought by the European Commission, which has been investigating banks\u2019 access to the Apple Pay system, Reuters reported at the weekend. Apple wants the Albanese government to rethink new RBA powers. \u00a0Josh Robenstone The case arose because Apple restricts access to its near-field communication (NFC) technology, which lets iPhones communicate with payment terminals. Currently, all contactless payments that use iOS-based devices, such as iPhones and Apple Watches, are sent through Apple Pay. The EU says that, by limiting third-party access, Apple is making it tougher for banks to develop rival mobile wallets, which are becoming a more common way to pay. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has been examining similar issues after the big banks flagged concerns eight years ago that Apple\u2019s payments architecture was \u201cclosed and controlling\u201d. The federal government is consulting on new laws that would expand the powers of the RBA over Apple and other global payments platforms. The changes to the Payment Systems (Regulation) Act of 1998 would let the RBA create an \u201caccess regime\u201d, creating rules about bank use of iPhones for payments, which has emerged as a key issue in submissions to Treasury on the bill late last year. The Australian Banking Association argues the new law should ensure regulators can consider bank access to \u201cgatekeeper\u201d or \u201cmust-have\u201d payment technologies, which are being used by a growing proportion of consumers and businesses. \u201cThe ABA strongly supports the intention for the RBA to have clear powers to address a spectrum of issues that may affect access to payment systems,\u201d it said. Whether Apple is acting as a \u201cgatekeeper\u201d \u2013 by controlling critical economic infrastructure that iPhones have become part of as they digitise payment cards \u2013 was flagged last year by Commonwealth Bank CEO Matt Comyn. He has been warning policymakers for several years about Apple\u2019s increasing power in the financial services sector. Apple told Treasury in its latest November 1 submission that if Australian regulators are given powers to impose such a regime, decisions should be \u201cappropriately weighed against potentially harmful consequences for participants and the public more generally\u201d. The Cupertino, California-based company expressed concerns that draft bill \u201cdoes not identify any specific matters that must be taken into account\u201d when proposing an access regime, or standards. Apple has previously argued its control of the iPhone NFC antenna, which also lets it charge banks fees when iPhones make card payments, is necessary to maintain the security of iPhones. It has also argued banks\u2019 arguments are being made to protect their own market power in payments, given Apple Pay makes it easy to switch between cards issued from different banks. In Europe, where it faces a potential fine from the commission, Apple\u2019s position appears to be softening. \u201cWe have offered commitments to provide third-party developers in the European Economic Area with an option that will enable their users to make NFC contactless payments from within their iOS apps, separate from Apple Pay and Apple Wallet,\u201d Reuters reported Apple as saying on Friday. The decision may embolden Australian banks, which have been seeking fair access to the NFC since Apple Pay arrived in Australia in 2016. The following year, the ACCC refused to grant the other big banks authorisation to collectively bargain with Apple over access to NFC technology. But ACCC chairwoman Gina Cass-Gottlieb said in 2022 that the competition watchdog had been collaborating with the EU on NFC access, including considering whether Apple \u201cengages in self-preferencing and restriction of competitor access to functionality is in its reservation of tap-and-go, contactless payments using the NFC chip on Apple mobile devices to its own Apple Pay app and Apple Wallet\u201d. Apple told Treasury in its latest submission that the bill \u201cis not a proportionate nor evidence-based regulatory response\u201d for services that are simply a digital presentation of a physical card. It reiterated it had a \u201climited role in payment systems\u201d and no material risks caused by Apple Pay had been identified that would make regulatory intervention necessary.
