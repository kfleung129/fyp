    "text": "In a report describing new AI coding and testing features coming to Xcode later this year, Bloomberg also shares some interesting details about ways Apple is considering using AI to supercharge Spotlight. The report describes a version of Spotlight that is far more powerful than what we have today, thanks to the use of generative AI. Spotlight Search is Apple\u2019s search utility that\u2019s available on iPhone, iPad, and Mac. In addition to letting users find documents and files saved on their devices, it can also search the web, the App Store, and perform other rudimentary tasks. Today\u2019s report says that this \u201crevamped version of Spotlight\u201d powered by large language model technology is \u201cunder consideration\u201d inside Apple. This would give Spotlight the ability to perform more complex tasks, tie into specific apps, and more. The new version would be able to toggle between specific features within apps and answer complex questions based on data trained from large language models. LLMs, the technology that powers AI tools, is developed by bombarding software with a torrent of data. Early designs of the Spotlight overhaul include using LLMs to answer more complex questions and the ability to tap deeper into apps to launch specific functions. The current version of Spotlight is mostly limited to launching apps, making basic web searches and pulling up information like the weather and sports scores. As of right now, there\u2019s no word on when \u2013\u00a0or if \u2013 this new version of Spotlight will see the light of day. Bloomberg simply says it\u2019s something Apple is considering as part of its adoption of AI across all of its platforms. While the AI coding and testing features rumored for Xcode sound great for developers, I\u2019m not the target audience for that. I am, however, very excited at the prospect of a more powerful version of Spotlight Search. There are Spotlight alternatives on the Mac that are far more powerful than Apple\u2019s offering, such as Raycast and Alfred. While these are great on the Mac, Apple doesn\u2019t give developers a way to overtake Spotlight on iPhone and iPad. In fact, I\u2019d say that a more powerful version of Spotlight Search is one of the best ways Apple could implement LLM technology on iPhone and iPad (other than improving Siri itself, of course).
