If you want to skip our coverage of what magic formula investing is all about, then you can take a look at the 5 Best Magic Formula Stocks to Buy Now. Considering the thousands of companies that trade on stock markets such as the NASDAQ and the NYSE as well as the plethora of information that investors are bombarded with every day, investing sometimes appears as nothing short of wizardry. For novices, terms such as relative strength indexes (RSIs), standard deviations of returns, beta, earnings per share, yields, and other metrics appear to be a new language that requires a detailed study before one can become comfortable with it. One investor who literally describes his investment strategy as 'magic' is Joel Greenblatt. Mr. Greenblatt is the chief investment officer of the ominously named Gotham Asset Management. While his investment decisions focus mostly on making returns for investors rather than fighting crime, Mr. Greenblatt's approach has nevertheless won him more fame in financial markets than Bruce Wayne. He set up Gotham Asset Management in 2008, which makes the fund relatively younger when compared to some other funds that have been around for decades. However, before Gotham Asset Management, the Magic Formula investor was at the helm of the fund Gotham Capital. He set up Gotham Capital in 1985, and the fund successfully focused on investing in distressed or 'special situation' companies and stocks. These stocks are of firms that might be facing troubles in managing their debt, or they might be struggling in their markets due to choices made of their own accord or broader macroeconomic factors. Mr. Greenblatt's Gotham Capital was one of the top performing funds in its league back in the mid 80s and 90s as it delivered net 30% returns during the time periods. Like some other hedge fund and investing heavyweights like Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway and Seth Klarman of Baupost Group, Mr. Greenblatt is also an adherent of one of Wall Street's best known investment approaches. If you haven't guessed it already, this approach is called Value Investing. Value investing simply analyzes a stock to compute what the investor believes is a fair value of the shares. This value is then compared to the market price of the stock, and if it's higher than the market price, then a potential investment decision is made. This investment decision is also influenced by the difference between fair and market values. The higher this difference is, the more comfortable an investor is buying the shares as it leaves a greater 'margin of safety' for non fundamental downward share price movements. So where's the magic? Well, Mr. Greenblatt's flavor of value investing is called Magic Formula investing. This strategy is based on the two fundamental metrics of share price and stock valuation. These are the Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) and the earnings yield. For the uninitiated, the ROCE divides a firm's operating income by the sum of its working capital and net fixed assets. The logic behind this computation is that the ROCE measures the return to investors over the costs of doing business as measured by buying and selling inventory and spending on assets. The earnings yield of a stock is its earnings per share divided by the share price, and it enables investors to understand the true post expenses, tax, and interest ability of their investment to make money. In Magic Formula investing, the ROCE and earnings yield of stocks are calculated first. They are then ranked according to these metrics, and the top shares are bought and held for the long term to benefit from a firm's ability to capitalize on its assets and cash to turn a profit and return for investors. So what are some magic formula stocks that can deliver magical returns? We took a look today, and some top stock picks are Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc.
