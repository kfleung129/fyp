Apple scrapped plans to build the self-driving iCar after a decade of development, perhaps disappointed it didn't autonomously make a success of itself. What does this mean? Apple put \u201cProject Titan\u201d into motion in 2014, sketching plans for a self-driving electric vehicle with a swanky limo-style layout. A company needs to be pretty confident in its driverless car to put it on the roads, though \u2013 and even after a decade, Apple\u2019s just not there. That\u2019s why the iCar team has switched its focus to generative AI, the type of technology that fuels OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Apple\u2019s already teasing more progress than it did with its eco-friendly limousine, dropping hints earlier this year that investors can expect a serious announcement in the not-too-distant future. Why should I care? Zooming out: Apple\u2019s been reading the news. Apple might not be missing out on much. Drivers aren\u2019t buying electric cars like they once were, mainly because their higher prices are less justifiable in today\u2019s economy. So realistically, the iCar wouldn\u2019t have helped Apple catch up to competitors Google, Amazon, and Microsoft. But if Apple can craft an AI service that takes its signature iPhones and iPads to the next level, the company could win big-spending gadget aficionados over \u2013\u00a0not to mention eagle-eyed, tech-obsessed investors. The bigger picture: Baidu, bai-dont. The tech industry moves fast, and companies that can\u2019t keep up risk being left behind. Just look at Baidu: the Chinese firm secured its spot as the country\u2019s go-to search engine ten years ago, but rivals Alibaba and Tencent have since stolen a march on the company when it comes to AI. Baidu created the \u201cErnie\u201d language model, sure, but the other two were quicker to throw a lot more money into their own budding systems. That go-getter attitude has already paid off, with Alibaba and Tencent\u2019s stocks and AI-related revenue beating the old timer\u2019s so far this year. ai alibaba amazon apple electric vehicles evs microsoft tencent tesla stocks us ai apple ecommerce fintech Disclaimer: These articles are provided for information purposes only.
