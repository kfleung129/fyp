When a Focus is active, people trying to contact you will see a banner at the bottom indicating that you\u2019re away or busy to receive texts. In this post, we\u2019ll explain how you can enable Focus Status sharing, how to share it with everyone or specific people, and what happens when you share it on your iPhone. Related: What does Focus Status sharing mean? To share your Focus Status, your Focus settings must be shared across all your Apple devices. When you don\u2019t share your Focus routines between your Apple devices, you won\u2019t be able to use Focus Status on any routines; so people who message you won\u2019t see when you\u2019re busy or when a Focus is active on your iPhone. Related: How To Share Focus Status on iPhone By default, when you enable Focus Status on iOS, it is shared with everyone in your contacts list on your iPhone. So, once you set up a Focus Status, you do not need to do anything more to share it with everyone. That means anyone who sends you a text during a Focus routine will be able to see that notifications on your iPhone are silenced. This alert will show up at the bottom of a conversation inside the Messages app.  But if you exclude a contact manually from Focus Sharing, then they won\u2019t get the notifications of your Focus Status. If you know that your Focus Status is not being shared with someone, make sure they are not being excluded from the Messages app. See our guide below for that.

While you can add this contact to your Allowed People list, you may not essentially want messages from them during a Focus routine. If your Focus Status isn\u2019t being shared with your contacts, you can fix it by enabling the feature for the Messages app inside iOS\u2019s privacy settings. When you turn on any Focus routine inside iOS, iOS gains the ability to tell anyone who texts you that you\u2019re busy and that any messages they send you will not be notified. This is what Apple calls Focus Status and this is enabled when you select any routine to be activated on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac. Focus Status adds a banner at the bottom of conversations you are a part of inside the Messages app. However, it\u2019s up to you to decide whether or not you want to broadcast that you\u2019re away or busy to receive texts. Focus Status is a polite way to let people know that you\u2019re busy with something important during which period, all messages will be delivered quietly unless you allow others to bypass it.  Sharing Focus Status is a good idea with people who respect your downtime and will not bug you unless necessary. If they have something really important to tell you, they can choose the Notify Anyway option that gets their messages delivered to you normally. If the Share Focus Status toggle isn\u2019t available when you access someone\u2019s contact info inside the Messages app, then the feature may be disabled by default on iOS. This can be because, in iOS 15.6 and newer versions, the ability to share the Focus on the Messages app has been disabled automatically when you update your iPhone to the latest version of iOS. When disabled, the Share Focus Status option won\u2019t show up at all when you access someone\u2019s contact info underneath \u201cSend Read Receipts\u201d.  The Share Focus Status option will only show up on Messages when you re-enable the Messages app inside the iOS privacy settings screen. When enabled, the share feature would appear back again, allowing you to share your Focus status with the selected individual. When you enable Focus Status, it is, by default, visible to everyone who sends you a message on iMessage. Only users who have sent you a message via the Messages app recently can see whether messages from them are being silenced or not. If you add a person to a Focus routine\u2019s Allowed People list, their messages will go through as usual without them knowing if Focus is currently active on your devices. Regardless of this, at no point will the other person know which Focus routine you have enabled on your iPhone. Your Focus Status appears inside conversations inside the Messages app for those people you have sent you a text recently. When someone tries to text you while a Focus routine is active on your iPhone, they\u2019ll see a \u201cDelivered Quietly\u201d label just underneath the message they send.  At the bottom of the conversation screen, they\u2019ll also see an alert that says \u201c has notifications silenced\u201d. No. When you whitelist a contact inside Focus, their messages will bypass any Focus routine you may have enabled. This way, when a person you added inside \u201cAllowed People\u201d on a Focus messages you, you will get their messages instantly the same way you\u2019ll get messages from anyone when no Focus routine is applied on your iPhone.  Since messages sent from whitelisted contacts are delivered normally, these contacts won\u2019t see your Focus Status; thus, won\u2019t be able to tell whether a Focus routine has been activated on your iPhone. Ideally, Focus Status when enabled will be active for everyone who texts you via the Messages app. If someone isn\u2019t able to see it at the bottom of a conversation thread, it could be for any of the following reasons: That\u2019s all you need to know about sharing Focus Status with everyone on iPhone.

I share across devices, messages is on in the focus settings, I even reset my phone. Still does not work. Have tried everything listed multiple times. Still doesn\u2019t deliver my status to sender. =( if you are whitelisted, and they had read receipts on for you, will it disable the read receipts when they add you to the whitelist?
