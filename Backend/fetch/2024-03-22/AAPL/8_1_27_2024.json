This week saw a\u00a0surge in the U.S. stock markets, with the S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite\u00a0and Dow Jones Industrial Average all setting new record highs, largely fueled by the growing excitement around AI investments and the anticipation of Federal Reserve rate cuts. The S&P 500 saw a rise of approximately 1.1%, the tech-centric Nasdaq Composite increased by around 0.9%, and the Dow experienced a gain of about 0.7%. Data released on Friday revealed that December's core personal consumption expenditures price index aligned with monthly expectations set by economists but fell slightly short of the yearly forecasts. This index is crucial as it serves as a key inflation measure for the Federal Reserve in its monetary policy decisions. Benzinga provides daily reports on\u00a0the stocks most popular with investors.
