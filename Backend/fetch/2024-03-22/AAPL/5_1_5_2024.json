    "text": "Apple is off to its weakest start to a year since 2019, putting its long-standing status as the world\u2019s most valuable stock by market value in jeopardy The\u00a0Cupertino, California-based\u00a0company has been the most valuable publicly-listed company since July 2022, but the stock has fallen sharply this year after the technology giant was hit by\u00a0two\u00a0ratings\u00a0downgrades, with analysts flagging weak macro environment in China pressuring demand for iPhones. That has shrunk its lead over fellow technology juggernaut Microsoft Corp. \u2014 whose shares have seen a less pronounced decline to begin the year \u2014 to less than $100 billion. Apple shares are fluctuating between gains and losses in the regular trading session Friday. If the stock ends the day higher, it will snap a four-day losing streak. Still, the company has seen $164 billion in market value erased so far this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. While the stock has suffered bigger percentage declines in the first week of January, the losses are the biggest market value destruction at the start of any year on record. \u201cInvestors realize how rare it is to have two people go negative,\u201d said Gene Munster, managing partner of Deepwater Asset Management. \u201cI\u2019ve been covering this company for a long time and I\u2019ve never seen two downgrades before an earnings report.\u201d Apple is also likely under pressure as investors rotate their portfolios at the start of the year. \u201cEverybody\u2019s selling their winners and buying losers,\u201d said Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management. \u201cThere\u2019s a big rebalance going on.\u201d The losses have pushed Apple\u2019s market value down to about $2.84 trillion, nearing Microsoft\u2019s $2.76 trillion. Shares of Microsoft are up as much as 1% Friday. The Windows software maker has benefitted from the artificial intelligence trade that has mesmerized Wall Street over the past year. The software maker is OpenAI\u2019s largest shareholder and has invested about $13 billion into the ChatGPT parent. \u00a9 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.
