    "text": "Bloomberg reports that Apple\u2019s longest-running senior designer, Bart Andre, is retiring. As the story explains, Andre joined Apple in 1992 with Jonny Ive. His departure marks \u201cthe near-complete turnover\u201d of Ive\u2019s former design team. Andre announced his plans to retire this month. His departure is a significant shakeup to Apple\u2019s industrial design team, but only the latest in a series of changes and departures. Andre is described as being \u201cone of Ive\u2019s top lieutenants\u201d and is credited with helping run Apple\u2019s industrial design team after Evans Hankey departed in 2023. \u201cHe\u2019s also known as one of the biggest holders of Apple patents,\u201d Bloomberg reports. Bart Andre, who joined Apple in 1992 alongside Ive, told colleagues this month that he is retiring, according to people familiar with the matter. Andre was one of the last remaining designers from the Ive era and helped create the aesthetic for Apple products released over the past three decades \u2014 even prior to\u00a0Steve Jobs\u00a0returning to the helm in the late 1990s. As it stands right now, Apple\u2019s industrial design team is led by chief operating officer Jeff Williams. \u201cHaving an operations person oversee a division dedicated to design and innovation has rankled some staff,\u201d Bloomberg says, according to \u201cpeople close to the situation.\u201d \u201dCost-cutting measures also have added to the unrest, they said. Under Ive, the team embarked on exploratory projects that didn\u2019t necessarily have an immediate payoff \u2013\u00a0something that\u2019s been reigned in.\u201d The full report is available at Bloomberg.
