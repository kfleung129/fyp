A day after BGR reported that the microLED Apple Watch Ultra project could have been canceled, analyst Ming-Chi Kuo corroborated this idea by saying Apple has given up on this product. Previously, manufacturer Osram announced an unnamed customer canceled all orders for microLED displays, which could possibly be Apple. While the company expected increased revenue in 2025, when Apple was first expected to release its microLED Apple Watch Ultra, Osram\u2019s CEO said that the project was abandoned, which made its shares drop. Now, according to analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple canceled the microLED Apple Watch Ultra project as this display couldn\u2019t add \u201csignificant value to this product,\u201d in addition to production costs being too high to make it economically viable. Apple Micro LED\u00a0update:1. My latest survey indicates that Apple has canceled the Micro LED Apple Watch projects because Apple thinks that Micro LED can\u2019t add significant value to this product, and the production costs are too high to make it economically viable.2. Apple has\u2026 A previous report said the cost for a microLED display at this moment would be around $150, although Apple only pays $38 for the current Apple Watch OLED display. Usually, when Apple pays that much for a screen, the product it sells would cost around $1,500, which is almost double what the Apple Watch Ultra costs at this moment.

With that, Kuo believes Apple laid off many people from the microLED development team, as \u201cthere\u2019s currently no visibility on any microLED related project.\u201d He continues: \u201cIt\u2019s undoubtedly a major setback for Apple, which hopes to own the next generation of display technology to make its products more competitive.\u201d Besides that, Bloomberg\u2018s Mark Gurman has hinted that Osram wasn\u2019t the only microLED manufacturer Apple was in talks with. Still, Kuo thinks otherwise: \u201c3. Osram was Apple\u2019s exclusive LED chip supplier for Micro LED. The company\u2019s cancellation of its Micro LED collaboration with Apple means that Apple has no plans to mass-produce Micro LED devices in the foreseeable future.\u201d AMS-Osram was one supplier in the Apple Watch Ultra microLED project. There are several others. I doubt it was canceled. https://t.co/wu0mfli3GO Despite the microLED display, Apple was rumored to be planning\u00a0sleep apnea detection for the 2024 Apple Watch while also studying to roll out blood pressure sensors in phases. The first iteration would just tell a user if their blood pressure is trending upward; a 2027 version could have the ability to provide exact numbers and even diagnose related conditions. In addition, Apple is putting all its efforts into a blood glucose sensor for a future Apple Watch. While it\u2019s unclear if the company will be able to pull a non-invasive system, it\u2019s easier to predict this technology could be presented in 2027 rather than 2024.
