If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. Happy Sunday. It\u2019s a busy week ahead for tech, with lots of companies reporting Q4 earnings, a big tech CEO hearing in DC, the Vision Pro going on sale, and more. In this issue: The intent of the EU\u2019s Digital Markets Act, which goes into effect on March 7th, is to loosen the control of tech\u2019s gatekeepers. Apple has now shown that it has no intention of letting that happen \u2014 regulation be damned. I believe the company is on the wrong side of history here, and that karma will come back to bite it. First, a programming note: I\u2019ll be interviewing Pinterest CEO Bill Ready on Monday morning at the first-ever Common Sense Summit in San Francisco. Other speakers include Sam Altman, Hillary Clinton, and United States Surgeon General Vivek Murthy. If you\u2019re reading this and will be there, please say hi.
