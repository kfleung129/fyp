    "text": "BREAKING: Futures Rise; Tesla Skids On China Production Cut     The Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied 180 points Thursday as Wall Street digested a stronger-than-expected jobs report and fewer-than-expected unemployment claims that could tip the balance for stocks going forward. Meanwhile, Apple stock sold off on another analyst downgrade. And Mobileye Global (MBLY) crashed after the company warned that 2024 sales will be below estimates because of excess inventory at its customers. After the opening bell, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.5%, while the S&P 500 gained 0.3%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite declined 0.1% in morning action. Among U.S. exchange traded funds, the Nasdaq 100 tracker Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) was down 0.3%, while the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) rose a fraction. Oil prices looked to add to Wednesday's solid rebound, as West Texas Intermediate futures climbed Thursday morning. WTI futures held right at $73 a barrel. Magnificent Seven stock Apple (AAPL) sold off 1.5% Thursday after Piper Sandler downgraded the stock from overweight to neutral, lowering its price target to 205 from 220. The analyst firm cited a weak macro environment in China that it said will negatively impact demand for iPhone. Apple traded further below its 50-day line Wednesday, with a 0.75% decline. Shares are also below a 192.93 buy point. Mobileye shares crashed 27% Thursday morning after the company released preliminary fourth-quarter results and a weak 2024 outlook before the market open. The maker of advanced driver-assistance systems predicted 2024 sales of $1.9 billion at the midpoint, well below forecasts for $2.56 billion. Mobileye cited excess inventory at its customers. Early Thursday, the ADP employment report showed an increase of 164,000 jobs in December, above the 115,000 estimate and up from November's 103,000 gain. ADP's employment report is a precursor to Friday's jobs report from the Labor Department. Meanwhile, initial unemployment claims surprisingly fell to 202,000 vs. 218,000 in the previous week. They were expected to edge lower to 217,500. Stock Market Forecast 2024: A Soft Landing May Not Bring The Gains You Expect The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite led the stock market lower Wednesday, as it declined 1.2%. The Dow Jones industrials and S&P 500 followed up with losses of around 0.8% each. Wednesday's Big Picture column commented, \"As a result, the Market Pulse after the action in stocks today reflects a cluster of four\u00a0distribution days on the S&P 500 \u2014 four bouts of unusually strong profit taking by fund managers \u2014 in the space of just nine trading sessions.\" Now is an important time to read IBD's The Big Picture column amid the continuing stock market rally.
