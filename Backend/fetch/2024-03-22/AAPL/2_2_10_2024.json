    "text": "Apple has decided to settle with the chip startup Rivos, two years after first suing the company for stealing trade secrets. According to a filing released on Friday, Rivos and Apple informed a judge that they are planning to finalize a settlement by March 15. Apple sued the \u201cstealth-mode\u201d startup in May 2022, accusing Rivos of poaching engineers with access to secret company information. Apple\u2019s lawsuit claimed that former employees stole proprietary information at the request of Rivos as part of the recruiting process. \u201cStarting in June 2021, Rivos began a coordinated campaign to target Apple employees with access to Apple proprietary and trade secret information about Apple\u2019s SoC designs,\u201d Apple says in the complaint. According to Apple, the engineers stole \u201cgigabytes of sensitive System-on-a-Chip specifications and design files.\u201d Rivos then fired back with its own lawsuit against Apple in September 2023, accusing it of using intimidation and other tactics to deter its engineers from leaving. In a filing spotted by Bloomberg on Friday, Apple and Rivos said that they plan to settle the lawsuit and are working towards finalizing their agreement now: \u201cThe agreement provides for remediation of Apple confidential information based on a forensic examination of Rivos systems and other activities,\u201d according to the filing in federal court in San Jose, California. \u201cThe parties currently are working through that process.\u201d In April 2023, Apple\u00a0quietly withdrew a lawsuit it filed against former executive Gerard Williams III, who was described as critical to the development of the high-performance A-series and M-series Apple Silicon chips. Williams had left Apple in 2019 to start a server chip startup Nuvia, which was acquired by Qualcomm\u00a0in 2021. FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links. More.
