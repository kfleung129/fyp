The Vision Pro \u2013 unveiled in June last year \u2013 has been lauded by analysts for its impressive technology, including an exterior display that shows the user\u2019s eyes to people in the outside world, as well as a new chip that Apple\u00a0says will process information from sensors in less time than the blink of an eye. At $3,499 they are the most expensive wearables on the market\u00a0 \u2013 leaving behind Meta\u2018s Ray-Ban smart glasses which start at $299, and the Meta Quest 3 at $650 for the 512GB version. What makes the Apple\u2019s Vision Pro different is the never-seen-before tech fit into a device that slides onto your face and allows you to move about without any restrictions. The headset, which has been called the phone maker\u2019s most expensive wearable gamble, features multiple cameras and sensors built into the device, OLED displays, an external EyeSight display (with a blue glow), the internal stereo speakers, connectors, the lens inserts and headbands, and the new R1 chip powering it all. Check out this video below from iFixit who breaks it down \u2013 quite literally \u2013 and lets you have a look at the nuts and bolts of the Vision Pro. With the first set of devices available from February 2, a few reviewers have taken it for a spin, and the reactions are a social experiment of sorts. Apple has turned the surroundings into a three-dimensional navigational display, while aiming for an intuitive and natural control interface. Wallpaper describes the interface interaction as \u201cVisionOS makes digital content look present in the physical world. Every detail of the UX design has been specially created to close the gap between the physical and digital realms.\u201d Alan Dye, Apple\u2019s VP of Human Interface Design explained the spatial computing that defines the Vision Pro to Wallpaper. \u201cOnce we understood that the product could be used for connection, for bringing people together and helping to enrich their lives, as we do with so many other Apple products, that\u2019s when we got fully immersed in the program and wanted to bring it to life. We got excited about what this could mean as a whole new platform. That\u2019s why we call it spatial computing.\u201d The transparency of the glass that allows the wearer\u2019s eyes to be visible was a huge consideration, revealed Dye, and is arguably the biggest differentiator from other eye wearables.\u201d Dye says, \u2018We wanted people around you to also feel comfortable with you wearing it, and for you to feel comfortable wearing it around other people. That\u2019s why we spent years designing a set of very natural, comfortable gestures that you can use without waving your hands in the air. \u201cThat\u2019s also why we developed EyeSight, because we knew more than anything, if we were going to cover your eyes, that takes away much of what is possible when you connect with people. Getting that right was at the core of the concept of the product because we wanted people to retain those connections in their actual world,\u201d he added.

Asking for directions was not a problem as people do engage with you while you are wearing it 2. You can talk and look at the screen simultaneously and this is what it looks like: 3.
