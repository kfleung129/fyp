    "text": "Apple has plans to disclose more about its long term plans in artificial intelligence later this year, according to Tim Cook. The Chief Executive Officer mentioned during the company\u2019s annual shareholder meeting Wednesday that the iPhone maker sees \u201cincredible breakthrough potential for generative AI, which is why we\u2019re currently investing significantly in this area. We believe that will unlock transformative opportunities for users when it comes to productivity, problem solving and more.\u201d Apple has not rolled out as much when it comes to generative AI in comparison to competitors like Microsoft and Alphabet\u2019s Google, which are now integrating them into products. Cook went on to mention during the meeting that AI is already at work behind the scenes in Apple\u2019s products, but he also mentioned that there would be even more news on AI features later this year. As of late, Bloomberg also reported that Apple has plans to use new AI to improve the ability to search through data in Apple devices. \u201cEvery Mac that is powered by Apple silicon is an extraordinarily capable AI machine. In fact, there\u2019s no better computer for AI on the market today,\u201d Cook said. Apple shareholders also rejected a new measure asking the company to disclose even more information about how its uses artificial intelligence in its business and ethical guidelines for the technology. ADVERTISEMENT The proposal, which did not pass but won 37.5% of votes cast, was put forth by the pension trust of the AFL-CIO, the largest American labor union federation, which has also proposed AI measures at other technology companies. \u201cCompared to other leading technology companies, Apple has been behind the curve on disclosing ethical guidelines regarding the use of artificial intelligence,\u201d Brandon Rees, deputy director for corporations and capital markets with the AFL-CIO, said in statement. \u201cWe hope that Apple will enhance its disclosure practices on this important issue to investors and other stakeholders.\u201d A similar proposal is up for bat at Walt Disney\u2019s annual meeting in April. At Apple, the AFL-CIO asked for a report on the company\u2019s use of AI \u201cin its business operations and disclose any ethical guidelines that the company has adopted regarding the company\u2019s use of AI technology.\u201d What\u2019s Trending, Inc \u00a9 2024 "
