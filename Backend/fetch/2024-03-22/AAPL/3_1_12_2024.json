    "text": "Microsoft on Thursday briefly overtook Apple as the world's most valuable company for the first time since 2021 after the iPhone maker's shares made a weak start to the year on growing concerns over demand, Reuters said.\nMicrosoft's shares have risen sharply since last year, thanks to the early lead the company has taken in generative artificial intelligence through an investment in ChatGPT-maker OpenAI.\nMicrosoft's stock closed 0.5% higher, giving it a market valuation of $2.859 trillion. It rose as much as 2% during the session and the company was briefly worth $2.903 trillion.\nShares of Apple closed 0.3% lower, giving the company a market capitalization of $2.886 trillion. Microsoft and Apple have jostled for top spot over the years.\n\"It was inevitable that Microsoft would overtake Apple since Microsoft is growing faster and has more to benefit from the generative AI revolution,\" said D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria.\nMicrosoft has incorporated OpenAI's technology across its suite of productivity software, a move that helped spark a rebound in its cloud-computing business in the July-September quarter.\nApple, meanwhile, has been grappling with weakening demand, including for the iPhone, its biggest cash cow. Demand in China, a major market, has slumped as the country's economy makes a slow recovery from the pandemic and a resurgent Huawei chips away at its market share.\n\"China could be a drag on performance over the coming years,\" brokerage Redburn Atlantic said in a client note on Wednesday, downgrading Apple's shares to \"neutral\".\nAt least three of the 41 analysts covering Apple have lowered their ratings since the start of 2024.\nShares of Cupertino, California-based Apple have fallen 3.3% in January as of the last close, compared with a 1.8% rise in Microsoft.\nBoth stocks are expensive in terms of their share price-to-earnings (PE) ratio, a common method of valuing publicly listed companies.\nApple is trading at a forward PE of 28, well above its average of 19 over the past 10 years, according to LSEG data.\nMicrosoft is trading around 31 times forward earnings, above its 10-year average of 24.\nShares of Apple, whose market capitalization peaked at $3.081 trillion on Dec. 14, ended last year with a gain of 48%. That was lower than the 57% rise posted by Microsoft.\nMicrosoft has briefly taken the lead over Apple as the most valuable company a handful of times since 2018, including in 2021 when concerns about COVID-driven supply chain shortages hit the iPhone maker's stock price.\nCurrently, Wall Street is more positive on Microsoft. The company has no \"sell\" rating and nearly 90% of the brokerages covering the company recommend buying the stock.\nApple has two \"sell\" ratings and only two-thirds of the analysts covering the company rate it a \"buy\". The General Assembly approved the first United Nations resolution on artificial intelligence Thursday, giving global support to an international effort to ensure the powerful new technology benefits all nations, respects human rights and is \u201csafe, secure and trustworthy.\u201d The resolution, sponsored by the United States and co-sponsored by 123 countries, including China, was adopted by consensus with a bang of the gavel and without a vote, meaning it has the support of all 193 UN member nations. US Vice President Kamala Harris and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan called the resolution \u201chistoric\" for setting out principles for using artificial intelligence in a safe way. Secretary of State Antony Blinken called it \u201ca landmark effort and a first-of-its-kind global approach to the development and use of this powerful emerging technology.\u201d \u201cAI must be in the public interest \u2013 it must be adopted and advanced in a way that protects everyone from potential harm and ensures everyone is able to enjoy its benefits,\u201d Harris said in a statement. At last September's gathering of world leaders at the General Assembly, President Joe Biden said the United States planned to work with competitors around the world to ensure AI was harnessed \u201cfor good while protecting our citizens from this most profound risk.\u201d Over the past few months, The United States worked with more than 120 countries at the United Nations \u2014 including Russia, China and Cuba \u2014 to negotiate the text of the resolution adopted Thursday. \u201cIn a moment in which the world is seen to be agreeing on little, perhaps the most quietly radical aspect of this resolution is the wide consensus forged in the name of advancing progress,\u201d US Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield told the assembly just before the vote. \u201cThe United Nations and artificial intelligence are contemporaries, both born in the years following the Second World War,\u201d she said. \u201cThe two have grown and evolved in parallel. Today, as the UN and AI finally intersect, we have the opportunity and the responsibility to choose as one united global community to govern this technology rather than let it govern us.\u201d At a news conference after the vote, ambassadors from the Bahamas, Japan, the Netherlands, Morocco, Singapore and the United Kingdom enthusiastically supported the resolution, joining the US ambassador who called it \u201ca good day for the United Nations and a good day for multilateralism.\u201d Thomas-Greenfield said in an interview with The Associated Press that she believes the world's nations came together in part because \u201cthe technology is moving so fast that people don't have a sense of what is happening and how it will impact them, particularly for countries in the developing world.\u201d \u201cThey want to know that this technology will be available for them to take advantage of it in the future, so this resolution gives them that confidence,\u201d Thomas-Greenfield said. \u201cIt's just the first step. I'm not overplaying it, but it's an important first step.\u201d The resolution aims to close the digital divide between rich developed countries and poorer developing countries and make sure they are all at the table in discussions on AI. It also aims to make sure that developing countries have the technology and capabilities to take advantage of AI's benefits, including detecting diseases, predicting floods, helping farmers and training the next generation of workers. The resolution recognizes the rapid acceleration of AI development and use and stresses \u201cthe urgency of achieving global consensus on safe, secure and trustworthy artificial intelligence systems.\u201d It also recognizes that \u201cthe governance of artificial intelligence systems is an evolving area\u201d that needs further discussions on possible governance approaches. And it stresses that innovation and regulation are mutually reinforcing \u2014 not mutually exclusive. Big tech companies generally have supported the need to regulate AI, while lobbying to ensure any rules work in their favor. European Union lawmakers gave final approval March 13 to the world\u2019s first comprehensive AI rules, which are on track to take effect by May or June after a few final formalities. Countries around the world, including the US and China, and the Group of 20 major industrialized nations are also moving to draw up AI regulations. The UN resolution takes note of other UN efforts including by Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres and the International Telecommunication Union to ensure that AI is used to benefit the world. Thomas-Greenfield also cited efforts by Japan, India and other countries and groups. Unlike Security Council resolutions, General Assembly resolutions are not legally binding but they are a barometer of world opinion. The resolution encourages all countries, regional and international organizations, tech communities, civil society, the media, academia, research institutions and individuals \u201cto develop and support regulatory and governance approaches and frameworks\u201d for safe AI systems. It warns against \u201cimproper or malicious design, development, deployment and use of artificial intelligence systems, such as without adequate safeguards or in a manner inconsistent with international law.\u201d A key goal, according to the resolution, is to use AI to help spur progress toward achieving the UN\u2019s badly lagging development goals for 2030, including ending global hunger and poverty, improving health worldwide, ensuring quality secondary education for all children and achieving gender equality. The resolution calls on the 193 UN member states and others to assist developing countries to access the benefits of digital transformation and safe AI systems. It \u201cemphasizes that human rights and fundamental freedoms must be respected, protected and promoted through the life cycle of artificial intelligence systems.\u201d Apple CEO Tim Cook opened Apple's new store in Shanghai drawing a large crowd on Thursday.\nSome people queued up overnight, according to posts on Chinese social media.\nCook arrived in Shanghai on Wednesday, he said on his personal Weibo account. Meanwhile, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) is preparing to sue Apple for allegedly violating antitrust laws by blocking rivals from accessing hardware and software features of its iPhone, Bloomberg News reported on Wednesday. Taking action against Big Tech has been one of the few ideas that Democrats and Republicans have agreed on. During the Trump administration, which ended in 2021, the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) opened probes into Google, Facebook, Apple and Amazon.\nA DOJ spokesperson and Apple did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment. The UN General Assembly will turn its attention to artificial intelligence on Thursday, weighing a resolution that lays out the potentially transformational technology's pros and cons while calling for the establishment of international standards.\nThe text, co-sponsored by dozens of countries, emphasizes the necessity of guidelines \"to promote safe, secure and trustworthy artificial intelligence systems,\" while excluding military AI from its purview, AFP said.\nOn the whole, the resolution focuses more on the technology's positive potential, and calls for special care \"to bridge the artificial intelligence and other digital divides between and within countries.\"\nThe draft resolution, which is the first on the issue, was brought forth by the United States and will be submitted for approval by the assembly on Thursday.\nIt also seeks \"to promote, not hinder, digital transformation and equitable access\" to AI in order to achieve the UN's Sustainable Development Goals, which aim to ensure a better future for humanity by 2030.\n\"As AI technologies rapidly develop, there is urgent need and unique opportunities for member states to meet this critical moment with collective action,\" US Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield said, reading a joint statement by the dozens of co-sponsor countries.\nAccording to Richard Gowan, an analyst at the International Crisis Group, \"the emphasis on development is a deliberate effort by the US to win goodwill among poorer nations.\"\n\"It is easier to talk about how AI can help developing countries progress rather than tackle security and safety topics head-on as a first initiative,\" he said.\n'Male-dominated algorithms'\nThe draft text does highlight the technology's threats when misused with the intent to cause harm, and also recognizes that without guarantees, AI risks eroding human rights, reinforcing prejudices and endangering personal data protection.\nIt therefore asks member states and stakeholders \"to refrain from or cease the use of artificial intelligence systems that are impossible to operate in compliance with international human rights law or that pose undue risks to the enjoyment of human rights.\"\nWarnings against the technology have become increasingly prevalent, particularly when it comes to generative AI tools and the risks they pose for democracy and society, particularly via fake images and speech shared in a bid to interfere in elections.\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has made AI regulation a priority, calling for the creation of a UN entity modeled on other UN organizations such as the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).\nHe has regularly highlighted the potential for disinformation and last week warned of bias in technologies designed mainly by men, which can result in algorithms that ignore the rights and needs of women.\n\"Male-dominated algorithms could literally program inequalities into activities from urban planning to credit ratings to medical imaging for years to come,\" he said.\nGowan of the International Crisis Group said he didn't \"think the US wants Guterres leading this conversation, because it is so sensitive\" and was therefore \"stepping in to shape the debate.\"\nA race is underway between various UN member states, the United States, China and South Korea, to be at the forefront of the issue.\nIn October, the White House unveiled rules intended to ensure that the United States leads the way in AI regulation, with President Joe Biden insisting on the need to govern the technology. Neuralink on Wednesday streamed a video of its first human patient playing computer chess with his mind and talking about the brain implant making that possible.\nNoland Arbaugh, 29, who was left paralyzed from the shoulders down by a diving accident eight years ago, told of playing chess and the videogame \"Civilization\" as well as taking Japanese and French lessons by controlling a computer screen cursor with his brain, said AFP.\n\"It's crazy, it really is. It's so cool,\" said Arbaugh, who joked of having telepathy thanks to Elon Musk's Neuralink startup.\nMusk's neurotechnology company installed a brain implant in its first human test subject in January, with the billionaire head of Tesla and X touting it as a success.\nArbaugh said he was released from the hospital a day after the device was implanted in his brain, and that he had no cognitive impairment as a result.\n\"There is a lot of work to be done, but it has already changed my life,\" he said.\n\"I don't want people to think this is the end of the journey.\"\nHe told of starting out by thinking about moving the cursor and eventually the implant system mirrored his intent.\n\"The reason I got into it was because I wanted to be part of something that I feel is going to change the world,\" he said.\nArbaugh said he plans to dress up this Halloween as Marvel Comics X-Men character Charles Xavier, who is wheelchair-bound but possesses mental superpowers.\n\"I'm going to be Professor X,\" he said.\n\"I think that's pretty fitting... I'm basically telekinetic.\"\nA Neuralink engineer in the video, which was posted on X and Reddit, promised more updates regarding the patient's progress.\n\"I knew they started doing this with human patients, but it's another level to actually see the person who has one in,\" one Reddit user commented.\n\"Really crazy, impressive and scary all at once.\"\nNeuralink's technology works through a device about the size of five stacked coins that is placed inside the human brain through invasive surgery.\nThe startup, cofounded by Musk in 2016, aims to build direct communication channels between the brain and computers.\nThe ambition is to supercharge human capabilities, treat neurological disorders like ALS or Parkinson's, and maybe one day achieve a symbiotic relationship between humans and artificial intelligence.\nMusk is hardly alone in trying to make advances in the field, which is officially known as brain-machine or brain-computer interface research. Apple CEO Tim Cook said he is currently visiting Shanghai, according to a post on his Weibo account on Wednesday. Cook said he spent the morning walking along Shanghai's historic Bund River with Chinese actor Zheng Kai and having a local breakfast but did not disclose what other plans he had for this China visit. His visit comes after the iPhone maker announced that it would open a new retail store in the heart of the Chinese financial hub on Thursday, and as Apple battles falling iPhone sales in China and rising competition from domestic rivals such as Huawei. Cook made at least two visits to China, Apple's third-largest market by revenue, last year. He also travelled to Beijing around the same time last year, where he visited an Apple store and attended the China Development Forum. Samsung Electronics expects $100 million or more of revenue from its next batch of advanced chip-packaging products this year, co-CEO Kye-Hyun Kyung said on Wednesday. Samsung set up advanced chip packaging as a business unit last year, and Kyung said he expects the results of Samsung's investment to come out in earnest from the second half of this year. Kyung's remarks were made during Samsung's annual general shareholders' meeting. Samsung's memory chip business seeks to achieve a greater profit share than its market share this year, Kyung said. Samsung's market share in DRAM chips, used in tech devices, reached 45.5% in the fourth quarter last year, according to data provider TrendForce. To do this, Samsung seeks to secure a competitive advantage in high-end memory chips required by booming artificial intelligence demand, including mass producing a 12-stack version of high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips called HBM3E. For a future generation of HBM chips called HBM4, likely to be released in 2025 with more customized designs, Samsung will take advantage of having memory chips, chip contract manufacturing and chip design businesses under one roof to satisfy customer needs, Kyung said. Answering a shareholder question on Samsung's recent setback in the current HBM market compared to rival SK Hynix , Kyung said: \"We're better prepared to prevent that from happening again in the future.\" Samsung Electronics shares rose as much as 6.04% on Wednesday, and are set for their highest one-day jump since early September after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said the AI semiconductor leader is qualifying Samsung's HBM chips for use. Samsung expects tangible results soon from other memory products being developed for use in AI, including compute express link (CXL) and processing-in-memory (PIM) products, Kyung added. France's competition watchdog on Wednesday said it fined Google 250 million euros ($271.73 million) for breaches linked to EU intellectual property rules in its relationship with media publishers. Google has pledged not to contest the facts as part of settlement proceedings, the watchdog said, adding the company also proposed a series of remedy measures to certain shortcomings. The fine is linked to a copyright dispute in France over online content in a case triggered by complaints from some of France's biggest news organizations, including Agence France Presse (AFP). The dispute seemed resolved in 2022 when the US tech giant dropped its appeal against an initial 500 million euro fine issued at the end of a major investigation carried out by the Autorite de la Concurrence. In Wednesday's statement, the watchdog said Google violated the terms of four out of seven commitments agreed in the settlement agreement, including conducting negotiations with publishers in good faith and providing transparent information. Google could not immediately be reached for comment. Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi reported a 10.9% rise in fourth-quarter revenue on Tuesday, boosted by strong smartphone sales in an industry showing signs of recovery. Revenue reached 73.24 billion yuan ($10.17 billion) in October-December, versus the 73.17 billion yuan average of 15 analyst estimates compiled by LSEG. Adjusted net profit rose 236.1% from the same period a year earlier to 4.9 billion yuan. That compared with the 3.89 billion yuan average analyst estimate. SK Hynix Inc said on Tuesday it has begun mass production of next-generation high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips used in artificial intelligence chipsets, with sources saying initial shipments will go to Nvidia this month. The new type of chip - called the HBM3E - is a focal point of intense competition. Last month, Micron Technology said it had started mass production of the chips while Samsung Electronics said it had developed the industry's first 12-stack HBM3E chips. SK Hynix has, however, led the HBM chip market by virtue of being the sole supplier of the version currently used - the HBM3 - to Nvidia which has 80% of the market for AI chips. \"The company expects successful mass production of HBM3E and with our experience... as the industry's first provider of HBM3, we expect to cement our leadership in the AI memory space,\" SK Hynix said in a statement. The new HBM3E chip by the world's second-largest memory chipmaker offers 10% improvement in heat dissipation and processes up to 1.18 terabytes of data per second. SK Hynix's HBM capacity is fully booked for 2024, analysts said, as explosive demand for AI chipsets drives up demand for high-end memory chips used in them. \"SK Hynix has secured an absolute market position... and its volume increase in high-end memory chips is also expected to be the most aggressive among chipmakers,\" said Kim Un-ho, analyst at IBK Investment & Securities. Nvidia unveiled on Monday its latest flagship AI chip, the B200, said to be 30 times speedier at some tasks than its predecessor as it seeks to maintain its dominant position in the artificial-intelligence industry. Shares in SK Hynix have doubled in value over the past 12 months on its leading position in HBM chips. By Brian X. Chen and Yiwen Lu To a growing number of youths, a wallet stuffed with cash and cards is as unfashionable as the millennial tuck, no-show socks and skinny jeans. Carrying only a smartphone is the way. Iykyk \u2014 that\u2019s \u201cif you know, you know,\u201d for those who don\u2019t know. I, Brian Chen, a graying 39-year-old tech columnist, am not one of those in the know. It\u2019s unfathomable to me to part with my wallet, which holds crucial items like my driver\u2019s license. So in an effort to be hip again, I recruited my 23-year-old colleague Yiwen Lu to ask the young ones how they live like this, and then I took the jump myself. In ditching my physical wallet, I am joining youths like Ruby Hegab, a 19-year-old student in Fremont, Calif. As soon as she got her first credit card last year, she said, she went all-in on using her iPhone to pay for groceries, parking meters and restaurant meals, and for carrying insurance cards. \u201cIf a store doesn\u2019t accept Tap to Pay, I won\u2019t give them business,\u201d Ms. Hegab said. But that rarely happens, because the overwhelming majority of merchants she visits, including big box retailers and mom-and-pop shops, now accept some form of mobile payment from services like Apple Pay and Venmo. In a survey asking just over 2,500 Americans about digital payments, some 80 percent of Gen Z respondents said they were using mobile wallets, and among them, half were eager to use their phones for much more than paying for things, according to recent data from Pymnts Intelligence, a research firm that studies commerce. Younger people are increasingly using their phones for purposes that older adults would use a traditional wallet for, like carrying documents such as a driver\u2019s license, boarding passes and event tickets. Some of these digital items can be added into the Apple and Google wallet apps, while others, like insurance cards, can be downloaded through third-party apps. The shift in behavior is a reflection of how far mobile wallets have come. About a decade ago, when I covered emerging mobile payment apps, most people shrugged at the technology because tapping a phone on a scanner was no more convenient than swiping a credit card. In recent years, amid a global pandemic that drove people toward contact-free payments, Apple and Google expanded their software to support digitized driver\u2019s licenses and transit cards, a perfect storm that made mobile wallets more useful. Braving it without a wallet for a week, I used only my phone to do my shopping; go to bars, out for dinner and to the movies; and even buy crab from a fisherman\u2019s boat. The phone sufficed in almost all those situations, though paying for dinner was more complicated and using a digital driver\u2019s license to buy wine at a grocery store was a nonstarter. If you\u2019re hoping to ditch your wallet or simply want to cut down on some bulk in your pocket, here\u2019s what you need to know. Payments In many stores, Android and iPhone users can use Google Pay and Apple Pay by tapping their phones on readers next to the cash register. Many small businesses such as food trucks accept payments through third-party apps like Venmo, which let you scan a bar code to send money. Yet there is inherent risk when you rely fully on a mobile wallet. Abi Hoyer, 21, in Punta Gorda, Fla., said she didn\u2019t carry a wallet for safety reasons: In the event of a mugging, a thief would get only her phone. Still, thieves could potentially make payments and drain money from your account if they coerced you into sharing your passcode. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important for iPhone users to activate a new safety feature in settings called Stolen Device Protection, which prevents passcode access to data such as passwords and stored credit cards when the device is in an unfamiliar location. And Android users should be aware of the steps to lock and purge data from the device in the event of theft. In addition, not all businesses take mobile payments. Ms. Hoyer learned this the hard way at Walmart when she discovered she was unable to pay for her items and didn\u2019t have her full credit card number to sign up for the store\u2019s wallet, Walmart Pay. One workaround: Password manager apps like 1Password and Bitwarden can safely store sensitive data including credit card numbers in case you need to look them up. Jillian Gillespie, 27, in Chicago, switched to Apple Pay after losing her wallet over a year ago, she said. This works out fine for fast-casual restaurants where you pay at the counter, but at sit-down restaurants where waiters drop off a bill and expect to run a credit card, she occasionally has to rely on friends to pay. In those cases, she typically uses Venmo to reimburse her friends. \u201cI don\u2019t really carry my wallet around with me, which sometimes can bite me in the butt,\u201d Ms. Gillespie said. I ran into similar snags. Out of three restaurants, only one brought a reader for me to tap my phone to pay, while the others asked for a credit card, which required my wife to pay. Insurance cards and other documents Digital scans or photos of important documents like health insurance and car insurance cards are now broadly accepted as substitutes for the real thing. Some insurance providers, like State Farm, Aetna and Anthem, make their digital cards available through their apps, which can be added to your mobile wallet. Not all insurance cards work this way, though, and it can be a hassle to find those cards at a moment\u2019s notice \u2014 you don\u2019t want to be stuck sifting through photos or finding the right app to load your insurance card after a car crash, for instance. I found that the simplest method to make insurance cards easy to look up is to attach images of all of them to one digital note stored on your phone. On iPhones, you open your photo of the insurance card, tap the button in the lower left corner and select the Notes app to save the image to a new note. Then rename the note \u201cInsurance Cards.\u201d Similarly, Android users can use the Google Keep note-taking app. In Keep, at the bottom tap \u201cadd image.\u201d Then pick the photo of your insurance card and label the note. Other types of cards and documents, like my Clipper card for public transit, movie tickets and gift cards, were all simple enough to digitize: Tapping the Add to Apple Wallet button loaded them inside my Apple wallet app. Identification Digitized versions of driver\u2019s licenses are still relatively new and being tested in various states, including California, Arizona, Connecticut, Maryland and Utah. This is where the mobile wallet falls short. Here in California, for example, you sign up for the digital driver\u2019s license through the California Department of Motor Vehicles app. The app generates a temporary bar code that can be scanned to verify your age and identity. Airports in some states now display signs stating that they will accept the digital ID from those who have signed up for the Transportation Security Agency\u2019s PreCheck program \u2014 but many states have yet to participate in this experiment, which makes it impractical to leave your driver\u2019s license at home. The digital ID is also not yet an acceptable substitute for a physical driver\u2019s license. The California D.M.V. says law enforcement officers cannot accept the mobile driver\u2019s license if you are pulled over, and Arizona\u2019s Motor Vehicle Division says people are still required to carry a physical ID. In the event of an emergency, a person may also have trouble identifying you. Apple\u2019s Medical ID and Google\u2019s Personal Safety features can be set up to show people your name, age and emergency contacts by pressing a shortcut on the phone \u2014 but emergency medical workers would have to know how to use the feature. So it\u2019s best to continue carrying a physical ID. To do that without carrying a wallet, you could do what some younger people do and sandwich the ID between your phone and phone case. I found that to be an imperfect solution because the card elevates the phone closer to the edges of the case, which makes the screen more susceptible to damage when it\u2019s dropped. After a week, I settled on what I felt was the best solution: a magnetic wallet that attaches to the back of my phone and carries only two cards \u2014 my ID and one credit card. That felt like cheating. But Ms. Hegab, the 19-year-old, admits that she uses a similar card holder for carrying only her driver\u2019s license. As soon as digital driver\u2019s licenses work everywhere, she said, she\u2019ll be getting rid of it.
