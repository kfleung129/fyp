AirDrop is one of the neat iPhone features that Android has had a tough time competing with. It\u2019s also one of the features that users often take for granted if they own multiple Apple devices. That\u2019s how I transfer files between my iPhone and Mac, and I use AirDrop all the time. It\u2019s also the best way to share photos and videos with friends, as long as they\u2019re on an iPhone or another Apple device. Over on Android, things are starting to get a lot simpler thanks to Google\u2019s announcement during CES 2024. The Nearby Share feature that rivals AirDrop is now called Quick Share. That\u2019s actually Samsung\u2019s version of AirDrop. You can use Quick Share to send files on Android just like you AirDrop on iPhone. All that is to say that something is missing here: a cross-platform feature that would work between iPhone and Android. That\u2019s why I\u2019m so excited to hear that Meta is working on an AirDrop equivalent for WhatsApp. Since WhatsApp is the most popular chat app in the world with over 2 billion users, and since it bridges the gap between iPhone and Android, Meta might be on to something here. I might be a longtime iPhone user, but WhatsApp is one of the chat apps I use the most. I\u2019ve explained this time and again while discussing the chat blue vs. green bubble war in the US. There\u2019s no such thing in Europe. Most people use WhatsApp here, and it\u2019s the platform of choice between me and other iPhone users in my circle.

I also use WhatsApp to chat with Android users in my group of friends or family. And we use WhatsApp to share files. It\u2019s not as convenient as AirDrop or Quick Share would be, but that\u2019s where WhatsApp\u2019s new AirDrop alternative could come in handy. It would make file transfers even easier than they already are. Picking photos or videos and then tapping a contact name to transfer them should be a standard of modern mobile computing. Provided, of course, this data transfer protocol has privacy and security features in place to avoid abuse. If WABetaInfo\u2019s findings are accurate, and they usually are, WhatsApp is working on an AirDrop feature of its own. It\u2019s currently enabled in the beta version of WhatsApp for Android. That\u2019s not a surprise, as Meta prefers Google\u2019s mobile OS over Apple.\u00a0However, if Meta rolls out this WhatsApp AirDrop functionality, it\u2019ll probably be available across platforms. The WhatsApp AirDrop alternative should work just like the original. You will be able to share files with people nearby as long as those people make themselves visible to you. The screens above also explain that both parties would have to open WhatsApp for the AirDrop-like transfer to work. This feature will presumably fight spam drops, and it\u2019s great that it\u2019s there. Moreover, WhatsApp will protect the sender\u2019s phone number when sharing with non-contacts nearby. Also, the data transfers themselves will be end-to-end encrypted, which is something we should expect from an end-to-end encrypted chat app. Finally, there appears to be a shake gesture from the recipient to see the sender\u2019s share request. That\u2019s something that might cause confusion on the iPhone if you have the shake-to-undo feature enabled on the iPhone. I know I do, but I hardly use it. I\u2019d be willing to replace it with this WhatsApp gesture if that was a possibility down the road. As with any beta software, there are no guarantees the WhatsApp AirDrop equivalent will see the light of day. But if it does, I\u2019d expect it to roll out on both Android and iPhone.
