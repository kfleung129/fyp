The next iPhone releases planned for 2024 would mark the beginning of a new massive upgrade cycle driven by revolutionary capabilities enabled by AI. According to Bank of America analysts, Apple is betting big on its artificial intelligence capabilities to revolutionize the user experience of its future iPhones and drive a new massive cycle of renewal. The tech giant has been nurturing its AI teams for several years and is on the verge of realizing these efforts. The next generation of iPhones planned for 2024 could incorporate spectacular advances powered by AI, including next-generation 3D facial recognition, immersive augmented reality features, advanced conversational abilities, and many other major innovations. These new revolutionary features fueled by AI are expected to have a resounding impact on Apple\u2019s sales, analysts say. They would strongly encourage current iPhone owners to take the leap and upgrade their devices, even if they are recent. We would witness a super-cycle over several years similar to the one initiated by the iPhone 6 in 2015. Every year, the number of devices sold would jump dramatically, triggering strong growth in Apple\u2019s revenue and profits for the period. Carried by the iPhone, Apple\u2019s prospects of blazing growth would inevitably be reflected in the evolution of its stock price, according to Bank of America. Thanks to AI, the share price would soar and could display a 23% increase by the end of 2024, surpassing $200. Riding the wave of AI would ensure that Apple reaches new heights in the stock market over the coming years and solidifies its status as a top-tier tech value. The next generation of Apple products would mark the beginning of a new golden age driven by innovation in AI. Driven by AI, the major innovations expected in the upcoming iPhones in 2024 could trigger a powerful renewal cycle. If this scenario materializes, Apple\u2019s growth would be turbocharged, driving the stock up 23% higher by the end of 2024 according to Bank of America. AI would then assert itself as the fuel that will propel Apple\u2019s growth in the coming years. Maximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!
