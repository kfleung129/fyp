Reviewed Reviewed Published: Jan 24, 2024, 5:04pm In a bid to foil potential thieves, Apple has rolled out a major security update for iPhones that identifies users with biometric scans before granting them access to important data. The Stolen Device Protection feature, included in the iOS 17.3 update, can detect when a phone is in an unfamiliar place, away from known locations like your home or office. It then deploys one or more anti-theft measures to prevent unauthorized access and safeguard personal data. Stolen Device Protection requires you to provide biometric authentication through either Face ID (face scan) or Touch ID (fingerprint scan) for access. This safeguards data, such as stored passwords and credit card numbers, and prevents actions a thief might take, such as erasing all content from the device. Previously, iPhone users could use just a passcode. The new feature also includes a security delay for certain actions, such as changing your Apple ID password. After starting the process with one Face ID or Touch ID authentication, you have to wait an hour and then complete a second authentication.

If there are multiple update options; choose the one you want and tap Install Now. If it says download and install, tap it, enter your passcode, and then tap Install Now. Once the update is complete, go to Settings > Face ID & Passcode and turn on Stolen Device Protection. This is an optional feature, so you can always disable it later if you want.
