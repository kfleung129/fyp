View all partners Apple Vision Pro is a mixed-reality headset \u2013 which the company hopes is a \u201crevolutionary spatial computer that transforms how people work, collaborate, connect, relive memories, and enjoy entertainment\u201d \u2013 that begins shipping to the public (in the United States) later this week. Critics have doubted the appeal of the face-worn computer, which \u201cseamlessly blends digital content with the physical world\u201d, but Apple has pre-sold as many as 180,000 of the US$3,500 gizmos. What does Apple think people will do with these pricey peripherals? While  uses will evolve, Apple is focusing attention on watching TV and movies, editing and reliving \u201cmemories\u201d, and \u2013 perhaps most importantly for the product\u2019s success \u2013 having its customers not look like total weirdos. Apple hopes the new device will redefine personal computing, like the iPhone did 16 years ago, and Macintosh did 40 years ago. But if it succeeds, it will also redefine concerns about privacy, as it captures enormous amounts of data about users and their environments, creating an unprecedented kind of \u201cbiospatial surveillance\u201d. Apple is careful about its brand and how it packages and describes its products. In an extensive set of rules for developers, the company insists the new headset is not to be referred to as a \u201cheadset\u201d. What\u2019s more, the Apple Vision Pro does not do \u201caugmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), extended reality (XR), or mixed reality (MR)\u201d \u2013 it is a gateway to \u201cspatial computing\u201d. Spatial computing, as sketched out in the 2003 PhD thesis of US software engineer Simon Greenwold, is: \u201chuman interaction with a machine in which the machine retains and manipulates referents to real objects and spaces\u201d. In other words, the computer can interact with things in the user\u2019s physical surroundings in real time to provide new types of experiences. The Vision Pro has big shoes to fill for new user experiences. The iPhone\u2019s initial \u201ckiller apps\u201d were clear: the internet in your pocket (including portable access to Google Maps), all your music on a touch screen, and \u201cvisual voicemail\u201d. Sixteen years later, all three of these seem unremarkable. Apple has sold billions of iPhones, and some 80% of humans now use a smartphone. Their success has all but killed off earlier tools like paper maps and music CDs (and the ubiquity of text, image and video messaging has largely done away with voicemail itself). We don\u2019t yet know what the killer apps of spatial computing might be \u2013 if any \u2013 but here is where Apple is pointing our attention. The first is entertainment: the Vision Pro promises \u201cthe ultimate personal theatre\u201d. The second is an attempt to solve the social problem of walking around with a weird headset covering half your face. An external screen on the goggles shows a constantly updated representation of your eyes to offer important social cues about your gaze to those around you. Admittedly, this looks weird. But Apple hopes it is less weird and more useful than trying to interact with humans wearing blank aluminium ski goggles. The third is the ability to capture and and relive \u201cmemories\u201d: recording and playback of 3D visual and audio from real events. Reviewers have found it striking: this was stuff from my own life, my own memories. I was playing back experiences I had already lived. Apple has patented tools to select, store, and annotate digital \u201cmemories\u201d. These memories are files, and potentially products, to be shared in \u201cspatial videos\u201d recorded on the latest iPhones. There is already a large infrastructure devoted to helping tech companies track our behaviour in order to sell us things. Recent research found Facebook, for example, receives data from an average of around 2,300 companies on each individual user.

In order to function, spatial computing records and uses vast amounts of intimate data about our bodies and surroundings. One study on headset design noted no fewer than 64 different streams of biometric and physiological data, from eye tracking and pupil response to subtle changes in the body\u2019s electromagnetic field. This is not \u201cconsumer\u201d data like the brand of toothpaste you buy. It is more akin to medical data. For instance, analysing a person\u2019s unconscious movements can reveal their emotional state or even predict neurodegenerative disease. This is called \u201cbiometrically inferred data\u201d as users are unaware their bodies are giving it up. Apple suggests it won\u2019t share this type of data with anyone, and Apple has proven better than most companies on privacy. But biospatial surveillance puts more of ourselves in use for spatial computing, in ways that are expanding. It starts simply enough in the pre-order process, where you need to scan your facial features with your iPhone (to ensure a snug fit). But that\u2019s not the end of it. Apple\u2019s patent about memories is also about how to \u201cguide and direct a user with attention, memory, and cognition\u201d through feedback loops that monitor \u201cfacial recognition, eye tracking, user mood detection, user emotion detection, voice detection, etc. [from a] bio-sensor for tracking biometric characteristics, such as health and activity metrics [\u2026] and other health-related information\u201d. Biospatial surveillance is also the key to Apple\u2019s attempt to solve the social problems created by wearing a headset in public. The external screen showing a simulated approximation of the user\u2019s gaze relies on constant measurement of the user\u2019s expression and eye movement with multiple sensors. Your face is constantly mapped so others can see it \u2013 or rather see Apple\u2019s vision of it. Likewise, as passersby come into range of the Apple Vision Pro\u2019s sensors, Apple\u2019s vision of them is automagically rendered into your experience, whether they like it or not. Apple\u2019s new vision of us \u2013 and those that surround us \u2013 shows how the requirements and benefits of spatial computing will pose new privacy concerns and social questions. The extensive biospatial surveillance that captures intimate biometric and environmental data redefines what personal data and social interactions are possible for exploitation.
