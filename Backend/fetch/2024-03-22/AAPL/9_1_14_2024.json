The Redmond, Washington-based software giant rose 1% to $388.47 on Friday, ending with a market valuation of $2.89 trillion. Meanwhile, Apple gained 0.2% and closed with a market capitalization of $2.87 trillion. It\u2019s the first time since November 2021 that Microsoft has closed with a higher value than Apple. \u201cWhen you compare and contrast the two, the growth Apple is showing is nothing special, whereas Microsoft has done a better job of executing and demonstrating earnings growth,\u201d said David Katz, chief investment officer at Matrix Asset Advisors. \u201cMicrosoft also has a much clearer roadmap with AI, and it has done a great job articulating how that will accelerate growth to make its long-term prospects even more compelling.\u201d The Supreme Court has agreed to hear an appeal from Starbucks in a dispute with the National Labor Relations Board over efforts by workers to unionize at a store in Memphis, Tennessee. The case has been among the most closely watched in the more than 2-year-old effort to unionize Starbucks\u2019 company-owned U.S. stores. Starbucks fired seven employees in Memphis in February 2022, citing safety. The Seattle coffee giant said they violated company policy by reopening a store after closing time and inviting non-employees \u2014 including a television crew \u2014 to come inside and move throughout the store. But the NLRB intervened, saying the company was unlawfully interfering in workers\u2019 right to organize and that the store had routinely allowed employees to gather there after closing time.
