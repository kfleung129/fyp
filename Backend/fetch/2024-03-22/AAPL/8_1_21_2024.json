    "text": "iOS 17 launched with a fair share of bugs and issues that prolonged months after its release alongside the iPhone 15 lineup. While the company managed to fix some of the crucial bugs, some issues exist to this day, almost five months later. The company is working with developers to fix the iPhone's ongoing battery drain and connectivity issues. iOS 17.3 update will be released with a potential fix for the iPhone's connectivity issues and a significant feature that protects the iPhone after it is stolen. Apple's latest iOS 17.3 update is in the beta stage, as the company released the RC build last week. iOS 17.3 will focus on fixing some of the underlying bugs and introduce a prominent stolen device protection system for the iPhone. Note that the update will not be as big as iOS 17.2, as it brought a boatload of new features to the table. This means that there will be fewer beta builds of the operating system. If you are encountering issues and are desperately waiting for the company's iOS 17.3 update to be released, you can expect the update to arrive on Tuesday, January 22. We have previously speculated that iOS 17.3 will be released to all compatible iPhone models by the end of January. However, if the update is not ready and Apple's software teams are encountering issues, it could take another week or so for the company to release the update. Since the company seeded the release candidate build of the update to developers last week, there is a high chance that the update will be released on January 22 or 23. Potentially, there is only going to be a single release for the release candidate build. If the company decides to seed the second release candidate build of iOS 17.3, the final version will be released on January 29. However, it is doubtful the company will release iOS 17.3 the same week it releases VisionOS and Vision Pro to the public on February 2. Apple's visionOS is an entirely new operating system, and the company will initially release it alone. This means that the company could see fit to release the rest of the updates before it. However, the beta builds of visionOS could be coupled with iOS 17, watchOS 10, macOS 14, and tvOS 17. The company will potentially continue its beta trend with visionOS as it sees fit to curate bugs ahead of the final release. We expect iOS 17.3 to be released in the next two or three days.
