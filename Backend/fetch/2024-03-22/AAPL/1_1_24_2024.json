As I was writing it, I realized I was leading off with interviews I had done with Steve Jobs for the Mac\u2019s 20th and with Phil Schiller, Craig Federighi, and Bud Tribble for the Mac\u2019s 30th anniversary. It made me realize that the article ideally should have the voice of someone at the Apple of today, too. One of the conditions of my interview with Jobs\u2014hard to believe it\u2019s half the Mac\u2019s life ago, now\u2014was that I only talk to him about the future, not the past. It\u2019s a tough task, asking someone about the future when you\u2019re supposed to be interested in the past, but that\u2019s just how Apple rolls\u2014then and now. It\u2019s always focused on what\u2019s next, a bit of corporate culture instilled by Jobs himself. The obvious choice was Greg \u201cJoz\u201d Joswiak, Apple\u2019s senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing. Joz has been working at Apple since 1986, and I first remember encountering him at an early PowerBook briefing. In a tight timeframe, I managed to get a few quick questions into Joz for the Mac\u2019s 40th anniversary. The issue I keep coming back to (apparently every 10 years!) is how since 2001 Apple just keeps adding new non-Mac product lines. (A new one on the way in a couple of weeks.) The Mac is roughly 10% of Apple\u2019s business. So how do you give love to a platform that is only a fraction of your business when there\u2019s another platform that\u2019s more than half your business? \u201cThe Mac is the foundation of Apple\u2026 and today 40 years later it remains a critical part of our business that we continue to invest in,\u201d Joswiak said. \u201cThrough all of its changes and evolutions over the years, we couldn\u2019t be more proud to say that the Mac is more popular and relevant than ever\u2026 It\u2019s exciting to see more people switching to Mac than ever before. The Mac will always be part of Apple. It\u2019s a product that runs deep within the company, and defines who we are.\u201d I asked Joswiak about where the Mac fits in among all these other platforms, and he pointed out that Apple, one of the largest companies in the world, runs on the Mac. \u201cAs a platform, the Mac is still breaking new ground and continuing to propel the concept of computing forward in unprecedented ways,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople can do things on a Mac laptop that they would have never dreamed possible 40 or even 10 years ago. And today, the Mac also plays an important complementary role to other devices in the Apple ecosystem, whether it\u2019s iPhone, iPad, or soon\u2026 Vision Pro.\u201d As has been pointed out a lot today, the Mac is the unique tech product to have somehow survived and thrived over 40 years, when many hit products don\u2019t manage even 10 years in the spotlight. I\u2019ve got my own theories about why that is, but I was curious if Joswiak\u2014who, again, has been around Apple since 1986\u2014had his own theories. \u201cFrom the beginning, the Mac has always embraced big changes to stay at the forefront of personal computing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt revolutionized the concept of the personal computer 40 years ago and is still doing so today \u2014 challenging the notion of what\u2019s possible on a laptop or desktop computer. Mac has [led] with nearly every major technological wave\u2026 This constant evolution paired with our unrelenting dedication to the user experience across hardware, software, and design, has led the Mac to become a product that has not only stood the test of time, but that has built a loyalty among users like no other.\u201d There\u2019s no denying that. From the very beginning to today, the attachment people feel for their Macs seems like it\u2019s one of the product line\u2019s definining characteristics. \u201cPeople love their Mac,\u201d Joswiak told me. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine any other PC that people love as much as the Mac. That was true with the very first Mac, and it\u2019s still true with the Macs we make today.\u201d If you appreciate articles like this one, support us by becoming a Six Colors subscriber.
