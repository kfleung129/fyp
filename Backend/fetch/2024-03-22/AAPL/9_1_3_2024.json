    "text": "Apple, yet again, captured the major share of the global premium smartphone shipments in 2023 with a 71% share of the total market, according to a latest report. However, compared to the previous year, the company saw a decline, which is believed to be because of Huawei\u2019s resurrection in China driven by the Mate 60 series. According to Counterpoint Research, the global premium smartphone market is likely to grow by 6% annually in 2023. The segment, which comprises smartphones priced over $600, could capture about one-fourth of the global smartphone sales and 60% of the revenues in the last year. The graph for the premium segment too starkly contrasts with what is otherwise a weak market. In its November report, Counterpoint mentioned that the smartphone market could hit the lowest in almost a decade in 2023. \u201cGlobal smartphone shipments in 2023 are projected to decline 5% YoY to reach 1.2 billion,\u201d the report stated, adding that the shipments are expected to increase by 3% yearly in the October-December 2023 quarter to reach 312 million units. Counterpoint also added that even within the premium segment, it is the ultra-premium devices \u2014 the ones with a price tag of over $1,000 \u2014 that are driving the growth. \u201cThe $1,000 and above price segment has captured over one-third of the total premium market sales in 2023,\u201d it added. Second only to Apple and the leader in the premium Android smartphone segment, Samsung stood at a 17% market share with a 1% annual increase. This is said to be driven by the Galaxy S23 series and its foldable devices, the Galaxy Z Fold5 and the Galaxy Z Flip5. Varun Mishra, senior analyst at Counterpoint Research, said consumers are now willing to spend more to get a high-quality smartphone that they use for a longer period. \u201cOwning the latest and greatest flagships has also become a status symbol for many consumers, especially in emerging markets where they are jumping directly from the mid-price band to the premium band,\u201d he added. Moreover, these devices are also becoming more affordable with several financing options and offers. In terms of regions, China, Western Europe, India and the Middle East and Africa (MEA) regions seem to be driving the most growth in the premium segment. The report added that China, India, MEA and Latin America are also likely to see a new record for premium market sales, with India being the fastest-growing premium market globally.
