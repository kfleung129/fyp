    "text": "Vassar College's student newspaper of record since 1866 By Benjamin Savel Posted on January 24, 2024 in Humor & Satire, Uncategorized On Dec. 26, 2023, Apple was banned from selling Apple Watches in the United States. Yet just one day later, the ban had been reversed. According to press reports, CEO Tim Cook reversed the ban by simply walking up to the court and saying, \u201cPretty please?!\u201d An Apple spokeswoman confirmed to The Misc that the \u201cpretty please\u201d did, in fact, include a cherry on top. Tim Cook\u2019s move reversed a ban that had been upheld by the Biden administration. In a statement, President Biden commented with a set of phrases he\u2019s never uttered before: \u201cWe are facing an existential threat to our existence. Democracy is at stake. This is a battle for the soul of our nation.\u201d Apple was expected to face severe losses if it could not sell its watches. \u201cWe\u2019re just a small, family-owned business with only $500 billion laying around,\u201d Apple spokesperson Munn E. Bags wrote. The company, which currently has assets greater than those of Italy, Russia and Brazil, was worried that it might only be able to make a $120 billion profit instead of a $120.5 billion profit this holiday season. According to The Washington Post, Apple has requested an even longer reprieve because the company might suffer \u201cirreparable harm\u201d if it can\u2019t sell more watches. When asked about whether union workers might suffer irreparable harm after facing the company\u2019s anti-union tactics, a spokesperson for the company said, \u201cLA LA LA I CAN\u2019T HEAR YOU.\u201d Asked about Apple\u2019s anti-union tactics, President Biden commented in a follow-up statement, \u201cWe are facing an existential threat to our existence. Democracy is at stake. This is a battle for the soul of our nation.\u201d He again assured us he has never, ever said this before. The megacorporation indicated last week that it will use the extra $450 million in holiday sales to pay its factory workers a living wage. \u201cApple will provide them all a three-bedroom house, an extra $40,000 per year and free transportation,\u201d senior vice president Redd D. Licious stated. \u201cYou didn\u2019t really believe that, did you?\u201d Licious added, and then proceeded to burst into a fit of maniacal laughter. Apple has also noted that customers would be devastated if they couldn\u2019t try the new watches. \u201cThe watch now weighs 0.1 grams lighter than the previous version, and we added pretty much nothing else. How could anyone live without it?\u201d President Biden, in a speech, offered some solemn parting words regarding the situation. \u201cWe are facing an existential threat to our existence,\u201d he stated. \u201cDemocracy is at stake. This is a battle for the soul of our nation.\u201d Your email address will not be published.
