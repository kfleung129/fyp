    "text": "BRUSSELS (AFP) \u2013 Apple is prepared to open the iPhone\u2019s ability to tap-to-pay to rivals \u2013 in the European Union (EU) \u2013 after coming under fire for keeping users in its own ecosystem, the European Commission and the company said on Friday. The commission, the EU\u2019s market regulator, said it was weighing Apple\u2019s proposal, which was made after Brussels determined that the Cupertino company enjoys a dominant position in iOS mobile wallet transactions by shutting out competitors. Such transactions rely on technology called Near-Field Communication (NFC) which allows users to tap a smartphone on a vendor\u2019s payment terminal instead of a credit card with a microchip. An Apple spokeswoman told AFP: \u201cWe have offered commitments to provide third-party developers in the European Economic Area (EEA) with an option that will enable their users to make NFC contactless payments from within their iOS apps, separate from Apple Pay and Apple Wallet.\u201d This option would be made available in the 27 EU countries plus associated countries Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, which together make up the EEA. \u201cApple Pay will continue to be a broadly available option, and over 3,000 issuing banks across all EEA countries will still be able to offer the unparalleled privacy and security of Apple Pay, as well as its great user experience,\u201d the spokeswoman said. The European Commission has invited companies in the contactless payments business to comment within a month on Apple\u2019s proposal to see if it addresses their competition concerns on getting access to tap-to-pay tech on iPhones and Apple watches. The commission said Apple was offering to make NFC on iOS devices available free of charge, and would create interfaces so that competitors could safely store personal payment details for use in their own apps. Only users with an Apple ID registered in the EEA would be able to make use of these outside apps, though \u201cApple will not prevent the use of these apps for payments in stores outside the EEA\u201d, the commission said in a statement. That raised a question about how consumers and regulators in non-EU markets, such as the United States, Britain and Australia might view the change, and whether they could push for similar treatment. The commission noted that, up to now in Europe, \u201cApple\u2019s iPhones run exclusively on Apple\u2019s operating system (iOS), with which they form a \u2018closed ecosystem\u2019\u201d.
