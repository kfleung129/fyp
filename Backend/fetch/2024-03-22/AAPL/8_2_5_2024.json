Learn More Pro Medicus Limited (ASX: PME) shares have continued their positive run on Monday despite the market weakness. In morning trade, the ASX 200 healthcare share has climbed over 3% to hit an all-time high of $108.67. Investors have been buying the company's shares after it announced the launch of the \"groundbreaking\" Visage Ease VP for the new Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) product, the Apple Vision Pro. Apple Vision Pro is the tech behemoth's newly released spatial computer that blends digital content and apps into your physical space. It lets users navigate using their eyes, hands, and voice. According to the release, Visage Ease VP has been designed to take advantage of the unique capabilities of Apple Vision Pro. It supports immersive, spatial experiences for diagnostic imaging and multimedia. The company notes that Visage Ease VP includes all the proven functionality of Visage Ease, plus the exciting addition of Visage's powerful cinematic rendering engine for stunning volume-rendered images in immersive space. In addition, anywhere, on-the-go access with Visage Ease VP has additional flexibility with virtual screens at more than 4K resolution for each eye, independence from environmental lighting restrictions, and the ability to interact with imaging seamlessly in the user's physical space. Management also notes that Visage Ease VP uses the natural and intuitive input of eyes, hands, and voice navigation \"to provide an end-user imaging experience that's unlike any other application.\" The ASX 200 healthcare share already has a user testing out the technology. It notes that UC San Diego Health, a tier 1 academic medical centre and Visage customer, is the first health system to pilot the technology. Dr. Paul Murphy from UC San Diego Health commented: The visualization of three-dimensional medical imaging in immersive space creates exciting opportunities to improve patient care. Technology that allows for sophisticated eye motion and gesture controls for reviewing 2D and 3D medical imaging could potentially help in efficient tumor board reviews and create collaborative spaces in healthcare.
