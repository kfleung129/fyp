Brian Connolly January 1, 2024 Amazon Policies, Entrepreneurship, Selling on Amazon, Uncategorized  As Amazon continues to grow, opportunities to build an e-commerce business by selling on the site grow as well. In 2023, 63% of consumers started their shopping searches on Amazon, with low product prices, free or low-cost shipping, and convenience as the reasons they chose to shop online instead of in-store. More than half of consumers shopped on Amazon weekly or more, and towards the end of the year, 67% of consumers chose to shop on Amazon for holiday gifts. These trends indicate that the year ahead holds immense potential for ecommerce entrepreneurs in 2024. However, if you want to take advantage of the enormous opportunity Amazon represents, you must first go through the Amazon seller registration process. So, to make sure your account is verified (giving you the chance to build a successful Amazon business), we\u2019ll walk you through the updated process. This is what we\u2019ll cover: Want to learn more about selling on Amazon? Check out our complete guide. What\u2019s great about Amazon is that there isn\u2019t just one way to start an Amazon business. From the business model you choose to the products you decide to sell, there are many ways to succeed on the platform. However, the steps required to get up and running on Amazon remain the same, regardless of the type of business model and the product you choose. There are pros and cons for both methods, so make sure you look closely at both to determine which one will work best for your business. You don\u2019t have to choose one or the other, though. You can fulfill orders with both FBM and FBA. If you have a product, you may be ready to go, but you should still follow this step to validate that your product will have sufficient demand on Amazon. To help you find products to sell that are high in demand, but low in competition,\u00a0make sure you use a tool like Jungle Scout. READ MORE |\u00a0Amazon\u2019s Top Product Categories More details on how to complete the Amazon seller registration process are in the next section. If you\u2019ve chosen to sell private label, you can find a manufacturer to create your product by using Jungle Scout\u2019s Supplier Database or Alibaba. Learn more about Jungle Scout And once you create your listing, you can grow your Amazon sales from there! Back to Top Once you\u2019ve figured out what you plan on selling on Amazon, you\u2019ll need to go through the Amazon seller registration process, which is really quite simple.   Next, fill out the form with your information. Based on what you submit, your business may be eligible for a dedicated Amazon account rep. If you don\u2019t have a business website, you can put \u201cAmazon.com\u201d in that field. Once you submit your information, you\u2019ll be sent to a confirmation screen.  In this step, you can either wait to receive an email from an Amazon account representative, or sign up to start selling right away. We assume you are eager to get started, so click on Sign up!  Note: When you sign up for the professional account, you will be charged $39.99/month for the first month. For any months that you do not have any active listings, you will not be charged the $39.99 for that month. Once you have an active product for sale, you will be charged again. You can downgrade to an individual seller account at any time. Once you\u2019ve chosen the seller plan that is right for you, the following window will appear where you\u2019ll be asked to enter your email address and a password (of your choosing) for your seller account. When you\u2019re done, click the \u2018Create your Amazon account\u2019 button.  This will take you to a second screen stating you must enter a verification code sent to your email. This is Amazon\u2019s way of verifying the email you entered. Once you enter the correct code, you\u2019ll be automatically taken to this screen:  Amazon will let you know what you\u2019ll need to complete your registration: The next step in the Amazon seller registration process is to share the following information: If you don\u2019t have a business formed just yet, choose \u201cNone, I am an individual.\u201d If you choose this, Amazon will ask for your full name in the next step.  Then, click the \u2018Agree and continue\u2019 button. From there, you\u2019ll be asked to provide Amazon with a number of personal details. This includes a form of identification (either your passport number or your driver\u2019s license). To move onto the next step, you will need to verify your phone number through a text or call. When you enter the PIN you received from Amazon, your number will be verified. Make sure all of your information is correct before moving on.   When you\u2019ve entered everything, click on \u2018Next\u2019 at the bottom of the screen. Your next step will be to provide Amazon with your billing information. This includes a valid bank account number and a valid credit card number.    After you supply your credit card information and it has been validated, you\u2019ll be asked a few questions about your Amazon store and the products you plan to sell. To move onto the next phase of the Amazon seller registration process, you\u2019ll need to answer the following:  Click the \u2018Next\u2019 button after you\u2019ve provided the answers to those questions. Next, you\u2019ll be asked to verify your identity by uploading images of your ID (license or passport) and a bank statement.  After you upload your documents, click Submit. After submitting all of your documents, you will need to complete an Identity Verification via video call with an Amazon associate. This is so they can verify all of your documents and personal information you provided. Unfortunately, this is now part of the process so we suggest doing it as soon as possible so you can start selling products on Amazon. You may have an option to take a call at the end of your application. If you cannot at that time, you can schedule an appointment for a future date and time.  Once you\u2019re verified, you\u2019re in! To be on the safe side, we recommend setting up 2-step verification on your account, for increased security. But, once your identity and business information have been verified, all you need to do to get started is to log into https://sellercentral.amazon.com. And this is what your seller account home screen will look like (without any sales yet, of course).  Back to Top  What\u2019s great about selling on Amazon is that you can get started without spending any money. However, if you\u2019re planning to use the private label business model there are costs involved in order to purchase your inventory before you sell it (at a higher price). But, it may not be as expensive as you might think. In fact, according to a Jungle Scout survey of 3500 Amazon sellers, 16% started their businesses with less than $500 \u2014 though the average reported cost is $3,836. Plus, regardless of your chosen fulfillment method, there will be some fees associated with your seller account. Here are a few of the Amazon fees that you may be required to pay as an Amazon seller: READ MORE | Amazon FBA Fees: How They Work and How to Profit as a Seller Back to Top  Here are a few more Amazon-selling basics that you should know. Amazon organizes all of its products by giving each a Best Sellers Rank (BSR); the more popular an item (and the more sales it makes), the higher the BSR. In addition, departments (also called parent categories) on Amazon have their own taxonomy of BSRs, as do their sub-categories. If you\u2019re using Amazon\u2019s FBA program, and you have enough inventory to spread around through its fulfillment network, then your product will qualify for Amazon Prime. Selling Prime is key to being successful on Amazon as it means your products will be shipped to customers within 2-3 days. Plus, you get the \u201cAmazon Prime\u201d badge on your listing, which means you\u2019ll have a better chance of selling your product. Customers love fast shipping. But if you\u2019re selling FBM, you can still sell Prime as a Merchant Fulfilled Network seller. To do so, however, you\u2019ll have to apply to Amazon\u2019s Seller Fulfilled Prime program.

So, to help you ramp up more quickly, we have an extensive library of free resources. In addition, if you already have a Jungle Scout subscription, you have access to our members-only Academy.

I\u2019m UK based and in the process of setting up a new business account to start selling on Amazon. I obviously won\u2019t have generated any statements yet in order to complete the varification process and register my seller account, how do I get around this? Also, should I list my business type as an \u201cindividual\u201d even though I plan to use an LLC (Ltd. in the UK) when I start trading? Hi Richard, Use your personal back account to get verified. You can sign up as an individual account and change it to professional when you are ready to start selling. Can i do online arbitrage on individual account without any document ? Hi, What do you mean by without any documents? Hi, I am new to this and so I started the process and didn\u2019t realize I was setting up a business account. I backed out, and am now trying to set up an individual seller\u2019s account. First, it already had my bank account number which is more than curious, but I can\u2019t continue the process without providing my store name. I just wanna sell some used items and this process is absolutely inept. Do you have any suggestions? Hi Eddie, If you just want to sell used items, Amazon may not be for you. I suggest selling used products on eBay or Facebook Marketplace. You can make your store name anything, don\u2019t think too much about it. Can one start selling on Amazon without having a dime in his account? You can start selling on Amazon and online by selling used books and other items you have around your home. You can also attempt dropshipping (done correctly) on Amazon. I am assuming you recommend creating a new Seller account that is different from your personal account that you shop with as an individual? You can use the same email you use for your personal buying account, but to keep things separate, use a new email. Can you see roe(fish egg), worms things. If you were to sell it on prime and it takes 2-3 days. I don\u2019t think it would go bad. I would appreciate on a feed back or advise on that. Thinking about opening an account.

What\u2019s bothering me though is that I\u2019m completely unable to update my documents and re-apply again. Each time I log into Seller Central I\u2019m being told my application was rejected and I can\u2019t sell on Amazon. I\u2019ve asked the support team a few times and all I get is an automated response telling me to create a new account with a new e-mail address. The problem is that I\u2019ve read that it\u2019s forbidden by Amazon to try and have two accounts and can get me banned forever. First email they sent me: Within the next 30 days, please update your country of origin and upload the requested documents in the verification section of Seller Central Second email: Within the next 30 days, register with a new email in (https://sellercentral.amazon.com/), update your country of origin, and upload new documents. I don(t want to create a new account. I am afraid to get suspend. what should I do? Hi Oskine, Save that email they sent you and reference back to it if Amazon gives you a hard time trying to create a new account. Since you don\u2019t yet have an account set up, I don\u2019t think it will be an issue if you try a new email. I was approved for Amazon Handmade, and am currently working on getting my products listed. I have changed the \u201cdisplay name\u201d REPEATEDLY to my business name, but the Amazon Handmade \u201cseller details\u201d page still lists my personal name instead of my business name although it does list my business address. Any idea WHY? I really don\u2019t like this. I\u2019m a private person and don\u2019t care to have my personal info on the page. (oddly, in Seller Central for US/CA/MX markets the it shows my business name correctly) Hi Char, I\u2019m not sure why it won\u2019t save the correct business name in your Handmade account. Have you tried contacting seller support to see if they can change it for you? I never sold on Amazon but they say o have to make new account Hi Donald, Not sure what you mean here.

It really comes down to what you feel most comfortable with and what works with your budget. Thanks for reading, Stefan! Hey, I read through the guide and have a question regarding UPC codes. If I\u2019m planning to sell items from my house or items that are new from a retail store (but not made by me), do I need a UPC code? I\u2019m a little confused as to when and for what products I would need a code. Thank you! Hi Ali, If you are planning to sell items of another brand, you do not need a UPC code (Assuming these items have UPC barcodes already.) You would only need a new UPC code when you are selling your own branded products. It is likely that the items you want to sell are already listed on Amazon. If that is the case, you can simply list your offer on that listing without needing to enter the UPC code. If you were creating a new listing for a product, Amazon would require that you enter a UPC code to create the listing. I hope this helps! Amazon is the best!! I am glad to see this important information. Thank you very much to share with us.

Maybe I\u2019m confused, but my intention is to start out with an online arbitrage business model and possibly implement private label products in the future. Isn\u2019t that primarily what \u201ca store\u201d is used for? I have set up an LLC and will be doing business under an assumed name \u201cXXXXX Trading Co.\u201d Should I list that here and just answer no to all the questions? Immediately upon approval/verification I will be signing up for your full suite. Thanks! Hi David, You can sell as many different products as you want. Whether it\u2019s online arbitrage or private label or both. The store name can be whatever you want. Also, you can always change it in the future. Just don\u2019t add \u201cLLC\u201d at the end of your store name. If selling online arbitrage products, answer yes to the first and no or some of them to the last two.

I am now on my third attempt to set up a business from Guam. One very important point. Make sure you use a MAILING address as your RESIDENTIAL address. We use post office boxes for our mail and if you put your residential address you have screwed the pooch. Once your email is associated with that account there is no turning back. As a pre- registered account you have no way of contacting the seller division directly, only by email, which offers no help in any way. There is no way to correct this mistake even though you are directed to correct your mailing address at the end of the registration page. BEWARE of this mistake before you proceed to the end of registration, make sure you enter your MAILING address instead of your residential address unless of course you do receive your mail at your residence.

You will need to provide Amazon with everything they\u2019re requesting, including proof of address.

To make it infinitely worse they billed me $70 NZD for the account I am blocked fro using. Now they want a utility bill. I can not provide one as everything is covered in my rent which I pay electronically. I can not communicate with anybody as they have suspended my account. It is utterly disgustingy BAD.

Since January 2020 I have tried to open a Seller Central Account on Amazon Mexico, which apparently works in the USA also, and unfortunatelly it has not worked out well. I have a Book brand ment for the Mexican Market and LATAM Market in the USA. These books are fill-in books, with graphics and questions, so that Mexican families or LATAM families can record their best memories of their loved family members.\nMy goal is to reach people through Amazon to sell these books and to grow our brand penetration in these markets. I would appreciate very much to get help on the following: 1) Fixing my opening account process in Amazon. This has being very difficult, first because this is my first time trying to do this, and second because the help I got in Amazon has being very limited. I already know I need to upload my Company\u00b4s information, and I am not able to do this for some unknown reason. During my first attempts, I was able to upload some files, but then Amazon required me to upload more files, and this was not possible and at this point I am not able to access my account. 2) Based on what I have already described, and on our goal at the company, please let me know in which other areas you could help us to grow. Please keep in mind this is a very small company. It seems as if you have experience helping companies like the one I have to be succesful in Amazon. Thank you very much, Nuria Conde\nCuentame Corazon Hu Nuria, I am sorry you are having trouble setting up your seller account!

Amazon supplies little to no explanation of what the issue is. It just shows the same tired message: \u201cYour Amazon seller account has been deactivated in accordance with section 3 of Amazon\u2019s Business Solutions Agreement\u201d Then when you google that phrase an Amazon pop up shows a little more detail of the problem is. Often a hyper-critical detail. I address it.. then NOTHING CHANGES. Just more suspensions. Im stuck in a loop. (this last time my User Name wasn\u2019t the same as my Name in the account\u2026 Name is optional.. but I didnt put a name there\u2026 the AI system did\u2026 then it stated that it had corrected it\u2026 so was I supposed to change something??? or just resubmit appeal? why put me through that at all?) I even got the postcard with the code. Isn\u2019t that enough? EBay had me selling in minutes\u2026 So these security measures are ridiculous. I would love some answers as to why Amazon is so dysfunctional and incompetent in it\u2019s on-boarding procedures. From my last 2 times.. I know what happens.. no one responds to my questions in Seller Central or if they do answer they can\u2019t detail the solutions since its just a \u201ccopy and paste\u201d respond center who is clueless to actual user experience. Then that account becomes deactivated for good with absolutely no explanation. Its a shame since Im killing it on Ebay.. Meanwhile I have a friend who signed up years ago.. who has NO IDEA what he is doing and he\u2019s making little to no money?? Amazon is just shooting themselves in the foot.

Tell me more about amazon please Hi Susan, Thanks for your questions! Can you elaborate more? Brian Hi JungleScout, I am Kevin based in Singapore who would like to become a Amazon seller. Following are some of my queries before I going to start my Amazon seller carrer: \u2013 Do I need to create logo for selling in Amazon?\n\u2013 My marketplace in US but my address for validation is in Singapore, is there any problem?\n\u2013 Understand that UPC codes is a bar code, do I really need that? What if I haven\u2019t find a product to sell, but I going to register for seller account, when I click no for UPC code, any impact?\n\u2013 Should I create Amazon seller account first? Or should I liaise with supplier first?\n\u2013 Amazon storage fee is included inside of FBA fee? Or separate cost? After 365 days, Amazon will charge monthly storage fee?\n\u2013 What if after one year, I can\u2019t sell the product any, can I dispose my products? Instead of paying the monthly storage fee to Amazon. Or can I ship back to me?\n\u2013 Will my product auto enroll to Amazon prime program? Or is there any requirement?\n\u2013 Do I need to pay Amazon advertising fee to promote my item to the top list? Or do they have this option? Thank you. Hi Kevin, Thanks for your questions. I will do my best to answer all of them. \u2013 No, you don\u2019t\n\u2013 No, you can sell internationally. Please use this post as a reference: https://www.junglescout.com/blog/how-to-sell-on-amazon-from-overseas/\n\u2013 You can apply for a GTIN exemption if your product does not have a UPC\n\u2013 Begin contacting suppliers but work on setting up your account as soon as possible because it does take a while now to verify all your info\n\u2013 Yes, storage fees are separate from FBA fees. See here: https://sell.amazon.com/pricing.html#fulfillment-fees\n\u2013 You can choose to have Amazon destroy the product or they can ship it back to you for a fee\n\u2013 If you send your product into an FBA warehouse, it will automatically be prime eligible\n\u2013 You don\u2019t have to advertise but it is recommended for new products so it can be seen by customers I hope this helps!

Can yoi please send me a sample.\nRegards\nSam Hi Sam, Please check out this post to find out more information! https://www.junglescout.com/blog/how-to-sell-on-amazon-from-overseas/ Can you please advise on whether Amazon prohibits/discriminates anyone from opening a seller account based on their country of birth regardless of whether they are a citizen of an allowed country? At the moment the drop down menu on registration only has a limited amount of countries you have to be born in to register regardless of whether what citizenship you are. I can not even skip that section since it is required. Is one\u2019s Amazon fate sealed at place of birth or is there a way around this :)I have reached out to amazon but have been not received any response despite sending several messages, Please advise. Thank you. I forgot to add I am a Canadian citizen but was not born here. My country of birth is not listen in the limited list under Amazon\u2019s \u201ccountry of birth\u201d in the individual registration section. Hi, Amazon will not discriminate for where you were born. Do you need to list your place of birth? Hi, It should not matter where you place of birth was. Only where you currently reside. Have you heard back from them yet? Hi guys\nI have a question! What if my LLC address is different from my actually living address? and if Amazon ever ask me proving utility bills which one should I use? Thanks! Hi Houssame, Everything should match. Use the utility bills from your LLC address. Please I can\u2019t find my country in the list\u2026. What should I do next. If your country isn\u2019t listed in the \u2018Business Location\u2019 dropdown, then it\u2019s likely that it isn\u2019t one that Amazon accepts for registration. You can double check that here: https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/external/200405020?language=en-US&ref=mpbc_200417280_cont_200405020 But, if it\u2019s not on that list either, then there\u2019s nothing that can be done. Even if there was a way around the rule, and you were able to sell on the site from a country not on the list, there\u2019s an extremely good chance Amazon will shut your listing down and ban you from the platform. I\u2019m so sorry about that, Abogu. Hello.\nI want to inquire whether the requirement for tax information is optional or compulsory.\nThank you for your anticipated reply. Hi Eboh! Thanks for reaching out about this as the requirement to provide Amazon your tax information is compulsory. To get a clear picture of how tax collection works on Amazon, we recommend reading Amazon\u2019s \u201cMarketplace Tax Collection FAQ\u201c. I hope this helps. \ud83d\ude42 HEY, I LIVE IN CANADA AND I WOULD LIKE TO START SELLING ON AMAZON AS A PROFESSIONAL ACCOUNT BUT I DONT OWN A PRIVATE BRAND NOR A LLC. MY QUESTIONS ARE:\n1.HOW CAN I SET A PRIVATE BRAND?\n2.AS A CANADIAN PERMANENT RESIDENT HOW CAN I CREATE A LLC?\n3.AM I ELLIGIBLE FOR A LLC?\n4. IS THERE SOMETHING SIMILAR TO LLC IN CANADA? THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME TO ANSWER MY QUESTIONS!!!! Hi, Please check out this post to help you with selling internationally on Amazon US: https://www.junglescout.com/blog/how-to-sell-on-amazon-from-overseas/ Dear Sir,\nI would like to ask that after i sign up as professional Seller which already charge 39.99, does it have anymore fee charge for document processing fee for this registration before approval as Amazon Seller? . I live in Cambodia, if i send the product from here to USA, so how can i process it to Amazon inventory warehouse to keep my product, can you advice detailed. Highly appreciated for your respond.\nRegard\nDara. Hi Dara, There are no document processing fees. There will be FBA fees and other selling fees associated with selling on Amazon. You will need to create a shipment in your seller account and in there it will tell you which warehouses your inventory will be sent to. Hi, I am a foreigner and would like to set up a LLC for trading in Amazon. I have a SSN already as I lived in US for a few years long time ago. I will hire a registered agent in US for the LLC setup, but all my bank statements and utilities bills are local address. Therefore, just wonder if I can still use the LLC to open the Amazon account, as I won\u2019t be able to provide address proof in US for the account opening requirement, or there\u2019s no point for me to set up the LLC? Hey Cory! So glad you got in touch, as you don\u2019t need an LLC in order to start selling on Amazon. Instead, since you don\u2019t have proof of an address in the US, you can set up your business as a sole proprietorship.I hope this helps, and good luck with your business! can a Pakistani register his account on amazon for sale purpose????? Hi Talha! Based on the list of countries Amazon accepts for seller registration (https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/external/200405020?language=en-US&ref=mpbc_200417280_cont_200405020), if you are living in Pakistan you won\u2019t be able to sell on the site as it isn\u2019t one of the countries Amazon accepts. I am sorry about that. The popped up window says to sign up as a professional \u201caccount\u201d seller even though I hit (Individual seller) button. And there is no other way I can do anything to the window, it\u2019s solid. I cannot change it. Good question! If you scroll down the page, there should be a link that reads \u201chow to sell as an individual seller.\u201d That will help you circumvent the professional seller account. How to set up an Amazon Amazon seller account in 2020. What do I need to verify? Hi Anh, Amazon requires that you provide two types of verification. You can read more about it here: https://services.amazon.com.sg/resources/siv.html Is have a NZ tax i d number okay to use? Hi John, Good question. I am not certain how NZ works. You may contact Amazon directly to find out how it works with New Zealand and what they require. Hii! Can you send me the whole document on how to sell on amazon. Thank you very much! Hello! A fraudster, used my personal data and created an Amazon seller account for himself. My question is, will this work? Amazon tech support doesn\u2019t tell me anything clearly. Have you encountered this? Hey Darina, Interesting issue. Did you contact seller support with information? Right now, they might be a little behind due to the coronavirus threat, so they may be slow to get back to you. Hi Dave, My business partner and I are new in the Amazon Business. We are LLC and registered as a Professional Account about 2 months ago and our business is doing fine until now. However, we realized that we do not want to work together anymore but both of us want to keep working with Amazon. What should we do? Is it possible that one of us keep this first account and the other open a new one? Should we inform Amazon first? Do you think we should close this LLC and open 2 new ones? Thanks,\nD. Danyela, Hey! Sorry to hear that it didn\u2019t work out between you and your business partner. Make sure that the paperwork is line with the first LLC and yes, it\u2019s probably a good idea to contact Amazon. Then, whoever isn\u2019t part of the first LLC should start their own LLC or other business with Amazon. Just communicate with Amazon and you should be in good shape. Hope that\u2019s helpful! Do you have to show Credit Card, Utility Bill and Bank Account account numbers on the documents they require to be submitted when applying for an Amazon Seller Account? Hi Rob, Good question. I\u2019ll ask our CS department, but as far as I know you just need a credit card and bank account. Thank you for this article! I do have general questions as I am looking to become an Amazon FBA seller and currently reading through various forums: 1. I am planning on registering my LLC and setting up a business bank account with the LLC\u2019s name. I\u2019ve read that for Amazon\u2019s verification, a utility bill is needed in the name of the registered entity. So my question is, will a utility bill that has my personal name on it (not the LLCs name) be sufficient? Or does a utility bill have to have the LLCs name on it? 2. Can the utility bill have both my name and my husband\u2019s name on it or mine alone? 3. The credit card I plan on using to register is a personal one as I don\u2019t have a business credit card as of yet. Will this be okay? Hi Kimberly, Glad to see you joining in on all the fun! 1. One with your name should be sufficient. If you are unsure, you can reach out to seller support and ask them. When I started selling on Amazon, I started as a sole proprietor first then switch to LLC later.\n2. It should be fine if it\u2019s both.\n3. It should be fine, although, for the sake of keeping your business separate from your personal finance I recommend waiting until you have a business card. Hi Dave,\nVery helpful Blog!\nJust want to ask what under category is the towel, face towel or Bath towel Hi Mary Jane, Good question. Those should all be in Home & Kitchen. If you are unsure, when you\u2019re adding a product to Amazon, type in the type of product that it is and Amazon will automatically suggest the category to place your product in. Hi Dave Thank you so much for sharing good knowledge with us, i have read. my own question here is that, I am not a business owner non have product to sell.

Not sure I totally understand the question. Could you elaborate? Hi there,\nI\u2019m in Canada. Do I need to register my Amazon business here in BC, Canada to do the income tax returns?\nI\u2019m just starting off. I\u2019m not aware of the laws behind online businesses.\nPlease help me out.\nThank you Hi Richu, Great questions! You might consult with a tax law attorney or do a little hunting online. We don\u2019t want to give you the wrong information as we are not qualified to answer questions of that status. Does GST registration be required when doing business with Amazon due to a business of less than 1.5 million Hi Nikhil, For GST/India, we do not have reliable information on that. You might check with Amazon Seller Central Seller Support to see where you need to register. Sorry I couldn\u2019t be more helpful! Hey guys, thanks for the info! When I register it asks me if I own a brand? I\u2019ll be making custom packaging with a logo/company name (however the company doesn\u2019t exist as an LLC or registered trade mark). So do I check off the box that I own a brand or not? Thanks! Hey Ion, If you\u2019re registering your brand, you\u2019ll need to have a trademark. If you don\u2019t already have one, then you can use a service like Amazon\u2019s IP accelerator which will file your trademark for you and get you into the program faster. An outstanding share! I\u2019ve just forwarded this onto a colleague who has been doing a\nlittle research on this. And he actually bought me lunch simply because I found it for him\u2026\nlol. So let me reword this\u2026. Thanks for the meal!!\nBut yeah, thanx for spending some time to discuss this subject here on your site.

Do I send amazon inventory or just one product and they continue to make it? Eg. a book or keychain ect Hi Baileigh, Amazon is just a sales channel and fulfillment network. You would need to produce your own products and sell it, so yes, you\u2019d send inventory. Please i would love to sell books on amozon,but i am from nigeria how do i go about it.please enlighten me Hi Charles, The biggest difficulty you\u2019ll face is transporting the goods from where you are to Amazon. However, you might consider writing your own books to sell on Amazon, too, which wouldn\u2019t cost you any money. You could publish through Amazon\u2019s Kindle Direct Publishing system. hi\nI wanna ask if the \u201cregistered business\u201d is essential for amazon.de account? anybody would help me? how do I ship from my country, Trinidad and Tobago-WI, to US or other customers? do I hire a local shipping company to ship to amazon and from there my products is then shipped to customers or do I ship directly? shipping from my country will increase the cost of every product. Hi Nile, You can choose to manufacture your product in another country, like China, and have your products shipped directly to Amazon warehouses in the US. This would certainly be the most cost-effective option instead of shipping from your home country. We have several resources on finding suppliers and planning the shipping details. I hope those help! I tried to open an account according to your instructions, but Amazon asked me to verify my identity. I sent them a statement but they emailed me back that they can not verify the document and as a result I am not allowed to sell on Amazon.\nWhat can I do? I don\u2019t have credit card how can I start Hi Habib, Unfortunately, a credit card is absolutely necessary in order to set up an Amazon seller account. It can\u2019t be a prepaid card or debit card. If it\u2019s possible, check with your bank or research online banks to see if you can be approved. Hi there I have created new account and it\u2019s suspended immediately after deduction of my fee 39$ \u2026 I replied all email which is received from amazon. I can\u2019t understand why my account suspended and what amazon actually need from me\u2026 if amazon guide me what they need I can provide everything which they desire.. but I\u2019m very disappointed because I am nit getting any help and any response.. plz help and guide Hi Kashif! We\u2019re not suspension specialists here, but you might try contacting Chris McCabe at ecommercechris.com for guidance. Hope that\u2019s helpful! I am not a business owner but would like to start selling my own brand with Amazon and intend to sell 40 items per month. Hence individual seller should not be an option for me. However, upon registering on the website, I\u2019ve learned that the business type drop down button is limited only to the following categories: privately-owned business, individual, charity, state-owned and publicly listed business. Should I first then register a business before selling on Amazon? Thank you. Hi Teresa, Good question! I believe \u201cindividual\u201d would be what you filed as. You\u2019d have to put in your SSN for sole proprietor. Some states may require that you fill out a do-business-as (DBA), too. Hey can we use debit mastercard instead of credit card. And if we cant can you suggest me any other platform just like amazon to sale products\nThanks Hi Dave! very informative article, but I have some questions about setting up our Amazon US account as International seller outside USA: 1. if I lived in Indonesia and opened amazon US account, in this case I have set up my LLC and EIN using PO BOX address in USA, in the section point NO.7 on your article input business information which we need to input our business address, what address that I need to input? I think it should be our PO BOX USA address isn\u2019t? since I am doing dropshipping in this case. Regarding the verification process using phone, I will use my Indonesia number to receive the PIN. 2. In the section \u201cTax Information Interview\u201d, I will choose non US citizen, after that Amazon will need us to fill the form about our permanent address, in this case, it will be my Indonesia address, isn\u2019t? Just confused about the address part that we need to set as International seller especially doing dropshipping, looking forward to hear from you, CMIIW in setting up procedure, thank you \ud83d\ude42 Hi Juherianto, Great questions! And possibly a little out of my league. My recommendation would be to speak directly with one of Amazon\u2019s seller support representatives or to someone who does legal/accounting advice for international sellers in the US. There may be one available on our https://www.junglemarket.com or you might be able to find one somewhere on Google. You could also try hitting up our Customer Success team. They usually have pretty good insights on this type of thing. let me know the procedure to get amazon registration done I have heard that some people set up a separate amazon business account to do buying. How do you set up that type of business account as an individual without licenses etc, since it requires business verification? Hey Em, Great question! I personally have two LLCs myself, one for purchasing and one for the retail side. But you won\u2019t have to register the secondary business with Amazon, only the one you use to do through the retail. I am not a usa resident, after click my own country, the amozon ask me me to sign up for hyperwallet.com to receive payment. After successfully done in hyperwallet, I cannot click the next step. Why? any remedy to this problem.? thank Hi Happyjamin, Thanks for writing in! I\u2019m not sure what you mean. Have you tried contacting seller support? Hi, I have a question regarding selling tooth brushs that are produced outside USA on Amazon.com while I live in Canada. Are there any restrictions on such a business? Hi Arsalan! Great question! You can probably do that no problem, however, toothbrushes, I believe will fall into Health/Beauty category which is a restricted category and requires ungating. I think to ungate H/B you need to supply Amazon with an invoice from your manufacturer to prove that you are a legitimate reseller of that product. If you are the manufacturer, you have to prove and show proper paperwork. Hope that\u2019s helpful! Gr8, thanks ur info. That helps meh to get some info. in this field.\nI\u2019m also beginner in this Amazon vast Jungle. Thanks ur info. Is it easier to get documents approved on Amazon if you are an individual or professional seller? I am having a hard time getting my documents approved but I have no idea why. I am signed up as a professional right now and am trying to sell used books.\nThanks Was this ever answered? Fia\n11.21.2018 AT 2:50 PM\nGreat guide Greg!\nImportant question: Does Amazon accept seller if Business/LLC address is different from Credit card address? Do bank accounts/credit cards also have to be registered at the official business address? Thanks, don\u2019t want to muck up my chances of getting approved! Hello, I have an LLC (filing squared away) but d not want a hard inquiry on my personal name to open a new internationally chargeable credit card. Can I use personal internationally chargeable credit card until I build up business credit? Thank you, Britt Amazon asks you to verify your account like send documents, your passport details and bank statement. Now i have provided this information to get my account activated but they rejected the application saying your bank statement does not show any customer transactions.\nI never been in business I am starting from scratch and uploaded my personal upto date bank statement.\nHow do I get round this Hi, thanks very much for this information. I am a distributor of edible pet treats in the UK and I want to begin selling on Amazon. I will be using FBA and was hoping you have some more information on inventory management under FBA?\nUnder FBA is it correct to say that the seller only has to ensure that the amazon warehouse is sufficiently stocked to meet customer orders and that any distribution from the warehouse is left to the amazon distribution function to deal with? How would one ensure the amazon warehouse is sufficiently stocked with inventory and how do you ensure that your stock is held at a number of distribution warehouses across the UK region. If we do not use credit card for deposit, any other option? thanks Hi\nI have garments manufacturing unit. And i was making kitchen approns for a client , who export those goods to amazon. Now i want to export direct. How ? Please guide me Hi Rana, You would need to set up an Amazon account and prepare a shipment. You can learn how to do that in our Million Dollar Case Study (it\u2019s free) https://www.junglescout.com/blog/category/the-million-dollar-case-study/ Dave, When using the Amazon fab program, does Amazon handles defective products return by customers? And, how does it work? One thing that I would not like be part of is having to deal with products cominto me or my home address. Hey Pedro, You have two options. You can either have it sent directly to you or you can have Amazon dispose of it for you. Both have an associated cost. Sometimes, though, the \u201cdefective\u201d product is nothing more than a dinged up box. It seems you forgot a liiiiiiiittle detail, amazon now asks for a SS#! (TIN) I just tried to set up a new selling account and I found out that (even to sell a few things) they want \u201cTax Information\u201d. This is what it says: If you are a U.S. tax payer, by completing the tax interview in your seller account, you will be providing Amazon the appropriate tax identity in the form of a W-9 or W-8BEN form. For U.S. taxpayers, a Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) is required by the IRS for the administration of tax laws. In most cases, your TIN is either an Employer Identification Number (EIN) or a Social Security Number (SSN). My question is why do they want it now and they did not need it before (same with the credit card)? The way it is going, it would not be surprised if amazon soon will ask for a urine, stool, DNA, etc. sample (and maybe request to have a \u201cchip\u201d implanted to be able to sell). I looks I will be an eBay seller after all. Hi Sir Thank you very much for your information. Could you tell me please, Can i change my individual account into pro. after some time? Great guide Greg!\nImportant question: Does Amazon accept seller if Business/LLC address is different from Credit card address? Do bank accounts/credit cards also have to be registered at the official business address? Thanks, don\u2019t want to muck up my chances of getting approved! Fia, Did you ever get an answer to this question regarding LLC entity name and use of personal internationally chargeable credit card? If you would please reply if you have an answer that would be amazing.\nThank you in advance, Brittany Hi Dave excellent blog on Amazon thanks for all the ideas shared. Im based in India but the tools referred to seemed to be of US origin so how do i use this if i were to start my venture in India Hope you have some details for the same Thanks a lot in advance Sowmya Hey Sowmya, The process is still the same as it would be in the US, just a smaller market overall. In my experience, it\u2019s a little harder to profit on Amazon India as most of the items cost very few rupees. i want sales my rugs product on amazon..com so you tel me which type i do. Girish Khandelwal Which type of what? Seller account? I want to provide a simple solution to distributing a family genealogical book to about 40 family members, 7 of whom live outside the US\u2013England, Holland, Germany, Australia and Israel. There will be a charge for the cost of the book. My concern is the cost of shipping to these non-US addresses. Through any international air carrier, it can run $70-100 per location per book. Do you know if Amazon has a different shipping cost structure?-it can go by ship. I have tried to talk to an Amazon agent, but have not found any department that is willing to explain this. Thanks very much. Nancy, You might ask a logistics company the easiest and most cost-effective way to do this. I\u2019m not sure doing it through Amazon will work. DHL might have good rates for foreign carriers. Please, how if a product has a private label potential? And if there are multiple sellers for the product and how I can know if the product is patented or patent pending without going through the rigours of patent search that I don\u2019t really understand. Hey Amarachi, Rolando and Greg just made a video re: patents. https://www.junglescout.com/blog/branding-amazon-products/ if you need to register VAT in Europe, do you have to have an entity?\ncan\u2019t decide if i need to register a company or not? (prefer not to in the beginning) Hi Alice! We have a comprehensive guide to VAT from our European Million Dollar Case Study that you can read through here. It should answer your questions and help you get started! Melissa Hello Dave, Great and informative blog. I have learn a lot. I am planning to start amazon fba selling used books and I have some clarifications below; 1. Which one do you recommend for a newbie when starting in amazon fba (individual or pro merchant seller)?\n2. As an international seller, Is EIN required if I choose a pro merchant account?\n3. As for the shipping of goods, when do you recommend to use air or sea freight (is it base on weight)? Thanks in advance. Con 1. Depends on how many you think you\u2019re going to sell. If you\u2019re going to sell 40+, go Pro. Otherwise, stick with individual.\n2. That I\u2019m not sure of. You may contact Amazon direct to see what\u2019s necessary for your country.\n3. For private label, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re talking about, go with whichever is cheapest haha! Sea freight isn\u2019t tough, just requires a bit more prep. And you can outsource with a third party logistics company if you need to. Yes, I had the same issue trying to get verified ultimately being told that I may not sell on Amazon. I have a LLC in California, business bank account and credit card etc\u2026 and without a utility bill no dice. I use a managed mail service for my business location so getting a utility bill (cell doesn\u2019t count) is impossible. The verification group is not transparent or approachable either as they assume you are a fraudulent scammer so there is no one to talk to and the responses are just templated emails with the same request. I spent a lot of time following the Jungle Scout case studies and other resources so this was was a bit upsetting and quite a let down. Jungle Scout is a great company with awesome resources just make sure you do a little research on the Amazon verification process beforehand so you aren\u2019t blindsided. In particular make sure you make the correct decisions on the structuring of your business. You don\u2019t mention anything about the verification process. This is turning out to be the biggest hassle in setting up an account. You make it look so easy here but it\u2019s been nothing but a headache trying to get our documents verified to set up the account. I wish it was this easy!! Hey Bobbi, We actually wrote a piece earlier this year on the registration process for products. For this piece, we just wanted to introduce things. But for those interested, some categories are harder than others. In my opinion, the easiest ones are Kitchen/Dining, Sports/Outdoors, and Garden. Here\u2019s the article that covers some of these things: https://www.junglescout.com/blog/amazon-restricted-categories/ Hi. Thanks for the content. Question about the professional Amazon acct.\nIt is stated if one wants to to sell over 40 products to opt for the pro account of $39.99 a month. Now does this mean selling 40 different products or SKU\u2019s such as a bigger store if you will, or does this mean 40 sales in general per month of any one item (40 monthly sales in general)? Hey Kevin, Good question. It\u2019s just a math thing. Selling individual, you\u2019re charged an extra dollar by Amazon for every sale you make. Doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s one or many SKUs. Therefore, if you sell 40 items, you\u2019ll get charged an extra $40 in fees. Therefore, it makes sense to sell Pro if you\u2019re going to do more than 40 sales. Otherwise, you\u2019ll end spending more in fees than you really need to. Thanks so much for this!\nOne thing I\u2019m not seeing is how you know the exact address of where to ship to? How does amazon know to expect the packages? Hey Rebecca, Once you create your fulfillment order through Amazon seller central, they\u2019ll autocreate labels to send your products to. Greg, I am new seller, and my products will ship to FBA warehouse next month. trying to learn on Amazon. When click manage inventory, then click preference, there are lots of boxes we can check. would you give us idea what to do with each of them? There is also buy box price. Do you normally check it? What does it do when check it on? thank you so much,\nGeorge Hi Greg! Love this blog! Tons of info that helps\u2026I wanted to ask in your experience, for those who do not live in the US, what do you recommend to start selling in Amazon (private label, wholesales, books)?\nThanks, E Hey Elaine, Great question. Lots of sellers come from different backgrounds. Greg started with wholesaling and I started with books. A lot of folks just start with private label. And even more try out arbitrage first. It really comes down to what you feel most comfortable with and what works with your budget. Your email address will not be published.
