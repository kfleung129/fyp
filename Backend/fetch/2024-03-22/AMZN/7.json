    "text": "Several years back, CNBC\u00a0obtained a recording of Jeff Bezos\u2019s comments at an Amazon all-hands meeting. He was talking about his excitement for the auto industry and his admiration for the founder and CEO of electric vehicle startup Rivian, R.J. Scaringe. Amazon made a $700 million dollar investment in Rivian the prior February, and Bezos was explaining that Scaringe is part of what drew him to the company. Bezos called him \u201cincredible\u201d and said the entrepreneur\u2019s personality was a perfect match with Amazon\u2019s culture and values. That\u2019s when Bezos dropped the bombshell of wisdom that follows. He said that the kind of entrepreneurs he/Amazon looks to work with, the very best kind, have one thing in common about their approach. It\u2019s one thing to be laser-focused, task oriented, brutal when necessary or even cold and calculating, especially towards competition, when required. This mercenary, take no prisoners, win for the shareholders mentality has certainly made many a founder rich. But it\u2019s another thing altogether when an entrepreneur is on a mission, one that\u2019s bigger than him/her, one that isn\u2019t all about profits, and one that encapsulates a powerful vision to be more and contribute more to the\u00a0industry, employees, and society. It\u2019s what makes the best entrepreneurs. I realize best is subjective. I define best as those entrepreneurs that can accomplish all the business wins of a more mercenary approach, while still being higher-order mission-driven. In the\u00a0announcement\u00a0of Amazon\u2019s investment, Scaringer said Rivian\u2019s\u00a0mission is to bring \u201csustainable mobility\u201d to the world and to \u201creset expectations of what\u2019s possible\u201d, including eliminating compromises electric cars make on performance, capability, and efficiency, while setting a new bar in innovating the total customer experience. Missionary over mercenary. This point is worth another example. In his\u00a0TED talk, Chobani CEO Hamdi Ulukaya shares his \u201canti-CEO\u201d approach to running the yogurt company. He describes the fateful day visiting an 85-year old yogurt plant that was closing (and that was for sale for parts). He met the hard working, proud, yet stoically saddened workers\u00a0that were\u00a0losing their jobs, duty bound to shutter the site while their CEO was nowhere to be found. It was then that Ulukaya knew that he had to run a company that put people, not profits, first. He went on to describe an incredible mission versus mercenary driven approach: Corporate America says it\u2019s about profits.\u00a0Mainstream business says it\u2019s about money.\u00a0The CEO playbook says it\u2019s about shareholders.\u00a0And so much is sacrificed for it \u2014 it\u2019s factories, communities, jobs.\u00a0But not by CEOs.\u00a0CEOs have their employees suffer for them.\u00a0But yet, the CEOs\u2019s pay goes up and up and up.\u00a0And so many people are left behind. We need a new playbook that sees people again.\u00a0That sees above and beyond profits. The new way of business \u2014\u00a0it\u2019s your employees you take care of first.\u00a0Not the profits. The Chobani CEO backs his mission with actions, giving shares to all 2,000 employees, building a little league field with the company\u2019s first profits, taking a stand for immigrants and providing them with jobs, even busing them to his facilities. His mission includes consumer delight and he considers himself as reporting to the consumer versus the corporate board. His personal number in the beginning years of Chobani was the 1-800 number on the cup. Missionary over mercenary, as Bezos says. Now back to that word \u201cbest\u201d. The best entrepreneurs follow a mission because of its higher-order nature and because they realize it will also get them all the business wins any other more cutthroat approach might bring. For my money, that makes it the best kind of entrepreneur. Case in point, says Ulukaya (edited for brevity): \u201cYou see,\u00a0if you\u2019re right with your people,\u00a0community, and product, you\u2019ll be more profitable,\u00a0innovative,\u00a0and you\u2019ll have more passionate people working for you\u00a0and a community that supports you.\u201d If you started a local business, but didn\u2019t need the income to live on, why would you start it? It would be to create jobs for the people in that community. To bring enrichment to that community. To create a platform to fight injustices. To build a company to serve the people, not to corral people to serve a company. Maybe it\u2019s idealistic. Maybe Wall St. would crap on that. Maybe it\u2019s why I was destined to leave the corporate life for that of an entrepreneur. I know for certain, though, that Bezos is right. I\u2019ll take mission-driven over no-mercy driven any day of the week. I bet you would too \u2014 so why not role model it?
