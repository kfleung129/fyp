Well I believe so I wouldnt expect Microsofts total returns to be almost 24000% in the next 30 years as they were over the past 30 years but consistent investments in the company could lead to substantial growth MSFT data by YCharts One of Microsofts fastest-growing segments is its Intelligent Cloud division which includes its cloud platform Azure Although Azure trails Amazon Web Service (AWS) in market share -- 19% of cloud spending in the third quarter of 2023 compared with AWSs 31% -- it has made considerable progress in the past few years In 2016 Azures market share was around 11% As of the end of 2023 the global cloud computing market is estimated to be around $626 billion By 2028 its expected to be over $126 trillion a compound annual growth rate of around 15% As the overall cloud pie gets larger Microsoft has a chance to continue gaining market share as its growing faster than the current leader AWS Microsoft should see a boost to its profits as Azure grows because its a much higher-margin business than other segments involving physical products such as PCs or Surfaces MSFT Net Income (Quarterly) data by YCharts Microsofts partnership with ChatGPTs creator OpenAI could prove to be a game-changer for the company The partnership first started in 2017 when Microsoft invested $1 billion in OpenAI giving it capital to fuel its research and development Since then Microsoft has introduced two additional phases to its long-term partnership with OpenAI The deals essentially combine the AI expertise of OpenAI with the vast resources and cloud computing power of Microsoft Thats a match made in AI heaven For Microsoft being able to leverage OpenAIs language models like GPT-4 and integrate it into its products and services will allow them to become even more efficient and competitive against other options Current examples include using Copilot in GitHub to suggest code improvements and making developers more productive as well as using GPT-4 in Azure Short of generational returns or a large lump-sum to invest at once the only way a stock could be a millionaire-maker is if it has continued success over a long period Given the robustness of Microsofts product and service ecosystem there may not be another big tech stock built for this sustained success quite like Microsoft Microsoft operates in productivity (Office) professional networking (LinkedIn) gaming (Xbox) the cloud (Azure) operating systems (Windows) and a handful of other markets Having this diversification is key to weathering economic storms because it reduces reliance and encourages long-term stability If the iPhone struggles Apple struggles And if Google advertising struggles Alphabet struggles In addition if e-commerce struggles Amazon struggles And so by no means is Microsoft exempt from struggles but there isnt a single product service or segment that Microsoft leans on too much Making consistent investments in Microsoft is the most effective way to let it lead you to millionaire land John Mackey former CEO of Whole Foods Market an Amazon subsidiary is a member of The Motley Fool’s board of directors Suzanne Frey an executive at Alphabet is a member of The Motley Fool’s board of directors Stefon Walters has positions in Apple and Microsoft The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Alphabet Amazon Apple and Microsoft The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy Invest better with The Motley Fool Get stock recommendations portfolio guidance and more from The Motley Fools premium services Making the world smarter happier and richer © 1995 - 2024 The Motley Fool All rights reserved Market data powered by Xignite and Polygonio"

2024","1/3/2024","https://investorplace.com/2024/01/new-year-new-gains-the-3-best-quantum-computing-stocks-to-buy-in-2024/","Countdown to Luke Lango’s “2nd Trillion-Dollar AI Trade” The US govt just unlocked an $8 trillion market to move in a new direction See how it could unleash 6000% potential upside Get ahead of the quantum revolution with these leading companies Advertisement Source: Shutterstock Quantum computing is an exciting yet complex space with much promise Recent projections estimate the global quantum computing market will grow to $76 billion in 2027 This forecast considers factors like the methodical pace of quantum hardware development competition from other advanced computing technologies and current economic uncertainties Analysts expect a gradual expansion as the market matures Progress will likely come through enhancements in infrastructure computing platforms and a wider range of suitable applications Experts predict investments will continue accelerating over the next five years even with measured hardware breakthroughs Quantum computing stocks are positioned to capitalize on this advancement Let’s take a look at the three most promising ones The first quantum computing stock on our list is the global tech company Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) It has been around for over 48 years and is based in Redmond Washington Today the company is

investment in OpenAI the company’s innovative contributions solidify its role in shaping the future of computing technology MSFT recently announced a partnership with the AFL-CIO to develop AI technology that benefits workers Instead of treating labor as an input to be optimized by tech they want workers themselves to guide the development process The partnership allows workers’ on-the-ground expertise to shape how AI gets built and deployed This collaboration can reduce burdens enhance careers unlock human potential and increase company valuation Microsoft reported strong financial results in its recent quarter Total revenue rose 13% year-over-year to $565 billion operating income jumped 25% to $269 billion net income increased 27% to $223 billion and diluted earnings per share was $299 The company saw double-digit growth across major financial metrics and on top of that analysts rated the stock a Strong Buy citing over 60% upside potential with a high price target

Learn more share this! 1 Twit Share Email February 3 2024 This article has been reviewed according to Science Xs editorial process and policies Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the contents credibility: fact-checked reputable news agency proofread by Matt Obrien Satya Nadella marks his tenth year as Microsoft CEO on Sunday capping a decade of stunning growth as he pivoted the slow-moving software giant into a laser focus on cloud computing and artificial intelligence Microsofts stock has soared by more than 1000% since Nadella took the helm in 2014 compared to the more gradual 185% growth of the broader S&P 500 Microsoft now has a market value of $3 trillion—more than any US publicly traded company including its longtime rival Apple Nadellas had the biggest transformation of a tech company potentially ever said Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives The only one that would rival it was (Steve) Jobs coming back to Apple and turning it around with the iPhone Microsoft has created $28 trillion in shareholder wealth in the past decade meaning an investor who bought a $10000 stake in Microsoft at the time Nadella took over and did nothing with those shares would have a stake worth about $113000 now Our industry does not respect tradition—it only respects innovation Nadella told employees in an inaugural memo 10 years ago an opening salvo that hinted at bigger shifts to come Microsoft declined requests for an interview Now a hero to Wall Street some were at first skeptical that such transformation could come from an insider whod already spent 22 years at the Redmond Washington company Hes only the third Microsoft CEO following Steve Ballmer who lasted for 14 years and Bill Gates who co-founded the company in 1975 and took it public in 1986 Big changes came quickly under Nadella He marshaled resources to build up the Azure cloud computing platform a shift in priorities from the companys longtime reliance on its flagship Windows operating system and the royalties it gets for each PC sold with it And he largely put the brakes on Microsofts ill-fated attempts to play catch-up in the smartphone market marked by his predecessor Ballmers $73 billion acquisition of Nokias phone business But some of the biggest changes were in the companys culture a shift away from Microsofts brash external reputation and internal bickering to a more collaborative approach that Nadella has modeled in his own collegial personality and engineers mindset LEARN-IT-ALL CULTURE Microsoft is known for rallying the troops with competitive fire Nadella said in his 2017 autobiography The press loves that but its not me Much of Nadellas strength is how he stands out from the typical very strong ego CEO said Raimo Lenschow a stock analyst at Barclays who covers 36 tech companies Instead of making bold pronouncements Lenschow said Nadella takes a more measured approach to explaining where he thinks the future is going And whether its the person making food in the cafeteria an engineer finance executive a customer he treats everyone in the same way with respect said Ives Its not just Wall Street analysts who think so A tiny startup from Zeeland Michigan running a booth at Januarys CES gadget show in Las Vegas caught a glimpse of Nadellas curiosity when he showed up shook founder Tim Murphys hand and asked for a demo The product Audio Radar visualizes the sounds in video games for deaf and hard of hearing players Hes very down to earth said Murphy who was there with a small crew including his teen son I gave him the pitch played some games and he was like Its wonderful what youre doing Honestly I cant really remember too much of what he said because I was just kind of shocked Nadella has long made the accessibility of technology a priority informed in part by his experience raising a son who was visually impaired quadriplegic and had cerebral palsy Zain Nadella died in 2022 Whats brought Microsoft to its latest heights is its emergence as an artificial intelligence leader setting the agenda on how AI tools could get used in work and society While Nadella has been emphasizing AI for most of his tenure its role was not guaranteed and happened after years of careful planning that led to a close partnership with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI (OpenAI pays The Associated Press an undisclosed fee to license its archive of news stories) Historically if youre a cool startup that was doing something amazing Microsoft wasnt really your first choice Lenschow said So the fact that he got OpenAI to commit to Azure was an amazing masterstroke it gives him a massive competitive advantage over Google and Amazon That position was put in jeopardy late last year when OpenAIs board of directors suddenly fired CEO Sam Altman A weekend of behind-the-scenes maneuvers and a threatened mass exodus of employees championed by Nadella helped bring back Altman and stabilize the startup assuaging clients and shareholders He handled that like he was in the World Series of Poker playing against little kids Ives said Nadellas tenure hasnt been without hiccups especially given how much of the world relies so heavily on Microsoft products—sometimes to the frustration of people using them Cybersecurity experts say its tendency is to sacrifice security for convenience including in its gung-ho rollout of AI large language models The companys trademark suite of work tools Microsoft Office 365 has also been penetrated successfully in recent years in embarrassing high-profile compromises that have seen elite Russian and Chinese cyber operators access the email accounts of senior US officials and members of Microsofts senior leadership team It stepped in to provide cloud hosting to Ukraine just ahead of Russias 2022 invasion but the networks serving NATO allies are constantly peppered by intrusion attempts That and the worsening ransomware scourge have led Nadella to call for a cyber Geneva Convention with Russia and China And despite Nadellas stated aversion to competitive fire Microsoft is once again drawing the kind of antitrust scrutiny that dogged Gates and Ballmer in earlier years Nadellas confident testimony at a federal court hearing last summer helped persuade a judge not to block Microsofts purchase of video game giant Activision Blizzard but the company is now facing another round of questions on its partnership with OpenAI None of those challenges are likely to push Nadella 56 who made $485 million in total compensation last year and has also chaired Microsofts board since 2021 out of his leadership roles anytime soon From everything I can gather hes really enjoying himself Lenschow said Were in very very very interesting times I would expect him to stay for

Trillion-Dollar AI Trade” The US govt just unlocked an $8 trillion market to move in a new direction See how it could unleash 6000% potential upside Kick off the new year by investing in three long-term gems Advertisement Source: Shutterstock For those prioritizing long-term investments the key is selecting stocks with a robust track record and resilience in unpredictable scenarios In the vast landscape of investments dominated by tech unicorns and financial giants three discreet millionaire-maker stocks stand out These stocks operating with resilience innovation and market finesse quietly generate wealth Also they act as undercover agents of fortune in the shadows Indeed investing early is a pathway to leaving a lasting legacy Also it assures substantial returns for future endeavors such as homeownership or funding education So the sooner one engages in legacy investing the greater the potential gains Therefore let’s dive into three millionaire-maker growth stocks that may have a few millionaires to mint yet In 2023 Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) staged a remarkable turnaround surging nearly 200% after a terrible 64% decline in 2022 Notably the company’s revival can be largely attributed to artificial intelligence (AI) initiatives This includes the launch of products like Imagine and Meta AI along with 28 additional AI programs They even feature influencers like Snoop Dogg and Kendall Jenner Additionally the potential for a significant Federal Reserve rate cut throughout the year promised positive market implications Further this could include a potential boost to the company’s valuation Meta’s strides in AI are notable and further advancements could prompt a valuation comparable to leading AI-focused stocks Additionally anticipated earnings growth of approximately 21% in the coming year will likely contribute to Meta’s favorable trajectory Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) thrives as a platform empowering businesses to establish and manage online stores Its subscription model ensures a steady income stream Recently the company marked its most successful Black Friday with merchants raking in $41 billion in sales Financially robust Shopify recorded a 25% year-over-year (YOY) revenue surge to $17 billion and a 36% YOY increase in gross profit With SHOP stock surging 115% year to date (YTD) momentum could propel it going forward in the coming year In its most recent recent quarter Shopify reported earnings of 31 cents per share marking a substantial 3429% increase from the same period last year Additionally quarterly revenue came in at $207 billion reflecting 19% YOY growth For the current fiscal year earnings are estimated at 70 cents per share This represents a remarkable 1650% change with revenue expected to reach $698 billion a 25% change Looking to the next fiscal year earnings are projected at $104 per share implying growth of 48% After a challenging 2022 Shopify rebounded reclaiming a $100 billion market cap The company’s restructuring including the sale of its logistics business boosted investor confidence With a leaner workforce positive operating income and AI opportunities analysts anticipate 20% revenue growth positioning Shopify as a top 2024 performer Tech giant Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a key holding for many institutional investors including Citadel making up nearly 2% of this asset manager’s portfolio Citadel increased its Microsoft position by 367 million shares across Q2 and Q3 Specifically it acquired 16 million shares in Q3 at an average closing price of $330 This strategic move bolsters confidence amid rising share prices Also it highlights Microsoft’s strength in AI and the cloud The tech behemoth surged over 260% in the past five years rewarding shareholders with a 08% dividend yield and $075 quarterly payout Heavy AI investments are expected to pay off with diverse products integral to daily life Steady 2023 net income growth is anticipated to continue Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard and its robust liquidity position coupled with strong leadership set the stage for future success Thus I’m remaining bullish on MSFT stock for a number of reasons Two reasons include the company’s entry into quantum computing and its robust ecosystem of software and hardware applications And the third reason is its investment in OpenAI which makes this stock worth owning for the long-term Indeed for those who believe this AI rally can continue MSFT stock is one to hold right now On the date of publication Chris MacDonald has a LONG position in META The

Examiner","1/3/2024","https://wisconsinexaminer.com/2024/01/03/tech-hub-microsoft-deal-and-more-fill-the-plate-for-wedc-ceo-hughes/","Wisconsin Economic Development Corp CEO Missy Hughes (second from left) speaks with participants of the WEDC’s Main Street Bounceback program in West Bend in December (Photo courtesy of WEDC) At the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp CEO Missy Hughes looks back on 2023 as a significant year for the state’s business community — at home and on the world stage In a late December interview Hughes rattled off some big hits for the state One is the federal government greenlighting the next phase for an ambitious proposal to establish a biohealth tech hub in Wisconsin Another is a new and promising future for the highly touted perennially doubted Foxconn site in Southeastern Wisconsin Hughes isn’t shy in her enthusiasm for the biohealth tech hub and its focus on “personalized medicine” — tailoring diagnosis and treatment of illness to a patient’s distinctive genetic characteristics “It’s going to transform health care” she declares Doctors treating a patient with a tumor won’t have to throw “the kitchen sink at this tumor” Hughes says Instead they’ll be able “to give the most effective treatment the most directly with as little damage to the rest of the healthy body as possible and get you back to work get you back to your family as quickly as possible It’s really honestly going to be game-changing” The federal CHIPS and Science Act passed in 2022 authorized and provided funding for the tech hubs But Hughes says the state was only able to take part because of groundwork laid well before by the participants The biohealth tech hub project brings together faculty from the University of Wisconsin and Madison and Milwaukee technical colleges health technology businesses and economic and workforce development agencies Universities conduct research businesses develop technologies that make use of those findings and health care providers then put those technologies to the test “That work is already happening” says Hughes “With the designation of the tech hub we’re able to expand on that” It brings together “a whole bunch of different skill sets that we already have in Wisconsin” — artificial intelligence research into gene functions drug development and advanced manufacturing Wisconsin’s was one of 31 tech hub projects that the federal government designated in October for initial funding with the prospect of larger federal investments to come Just getting this far gives Wisconsin additional allure for everyone from academics looking to relocate to employers eying the state Hughes says In March Microsoft announced a $1 billion investment to establish a data center on a 315-acre site in the Racine County village of Mount Pleasant — part of the land originally developed for Foxconn In November Microsoft announced it was expanding its footprint there with the purchase of another 1030 acres The Foxconn project that began under previous administrations in Madison and Washington DC and never approached the original promise sold in 2017 by then-Gov Scott Walker and President Donald Trump: a $10 billion high-tech flat screen manufacturing complex employing 13000 people Critics were skeptical from the start especially at the $3 billion in potential tax credits that the Legislature and Walker promised the company and questioned the $700 million that Mount Pleasant spent on infrastructure development Tony Evers ran for governor criticizing the project as a massive boondoggle Foxconn’s actual operational plans changed repeatedly leading WEDC to disqualify the company’s tax credit applications Midway through Evers’ first term WEDC and Hughes renegotiated the tax credits which for the first time enabled the company to actually qualify for them but at much lower cost to the state than the original credits would have cost if the company had ever qualified for them The April 2021 renegotiation was “right-sizing for what Foxconn is prepared to do in the marketplace” Hughes says — putting it on the same level as other companies that WEDC has rewarded with tax credits for job creation Having employed about 1000 people over the course of its history in the state “it’s a good company to have here in Wisconsin” she says of Foxconn “But they’re just like any of our other companies at this point” Reworking the deal was important to ensure an eventual return on the money sunk into developing the site “The way that I looked at it was it would be a shame for all of the infrastructure investment that happened to go to waste” Hughes recalls And as it became clear that the company would only use about a third of the redeveloped land WEDC “very aggressively went out … doing everything we could” to market the remaining vacant land Hughes says Microsoft showed interest with a $500 million investment initially later doubling that and then adding to it “We were very involved with having conversations” with the company she says Lawmakers and Evers included a sales tax exemption for data centers in the 2023-25 state budget — a further incentive for Microsoft Milwaukee 7 the economic development organization that covers seven southeast Wisconsin counties handled “the nitty gritty work of working through the new development agreement and the purchase and sale of the land with Microsoft and Foxconn Hughes says “A blue-chip company like Microsoft is the best outcome that we could have hoped for and worked for” she says While working with large business enterprises occupies much of WEDC’s agenda the agency has continued to dig more deeply into small business support Emblematic of that side of the operation is the Main Street Bounceback program now completing its second year of providing expansion grants of up to $10000 each to 9500 small businesses around Wisconsin Small business development is an important part of WEDC’s mission Hughes says because small businesses such as retailers and service providers help bring character life and value to the communities where they thrive In Prairie du Chien Main Street is bouncing back “Having communities where folks want to live and go downtown and spend time with each other is incredibly important” Hughes says “At WEDC we like to say we can walk and chew gum at the same time so we can focus on our small businesses and our large businesses” The Bounceback program gave the participating businesses opportunities to expand perhaps renovate or move into new space and to increase their value without owners having to drain their own savings Small businesses “often become large businesses if we give them enough support” she adds “Supporting small businesses along with the tens of millions of dollars that we give to large businesses every year in the form of tax credits is a way of evening things out” In the coming weeks WEDC expects to announce the first investments to be made by the Wisconsin Investment Fund a venture capital project The Wisconsin Investment Fund is being seeded with a federal grant — $50 million from US Treasury State Small Business Credit Initiative The Evers administration had sought $75 million in the state budget for venture capital but the budget committee’s Republican majority removed that request “We had a lot of conversations with the Legislature about how other Midwest states — Michigan Minnesota — are really digging in and investing in economic development” Hughes says “and I would have liked to have seen more willingness to really invest and think about the future with regard to economic development from our Legislature” Nevertheless she considers the investment fund one of WEDC’s big priorities for the new year “Access capital is going to be incredibly important — whether it’s our small businesses our mainstream businesses but also our startups or entrepreneurs who need significant capital to bring their product to market or to develop their software or their medical device” Hughes says Hughes is also looking to other opportunities afforded by the federal government The 2022 Inflation Reduction Act included a number of provisions aimed at addressing climate change including funding for the state green innovation bank “The governor has told WEDC we’re responsible for that” Hughes says Working with a commission that Evers established in June WEDC will be looking at projects “all around the state that help businesses become more sustainable Wisconsinites choose renewable energy” GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX There are also bank federal tax credits to reward cleaner energy choices in the legislation and WEDC will dig into “how can we help our communities and our businesses” make use of those incentives she adds “A lot of the recent federal funding is ‘get it while you can and be first in line’” says Hughes “We want to make sure that for those opportunities our businesses and our communities are up at the front of the line” Hughes says she’s also been glad to have an opportunity in the last year “to get back on the road and travel internationally” helping Wisconsin businesses make new connections around the world “I think it’s incredibly important for Wisconsin businesses to realize that they’re part of a global marketplace and that there are opportunities in Asia there’s opportunities in Africa there’s opportunities in Europe — and not only grabbing those opportunities but also just having that understanding that there are markets to expand to and places to sell your goods that are different and interesting and pursuing them” she says Exports are increasing Hughes observes “And I think that’s going to continue to create opportunities for Wisconsin businesses” by Erik Gunn Wisconsin Examiner January 3 2024 by Erik Gunn Wisconsin Examiner January 3 2024 At the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp CEO Missy Hughes looks

Bill Mann: Yes Nice to be seen Dylan Lewis: To see and be seen and be heard as well Bill were going to have you heard as well Weve got to look at the necessity-based approach to retail centers and shopping centers weve got earnings from Tesla and Netflix and weve got some legacy names that might be worth a closer look for investors Were going to start with the new largest name on the market Andy This is a company that we have seen at the mountaintop before It is there again this week Microsoft opened as the most valuable company in the world passing Apple as they sometimes do jockeying for the crown of most valuable company in the world What do you make of Microsoft now a little over $3 trillion Andy Cross: It is that jockeying right guys? Theyre neck and neck theyre right there By the time someone listens to this they maybe be switched around again So theyre both outstanding companies obviously some of the most successful businesses Certainly in our lifetimes if not almost ever when you think about just the quality of these businesses and what they have earned in both the marketplace Interesting Apple this month so year to date I know its only been a few weeks guys but the stock is up a percent or two or so When you look at the rest of those large tech companies Microsoft done very well and of course Nvidia driving so many of the gains so I think you will just see it continue They are now separating Microsoft is starting to separate itself because its tied to so many things and we saw what it is now trying to do in the gaming business with its Activision Blizzard acquisition of almost $70 billion So they will be neck and neck It will be very interesting to see how Apple if it starts to think about really exploiting or using I should say its strength in the computer space and the individual space the consumer market as it thinks about AI and all those investments We still have really not heard a whole lot about that from Apple yet Dylan Lewis: Bill I love checking in on Microsoft and the story because it is a good reminder for investors It was a long road to becoming a $3 trillion company and one of the most valuable companies in the world period let alone the largest and there were a lot of periods where it didnt seem as inevitable as it does now for Microsoft Bill Mann: No for a long period of time Microsoft was pretty much thought to be an also-ran It had a 14 year period in which it did not reach its previous high so Microsoft was not a company that was being taken seriously as a competitor within that space anymore and now Id like to put frames around things $3 trillion means that Microsoft is worth $428 per man woman and child on the planet Dylan Lewis: Its humongous Bill Mann: Its humongous and you have to wonder at what point does that just simply become too large for any company to be able to generate that level of economic return So its a massive number Im not saying they cant I mean I think a lot of people have underestimated Microsoft for a long time Four hundred and twenty eight bucks thats a lot Dylan Lewis: Thats incredible If you add Apple and Microsoft together you have almost $1000 per every person Bill Mann: Apple by the way has been buying back shares Theyre not committed to being the largest company in the world by market cap If they did they wouldnt be buying back shares at all I mean Andys exactly right maybe there have never been businesses that have been better at generating returns for investors or economic returns than the two of these Dylan Lewis: One of the ways Microsoft is looking for that next phase of growth is gaming The company recently acquired Activision Blizzard and we did see it was not all good news over at Microsoft this week There were announced layoffs of 1900 employees in gaming many of them are part of the newly acquired Activision Blizzard Group Andy what do you make of this as youre processing the news itself and the broader layoff picture were seeing? Andy Cross: Well first on the news Dylan and not surprising anytime a companys going to make a significant acquisition theyre going to think of how to rationalize costs and a lot of these I imagine theres a lot of overhead corporate costs dual roles theyve talked about and those just are redundant and it doesnt really make sense for the acquiring company as painful as it is for those layoffs to keep those roles and think about trying to get the two companies together in the back office side What is interesting though is this does come on top of the layoffs that Microsoft had a year ago Many tech companies as we were seeing not just in the gaming space I mean were seeing Twitch were seeing Unity were seeing Riot Games they are definitely simplifying reducing their work forces because of some of the gaming slowdown overall But it does echo with what we are seeing across a lot of the tech sphere when so many companies made so many investments in people Namely because I think they were worried they wouldnt be able to get people During the COVID period they were just worried about talent the grab for talent They made those large investments in those people They are now starting to deal with that because they are seeing that there are different ways to get value from their assets and it maybe it isnt so much in all of the people especially as you think about things like how does AI or how does this technology in general improve the operations of a company that doesnt require having all those employees? So its painful but it is a rationalization cost that large companies need to go through Bill Mann: Some of it has to do with the fact that Microsoft immediately canceled a game thats been in development for six years code named Odyssey at Activision So obviously a long time investment that Microsoft didnt seem to think was worth to continue to make A lot of it also has to do with the fact that we are in a different environment now in terms of the cost of funds and so in 2020 you could throw money at anything and there was almost no loss to it because money was free Its not free anymore even at a company like Microsoft Andy Cross: Itll be very interesting to see how this all works out with Microsoft as they continue to push more aggressively at the cloud How much is X-box units versus X-box cloud and all those different subscriptions? So I think the acquisition is exciting It is unfortunate and painful for those people who had to let go Bill Mann: Always have to remember that that is a human story Andy Cross: Yeah sure Dylan Lewis: Before we go to break were going to go global It has been a tough run for the Chinese stock market and for companies based in China over the last few years but if youre paying attention to some major moves Bill things might be getting a little interesting Alibaba co-founders Jack Ma and Joseph Tsai recently bought $200 million in Alibaba shares Is this signal? Is this this noise? Bill Mann: Did they? [laughs] Dylan Lewis: Was it them? Bill Mann: Was it them? Six trillion dollars in losses in the Chinese stock market from its peak and that by the way that is Apple plus Microsoft just wiped off their market gap And by the way they didnt start with an Apple at a Microsoft So it has been a brutal run for China and its possible you are seeing some moves within China They reduced their banking reserve ratios that were required in order to get some liquidity into the market and you are starting to see some big purchases by some of the big shareholders of these companies and I think it is very interesting that they came in with $50 million of Jack Mas money and $150 million of Joseph Tsais money that they are backing Alibaba the way they have Because Alibaba has come up against some real competition in the form of Pinduoduo and its Temu platform Dylan Lewis: Bill when I look at China I feel like Ive seen different chapters of risk and concern with the overall picture there Some of it was for a very long time government intervention and the lines between private and public and the strength of public and private enterprises Some of it also was demographic story Knowing that were seeing slowing demographics and slowing population growth were going to see some declines there is there anything else that youre worried about as you look to that picture or anything you feel like were getting wrong as we look at some of those stories? Bill Mann: Im sure were getting a lot of things wrong in China but it bears remembering that China has over the last couple of years gone from being a government by committee to really government by one guy So there are some real concerns in China There never were in place any real shareholder protections particularly for international investors into Chinese companies and I think that people have you know theyve finally been burned enough times that theyre not that excited to go back There were huge withdrawals from the Chinese market by western investors at the end of this last year That has continued apace I think China is at the point where they need to prove that they are a market that is safe for foreign investors before people will get excited about any of the demographic shifts Actually the demographic shifts arent that awesome so that might be anything on top but it has always been the case Hey a billion people and a half in China thats a huge market It remains to be the case but I think people are three times bitten and four times shy at this point Dylan Lewis: Is that to say youre not following Jack Ma and Joseph Tsai into shares of Alibaba? Bill Mann: Alibaba is a company that I actually feel fairly positively about and have in fact I believe in China if you want to invest in there just play the hits and Alibaba is one of them Dylan Lewis: Coming up after the break weve got a run down on the earnings beat with the results from Tesla and Netflix Stay right here This is Motley Fool Money Welcome back to Motley Fool Money I am Dylan Lewis joined in studio by Bill Mann and Andy Cross Gentlemen it was a busy week for earnings so we are going to dive right in Bill Tesla shares down 10 percent after the company reported this week Results were below expectations But am I reading it right that a lot of the attention was on the forward-looking growth estimates and a little bit less on what we saw in the reported quarter? Bill Mann: I think that thats probably true I mean in the run-up to the earnings Elon Musk the very interesting CEO of this company came out and said that he believed that were there not protections put into place that the Chinese EV manufacturers would pretty much demolish Thats a direct quote competition around the world If youve got a $600 billion company that primarily does electric vehicles outside of China thats something that I think you should pay attention to I mean the quarter was expected for them Im actually surprised the stock went down as much as it did based on the results because we already knew about the price cuts around the world for their existing fleet Dylan Lewis: I was going to say I mean I think we had to know margins were going to get compressed because of what you were talking about there with the price cuts Weve seen the growing traction and the growing deliveries by BYD We dont see them on the roads here in the United States but that is a story weve been aware of Are you surprised at all that this was the reaction or was there anything in there that really surprised you? Outside of whats getting all the headlines? Bill Mann: Look I think that I think that Elon Musk will remain a complete enigma The fact that he came out and you had balls longtime balls like Dan Ives come out and say the things they were talking about during the conference call These were not executives who were taking responsibility for margin compression They were not taking responsibility for some of the mistakes that were happening or the environment that Tesla is in I think youve got to be mindful of the fact that there actually are many more questions that are being asked about Tesla including things in governance like Elon Musk came out and basically said that he wants 25 percent of the company as if hes not already deeply incentivized enough with the billions and billions of ownership he has of the company There are some real questions there A lot of them have been a long time coming Dylan Lewis: Tough week for Tesla great week for Netflix Andy shares the streamer up 15 percent this week following earnings that showed the company can still add subscribers Andy Cross: The story of two different leaders in two different spaces I mean this was a clear case of the clear leader in streaming Showcasing gosh Oscar Worthy status By adding 131 million streaming subscribers pushing this stock to a two-year high still far below 20 percent below its all-time high But as they continue to make investments including the WWE Raw investment they made for $5 billion reportedly over 10 years The outstanding strategy of testing and learning into all these different parts of the market International expansion live entertainment documentaries sports documentaries gaming With really no corporate acquisitions they do it all internal house Netflix is now the go-to space for creators because they know theyre going to get the eyeballs 260 million global subscribers like I just mentioned They added 1312 million this quarter Thats 50 percent above expectations and the most since 2020 It almost doubled the ads they had a year ago The United States was the slowest growing one of the slowest-growing parts of the market But they still added 28 million In the US and in Canada the advertising membership grew 70 percent and equals 40 percent of all new subs in markets where they have the advertising tier a lot of those new additions are coming in the advertising tier revenue was up 125 percent versus up six percent a year ago operating income was at 15 billion That was up 172 percent When you just look at the Netflix story they continue to widen their lead over the competition which is a little bit of a disarray I think its safe to say The programming theyre making and the success theyre having on both the programming for their viewers who see Netflix as the place that I have to maintain my streaming subscription above anything else and thats showing up in the results Bill Mann: I thought it was super interesting in their report that they basically came out and said that they intend to raise prices a little bit over time This is a company that is fully confident with where they are right now What a shock from two years ago Dylan Lewis: Unbelievable one of my questions here Andy with looking at Netflix is we have seen the push for were going to crack down on password sharing Weve seen the push into ads Do we have to continue to expect this growth? Do we have to think those were quick levers and maybe that we cant expect that growth going forward? Andy Cross: Oh gosh I think just the different ways Like theyre just starting to get into the gaming They had some grand theft auto stuff last year Like I mentioned in different documentaries Theyre going to have different live programming events The WWE that acquisition of that content for Raw in the licensing agreement and international other assets that plays really well into their strength Again I know $5 billion and a lot of money Theyre going to invest 17 billion in programming just this year alone But thats the way that Netflix has been able to build these properties out They leak out a little content they try things they see what works they dont they get the data and they make those smart investments that play out for their members I think itll be Im not worried about their ability to innovate and find new things for us to enjoy on Netflix Dylan Lewis: Were going to wrap the earnings chat by checking in on Big Blue Bill IBM shares up eight percent post earnings sending the stock to its highest level since 2013 What has the market so excited about IBM? Bill Mann: IBM is like the nickelback of AI companies Isnt it? Like nobody wants to admit that they like it because I mean its a company thats disappointed for so long It is one of the few companies in the last decade that Warren Buffett bought and sold in disgust because they didnt do any of the things that he thought that they were going to do But IBM has a 25-year library and a head start in AI Theyve been doing it for a long time It is not by accident that you go back and you remember that Big Blue which was an AI device was IBMs and thats what competed against Gary Kasparov and chess That was a long time ago They are now seeing the market catch up with them One of the reasons that you dont see IBM talked about it as an AI company is that they dont do anything customer-facing They are doing things which make a lot of sense When you think about some of the issues with Chat GPT of providing like a ring fence around companys private data Allows it to interact with public data in AI without compromising that private data Its a really really interesting business Nice to see them get a bid Theyre at a multi-year high And by multi I mean many many year high I think it may be just the beginning for IBM Dylan Lewis: Bill I cant help but think back to the conversation we were having earlier about Microsoft and that lost period I think theres probably a younger generation of investors that have not had IBM on their radar at all because it has been during this very tough period for the business It sounds like youre saying maybe this is one that should be on peoples radar Bill Mann: I think it absolutely should be Look back and it wasnt that many years ago that the Fang acronym was invented and they left Microsoft off that was the biggest winner to me IBM has the potential and thats a really important word to be on the same trajectory as an Nvidia or a Microsoft A company that has been minding its business and not really in a wonderful way for a long time but they have actually been still building things while they were going they invested in R&D the entire time I think youre now starting to see a payoff Dylan Lewis: IBM saying hey I want to be a rock star Its your nickel back example there Bill Mann Andy Cross were going to see a little bit later in the show Up next weve got a rundown on why grocery stores are a bigger part of the retail picture Stay right here youre listening to Motley Fool Money Welcome back to Motley Fool Money Im Dylan Lewis As some of you are listening to this very radio show you might be out on the roads driving your car maybe passing a strip mall or shopping center and you might notice that the formula for retail has changed a bit in recent years Increasingly supermarkets and medical services are the features of the modern shopping center and thats partially the work of Jeffrey Edison Hes the co-founder and CEO of Philips Edison Company They are a real estate investment trust focused on retail with over 275 locations in 31 states Motley Fool Moneys Deidre Woollard caught up with Edison to understand the importance of necessity based goods in retail what consumers want right now both in terms of concepts and convenience and how foot traffic is trending in shopping centers Deidre Woollard: I want to talk about the journey of this company because you were in the private markets a long time Youve only been publicly traded since 2021 You came to the market in an interesting time How is being public changed the company or changed how you think about things if at all? Jeffrey Edison: Surprise I hate to date myself but weve been doing this for 30 years We started the business 30 years ago Bought a grocery anchored shopping center in Virginia and weve continued for a sustained period of time now 30 years staying in that business and developing what we think is the best team operating in that particular niche Our niche is we buy shopping centers that are anchored by the number 1 or 2 grocer and theyre in markets where the market supports not only the grocer which is about 35-40 percent of the space but also the small stores What weve targeted is that center where when somebody wakes up on a Saturday in the suburbs they go to get their necessity based goods They get their groceries they get their hair done they get their nails done maybe they get a workout in and get a smoothie We want to be the place near their home where they go to do that type of thing We continue to build this team over a sustained period of time You just started with friends and family and went into institutional funds and then got into the non traded at space raised equity there and we got to a size where being a listed public company and the access that gave us to capital was a logical next step in that process It really hasnt been a major change for us I mean weve been SEC filing for over 10 years so all the reporting stuff was all common stuff that weve done and were actually one of the only companies to come public where it was simpler from a reporting standpoint than it was before when we had multiple different groups Its been for us a journey but where were learning a lot about our new set of investors and how that and a lot of our investors have stayed with us over that period of time through that whole process and have been great supporters of us Those were almost all retail investors Now were much more involved with the institutional investors But our retail investors are still at a core ownership of the company Deidre Woollard: You mentioned big grocery stores one of the biggest ones has been involved in this merger Im talking about Kroger and Albertsons of course major tenant of yours We just found out that its going to be a little while longer before that merger takes place They pushed it back Does that new extended timeline have any impact on you or how are you thinking about that merger in general? Jeffrey Edison: I think in general if it happens it will be a positive impact on us because it will take a grocer that is going through other stuff and put them in a much more really strong financial position The market still is very reluctant to say whether its going to happen or not Albertsons trading 15 percent below where the strike price is on the merger The market which we look at pretty closely is still questioning whether theyre going to get SEC approval and what that process will go through These are really strong grocery locations where they will be grocery stores on a long term basis That improved capital that will come back with a Kroger ownership we think would have a positive impact on our overall portfolio Were Krogers largest landlord were Publics second largest landlord Were working with the grocers and have been now for 30 years on how their business works and where they can be successful Deidre Woollard: Interesting Well I listened to your investor day and one of the things that I heard you and the team talk about is medical Ive heard this from other red operators as well Tell us a little bit more about it What type of medical are you seeing? Are you seeing chains or local operators? Whats the story there? Jeffrey Edison: Retail is always changing and what a lot of people are realizing is that they have to do what the consumer wants and that is in all parts of retail Whats happening and we call it medtail Ln the medtail side is theyre seeing the advantages primarily on a cost basis but also on a convenience basis for the customer being closer to them Were seeing a wide variety of different medical uses coming into our shopping centers They are long term players who will be in our centers for a long term They bring additional convenience to the markets that were in Theyre an important part of our growth in Tennessee over time It includes everything from the chiropractor to the physical therapy to the dentist to urgent care All of those are part of that and some people are even including veterinary services for the animals in that medtail category Its a strong growing part of the demand for our shopping centers Deidre Woollard: Im wondering what foot traffic trends youve seen in the post pandemic time Certainly we always talk about the death of retail being overstated Have you seen a lot of return to your shopping centers? Jeffrey Edison: Yeah I think the days of that conversation are limited Its almost all being driven by two factors one the increased demand and the other the lack of new supply For the last 10 years theres been very little new retail product Theres been more destroyed retail than there has been a created retail What thats done its really limited the supply At the same time weve had a great operating environment for our suburban located centers Because if you look at suburbanization thats a trend that has continued which we think is very positive for us Working from home is a big part of that because people are around our centers more of the day Rather than being in the office and going down to have lunch theyll go to the shopping center and have lunch Thats been very positive for us Jeffrey Edison: Theres a sense of buying local which is our centers are great for 27 percent of our neighbors are local in nature and theyve been with us on average nine years in our centers These are bringing something unique to the merchandising mix of our center and an important part of why our centers have continued to operate at a really high level I think were 98 percent occupied today the highest level weve been at in the 30 year history Its a really positive operating by Those macro tailwinds are not short term I mean from our perspective we think theres going to continue to be suburbanization continue to be work from home continue to be migration to the sun belt All of those are long term trends and we believe that rents have to go up somewhere between 50 and 100 percent before really new development is economically warranted which is a major move Deidre Woollard: What do you think in terms of how tenants are using space? Weve seen so much change to curbside pick up and things like that Jeffrey Edison: The retailers are really good at what they do and theyre very good at reading where the consumer is Its very expensive to acquire new shoppers to your store so you dont want to lose any of your shoppers Because of that todays shopper wants an omnichannel approach to retail They want to be able to go and have BOPUS and pick it up at the store They want to go in and shop the store and they want to be able to order online and have it delivered to their house Our retailers have to have that omnichannel approach Its going to be long term successful from our opinion What weve done I think Ill get the numbers wrong a little bit but its like 90 percent of our grocers have BOPUS so that you can order it pick it up at the store and do it Its in the high 90s We have a front row to go which is our program where we have dedicated parking spaces for our small store spaces so they can get that Then weve had an extensive program of getting drive-throughs continuously added to our shopping center Again all the pieces that the consumer wants trying to create those for them Dylan Lewis: Listeners if you see something interesting related to investing while youre out in the world we want to hear about it Shoot any questions or ideas for show topics over to radio at Foolcom Coming up after the break Bill Mann and Andy Cross return with a couple of stocks on their radar Stay right here youre listening to Motley Fool Money As always people on the program may have interests in the stocks they talk about and the Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against Dont buy or sell anything based solely on what you hear Im Dylan Lewis joined again by Bill Mann and Andy Cross Weve got one more earning story before we get over to our radar stocks Andy its going to be a name that we dont talk about all the time on the show but I think its worth bringing up because some interesting results and some interesting insights and maybe to the future of streaming in what we saw from Comcast this week Andy Cross: Well in the news too after they hosted the Chiefs Bills playoff game on Peacock which was criticized a lot of course But when they decided to go purely with streaming but theres still 23 million viewers tuned into that That was a huge success and they talked a lot about that in the call I mean its $182 billion market cap company thats still smaller than Netflix is very interesting but still a very large company and many subscribers Of course the revenue was flat up 23 percent during the quarter EBITDA Theyre earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization flat Whats interesting though Dylan is that so much talk about the subscriber base The connected broadband subscribers were basically flat They continue to see people leave for video who dont want to have video and the phone But when you look at the broadband business and you look at their mobile business the mobile business actually is doing quite well Revenue with subscribers grew more than 20 percent in that quarter Broadband about flat What was really interesting is the Peacock that streaming platform that they have launched Revenues in Peacock was up 57 percent and hit 1 billion for the first time ever in a quarter The subscriber revenues were up 88 percent and advertising was up 50 percent If you back out some of the effects of the World Cup from last year so much talk about Peacock is that the future for Comcast it will be a big part of their growth is right now pretty much the only exciting part to the growth picture for Comcast But youve got a company that basically sells at 10-12 times earnings per share a middling grower stock not super exciting but also not super volatile If thats your interest Comcast might be worth it Dylan Lewis: I remember seeing the story that they had spent about $110 millions for the exclusive streaming rights to that playoff game Based on data we saw from Antenna they wound up with just under 3 million new subscribers during the days leading up to that game Do you feel like that was money well spent for Peacock? Andy Cross: I think it is If you just think again long term and the benefit and the more and more push toward streaming Their advertising business is strong on the streaming When you start looking at the investments theyre making in there and the experiences they have Of course with all the other advertising properties they have and with the theme parks and all that thing But making the right investments in Peacock and 23 million people viewing that That is an impressive number when you look at just the previous one of the other NFL games it was I think a second highest That game was on broadcast TV so this was just on Peacock Obviously well have to see the investments they make and will they ultimately pay out But I think from an initial go theres some excitement behind whats happening at Peacock Bill Mann: Was it actually an NFL game or was it actually just another Taylor site? Andy Cross: Yes exactly Now maybe if you X out the Chiefs and somebody else well have to see Dylan Lewis: That would be an incredibly captivating exclusive if they were able to get Taylor Swift exclusives I wouldnt be surprised if that drove three million sign-ups as well Andy Cross: I will say Peacock did lose $27 billion last year so they have a long way to go to catch up to the likes of Netflix But at least they are pushing aggressively into that streaming business Bill Mann: Thats one 200th of what China has lost Theyre in great shape Theyre fine To me ultimately its a sheriff eyeball They brought subscribers in Will those subscribers stick? It is only down to their willingness to continue to consume content from Peacock Andy Cross: Bill for folks watching the NFL games this weekend theres some splash around Peacock But also I think there are going to be a lot of ads for the sports betting sites DraftKings MGM and Caesars advertising heavily trying to get a lot of users a lot of new people acquired during this period Well have to wait until earnings to see if that pays off but what are some of your impressions seeing some of that? Bill Mann: I think its been a really fascinating five years for sports betting in the US Because you have gone from the major leagues keeping them at arms length Then all of a sudden like nudge nudge wink at arms length Now youre seeing things where ESPN is going to buy part of one of a betting network and NFL might buy part of ESPN Betting its not just that its here to stay but it is going to become a more and more integral part of the sports viewing experience for a lot of people I think Andy Cross: I think its going to be very hard for them to separate the egg whites and the egg yolk at a certain point it is going to be scrambled together Bill Mann: Thats a great allegory because I dont know how they would undo it if it does in fact impact competition Dylan Lewis: Lets get over to stocks on our radar Our man behind the glass Dan Boyd is going to hit you with a question Andy youre up first What are you looking at this? Andy Cross: Guys Im looking at Spotify ticker S-P-O-T Im sticking with the streaming theme here but turning more toward the ears rather than the eyes 226 million paying subscribers of about $11 per month which Im sure many of us are over 570 million total monthly active users They can access 100 million digital tracks 5 million accounting podcasts and thats a big part of what their business is A $41 billion market cap with almost 4 billion in cash and a little more than $12 billion of debt 88 percent of revenues come from those subscriptions But advertising is where some of the excitement is I know one thing were excited about they report earnings in a couple of weeks Im really interested to see what they are doing on the margin side They unfortunately had to go through some of those other layoffs we talked about They let go of a lot of people last year There was some excitement enthusiasm that might really boost the profitability Analysts are expecting profits this year so looking to see what Dan act and his team is saying about Spotify About the market the investments and the cost that theyve been able to save and how thats going to impact profits and margins Dylan Lewis: Dan a question about Spotify Dan Boyd: More of a comment about Spotify I hate their app I really do Its slow It sucks I dont love it but I still pay for it I think that says something about the company Dylan Lewis: It sure does Spotifys shareholders thank you for that Dan Dan Boyd: The hate listen is as good as a love listen Dylan Lewis: A shameless plug to our radio audience if you like Motley Fool Money Also available on Spotify as well as iTunes Wherever you get your podcasts Bill what is on your radar this week? Bill Mann: I want to talk about Mercado Libre There is something fascinating to me and this has been one of the most successful companies on the US exchanges over the last 20 years An absolute miraculous growth story in Latin America I say miraculous purposefully because their largest market has been Argentina Argentina is a long term disaster of an economy But they have a new president now Javier Milei who is saying that he wants to dollarize the economy That he wants Argentina to privatize a lot of their economy Its very heavily state owned Its going to be really interesting to see from Mercado Libres standpoint because if you think about it in some ways its an advantage for them to know how to operate in a basket case economy like Argentina If it becomes simpler to operate in Argentina does that help companies like Sea Limited who have been trying to come into Latin America if the ground becomes more simple? To me Mercado Libre has an opportunity but it has a little bit of risk wrapped up into it Dylan Lewis: Dan a question about Mercado Libre Dan Boyd: The stock has been a powerhouse over the last couple of years thats for sure But is the general strike that was called on Wednesday in Argentina going to be a problem looking forward Bill Mann: You said Wednesday?

Resolution","1/3/2024","https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/stocks/MSFT-Q/pressreleases/23087200/a-bull-market-is-coming-2-stock-split-stocks-to-buy-as-part-of-your-new-years-resolution/","The benchmark S&P 500 index plunged into a bear market in 2022 when it fell more than 20% from its all-time high But following a strong 2023 it recovered nearly all of that lost ground The index is on the cusp of setting a new record high which would mark the official beginning of a new bull market It only needs a gain of 05% to get there Data source: YCharts History suggests 2024 will likely be another positive year for the stock market which would practically guarantee the S&P 500 enters bull territory With that in mind heres why investors might want to begin the year with shares of the worlds two largest companies: Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) Microsoft was founded in 1975 as a software company and it went public in 1986 valued at $777 million After expanding into hardware gaming cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AI) over the last 48 years Microsoft amassed a valuation of $28 trillion It trails only Apple for the title of worlds largest company That significant value creation prompted Microsoft to execute nine stock splits since 1987 to ensure its shares remained accessible to small investors -- who might be grateful right now considering it soared 57% in 2023 doubling the return of the S&P 500 And 2024 could be another strong year as the company ramps up efforts to monetize its growing portfolio of AI products Management started 2023 with a bang when it agreed to invest $10 billion in top generative AI start-up OpenAI which is responsible for the ChatGPT chatbot Microsoft has since embedded that technology into its Windows operating system Edge internet browser Bing search engine Microsoft 365 document suite and Azure cloud computing platform Azure OpenAI Service allows businesses to access OpenAIs latest GPT-4 models to help them build their own AI applications The service started calendar year 2023 with just 200 customers but within nine months over 18000 organizations had signed up I anticipate that number will grow significantly this year as businesses race to embed AI into their operations to boost efficiency Microsoft is also running an early-access program for its ChatGPT-powered Copilot technology in Microsoft 365 applications Now businesses can harness the power of AI in Word Excel PowerPoint Outlook and Teams for $30 per employee per month The company says 40% of the Fortune 500 companies are participating in the early-access program including giants like Visa and KPMG According to Statista over 13 million companies use Microsoft 365 so the ability to charge them more for AI-enabled versions could be a seismic financial opportunity Microsofts fiscal 2024 will end on June 30 this year Wall Street analysts estimate the company will deliver $243 billion in revenue an increase of 148% year over year Its earnings per share are expected to jump 145% to $1124 It places the stock at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 335 which is a slight premium to the Nasdaq-100 technology index However the companys presence in AI might still warrant further gains Leading Wall Street technology analyst Dan Ives at Wedbush recently named Microsoft as his top pick and he thinks the stock could hit $450 in 2024 thanks to AI That implies an upside of almost 20% Image source: Getty Images Apple was founded in 1976 and it went public in 1980 valued at $18 billion It now generates that much in revenue every 40 hours and it became the first company in history to amass a $3 trillion valuation Like Microsoft it has created so much value that its management executed five stock splits since 1987 to keep its shares accessible to small investors The catalyst behind the bulk of Apples market value is the iPhone which was introduced in 2007 It has taken consumers on a journey packed with innovation like the smartphones high-resolution displays its camera technology and its app ecosystem But the latest iPhone 15 lineup sets the stage for what could be the next big value creator: on-device artificial intelligence The iPhone 15 is fitted with the Apple-designed A17 Pro processor which is the smartphone industrys first 3-nanometer chip Simply put the brain of the iPhone is now smaller faster and more efficient than ever Its neural engine which processes AI and machine-learning workloads delivers a twofold performance boost over its predecessor the A16 Bionic That allows the iPhone to manage AI workloads independently of the cloud or third-party computing services which many AI applications currently rely upon It will open the door to powerful advancements in features like the Siri voice assistant predictive text and Visual Lookup -- a camera tool capable of identifying faces plants and even famous landmarks However Apple is rumored to be working on its own large language models and even a generative AI application called Apple GPT Details remain scarce but imagine having a ChatGPT-style tool woven throughout every aspect of your iPhone processed using the devices own chip hardware The possibilities will be endless; it could craft your messages and emails or even create image and video content for you AI isnt the only area in which Apple is innovating Its gearing up to launch its new virtual reality headset the Vision Pro in the early part of this year Its priced at $3499 so it probably wont sell in high volumes initially but its Apples first new product category since it launched its watch in 2015 It gives developers an opportunity to build new gaming and entertainment experiences which could attract consumers to this new platform Wall Street estimates Apple will generate $396 billion in revenue in fiscal 2024 (ending Sept 30 2024) which would mark a gain of just 35% year over year While it sounds sluggish theres an even bigger force likely to keep Apple stock afloat: The company continues to return truckloads of money to shareholders It bought back $775 billion worth of its own stock in fiscal 2023 and paid out $15 billion in dividends Thats music to the ears of its largest investors which include Warren Buffett Apple has always been a long-term story It isnt very agile given its enormous size; its more like an aircraft carrier that takes time to maneuver But 2024 will likely be one of the companys most exciting years as it lays more groundwork for its AI initiatives and consumers interact with the Vision Pro

Learn More Tech stocks have skyrocketed since the start of last year The Nasdaq-100 index rose 67% in 2023 massively improving on the 40% plunge it took the year before An economic downturn in 2022 triggered a marketwide sell-off that affected countless tech stocks However Wall Street has grown bullish about the industry again thanks to a boom in artificial intelligence (AI) The launch of OpenAIs ChatGPT reinvigorated interest in AI and has been a leading growth driver in the tech markets recovery Data from Grand View Research shows the AI market hit nearly $200 billion last year and is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 37% through 2030 Alongside tailwinds from several other high-growth sectors like cloud computing virtual reality and more now is an excellent time to invest in tech As two of the biggest names in the industry Alphabet (GOOG -063%) (GOOGL -077%) and Microsoft (MSFT 097%) are attractive options These companies have reputations for delivering consistent gains over the long term and are investing heavily in AI So lets compare these two tech giants and determine whether Alphabet or Microsoft is the better tech stock right now Alphabet has become a tech behemoth attracting billions of users to products like Android YouTube Chrome and the many products under Google The popularity of these offerings has seen Alphabet snap up a leading 25% market share in the digital advertising market Advertising has become the companys biggest growth catalyst making up almost 80% of its total revenue However all eyes have been on the tech giants expanding AI efforts over the last year The company impressed toward the end of 2023 by debuting Gemini its large language model that looked likely to make Alphabet competitive against cloud rivals Microsoft and Amazon Yet the Google companys stock is down nearly 10% in the last month after a disappointing launch for Gemini Alphabet held a presentation for the new AI model recently when Gemini gave inaccurate depictions of historical figures and failed to recognize key differences between other prominent figures The blunders forced Alphabet to take its AI image services offline while it works out the kinks Despite recent headwinds Alphabet hit nearly $70 billion in free cash flow last year The company has a mountain to climb to get its AI tech on track and keep up with competitors but it is financially secure and has the funds to keep investing in its business Like Alphabet Microsoft is home to a range of highly potent brands including Windows Office Xbox Azure and LinkedIn The company has leading positions across tech with these brands granting it roles in operating systems productivity software cloud computing and even social media The companys shares are up 65% in the last 12 months and it recently surpassed Apple as the worlds most valuable company with its market cap currently at just over $3 trillion Microsoft has won over investors by becoming one of the biggest players in AI Heavy investment in ChatGPT developer OpenAI led to a lucrative partnership and access to some of the most advanced AI models in the industry The Windows company has used OpenAIs technology to introduce AI features across its product lineup In 2023 Microsoft added new AI tools to its Azure cloud platform integrated aspects of ChatGPT into its Bing search engine and boosted productivity in its Office software suite by adding AI features Microsoft achieved more than $67 billion in free cash flow last year highlighting the businesss reliability and value as a long-term investment Alphabet and Microsoft each hold dominating positions in tech and are likely to prove assets to any portfolio over the long term However earnings per share estimates show Microsoft might have slightly more stock growth potential than Alphabet in the near term Data by YCharts This table shows Microsofts earnings could hit nearly $16 per share over the next two fiscal years while Alphabets may reach close to $9 per share When multiplying those figures by the companies forward price-to-earnings ratios (Microsofts 35 and Alphabets 20) you get a stock price of $546 for Microsoft and $182 for Alphabet Considering their current positions these projections would see Microsofts share price rise 32% and Alphabets 30% by fiscal 2026 The differences arent substantial However Microsofts higher growth potential and a more reliable position in AI make it the better tech stock over Alphabet right now Suzanne Frey an executive at Alphabet is a member of The Motley Fools board

resources and more Learn More Microsoft (MSFT 097%) is back on top of the tech world these days but its easy to forget that the company was left in the hinterlands for much of this century While Microsoft was an early pioneer in personal computing with operating systems like DOS and then Windows it missed the mobile transition falling behind Apple after the iPhone was released A decade ago Microsoft was regarded as a laggard in technology known for a lack of innovation and underperforming the stock market though it continued to generate profits from its entrenched personal computing and enterprise software ecosystem However its legacy of underperformance changed when Satya Nadella took over as CEO nearly 10 years ago on Feb 4 2014 Image source: Getty Images Nadella overhauled Microsoft philosophically and strategically He ended the companys war against Apple allowing Microsoft Office products to be used on Apple devices Nadella also invested heavily in Microsoft Azure the companys cloud infrastructure business which has grown to become the companys biggest profit driver Azure is now the second-largest cloud infrastructure business behind Amazon Web Services though its growing significantly faster than its larger rival The Microsoft chief has made key acquisitions like LinkedIn GitHub and Activision Blizzard diversifying the company and strengthening its pipeline upstream and downstream in areas like advertising and open-source code development However Nadellas biggest coup now seems to be the partnership he forged with OpenAI of which Microsoft now owns nearly 50% That partnership has made Microsoft a leader in generative artificial intelligence (AI) and OpenAIs technology has been incorporated across a range of products including Azure its Office software suite Bing search and others Thats helped make Microsoft a winner in 2023 and since Nadella took over the stock gained 934% outperforming the S&P 500 by a wide margin as the chart below shows MSFT data by YCharts According to those results $10000 invested in Microsoft when Nadella took the helm would now be worth $123000 with dividends reinvested or $103400 without dividends That would give you a compound annual return of 29% with dividends reinvested or 27% without which is roughly triple the historical average of the S&P 500 with dividends reinvested Thats a pretty stellar track record over a decade By comparison Microsoft stock increased just 34% in the decade before then which compared to a 55% gain in the S&P 500 as that decade included the crash during the financial crisis Nadellas record as Microsofts CEO shows the power of a CEO to breathe new life into a company The CEO is ultimately responsible for corporate strategy capital allocation and other key decisions and a bad CEO like predecessor Steve Ballmer can be equally damaging Leadership could be especially important these days in the tech industry as the AI revolution takes off Though each company competing in the generative AI race comes with a different set of strengths the choices and investments that CEOs like Satya Nadella are making could make a difference in billions of profits over the long term Nadella has also succeeded in making Microsoft much more resilient than it was a decade ago thanks to the growth of its Azure cloud infrastructure business the integration of its Office suite in Apple products and acquisitions like LinkedIn and GitHub That diversification also gives the company an advantage over its big tech rivals as it can deploy new generative AI across a wide range of products Microsoft stock jumped more than 50% in 2023 and its valuation has gotten a bit expensive at a price-to-earnings ratio of 36 However Microsoft executed effectively in 2023 and it strengthened its competitive advantages by incorporating its new AI Copilot into a wide range of products including its office productivity software Demand for those products should continue to ramp up in 2024 and Microsoft investors are in good hands with Nadella -- especially as the company continues to leverage its partnership with OpenAI which also gives it an edge in AI Although the stock might be pricey Microsofts stock still looks like a smart buy in 2024 John Mackey former CEO of Whole Foods Market an Amazon subsidiary is a member of The Motley Fool’s board of directors Jeremy

ADDITIONAL BENEFITS Connect With Us Get BusinessLine apps on By K V Kurmanath Comments READ LATER On February 4 ten years ago Satya Nadella took charge as the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Microsoft The company was at cross roads It lost its rhythm over the year and was unable to keep pace with the radically transforming technology space Google Apple and Amazon the tech companies much younger to it were on a growth trajectory Amazon primarily an e-commerce company made giant strides in the cloud space while Google could further cement its position in the digital space and Apple became a rage globally with its phones and tabs The company which turned 40 in 2014 made an attempt to find some space in the phone segment Its multi-billion dollar acquisition of Nokia’s phone business failed The Office suite was found to be too restrictive as its users were unable to get a seamless experience Nadella made some quick decisions as he took over the Redmond (US)-based tech giant The $76 billion acquisition of Nokia’s phone business was written off within a year after his taking over as the CEO It meant heavy job losses Admitting that the job losses were painful Nadella defended the decision Consequently LinkedIn the professional networking site was acquired Gaming company Minecraft which has huge application in sectors like education construction and technology was also added to the portfolio The company turned its focus on the cloud Though a late start Microsoft invested heavily under his leadership and emerged as a key cloud player globally Nadella saw opportunity in AI too The company invested in OpenAI the US-based startup that wowed the world with its Large Language Model (LLM) solution ChatGPT Being a majority stakeholder in the startup Microsoft has launched ‘CoPilot’ and is integrating it across all its platforms offering its customers the power of an LLM Nadella wrote the book ‘Hit Refresh’ a kind of autobiography of his self and the company post 2014 Nadella initiated a strategic shift in the company’s business emphasising a Mobile-First and Cloud-First’ approach focusing on expanding the cloud business The tech behemoth initiated collaborations with startups As he focussed on rebuilding the company culture he fostered a growth mindset and emphasised on the importance of customer obsession diversity and inclusivity “The reason I talk about empathy is that I believe this is the leading indicator of success Innovation comes only when you are able to meet unmet unarticulated needs—and this comes from a deep sense of empathy we all have” Nadella articulates “But you can’t go to work and say “turn on the empathy button” Your life’s experience will give you that passion and understanding for a particular customer a particular use case How you can connect (your life experience) to your work is what we want to invoke in the 100000 people who work at Microsoft” he says B Ashok Director of Applied Sciences and Engineering at Microsoft Research in Bengaluru says the last 10 years have been completely different “Nadella brought in a completely new culture in the company with a focus on collaboration and openness One of the first strategic moves he made was to make Microsoft Office suite available on iOS and Android platformsand offering Office on subscription model” Joined a little ahead of Satya in Microsoft Ashok who’s better known as Bash said that Nadella ensured all of the top executives received Non-Violent Communication training (a communication technique advocated by Marshall Rosenberg) He did away with ‘precision questioning’ which was designed to try and destroy the ideas proposed and encouraged a different way of questioning that promoted creative ideas “Another key aspect that he brought in was a growth mindset a learn-it-all attitude as opposed to a fixed mindset or a know-it-all attitude” he said These changes are evident in the way the company operates today As it completes 50 years in 2025 the company faces fresh challenges The New York Times which filed a case against OpenAI over copyright issues has made Microsoft too a respondent The company needs to find an answer to this question as it is actively integrating the Co-Pilot across all of its products and services The copyright petition could open a Pandora’s box as there is a chance that more and more content-led organisations might seek part of the revenues from LLM companies It also faces serious challenges in the cloud space and nimble-footed startups that are coming up with productivity and collaboration solutions challenging its leadership Comments BACK TO TOP Comments have to be in English and in full sentences They cannot be abusive or personal Please abide by our community guidelines
