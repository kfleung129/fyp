0,"Navigating Market Uncertainty: Intrinsic Value of NVIDIA Corp","1 Jan 2024","https://finance.yahoo.com/news/navigating-market-uncertainty-intrinsic-value-110120049.html","In this article we will take a look into NVIDIA Corps (NASDAQ:NVDA) DCF analysis a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with NVDA As of 2024-01-01 NVIDIA Corps intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $27906 Its currently trading at a price of $49526 Therefore the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -7747% The company is modestly overvalued The GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage In the growth stage the company is experiencing faster growth while in the terminal stage a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run NVIDIA Corps intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps Term Value Explanation EPS without NRI $811 GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow Discount Rate 10% An appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 387% rounded up to the nearest whole number which is 4% A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate Growth Stage Growth rate (g1) = 3430% Years of Growth Stage = 10 We choose the growth rate based on the availability prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10 5 or 3 years in that order and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate The default growth period is set to 10 years Terminal Stage Growth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10 For the terminal stage the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation Growth Stage = EPS without NRI * [ (1 + g1) / (1 + d) * (1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2 + + (1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ] = 28503 Terminal Stage = EPS without NRI * (1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 * [ (1 + g2) / (1 + d) + (1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2 + + (1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ] = 44412 Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based) = Growth Stage + Terminal Stage = 27906 GuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $24169 This valuation indicates that the NVIDIA Corp is significantly overvalued accompanied by a margin of safety of -10492% You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page Please note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model: Future Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings Embracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role All else being equal a company with rapid growth will have a higher value Predictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance For companies with unpredictable performance such as cyclical companies the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized Discount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate Using the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based) To identify undervalued predictable companies focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based) This article generated by GuruFocus is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice Our commentary is rooted in historical data and analyst projections utilizing an impartial methodology and is not intended to serve as specific investment guidance It does not formulate a recommendation to purchase or divest any stock and does not consider individual investment objectives or financial circumstances Our objective is to deliver long-term fundamental data-driven analysis Be aware that our analysis might not incorporate the most recent price-sensitive company announcements or qualitative information GuruFocus holds no position in the stocks mentioned herein This article first appeared on GuruFocus Related Quotes"

3,"Forget Nvidia: 2 Fantastic Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Instead","3/3/2024","https://finance.yahoo.com/news/forget-nvidia-2-fantastic-artificial-120000182.html?ref=upstract.com","Putting aside Nvidia is practically impossible considering nearly every large technology company in America seems to be racing to buy its data center chips designed to process artificial intelligence (AI) workloads Plus Nvidia stock was the best performer in the S&P 500 index in 2023 with a 239% gain and its already up another 61% in 2024 But the AI industry is expanding quickly and a number of other opportunities warrant attention so lets forget Nvidia for a moment Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ: PANW) is the worlds largest cybersecurity company and its applying AI across its product portfolio to deliver advanced protection against modern threats DigitalOcean (NYSE: DOCN) on the other hand is an under-the-radar cloud services provider emerging as an on-ramp to the AI revolution for small and mid-size businesses Heres why investors might do well to buy both stocks right now Cyberthreats are a growing concern in the corporate world Data breaches not only have severe financial consequences but they also shatter the trust between companies and their customers Attacks are increasing in sophistication with each passing year and malicious actors are even using tools like generative AI to trick employees into handing over sensitive information through realistic phishing emails and phone calls Automation has never been more important to cybersecurity because its impossible to train every employee within an organization to be an expert Palo Alto Networks says 93% of security operations centers still rely on manual human-led processes and the workload is so heavy that 23% of security incidents are left uninvestigated That creates enormous vulnerabilities Palo Alto offers three cybersecurity platforms addressing cloud security network security and security operations Its weaving AI into all of them including its new Cortex XSIAM security operations product For one customer it resolves up to 90% of security incidents autonomously with no human input required XSIAM was released a little over one year ago and it has already amassed a sales pipeline worth $1 billion Palo Alto is the worlds largest cybersecurity company and it plans to use that scale to crush its competitors Many large organizations use cybersecurity tools from multiple providers based on their needs but Palo Alto wants its customers to ditch competing products in favor of using its products exclusively To achieve this Palo Alto will offer customers lengthy fee-free periods so they can integrate its software at no cost which should encourage them to make the switch once their contracts are up with competing providers A customer who uses all three of Palo Altos platforms gets a lifetime value 40 times greater than a customer using just one so this could drive significant long-term growth On the other hand this strategy will lead to a short-term dip in Palo Altos revenue and billings growth which is why its stock suffered a sharp fall recently and now trades 16% below its all-time high Nevertheless the company still forecasts record revenue of up to $8 billion in fiscal 2024 (ending July 31) Therefore the dip in its stock price might be a great entry point for long-term investors Once Palo Alto begins reaping the rewards of its strategy it could unlock a new phase of growth The worlds largest cloud platforms like Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure are spending billions of dollars to build data centers for AI development mainly using chips from Nvidia While they are focused on serving large organizations and cashed-up AI developers DigitalOcean is making sure small and medium-sized businesses arent left behind DigitalOcean is a provider of cloud services that help these businesses store data host websites and develop software It offers cheap and transparent pricing highly personalized service and mountains of educational material to help customers maximize their output Its an ideal platform for start-ups and businesses with less than 500 employees that cant afford in-house technical teams to manage their cloud infrastructure Last year DigitalOcean spent $111 million to acquire Paperspace a data center operator focused on delivering AI infrastructure at affordable prices It offers the latest graphics processing units (GPUs) -- including the industry-leading H100 from Nvidia -- up to 70% cheaper than Microsoft Azure Paperspace charges customers by the second with no lock-in contracts and its narrow business model allows it to maintain a slim cost structure compared to the cloud giants Those features lead to lower prices for the end user DigitalOcean estimates its opportunity in the small and medium-sized business cloud services industry will be worth $114 billion in 2024 which could swell to $213 billion by 2027 However AI could dramatically expand that addressable market into the trillions of dollars considering Wall Street predicts the technology could add somewhere between $7 trillion and $200 trillion to the global economy in the coming decade DigitalOcean could soon become the go-to platform for these businesses who want to access AI At the end of 2023 the company had only $730 million in annual recurring revenue so it has barely scratched the surface of its addressable market let alone the AI opportunity DigitalOcean stock remains 71% below its all-time high which was set during the tech frenzy of 2021 Its valuation was a little unrealistic back then but the steep drop may give investors a great long-term entry point Should you invest $1000 in Palo Alto Networks right now?

If it does its earnings will skyrocket alongside the growth of AI But even if it loses some market share the AI market will boom for years For those keeping track that just leaves two final members of the magnificent seven Apple Inc – the world’s largest company by market capitalisation – consistently delivers solid returns: 162 per cent over the past two years by my calculations At the other end of the scale social media company Meta (owner of Facebook Instagram Threads and WhatsApp) is the only one of the group to have shown an essentially flat stock market performance over the past two years Although Meta’s revenues and earnings have consistently beaten expectations this year the threat of anti-trust legislation in the US and Europe hangs over the company as does an advertising market that is bottoming out Both of these issues could harm Meta’s revenue outlook next year So the magnificent seven have all survived to ride out of town at the end of 2023 but it’s as clear as a tumbleweed rolling down a deserted main street that not all of them are in for a leisurely horseback ride through 2024 Saddle up partners!

Brands (NYSE:YUM) — the owner of KFC Respectively these companies have a current P/E ratio of 2616 5409 and 2484 while all operate a market cap of over $36 billion Meanwhile Wingstop’s current P/E ratio is a staggering 11186 and operates at a low market cap of $7586 billion Its basic EPS of 230 is considered low compared to the rest of these companies Perhaps WING is worth its high valuation but as the world moves towards healthier food options Wingstop and its current menu may lose momentum As a result this stock is very compelling to sell Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is an American semiconductor company and a leading global manufacturer of high-end GPUs for gaming cryptocurrency mining and professional applications as well as chip systems for use in vehicles robotics and other tools NVDA stock is up 24594% YTD and has maintained its historical growth “The global technology market size was valued at $80207 million in 2021 and is expected to expand at a CAGR of 2573% during the forecast period reaching $316813 million by 2027” NVDA’s revenue of $1812 billion grew 20551% YoY and its diluted EPS of $371 grew 127407% YoY — both beating expectations by strong margins Strong financial growth is further evident in a 5101% net profit margin which grew 34473% YoY and an income of $924 billion up 125926% YoY Although NVDA stock was one of the stocks with the best growth in 2023 it must address several challenges to maintain the momentum Nvidia’s pricing power will likely decline mainly due to next year’s expected GPU scarcity in AI-accelerated data centers In addition to that US regulators placed limitations on high-powered GPU exports to China potentially resulting in billions in lost revenue per quarter Yahoo! Finance reported that 46 analysts predicted a mean 1-year price target of $64123 spanning from as low as $43900 to as high as $110000 It wouldn’t be surprising if demand for Nvidia’s GPUs failed to meet lofty expectations Investors should make their decisions before it’s too late IonQ (NYSE:IONQ) is a quantum computing hardware and software company It is an early mover into the quantum computing market and is working with Amazon Web Services Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure to provide cloud-based access to its servers However there are many underlying issues with this partnership IonQ is up 283% YTD and has been one of the best-performing stocks this year However its financials aren’t that strong The company has consistently missed earnings estimates for the past three quarters and has a current operating margin of -68765% That indicates a lack of profitability and earning potential On paper IonQ is promising having partnered with industry heavyweights in this sector However it is important to note that other companies too are in direct competition Azure hosts four other companies along with itself as quantum computing providers Other competitors include the PASQAL group founded and led by Nobel Prize laureate Dr Alain Aspect When coupled with industry leaders IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG NASDAQ:GOOGL) IonQ’s outlook is bleak IonQ is competing with companies with decades of experience greater financial strength and intellectual firepower While it is certainly possible its early entrance may be an advantage competition will only increase over the next few years Impressive YTD growth and bearish prospects for the upcoming years make IonQ a stock that investors should consider selling especially as the quantum-computing market gets saturated On the date of publication Michael Que did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer subject to the InvestorPlacecom Publishing Guidelines The researchers contributing to this article did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article Michael Que is a financial writer with extensive experience in the technology industry with his work featured on Seeking Alpha Benzinga and MSN Money He is the owner of Que Capital a research firm that combines fundamental analysis with ESG factors to pick the best sustainable long-term investments Article printed from InvestorPlace Media https://investorplacecom/2023/12/3-stocks-to-sell-before-2023-momentum-cools-off-completely/ ©2024 InvestorPlace Media LLC Market Analysis Stocks to Buy Market Analysis Crypto & Blockchain Hot Stocks Stocks to Buy Todays Market Crypto & Blockchain Financial Market Data powered by FinancialContent Services Inc All rights reserved Nasdaq quotes delayed at least 15 minutes all others at least 20 minutes Copyright © 2024 InvestorPlace Media LLC All rights reserved 1125 N Charles St Baltimore MD 21201 Not Yet a Premium Subscriber?

access to our top analyst recommendations in-depth research investing resources and more Learn More Nvidia (NVDA 118%) is the undisputed leader in artificial intelligence (AI) semiconductor hardware Its H100 and upcoming H200 data-center graphics chips (GPUs) set the standard for processing AI workloads giving the company a market share as high as 90% in 2023 But Advanced Micro Devices (AMD -058%) has emerged as a worthy competitor Its new MI300 series of AI data center chips is now widely available and some of the worlds largest technology companies and leading AI developers are lining up to buy them AI is about to expand beyond the data center and AMD has a fresh lineup of AI chips for personal computers and devices that will help developers place AI at the fingertips of billions of people worldwide Heres why AMD stock is a great place for investors to park their money in 2024 (and beyond) AMD just released its financial data for the fourth quarter and full-year 2023 (ended Dec 31) and the company provided several updates on its slate of AI products The MI300 was top of mind for investors as AMD is looking to snatch data-center market share away from Nvidia The MI300 comes in two configurations The MI300X is a pure GPU whereas the MI300A combines GPU and central processing unit (CPU) chips to create the worlds first accelerated processing unit (APU) for data centers The MI300A is the configuration of choice for the new El Capitan supercomputer at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) which will be the fastest in the world when it comes online later this year AMD shipped the majority of El Capitans MI300A chips in the fourth quarter with the remaining chips going out in the current quarter The MI300 is attracting a number of high-profile customers not only because of its performance but also because data center operators are trying to diversify their infrastructure as Nvidia continues to suffer supply constraints Microsoft Oracle and Meta Platforms are just a few of the tech leaders that have become MI300 customers While AMD is admittedly chasing Nvidia in the data center segment AMD has a 90% market share in AI-enabled personal computers Its Ryzen 7000 series -- otherwise known as Ryzen AI -- CPUs for computers are designed to handle AI workloads on-device meaning the user wont have to rely on a cloud or external data center to run advanced generative AI applications which leads to a faster more seamless experience To date millions of personal computers have shipped with Ryzen AI chips but AMD is about to launch a new processor that could be more than three times faster That will likely extend the companys advantage in this space even further Investors were slightly disappointed with AMDs latest financial report The companys fourth-quarter revenue came in at $617 billion which beat expectations but it forecast $54 billion in revenue for the upcoming first quarter of 2024 which fell short of the $57 billion Wall Street predicted AMD stock dropped 7% following the report but I think thats an opportunity for investors to swoop in and buy Thats because the fourth quarter revealed a significant growth acceleration in some of AMDs core segments Its data center revenue came in at a record-high $23 billion a 38% increase year over year The same line item was flat in the third quarter (ended Sept 30) The acceleration was attributed in part to significant growth in demand for data center GPUs -- in other words AI But it gets better AMD had previously forecast that the new MI300 series GPUs would contribute $2 billion to the companys total data center revenue in 2024 but it just revised that guidance significantly higher to $35 billion A strong customer pool with expanding engagements was the reason and given the feverish demand for AI processing power I wouldnt be surprised if that number was revised higher again during 2024 Furthermore AMDs Client segment (home to the Ryzen AI series of chips) delivered $15 billion in revenue a 62% year-over-year increase The company expects the strength in that segment to continue following the launch of its next generation of hardware this year AI is offsetting some of the weakness in other parts of AMDs business The company saw a drop in its gaming revenue during the fourth quarter for example mainly because we have moved past the launch phase of flagship consoles like Sonys PlayStation 5 which means sales will gradually continue to slow Image source: Getty Images AMD went through a challenging period during 2022 as inflation and interest rates soared leading to a slowdown in demand from consumers for big-ticket electronics It caused a supply glut for the chip sector which also carried into 2023 and heavily affected AMDs bottom line The company delivered $265 in adjusted earnings per share for the year down 24% compared to 2022 That places AMD stock at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 633 For context the iShares Semiconductor ETF trades at a P/E of just 319 which means AMD stock is almost twice as expensive as its industry peers However Wall Streets consensus estimate suggests AMD will return to growth in 2024 and deliver $367 in earnings per share which would shrink its P/E to 455 Then looking out to 2025 AMD could deliver $550 in earnings which would shrink its P/E to just 303 (assuming its stock price remained constant) The high estimate for that year is $905 which would result in a P/E of just 185 The point Im making is that AMD stock looks cheaper the further into the future you look and the company might even obliterate Wall Streets estimates with the help of AI Investors need only examine Nvidias performance lately: That company is wrapping up its fiscal 2024 year right now and its revenue and earnings are expected to have soared by 118% and 368% respectively Im not suggesting AMD will replicate Nvidias remarkable results (particularly the tripling of its stock price last year) but the strength in demand for AI is unmistakable and many of Nvidias top clients are already exploring AMDs MI300 series Plus AMD appears to have most of the AI-enabled personal computing market to itself right now Regardless of AMDs currently elevated valuation I think investors would do well to buy the stock as long as they can hold for three years or more The longer the better Randi Zuckerberg a

23,"Investors Bought This Hyper-Growth Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Hand Over Fist in 2023 Will It Split Its Shares in","1 Jan 2024","https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-bought-hyper-growth-artificial-190500249.html","It would be difficult to not mention Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) when recapping the stock markets 2023 The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and Nvidias triple-digit surge are arguably among 2023s leading headlines By the end of December Nvidia had rocketed to roughly $500 per share a steep price for many investors who want to buy whole shares Will the stock split in 2024 and bring down the price of a full share? Should that affect whether investors should continue buying shares? Here is what you need to know Predicting a stock split isnt rocket science and some clues point to it happening soon with Nvidia The company has a history of splitting its stock which is when a company multiplies or divides its share count without changing overall market capitalization So if the number of shares goes up the value per share goes down Nvidias most recent split came in 2021 Shares were trading at $744 before the split Nvidia isnt yet at such a high share price but its getting within shouting distance at $500 Before 2021 Nvidia split its stock four other times between 2000 and 2007 Shares rose 334% over those seven years I think management likes to keep the share price palatable for most investors The rapid growth of AI in 2023 has also established a growth narrative around Nvidia that could stretch well into the future In other words Nvidias fundamentals seem destined to carry the stock higher over the coming years and that makes me think a Nvidia stock split is a matter of when and not if Investors must understand what stock splits do and dont do Splits reduce the trading price of a share of stock This makes it cheaper to own a piece of that business but a split doesnt fundamentally affect a stocks value It creates a lower share price by splitting the stock into more pieces (shares) For example suppose you want some pie You go to the store and see a pie worth $40 selling as two halves for $20 each You dont want to pay $20 for pie so you ask the store to cut the halves to divide the pie into four quarters selling for $10 each In that case youre paying $10 for pie but getting a smaller piece Stock splits work the same way The company is worth the same but investors are paying a smaller share price for a smaller piece of the business the stock represents Thats not necessarily bad but remember that stock splits dont change fundamental value only the share price Investors who cant afford a full share could also check out buying fractional shares Investors should buy Nvidia if they like where its business is going not because of anything management does with share count The good news is that Nvidia looks like a great long-term buy It is the overwhelming market leader in AI chips which are being put in massive data centers to process intense computing workloads Revenue in the companys most recent quarter was up 200% from the year-ago quarter Analysts are predicting long-term earnings growth averaging 42% annually Despite its massive run in 2023 the stock trades at a forward P/E of just 40 The resulting price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of just 1 signals that the stock is a bargain assuming long-term growth estimates materialize No stock is risk-free Competition will surely come for Nvidia and hitting growth estimates isnt a sure thing But if investors intend to hold for the long term they should be rewarded Should you invest $1000 in Nvidia right now?

REUBEN ROY: Yeah its a great question And thanks for having me So we put out our trends report-- the tech team at Stifel yesterday And top 10 trends-- we do this every year And really it was about AI not surprisingly But it was more about the broadening of AI Last year it was a lot about NVIDIA and GPU clusters and this massive dollars being spent by the cloud service providers on building out training networks But when you look past that-- AI servers AI PCs-- theres a lot of AI innovation and applications coming behind right? And when we looked at all the companies that could potentially benefit guess what NVIDIA ticks all the boxes right? So NVIDIA is still playing in the clusters we think Theres still going to be an investment cycle continuing for AI training clusters But when you look beyond that we do think that if you think about AI servers that are going to be doing the next step of AI-- so were training last year training this year then inference Where are we going to make the money? Where are the ROIs going to come from? And NVIDIA ticks those boxes So we think its going to be a good year Numbers went up massively last year But there are different layers of NVIDIAs AI strategy Youve got the chips the hardware which is the biggest piece but then theres networking behind it that networks all of these clusters together And probably the most important piece that I think investors really will start thinking about this year is software And NVIDIA came up with a software stack CUDA that is the ecosystem of AI right now And if you look at Apple and iOS the way were thinking about it is if you can win the developer youre going to win the hardware And so I think thats what the next stage of the NVIDIA story for this year is going to be Related Quotes"

Stock","3/3/2024","https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cathie-woods-ark-invest-selling-195800197.html?ref=mc.news","Cathie Wood is the founder and chief investment officer at Ark Invest an asset management company focused on disruptive innovation Ark manages several thematic index funds built around burgeoning technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) but the firm continued to sell down its position in Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) throughout February That may strike readers as strange given that Nvidia graphics processing units are synonymous with AI infrastructure But the stock has advanced 236% over the past year so Ark is taking profits and reinvesting capital into other AI companies For instance the firm bought shares of Pinterest (NYSE: PINS) throughout February The social media company now accounts for a little more than 1% of Arks $14 billion portfolio Heres what investors should know Pinterest reported mixed financial results for the fourth quarter Global monthly active users (MAUs) increased 11% to 498 million and average revenue per user (ARPU) increased 2% to $200 Wall Street analysts anticipated slightly slower MAU growth but slightly faster ARPU growth As a result Pinterest missed top-line estimates Revenue increased 12% to $981 million but Wall Street was looking for $991 million Despite that shortfall the company beat bottom-line estimates due to effective expense management GAAP net income reached $201 million in the fourth quarter up from $17 million in the prior year Pinterest shares declined about 10% following the release of the report and the stock is still 60% below the record high it reached in early 2021 But the company is executing on a sensible growth strategy by investing in artificial intelligence (AI) and partnering with third-party advertisers Those moves could create value for patient shareholders in the years ahead Pinterest operates a social media platform that lets users explore and curate visual content to discover new products and ideas Its monthly user base trails that of Meta Platforms Facebook and Instagram ByteDances TikTok and Snaps Snapchat but Pinterest still ranks among the 15 largest ad tech companies in the world That positioning is a product of its ability to collect consumer data and influence shopping decisions and ongoing investments in AI help make that possible In the first quarter Pinterest CEO Bill Ready said: Nearly a year ago we began moving to next-gen AI capabilities enabling us to use recommender models that were 100x larger than before We combined our first-party proprietary data with our AI-based computer vision and search technologies to improve perceived relevance for recommendations on related pins driving perceived relevance up by nearly 10 points from a year ago to 94% In the fourth quarter Pinterest added generative AI search guides to help users refine queries and take action (make purchases) more easily It also debuted an AI-powered organization feature that automates content curation for users Management says those innovations create a powerful flywheel Specifically Pinterests ability to make relevant recommendations improves as user engagement improves simply because engagement creates data the company can feed into its machine learning models In addition to AI innovation Pinterest has partnered with Amazon and Alphabets Google to bring third-party advertising to its platform Specifically Amazon ads are live in the US on Pinterest search and the home feed and Google ads are live in international markets Those partnerships let Pinterest tap advertising demand beyond its own ecosystem and its partnership with Amazon in particular makes it easier for users to buy products they see on the platform Going forward digital ad spending is projected to grow at 15% annually through 2030 according to Grand View Research How quickly Pinterest grows depends on its ability to generate demand among advertisers which itself depends on its ability to engage users with relevant content and drive desirable outcomes for brands On that front management is making sensible decisions that could lead to market share gains Wall Street expects Pinterest to grow sales at 15% annually over the next five years so that consensus estimate leaves room for upside if the company does indeed gain share In either case its current valuation of 82 times sales seem reasonable As a caveat Pinterest faces tough competition from larger more popular social networks that could siphon advertising dollars away from its platform But unlike Pinterest those competing platforms are not purpose-built for product discovery In other words Pinterest is undoubtedly an underdog but it also has unique strengths that could make it more effective in driving social commerce If the company harnesses that potential it could create substantial value for patient shareholders Investors comfortable with that risk should consider buying a small position in

31,"Which Magnificent Seven Stocks Are Screaming Buys Right Now?","1 Jan 2024","https://finance.yahoo.com/news/magnificent-seven-stocks-screaming-buys-123000871.html","The Magnificent Seven stocks dominated the market in 2023 The worst performer in the group Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) rose 49% and the best Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) jumped nearly 240% But with such strong runs behind them do any of them have room left to grow in 2024? The answer: Yes and some are still worth buying at their current prices Im breaking the seven up into buy sell and hold groups Starting with the sell set I think Apple and Nvidias stock prices far outpaced their businesses Nvidias 2023 success has been spurred on by the artificial intelligence (AI) arms race and its business has responded in kind In its fiscal 2024 third quarter (which ended Oct 29) revenue rose 206% year over year Furthermore management guided for $20 billion in fiscal Q4 revenue up 231% The stocks movement was warranted given the companys sales growth but Im concerned that investors are forgetting that Nvidia operates in a cyclical industry Nvidia goes through boom and bust cycles and right now is certainly a boom However its unknown how many AI data centers will need to be built in the near to medium term If demand for its high-powered chips is satisfied shortly the stock may come crashing back down to earth Plus its trading at 65 times earnings -- a quite expensive premium From a business standpoint Apple is the opposite of Nvidia Its sales declined throughout 2023 Even so its stock skyrocketed This makes little sense and more headwinds are coming up: a US International Trade Commission order this month forced Apple to halt the import and sale of some Apple Watches due to a patent dispute (although a court ruling temporarily allowed sales to resume) With all this in mind 2024 could be a tough year for the company And considering that Apple stock has a higher valuation than Magnificent Seven members Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) it doesnt make a lot of sense to own it compared to its peers I view Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) as holds currently Microsoft had a strong year as its revenues and earnings per share (EPS) steadily rose However Microsoft trades at a steep premium even on a forward earnings basis Microsoft is executing well but its valuation is a bit too much from a historical perspective to consider buying Still its far from a sell Tesla is one of the hardest companies to value on Wall Street as its valuation is wrapped up in expectations for future products Its also set to face some added headwinds Starting in 2024 some Tesla models will only qualify for half of the $7500 federal EV tax credit due to where the automaker sources materials for their batteries and where it produces them When judging whether any given moment is a better time to buy or sell Tesla stock I like to look at its price-to-earnings and price-to-sales ratio compared to historical trends For Tesla these are trading roughly near the midpoint of valuations seen since mid-2022 Im taking a wait-and-see approach to Tesla stock heading into the new year as the stock doesnt look like a bargain at these prices That leaves Alphabet Meta Platforms and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) in the buy now category These stocks trade at reasonable levels and are expecting strong tailwinds next year Even though Alphabet and Meta have AI investments they are mostly advertising businesses In 2022 and 2023 the advertising market was fairly weak as companies pulled back on their marketing spending due to fears that a recession was coming However now that we have lapped that pullback Alphabet and Meta are posting meaningful growth in their advertising businesses Their ad revenues grew by 9% and 24% respectively in Q3 Next year should be another strong recovery year for advertising which will boost both companies Amazon has also had a strong 2023 with its margins rising However this chart doesnt tell the full story as this takes into account Amazons profits over the past 12 months If you focus on its latest quarterly results Amazons margins are nearing (or have already set) all-time highs The fact that Amazon posted solid results in historically weak quarters bodes well for Q4 which is usually its strongest one No investor knows what a fully profitable Amazon looks like but 2024 could give us a glimpse making it a strong buy now Should you invest $1000 in Nvidia right now?

Dips and fluctuations are normal But sharp declines below key moving averages in unusually heavy volume signal a potential change in trend for the worse On the flip side if Nvidia Shopify Microsoft or others rise but volume remains well below average that can point to hesitation or a lack of institutional demand for a continued climb Finally keep tabs on a stocks relative strength line Is the RS line rising moving sideways or heading south? A rising relative strength line shows market leadership as compared with the S&P 500 which represents a wide swath of the market All three factors come into play when evaluating Microsoft Amazon Shopify Nvidia and others Currently NVDA stock provides a good example The AI and automation giant has formed an early-stage flat base with a 50558 buy point The stock now trades below its 21-day line but above its 50-day moving average The relative strength line moved sideways last month and has edged downward so far in the new year See if that can perk up when a potential breakout nears Also keep an eye on trading volume as NVDA stock closes in on the new buy point On the day of any breakout attempt look for volume at least 40% higher than normal to show conviction for the move As you watch Nvidia Microsoft Amazon Shopify and other names on the IBD Breakout Stocks Index analyze each against those same three factors And be sure to view individual stocks within the context of how the market indexes are faring The IBD Breakout Opportunities ETF (BOUT) from Innovator Capital Management tracks the IBD Breakout Stocks Index As with other index ETFs this fund allows you to invest in the entire index in addition to or rather than buying individual stocks Learn more here about the ETF and Innovator Follow Matthew Galgani on X (formerly Twitter) at @IBD_MGalgani YOU MAY ALSO LIKE: Magnificent Seven Stocks In 2024: Ready To Rock On — Or Roll Over?

resources and more Learn More There is no doubt that Nvidia (NVDA 118%) has been one of the hottest stocks on the market over the past year thanks to huge demand for artificial intelligence (AI) chips the company sells But this is precisely the reason why investors may be looking for other ways to tap the AI boom After all Nvidia stocks 239% surge in 2023 made the stock expensive It now sports a price-to-sales ratio of about 27 and a trailing earnings multiple of 65 Nvidia seems capable of justifying those multiples with impressive growth The company is expected to finish the current fiscal year with a 118% jump in revenue to $59 billion followed by another jump of 56% in the next one It may even grow at a faster pace than what consensus estimates are projecting But still some investors may be on the hunt for cheaper alternatives This is where Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 197%) popularly known as TSMC steps in The chip stock is expected to deliver solid growth in 2024 and is trading at significantly cheaper multiples than Nvidia Lets look at the reasons why investors might want to consider buying TSMC right now The AI chips that Nvidia sells are manufactured by its foundry partner TSMC which is why TSMC seems a solid bet for investors seeking an alternative AI chip play Shares of the Taiwan-based company jumped 40% in 2023 underperforming the PHLX Semiconductor Sector index which clocked much stronger growth of 66% However thats good news for opportunistic investors as TSMC stock is trading at a much cheaper valuation than Nvidias TSMC sports a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 19 which is lower than the companys five-year average P/E ratio of 22 Investors can consider buying TSMC stock hand over fist at its current valuation as revenue and earnings growth are expected to pick up impressively in 2024 More specifically TSMCs revenue was predicted to decline almost 9% in 2023 to $69 billion thanks to the weak demand for smartphones and personal computers (PCs) AI however is likely to change the picture this year TSM Revenue Estimates for Next Fiscal Year data by YCharts As the chart above shows TSMC is expected to post 20%-plus revenue growth rates over the next couple of years A key reason why TSMCs growth is likely to accelerate is that the companys advanced chips which are manufactured using 5-nanometer (nm) and 3-nm process nodes are in strong demand from the likes of Nvidia These advanced chips are manufactured using TSMCs advanced packaging technology known as chip-on-wafer-on-substrate (CoWoS) Market research firm IDC estimates that CoWoS packaging capacity is expected to jump a whopping 130% in the second half of 2024 In other words sales of TSMCs AI chips are likely to take off as the company will be in a position to boost shipments this year and bridge the 20% demand-supply gap that currently exists in CoWoS packaging It is also worth noting that TSMC could win big from the growing adoption of its 3nm chips in the long run as this process node is expected to help chipmakers create $15 trillion worth of chips over the next five years All this explains why TSMCs bottom-line growth is set to accelerate as well TSM EPS Estimates for Current Fiscal Year data by YCharts Assuming TSMC does hit $772 per share in earnings in 2025 as the chart above indicates and trades at its five-year average forward earnings multiple of 213 at that time its stock price could reach $165 in two years That would represent a 58% jump from current levels However TSMC stock could jump higher if the market rewards it with a higher earnings multiple It is worth noting that TSMCs forward earnings multiple is cheaper than the 29 average forward P/E of the Nasdaq-100 index which can serve as a proxy for tech stocks considering that it is mostly made up of tech stocks If TSMC trades at 29 times forward earnings in a couple of years the companys stock could jump to $224 based on projected 2025 earnings That points toward an even bigger upside of 115% from current levels All this shows why investors would do well to buy TSMC stock while it is still cheap since it could soar impressively in the long run Harsh Chauhan has no position in any of the stocks mentioned The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy

36,"Will Nvidia Be a $2 Trillion Company in 2024?","2/3/2024","https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-2-trillion-company-2024-123300000.html","Right now only two US companies have market caps greater than $2 trillion Microsoft and Apple As of Jan 31 Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is the fifth-largest US company (sixth-largest globally) with a $15 trillion market cap So for Nvidia to reach a $2 trillion valuation in 2024 it would need to grow 33% from its current stock price Is this out of the question? Or could Nvidia become the third company to obtain a $2 trillion market cap? Nvidias primary business is graphics processing units (GPUs) Although this hardware was originally slated to be used by individuals who wanted better graphics than their processors could create while gaming the uses quickly expanded Now GPUs are used to power gaming rigs mine cryptocurrency process engineering simulations and create artificial intelligence (AI) models The latter example is why Nvidias stock has been a powerhouse over the past year as AI demand has dramatically improved Nvidias financial situation In the second and third quarters of fiscal year 2024 (ended July 30 and October 29 respectively) Nvidia posted year-over-year revenue growth of 101% and 206% This strength is expected to continue into the fourth quarter and beyond as management guided for $20 billion in revenue indicating 231% growth year over year Clearly AI is having a massive effect on Nvidia and with the purpose-built AI supercomputer infrastructure buildout not yet complete it has a ways to go But is reaching a $2 trillion market cap realistic? Nvidias prospects are well known As a result the stock has garnered a premium valuation because investors have already baked in substantial business gains Few people would consider the stock cheap with the stock trading at 83 times trailing and 51 times forward earnings If Nvidias stock price rose an additional 33% so would these valuations bringing these two valuation metrics to 110 times trailing and 68 times forward earnings But this doesnt take into account Nvidias earnings growth throughout 2023 If you look at Nvidias forward price-to-earnings ratio for fiscal year 2025 its 31 times earnings -- a far more reasonable level A 33% increase from that ratio would be 412 times earnings still cheaper than where the stock is today So if Nvidia continues to deliver solid results investors shouldnt be surprised if the stock can increase enough to achieve the $2 trillion valuation sometime this year A key piece of information will be provided to investors when it reports Q4 results sometime in late February: FY 2025 guidance This will clue investors into what can be expected this year With Nvidias current valuation nothing less than incredible sales growth will do which could be setting the stock up for failure However with AI demand still ramping up I wouldnt be surprised if it reported a strong quarter with jaw-dropping guidance But my biggest concern isnt with what Nvidia does over the next year or two; its what happens after that Nvidia is a hardware company and once the infrastructure is built out Nvidia wont have the same demand for GPUs as it has now This will inevitably lead to a substantial revenue drop Unfortunately I have no idea when that is coming So it could happen this year or a decade from now If its the former Ill be proven right by not buying the stock If its the latter Ill miss out on a massive winner Whats my plan? Im going to see what Nvidia says in its Q4 guidance If its great then I will likely purchase some shares Ill likely pass on the stock if its not what I want to see Should you invest $1000 in Nvidia right now?
