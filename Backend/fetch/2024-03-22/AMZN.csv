GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Sign with AMZN As of 2024-01-01 Amazoncom Incs intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $7212 Its currently trading at a price of $151945 Therefore the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -11068% The company is significantly overvalued The GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage In the growth stage the company is experiencing faster growth while in the terminal stage a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run Amazoncom Incs intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps Term Value Explanation EPS without NRI $21 GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow Discount Rate 10% An appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 387% rounded up to the nearest whole number which is 4% A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate Growth Stage Growth rate (g1) = 000% Years of Growth Stage = 10 We choose the growth rate based on the availability prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10 5 or 3 years in that order and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate The default growth period is set to 10 years Terminal Stage Growth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10 For the terminal stage the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation Growth Stage = EPS without NRI * [ (1 + g1) / (1 + d) * (1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2 + + (1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ] = 1288 Terminal Stage = EPS without NRI * (1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 * [ (1 + g2) / (1 + d) + (1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2 + + (1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ] = 601 Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based) = Growth Stage + Terminal Stage = 7212 GuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $2035 This valuation indicates that the Amazoncom Inc is significantly overvalued accompanied by a margin of safety of -64666% You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page Please note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model: Future Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings Embracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role All else being equal a company with rapid growth will have a higher value Predictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance For companies with unpredictable performance such as cyclical companies the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized Discount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate Using the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based) To identify undervalued predictable companies focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based) This article generated by GuruFocus is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice Our commentary is rooted in historical data and analyst projections utilizing an impartial methodology and is not intended to serve as specific investment guidance It does not formulate a recommendation to purchase or divest any stock and does not consider individual investment objectives or financial circumstances Our objective is to deliver long-term fundamental data-driven analysis Be aware that our analysis might not incorporate the most recent price-sensitive company announcements or qualitative information GuruFocus holds no position in the stocks mentioned herein This article first appeared on GuruFocus Related Quotes"

Remember though that there are many ways to estimate a companys value and a DCF is just one method If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model View our latest analysis for Amazoncom Were using the 2-stage growth model which simply means we take in account two stages of companys growth In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate To begin with we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows Where possible we use analyst estimates but when these arent available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow over this period We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to todays value: 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 Levered FCF ($ Millions) US$537b US$734b US$852b US$896b US$1067b US$1162b US$1242b US$1310b US$1369b US$1422b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x16 Analyst x11 Analyst x3 Analyst x4 Analyst x4 Est @ 889% Est @ 689% Est @ 549% Est @ 451% Est @ 382% Present Value ($ Millions) Discounted @ 75% US$499k US$636k US$686k US$671k US$744k US$754k US$749k US$735k US$715k US$691k (Est = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$688b We now need to calculate the Terminal Value which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 22% We discount the terminal cash flows to todays value at a cost of equity of 75% Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$142b× (1 + 22%) ÷ (75%– 22%) = US$28t Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$28t÷ ( 1 + 75%)10= US$13t The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value which results in the Total Equity Value which in this case is US$20t To get the intrinsic value per share we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding Compared to the current share price of US$152 the company appears a touch undervalued at a 23% discount to where the stock price trades currently The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation so it is better to view this as a rough estimate not precise down to the last cent The calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a companys future performance so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry or a companys future capital requirements so it does not give a full picture of a companys potential performance Given that we are looking at Amazoncom as potential shareholders the cost of equity is used as the discount rate rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital WACC) which accounts for debt In this calculation weve used 75% which is based on a levered beta of 1053 Beta is a measure of a stocks volatility compared to the market as a whole We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies with an imposed limit between 08 and 20 which is a reasonable range for a stable business Strength Earnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry Debt is not viewed as a risk Weakness No major weaknesses identified for AMZN Opportunity Annual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market Trading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20% Threat Revenue is forecast to grow slower than 20% per year Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis and it ideally wont be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company Its not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model Preferably youd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the companys valuation For instance if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly it can dramatically alter the overall result What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

It would be to create jobs for the people in that community To bring enrichment to that community To create a platform to fight injustices To build a company to serve the people not to corral people to serve a company Maybe it’s idealistic Maybe Wall St would crap on that Maybe it’s why I was destined to leave the corporate life for that of an entrepreneur I know for certain though that Bezos is right I’ll take mission-driven over no-mercy driven any day of the week I bet you would too — so why not role model it?

Share it with your friends or copy link On September 1 Justin Garrisons senior role and team at Amazon Web Services Amazons cloud computing subsidiary was eliminated He wasnt fired He just no longer had a role Hes still getting his regular paychecks as seen in the paystubs he shared with Business Insider For the past four months Garrison has been stuck in limbo at Amazon where his managers wont let him go or assign him new work but instead tell him to look for another role internally or find a job somewhere else Garrison — a senior developer advocate at AWS for almost four years writing documentation and testing cloud computing products — said its been part of a concerning pattern within the company this past year following the layoffs of more than 27000 employees and return-to-office plans announced in February Rather than conducting another round of mass firings that might spook shareholders or push workers out with pricey severance packages Garrison and another Amazon employee told Business Insider they feel the company is trying to make employees lives miserable either by enforcing RTO or sticking them in a position that pays less or has a more junior title The practice is often known as quiet firing in which perks and benefits are stripped or bosses stop providing attention to certain employees sometimes overtly showing them the door In a Saturday blog post in which he aired the issues hes had with Amazon in the past several months Garrison had another name for it: Silent Sacking Garrison said since as far back as the summer there has been a lack of clarity from upper management on the future of his role When Amazon CEO Andy Jassy announced RTO plans in February Garrisons team and other groups were told they would not be impacted After all Garrisons job was always expected to be remote: He started in April 2020 but began interviewing for the role well before the pandemic hit in March of that year I was told repeatedly it wouldnt affect me or the teams I worked with Then in the summer that changed Garrison wrote on his blog Garrison told BI the company went beyond the usual RTO in which an employee could work at any office and enforced return-to-teams which required people to be at an office where their team was located For Garrison the office options were Seattle San Francisco Austin and Vancouver Canada When he chose Vancouver Garrison said he was told the company probably wouldnt sponsor a work visa So it wasnt even an option he said Afterward Garrison was told his team had a one-year remote exception But two days later on September 1 he learned that his entire team was being eliminated All but two people on his team found other internal roles Garrison told BI he had about a month and a half of work to finish at AWS His skip-level manager told Garrison: After you finish your work here if you find another job externally take it Youre telling me to go find another job and go take another job without any repercussions to you Garrison told BI And that seems very disingenuous It seems really shady to me After Garrison wrapped up his work in mid-October he asked his bosses including Barry Cooks an AWS vice president for a severance package — something they previously said would be an option As a senior employee Garrison felt he was in a privileged position to make that request But Garrison was told he would have to write a proposal to get a severance package approved Garrison said he would ping Cooks for updates on his employment and severance for the next two and a half months He had been trying to help his teammates find other roles throughout that time but said he hadnt attended a meeting in months Its the best vacation Garrison said I was like This is kind of great but also I dont know when its going to end The last time Garrison spoke with Cooks was around the second week of December Since then he told BI that he has not gotten an update on his severance package That was why I published the blog post when I did Garrison said I was mostly silent about it for months Garrison told BI that these tactics were a way to manage head count at Amazon One Amazon software development manager who was asked to move across the US from New York to Seattle for RTO previously shared the same sentiment with Business Insider After nearly four years at the company the employee took a $203000 pay cut by forfeiting unvested stocks solely because of Amazons RTO policy If I was going to surmise I would think part of it is reducing head count without doing further layoffs because that signals bad things to shareholders the manager who requested to be anonymous told BI In a December 5 X post Merritt Baer a former AWS employee said the sheer number of AWS resignations in the last week is stunning In an email to Business Insider Rob Munoz a spokesperson for Amazon wrote that the company has been repeatedly been clear about what drove our decision on RTO and these inaccurate and misleading anonymous anecdotes just arent factual In February we shared with employees that wed be asking them to start coming into the office three or more days per week beginning in May because we believe it would yield the best long-term results for our customers business and culture And it has With the vast majority of employees in the office more frequently theres more energy connection and collaboration and were hearing that from employees and the businesses that surround our offices Munoz wrote But the software development manager who took the $203000 pay cut told BI that the company hadnt shown any evidence that productivity had decreased working from home Garrison acknowledged in his blog that the mass layoffs this year only impacted about 17% of Amazon employees Still the RTO initiative and layoffs have caused many teams to be emaciated and may make the company less agile to innovate He explained how for years Amazons organizational approach was known as two-pizza teams Jeff Bezos said that the idea was to create teams that are no larger than can be fed by two pizzas But people are expensive and Amazon appears to be shifting to a more centralized organization Garrison said in which a bigger team with a pool of expertise is created and everyone borrows time from that centralized pool The downside of that is you have to wait in line to get an expert on something he said Garrison told BI that he would love to get a severance package but has since lost all expectations of getting one He also said he felt compelled to write his blog post so that he could speak for other lower-level Amazon employees who have been stuck in similar situations but might not have enough experience to quit their jobs or make a lot of noise With the job market the way it is they dont have a lot of connections Garrison said Ive been in technology for 20 years Im going to be OK Since posting his blog on Saturday Garrison said he received messages from people across the company who said his post resonated with their position I havent had a single person at Amazon who said I was wrong Garrison said Every single one of them was like Yep this is exactly what weve been living through and it sucks Advertisement"

Hey Greg Great question Lots of sellers come from different backgrounds Greg started with wholesaling and I started with books A lot of folks just start with private label And even more try out arbitrage first It really comes down to what you feel most comfortable with and what works with your budget Thanks for reading Stefan! Hey I read through the guide and have a question regarding UPC codes If I’m planning to sell items from my house or items that are new from a retail store (but not made by me) do I need a UPC code? I’m a little confused as to when and for what products I would need a code Thank you! Hi Ali If you are planning to sell items of another brand you do not need a UPC code (Assuming these items have UPC barcodes already) You would only need a new UPC code when you are selling your own branded products It is likely that the items you want to sell are already listed on Amazon If that is the case you can simply list your offer on that listing without needing to enter the UPC code If you were creating a new listing for a product Amazon would require that you enter a UPC code to create the listing I hope this helps!

I am now on my third attempt to set up a business from Guam One very important point Make sure you use a MAILING address as your RESIDENTIAL address We use post office boxes for our mail and if you put your residential address you have screwed the pooch Once your email is associated with that account there is no turning back As a pre- registered account you have no way of contacting the seller division directly only by email which offers no help in any way There is no way to correct this mistake even though you are directed to correct your mailing address at the end of the registration page BEWARE of this mistake before you proceed to the end of registration make sure you enter your MAILING address instead of your residential address unless of course you do receive your mail at your residence Thanks for the postThanks Again Great!

Can I open account from Hong Kong ? Also can you please provide the list of countries which are allowed by Amazon to open account ? Kind regards Nadeem Hi Nadeem Yes you can open an account from Hong Kong Here is a list of countries accepted for seller registration: https://sellercentralamazoncom/gp/help/helphtml?itemID=200405020&language=en-US&ref=mpbc_200417280_cont_200405020 Brian I have tried to sign up 3x in past 9 months Amazon supplies little to no explanation of what the issue is It just shows the same tired message: “Your Amazon seller account has been deactivated in accordance with section 3 of Amazon’s Business Solutions Agreement” Then when you google that phrase an Amazon pop up shows a little more detail of the problem is Often a hyper-critical detail I address it then NOTHING CHANGES Just more suspensions Im stuck in a loop (this last time my User Name wasn’t the same as my Name in the account… Name is optional but I didnt put a name there… the AI system did… then it stated that it had corrected it… so was I supposed to change something??? or just resubmit appeal? why put me through that at all?) I even got the postcard with the code Isn’t that enough? EBay had me selling in minutes… So these security measures are ridiculous I would love some answers as to why Amazon is so dysfunctional and incompetent in it’s on-boarding procedures From my last 2 times I know what happens no one responds to my questions in Seller Central or if they do answer they can’t detail the solutions since its just a “copy and paste” respond center who is clueless to actual user experience Then that account becomes deactivated for good with absolutely no explanation Its a shame since Im killing it on Ebay Meanwhile I have a friend who signed up years ago who has NO IDEA what he is doing and he’s making little to no money?? Amazon is just shooting themselves in the foot Hi Emma So sorry to hear you are having trouble! We’re you able to get this figured out? Hi Dove i have limited company in UK Can i work in US Amazon on the basis of UK company?

Or can I use the previous email that Amazon has on file? Thanks Hi Moe Thanks for the question! You can create your seller account using a different email or use the same email as your buyer account Brian There are lot of things I need to know is Amazon going to produce stickers for one product ? Intern of selling natural skin and hair product Tell me more about amazon please Hi Susan Thanks for your questions! Can you elaborate more? Brian Hi JungleScout I am Kevin based in Singapore who would like to become a Amazon seller Following are some of my queries before I going to start my Amazon seller carrer: – Do I need to create logo for selling in Amazon? – My marketplace in US but my address for validation is in Singapore is there any problem? – Understand that UPC codes is a bar code do I really need that? What if I haven’t find a product to sell but I going to register for seller account when I click no for UPC code any impact? – Should I create Amazon seller account first? Or should I liaise with supplier first? – Amazon storage fee is included inside of FBA fee? Or separate cost? After 365 days Amazon will charge monthly storage fee? – What if after one year I can’t sell the product any can I dispose my products? Instead of paying the monthly storage fee to Amazon Or can I ship back to me? – Will my product auto enroll to Amazon prime program? Or is there any requirement? – Do I need to pay Amazon advertising fee to promote my item to the top list? Or do they have this option? Thank you Hi Kevin Thanks for your questions I will do my best to answer all of them – No you don’t – No you can sell internationally Please use this post as a reference: https://wwwjunglescoutcom/blog/how-to-sell-on-amazon-from-overseas/ – You can apply for a GTIN exemption if your product does not have a UPC – Begin contacting suppliers but work on setting up your account as soon as possible because it does take a while now to verify all your info – Yes storage fees are separate from FBA fees See here: https://sellamazoncom/pricinghtml#fulfillment-fees – You can choose to have Amazon destroy the product or they can ship it back to you for a fee – If you send your product into an FBA warehouse it will automatically be prime eligible – You don’t have to advertise but it is recommended for new products so it can be seen by customers I hope this helps! Brian I do not have a PAN card yet Can i continue register the amazon seller? Hi Broam Start going through the process and see what they need You may be able to go through without it Hi i like to know what Bank information i have to collect to register as an individual in amazoncom I live in canada For a monthly fee i know it has to be Credit card information But for direct deposit I need to know what exactly do i have to provide Can yoi please send me a sample Regards Sam Hi Sam Please check out this post to find out more information! https://wwwjunglescoutcom/blog/how-to-sell-on-amazon-from-overseas/ Can you please advise on whether Amazon prohibits/discriminates anyone from opening a seller account based on their country of birth regardless of whether they are a citizen of an allowed country? At the moment the drop down menu on registration only has a limited amount of countries you have to be born in to register regardless of whether what citizenship you are I can not even skip that section since it is required Is one’s Amazon fate sealed at place of birth or is there a way around this :)I have reached out to amazon but have been not received any response despite sending several messages Please advise Thank you I forgot to add I am a Canadian citizen but was not born here My country of birth is not listen in the limited list under Amazon’s “country of birth” in the individual registration section Hi Amazon will not discriminate for where you were born Do you need to list your place of birth? Hi It should not matter where you place of birth was Only where you currently reside Have you heard back from them yet? Hi guys I have a question! What if my LLC address is different from my actually living address? and if Amazon ever ask me proving utility bills which one should I use? Thanks! Hi Houssame Everything should match Use the utility bills from your LLC address Please I can’t find my country in the list… What should I do next If your country isn’t listed in the ‘Business Location’ dropdown then it’s likely that it isn’t one that Amazon accepts for registration You can double check that here: https://sellercentralamazoncom/gp/help/external/200405020?language=en-US&ref=mpbc_200417280_cont_200405020 But if it’s not on that list either then there’s nothing that can be done Even if there was a way around the rule and you were able to sell on the site from a country not on the list there’s an extremely good chance Amazon will shut your listing down and ban you from the platform I’m so sorry about that Abogu Hello I want to inquire whether the requirement for tax information is optional or compulsory Thank you for your anticipated reply Hi Eboh! Thanks for reaching out about this as the requirement to provide Amazon your tax information is compulsory To get a clear picture of how tax collection works on Amazon we recommend reading Amazon’s “Marketplace Tax Collection FAQ“ I hope this helps 🙂 HEY I LIVE IN CANADA AND I WOULD LIKE TO START SELLING ON AMAZON AS A PROFESSIONAL ACCOUNT BUT I DONT OWN A PRIVATE BRAND NOR A LLC MY QUESTIONS ARE: 1HOW CAN I SET A PRIVATE BRAND? 2AS A CANADIAN PERMANENT RESIDENT HOW CAN I CREATE A LLC? 3AM I ELLIGIBLE FOR A LLC? 4 IS THERE SOMETHING SIMILAR TO LLC IN CANADA? THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME TO ANSWER MY QUESTIONS!!!! Hi Please check out this post to help you with selling internationally on Amazon US: https://wwwjunglescoutcom/blog/how-to-sell-on-amazon-from-overseas/ Dear Sir I would like to ask that after i sign up as professional Seller which already charge 3999 does it have anymore fee charge for document processing fee for this registration before approval as Amazon Seller? I live in Cambodia if i send the product from here to USA so how can i process it to Amazon inventory warehouse to keep my product can you advice detailed Highly appreciated for your respond Regard Dara Hi Dara There are no document processing fees There will be FBA fees and other selling fees associated with selling on Amazon You will need to create a shipment in your seller account and in there it will tell you which warehouses your inventory will be sent to Hi I am a foreigner and would like to set up a LLC for trading in Amazon I have a SSN already as I lived in US for a few years long time ago I will hire a registered agent in US for the LLC setup but all my bank statements and utilities bills are local address Therefore just wonder if I can still use the LLC to open the Amazon account as I won’t be able to provide address proof in US for the account opening requirement or there’s no point for me to set up the LLC? Hey Cory! So glad you got in touch as you don’t need an LLC in order to start selling on Amazon Instead since you don’t have proof of an address in the US you can set up your business as a sole proprietorshipI hope this helps and good luck with your business! can a Pakistani register his account on amazon for sale purpose????? Hi Talha! Based on the list of countries Amazon accepts for seller registration (https://sellercentralamazoncom/gp/help/external/200405020?language=en-US&ref=mpbc_200417280_cont_200405020) if you are living in Pakistan you won’t be able to sell on the site as it isn’t one of the countries Amazon accepts I am sorry about that The popped up window says to sign up as a professional “account” seller even though I hit (Individual seller) button And there is no other way I can do anything to the window it’s solid I cannot change it Good question!

A fraudster used my personal data and created an Amazon seller account for himself My question is will this work? Amazon tech support doesn’t tell me anything clearly Have you encountered this? Hey Darina Interesting issue Did you contact seller support with information? Right now they might be a little behind due to the coronavirus threat so they may be slow to get back to you Hi Dave My business partner and I are new in the Amazon Business We are LLC and registered as a Professional Account about 2 months ago and our business is doing fine until now However we realized that we do not want to work together anymore but both of us want to keep working with Amazon What should we do? Is it possible that one of us keep this first account and the other open a new one? Should we inform Amazon first? Do you think we should close this LLC and open 2 new ones? Thanks D Danyela Hey! Sorry to hear that it didn’t work out between you and your business partner Make sure that the paperwork is line with the first LLC and yes it’s probably a good idea to contact Amazon Then whoever isn’t part of the first LLC should start their own LLC or other business with Amazon Just communicate with Amazon and you should be in good shape Hope that’s helpful! Do you have to show Credit Card Utility Bill and Bank Account account numbers on the documents they require to be submitted when applying for an Amazon Seller Account? Hi Rob Good question I’ll ask our CS department but as far as I know you just need a credit card and bank account Thank you for this article! I do have general questions as I am looking to become an Amazon FBA seller and currently reading through various forums: 1 I am planning on registering my LLC and setting up a business bank account with the LLC’s name I’ve read that for Amazon’s verification a utility bill is needed in the name of the registered entity So my question is will a utility bill that has my personal name on it (not the LLCs name) be sufficient? Or does a utility bill have to have the LLCs name on it? 2 Can the utility bill have both my name and my husband’s name on it or mine alone? 3 The credit card I plan on using to register is a personal one as I don’t have a business credit card as of yet Will this be okay? Hi Kimberly Glad to see you joining in on all the fun! 1 One with your name should be sufficient If you are unsure you can reach out to seller support and ask them When I started selling on Amazon I started as a sole proprietor first then switch to LLC later 2 It should be fine if it’s both 3 It should be fine although for the sake of keeping your business separate from your personal finance I recommend waiting until you have a business card Hi Dave Very helpful Blog! Just want to ask what under category is the towel face towel or Bath towel Hi Mary Jane Good question Those should all be in Home & Kitchen If you are unsure when you’re adding a product to Amazon type in the type of product that it is and Amazon will automatically suggest the category to place your product in Hi Dave Thank you so much for sharing good knowledge with us i have read my own question here is that I am not a business owner non have product to sell I am creative publication student i have platform and necessary tools to adversities and promote products to their target audience who may need them (but am not a US resident) which account should i create?? or how should i get suppler link to my platforms… someone should help me??… thanks looking forward to your quick reply… Heya!

I’m just starting off I’m not aware of the laws behind online businesses Please help me out Thank you Hi Richu Great questions! You might consult with a tax law attorney or do a little hunting online We don’t want to give you the wrong information as we are not qualified to answer questions of that status Does GST registration be required when doing business with Amazon due to a business of less than 15 million Hi Nikhil For GST/India we do not have reliable information on that You might check with Amazon Seller Central Seller Support to see where you need to register Sorry I couldn’t be more helpful! Hey guys thanks for the info! When I register it asks me if I own a brand? I’ll be making custom packaging with a logo/company name (however the company doesn’t exist as an LLC or registered trade mark) So do I check off the box that I own a brand or not? Thanks! Hey Ion If you’re registering your brand you’ll need to have a trademark If you don’t already have one then you can use a service like Amazon’s IP accelerator which will file your trademark for you and get you into the program faster An outstanding share!

Do I send amazon inventory or just one product and they continue to make it? Eg a book or keychain ect Hi Baileigh Amazon is just a sales channel and fulfillment network You would need to produce your own products and sell it so yes you’d send inventory Please i would love to sell books on amozonbut i am from nigeria how do i go about itplease enlighten me Hi Charles The biggest difficulty you’ll face is transporting the goods from where you are to Amazon However you might consider writing your own books to sell on Amazon too which wouldn’t cost you any money You could publish through Amazon’s Kindle Direct Publishing system hi I wanna ask if the “registered business” is essential for amazonde account? anybody would help me? how do I ship from my country Trinidad and Tobago-WI to US or other customers? do I hire a local shipping company to ship to amazon and from there my products is then shipped to customers or do I ship directly? shipping from my country will increase the cost of every product Hi Nile You can choose to manufacture your product in another country like China and have your products shipped directly to Amazon warehouses in the US This would certainly be the most cost-effective option instead of shipping from your home country We have several resources on finding suppliers and planning the shipping details I hope those help! I tried to open an account according to your instructions but Amazon asked me to verify my identity I sent them a statement but they emailed me back that they can not verify the document and as a result I am not allowed to sell on Amazon What can I do?

I am not a business owner but would like to start selling my own brand with Amazon and intend to sell 40 items per month Hence individual seller should not be an option for me However upon registering on the website I’ve learned that the business type drop down button is limited only to the following categories: privately-owned business individual charity state-owned and publicly listed business Should I first then register a business before selling on Amazon? Thank you Hi Teresa Good question! I believe “individual” would be what you filed as You’d have to put in your SSN for sole proprietor Some states may require that you fill out a do-business-as (DBA) too Hey can we use debit mastercard instead of credit card And if we cant can you suggest me any other platform just like amazon to sale products Thanks Hi Dave! very informative article but I have some questions about setting up our Amazon US account as International seller outside USA: 1 if I lived in Indonesia and opened amazon US account in this case I have set up my LLC and EIN using PO BOX address in USA in the section point NO7 on your article input business information which we need to input our business address what address that I need to input? I think it should be our PO BOX USA address isn’t? since I am doing dropshipping in this case Regarding the verification process using phone I will use my Indonesia number to receive the PIN 2 In the section “Tax Information Interview” I will choose non US citizen after that Amazon will need us to fill the form about our permanent address in this case it will be my Indonesia address isn’t? Just confused about the address part that we need to set as International seller especially doing dropshipping looking forward to hear from you CMIIW in setting up procedure thank you 🙂 Hi Juherianto Great questions! And possibly a little out of my league My recommendation would be to speak directly with one of Amazon’s seller support representatives or to someone who does legal/accounting advice for international sellers in the US There may be one available on our https://wwwjunglemarketcom or you might be able to find one somewhere on Google You could also try hitting up our Customer Success team They usually have pretty good insights on this type of thing let me know the procedure to get amazon registration done I have heard that some people set up a separate amazon business account to do buying How do you set up that type of business account as an individual without licenses etc since it requires business verification? Hey Em Great question! I personally have two LLCs myself one for purchasing and one for the retail side But you won’t have to register the secondary business with Amazon only the one you use to do through the retail I am not a usa resident after click my own country the amozon ask me me to sign up for hyperwalletcom to receive payment After successfully done in hyperwallet I cannot click the next step Why? any remedy to this problem? thank Hi Happyjamin Thanks for writing in! I’m not sure what you mean Have you tried contacting seller support? Hi I have a question regarding selling tooth brushs that are produced outside USA on Amazoncom while I live in Canada Are there any restrictions on such a business? Hi Arsalan! Great question! You can probably do that no problem however toothbrushes I believe will fall into Health/Beauty category which is a restricted category and requires ungating I think to ungate H/B you need to supply Amazon with an invoice from your manufacturer to prove that you are a legitimate reseller of that product If you are the manufacturer you have to prove and show proper paperwork Hope that’s helpful!

Under FBA is it correct to say that the seller only has to ensure that the amazon warehouse is sufficiently stocked to meet customer orders and that any distribution from the warehouse is left to the amazon distribution function to deal with? How would one ensure the amazon warehouse is sufficiently stocked with inventory and how do you ensure that your stock is held at a number of distribution warehouses across the UK region If we do not use credit card for deposit any other option? thanks Hi I have garments manufacturing unit And i was making kitchen approns for a client who export those goods to amazon Now i want to export direct How ? Please guide me Hi Rana You would need to set up an Amazon account and prepare a shipment You can learn how to do that in our Million Dollar Case Study (it’s free) https://wwwjunglescoutcom/blog/category/the-million-dollar-case-study/ Dave When using the Amazon fab program does Amazon handles defective products return by customers? And how does it work? One thing that I would not like be part of is having to deal with products cominto me or my home address Hey Pedro You have two options You can either have it sent directly to you or you can have Amazon dispose of it for you Both have an associated cost Sometimes though the “defective” product is nothing more than a dinged up box It seems you forgot a liiiiiiiittle detail amazon now asks for a SS#! (TIN) I just tried to set up a new selling account and I found out that (even to sell a few things) they want “Tax Information” This is what it says: If you are a US tax payer by completing the tax interview in your seller account you will be providing Amazon the appropriate tax identity in the form of a W-9 or W-8BEN form For US taxpayers a Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) is required by the IRS for the administration of tax laws In most cases your TIN is either an Employer Identification Number (EIN) or a Social Security Number (SSN) My question is why do they want it now and they did not need it before (same with the credit card)? The way it is going it would not be surprised if amazon soon will ask for a urine stool DNA etc sample (and maybe request to have a “chip” implanted to be able to sell) I looks I will be an eBay seller after all Hi Sir Thank you very much for your information Could you tell me please Can i change my individual account into pro after some time? Great guide Greg! Important question: Does Amazon accept seller if Business/LLC address is different from Credit card address? Do bank accounts/credit cards also have to be registered at the official business address? Thanks don’t want to muck up my chances of getting approved! Fia Did you ever get an answer to this question regarding LLC entity name and use of personal internationally chargeable credit card? If you would please reply if you have an answer that would be amazing Thank you in advance Brittany Hi Dave excellent blog on Amazon thanks for all the ideas shared Im based in India but the tools referred to seemed to be of US origin so how do i use this if i were to start my venture in India Hope you have some details for the same Thanks a lot in advance Sowmya Hey Sowmya The process is still the same as it would be in the US just a smaller market overall In my experience it’s a little harder to profit on Amazon India as most of the items cost very few rupees i want sales my rugs product on amazoncom so you tel me which type i do Girish Khandelwal Which type of what? Seller account? I want to provide a simple solution to distributing a family genealogical book to about 40 family members 7 of whom live outside the US–England Holland Germany Australia and Israel There will be a charge for the cost of the book My concern is the cost of shipping to these non-US addresses Through any international air carrier it can run $70-100 per location per book Do you know if Amazon has a different shipping cost structure?-it can go by ship I have tried to talk to an Amazon agent but have not found any department that is willing to explain this Thanks very much Nancy You might ask a logistics company the easiest and most cost-effective way to do this I’m not sure doing it through Amazon will work DHL might have good rates for foreign carriers Please how if a product has a private label potential? And if there are multiple sellers for the product and how I can know if the product is patented or patent pending without going through the rigours of patent search that I don’t really understand Hey Amarachi Rolando and Greg just made a video re: patents https://wwwjunglescoutcom/blog/branding-amazon-products/ if you need to register VAT in Europe do you have to have an entity? can’t decide if i need to register a company or not? (prefer not to in the beginning) Hi Alice! We have a comprehensive guide to VAT from our European Million Dollar Case Study that you can read through here It should answer your questions and help you get started! Melissa Hello Dave Great and informative blog I have learn a lot I am planning to start amazon fba selling used books and I have some clarifications below; 1 Which one do you recommend for a newbie when starting in amazon fba (individual or pro merchant seller)? 2 As an international seller Is EIN required if I choose a pro merchant account? 3 As for the shipping of goods when do you recommend to use air or sea freight (is it base on weight)? Thanks in advance Con 1 Depends on how many you think you’re going to sell If you’re going to sell 40+ go Pro Otherwise stick with individual 2 That I’m not sure of You may contact Amazon direct to see what’s necessary for your country 3 For private label if that’s what you’re talking about go with whichever is cheapest haha! Sea freight isn’t tough just requires a bit more prep And you can outsource with a third party logistics company if you need to Yes I had the same issue trying to get verified ultimately being told that I may not sell on Amazon I have a LLC in California business bank account and credit card etc… and without a utility bill no dice I use a managed mail service for my business location so getting a utility bill (cell doesn’t count) is impossible The verification group is not transparent or approachable either as they assume you are a fraudulent scammer so there is no one to talk to and the responses are just templated emails with the same request I spent a lot of time following the Jungle Scout case studies and other resources so this was was a bit upsetting and quite a let down Jungle Scout is a great company with awesome resources just make sure you do a little research on the Amazon verification process beforehand so you aren’t blindsided In particular make sure you make the correct decisions on the structuring of your business You don’t mention anything about the verification process This is turning out to be the biggest hassle in setting up an account You make it look so easy here but it’s been nothing but a headache trying to get our documents verified to set up the account I wish it was this easy!! Hey Bobbi We actually wrote a piece earlier this year on the registration process for products For this piece we just wanted to introduce things But for those interested some categories are harder than others In my opinion the easiest ones are Kitchen/Dining Sports/Outdoors and Garden Here’s the article that covers some of these things: https://wwwjunglescoutcom/blog/amazon-restricted-categories/ Hi Thanks for the content Question about the professional Amazon acct It is stated if one wants to to sell over 40 products to opt for the pro account of $3999 a month Now does this mean selling 40 different products or SKU’s such as a bigger store if you will or does this mean 40 sales in general per month of any one item (40 monthly sales in general)? Hey Kevin Good question It’s just a math thing Selling individual you’re charged an extra dollar by Amazon for every sale you make Doesn’t matter if it’s one or many SKUs Therefore if you sell 40 items you’ll get charged an extra $40 in fees Therefore it makes sense to sell Pro if you’re going to do more than 40 sales Otherwise you’ll end spending more in fees than you really need to Thanks so much for this! One thing I’m not seeing is how you know the exact address of where to ship to? How does amazon know to expect the packages? Hey Rebecca Once you create your fulfillment order through Amazon seller central they’ll autocreate labels to send your products to Greg I am new seller and my products will ship to FBA warehouse next month trying to learn on Amazon When click manage inventory then click preference there are lots of boxes we can check would you give us idea what to do with each of them? There is also buy box price Do you normally check it? What does it do when check it on? thank you so much George Hi Greg! Love this blog! Tons of info that helps…I wanted to ask in your experience for those who do not live in the US what do you recommend to start selling in Amazon (private label wholesales books)? Thanks E Hey Elaine Great question Lots of sellers come from different backgrounds Greg started with wholesaling and I started with books A lot of folks just start with private label And even more try out arbitrage first It really comes down to what you feel most comfortable with and what works with your budget Your email address will not be published Required fields are marked * Comment Name* Email* Website Δ Need help?
