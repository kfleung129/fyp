2,"Apple Stock: Vision Pro AI In Focus In 2024","1/11/2024","https://www.investors.com/news/technology/apple-stock-ai-vision-pro-2024/","BREAKING: Futures Rise; Tesla Skids On China Production Cut Apple (AAPL) missed out on the spotlight when generative artificial intelligence emerged last year as the biggest technology trend in a generation The tech giant hopes to play catch-up in 2024 and Apple stock investors will be watching The consumer electronics behemoth found itself on the sidelines as Microsoft (MSFT) Alphabets (GOOGL) Google and others publicly detailed plans to capitalize on generative AI throughout 2023 Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook could only point to AI features in the companys current product lineup when asked about Apples play in the exciting new field But those features mostly added incremental smarts to the iPhone and Apple Watch But 2024 promises to be different for Apple said Gene Munster managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management Probably the big story is going to be AI and what theyre going to do in generative AI he told Investors Business Daily Specifically its probably anticipation around what theyre going to say at their developers conference Apple will hold its much-anticipated Worldwide Developers Conference or WWDC in June A news report on Jan 4 suggested Apple plans to announce new generative AI capabilities for its Siri personal assistant application The report said Apple is going to add more personalization and natural conversations to Siri 9to5Mac reported Also Apple has been working on a ChatGPT-like generative AI project since 2022 known informally as Apple GPT The company already is using the AI chatbot internally according to news reports Apple scientists provided a possible glimpse of whats ahead in a recently published research paper titled LLM in a Flash The paper discussed a solution to the current computational bottleneck of running large-language models for AI on devices with limited memory such as smartphones Apple is likely to add AI capabilities to its upcoming iPhone 16 due out in September Meanwhile rival Samsung plans to unveil its Galaxy AI smartphone on Jan 17 In fact Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives thinks Apple will introduce an AI app store this year Apple likely will unveil it at WWDC and get software developers involved in making AI apps for the iPhone and the companys other devices he said For them its about monetization of the installed base Ives said But Apple is keeping its AI plans close to the vest During a conference call with analysts on Nov 2 Cook said Apple is actively working on AI projects but declined to elaborate In terms of generative AI obviously we have work going on Cook said Im not going to get into details about what it is because as you know we really dont do that But you can bet that were investing Were investing quite a bit Those AI innovations will show up in product advancements over time Cook added Apple already is selling products that have features based on AI and machine learning but it doesnt promote them as such Cook said We label them as to what their consumer benefit is Cook said But the fundamental technology behind it is AI and machine learning As examples he named the personal voice and live voicemail features of iOS 17 the latest iPhone operating system The companys AI innovations also include lifesaving features on the Apple Watch such as fall detection crash detection and electrocardiogram analysis But coming up with a response to the generative AI phenomenon isnt Apples only challenge in 2024 The company also is launching its first new hardware platform since the Apple Watch debuted in April 2015 That product is the Apple Vision Pro mixed-reality headset which the Cupertino Calif-based company said will be available in the US starting Feb 2 The $3499 computer goggles combine augmented and virtual reality Wall Street analysts arent counting on the first version of Vision Pro to be a smashing success For starters its pricey And secondly people arent sure of the use cases for the device yet much less a killer app The investment community is largely indifferent to it right now Munster said I cant remember an Apple product coming out that people were so indifferent to He added Investors are thinking its too expensive to be mainstream and all the predecessors have been duds So its just hard for investors to get excited about Apple is pitching the Vision Pro as a spatial computer with potential applications in education enterprise and entertainment The company is likely to produce 300000 to 400000 units of Vision Pro in 2024 UBS analyst David Vogt said in a recent client note The first generation Vision Pro is about laying the foundation for a new device category Ives said Future versions will be cheaper less bulky and more fashionable than the original he said Eventually Vision Pro will be less than $1200 and resemble sunglasses Ives said But that could take years he said Munster said Apple likely sees the Vision Pro as a steppingstone product to smartglasses Thats the long-term version he said He cited the way the original iPhone which came out 16 years ago has evolved over time Speaking of the iPhone analysts see it as a mature product with slowing growth In a recent client note Barclays analyst Tim Long described sales of the current model iPhone 15 as lackluster The next model iPhone 16 likely will be a minor upgrade he added Apple stock bulls disagree and predict the iPhone 16 will be an edge AI device with an advanced Siri assistant What else does Apple have up its sleeve for 2024? Loop Capital analyst John Donovan made some predictions in a recent client note He thinks Apple will come out with OLED screen iPad tablets an Apple Watch that can detect sleep apnea and AirPods wireless earbuds that double as hearing aids In addition to new products and artificial intelligence initiatives Apples year ahead is likely to be marked by increased regulatory scrutiny of its business practices The US Department of Justice reportedly plans to file an antitrust case against Apple for policies related to its App Store Meanwhile the European Union is likely to demand changes to Apples App Store in the year ahead to improve competition Follow Patrick Seitz on X formerly Twitter at @IBD_PSeitz for more stories on consumer technology software and semiconductor stocks YOU MAY ALSO LIKE: Microsoft Stock Has These Major Catalysts Ahead In 2024 AI PCs Could Spur Upgrade Cycle In 2024 AI News: Artificial Intelligence Trends And Top AI Stocks To Watch See Stocks On The List Of Leaders Near A Buy Point Find Winning Stocks With MarketSmith Pattern Recognition & Custom Screens 3/22/2024 The major indexes faded from record highs as Apple fell on a DOJ lawsuit But many stocks flashed buy signals 3/22/2024 The major indexes faded from record highs as Apple fell Get instant access to exclusive stock lists expert market analysis and powerful tools with 2 months of IBD Digital for only $20!

letting retailers restart sales However the move was temporary and sales have again been halted A Masimo spokesperson told DailyMailcom last month: Masimo is willing to settle As Joe Kiani indicated we believe the path forward is to have honest good-faith discussions with Apple to explore the various ways the parties could resolve their dispute The Irvine-based company pioneered a sensor technology that consistently emits light through the skin to monitor blood oxygen saturation Apples technology shines red and near-infrared (IR) light into blood-perfused tissue According to the company website Masimo founded by Joe Kiani in 1989 holds thousands of healthcare and consumer-focused patents Data shows that Masimo is valued at $669 billion and Kianis net worth is $13 billion Apple has also claimed that Masimo applied for a patent after Apple launched its smartwatches Apple has included a pulse oximeter feature in smartwatches since its Series 6 Apple Watch in 2020 The Cupertino-based company filed two patent infringement lawsuits against Masimo in October 2022 claiming Kianis company copied patented features of the Apple Watch to use in its medical tech Leave our flag alone!: Ex-FA boss and England stars round on woke Nike who face boycott for replacing red and white St Georges flag with a rainbow coloured abomination -

recommendations in-depth research investing resources and more Learn More The retail industry is vast with the US market soaring from a value of $3 trillion in 2000 to over $7 trillion in 2022 The rise of online shopping and digital forms of payment has expanded the industry and given companies new avenues for boosting earnings Apple (AAPL -409%) and Costco Wholesale (COST 025%) operate in significantly different areas of retail with one focused on consumer electronics and the other on wholesale grocery However both of these companies have delivered triple-digit stock growth over the last five years and have built up immense consumer loyalty Apple and Costco have some exciting developments in the works for the new year making now an excellent time to consider an investment in their stocks So lets examine whether youre better off with Apple or Costco stock in 2024 Despite offering a considerably smaller range of products than most retailers Apple ranks 11th out of the top 100 leading US retailers according to Statista The popularity of devices like the iPhone the MacBook AirPods and the iPad is unmatched Meanwhile an easy-to-use design language and interconnected system between all of Apples products encourage consumers to stick with the company for the long haul In fiscal 2023 the tech giant posted a revenue dip of 3% year over year Macroeconomic declines caught up with Apple as marketwide headwinds led to reductions in consumer spending However recent data suggests the tech market might finally be in recovery The fourth quarter of 2023 saw smartphone shipments increase 4% year over year after almost two years of declines PC shipments similarly returned to growth in the quarter rising 03% Market improvements have yet to be reflected in Apples earnings but its a promising sign for 2024 Apple generated nearly $100 billion in free cash flow despite market challenges last year Alongside a booming digital services business and expansions in AI I wouldnt bet against the companys long-term future It has the brand power and cash reserves to come back strong and flourish over the next decade Costco ranks third on the list of 100 biggest US retailers Meanwhile as seen in the chart below it has delivered significantly more stock growth over the last five years than some of its biggest American rivals Data by YCharts The company has won over consumers worldwide with its unique business model of charging an annual subscription fee for access to market-low prices in a wholesale setting Product sales dont actually amount to much in profit However the company has rectified that with its membership-based business model In fiscal 2023 Costco hit more than $6 billion in profits with membership fees making up 73% of that figure Alongside a 90% subscription renewal rate the company is crushing it in retail Moreover the company has managed to keep investors happy with consistent growth and surprise dividends that are substantially bigger than its usual dividend yield of 061% On Jan 12 the company paid out a dividend of $15 per share with its last special dividend released in 2020 for $10 per share A winning business model and happy investors make Costcos stock seem like a no-brainer for anyone looking to invest in retail Apple and Costco dominate their respective markets each profiting from some of the most loyal userbases in retail However just because a company leads an industry doesnt necessarily mean its trading at the right price The following data suggests Apples stock currently offers far more value than Costco Data by YCharts This chart compares Apple and Costcos price-to-earnings ratios (P/E) and price-to-free cash flows (P/FCF) For both valuation metrics Apples lower figures indicate its stock is the cheaper option P/E is calculated by dividing a companys stock price by its earnings per share Meanwhile P/FCF divides its market cap by free cash flow For both metrics the lower the figure the more value a stock offers These metrics are helpful in determining a stocks value as they take into account a companys financial health Apple wins on both fronts with its share price a bargain compared to Costcos Along with an improving tech market and expansions into high-growth sectors like AI the company is the better stock in 2024 Dani Cook has no position in any of the stocks mentioned The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Apple and Costco Wholesale The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy Invest better with The Motley Fool Get stock recommendations

What are the stocks with the capacity to drive lasting change in markets? In the nearly 17 years since Apple launched the iPhone smartphones have conquered the world: more than half the global population owns one as of October 2023 J P Morgan makes the point that it is difficult to recall a world in which smartphones weren’t ubiquitous While the question of what distinguishes a smartphone brings several features to mind — internet connectivity apps and a built-in camera for example — the original Apple iPhone wasn’t the first to offer any of these Smartphones actually date back to 1992 with IBM’s [IBM] Simon Personal Communicator This touchscreen phone could send and receive both emails and faxes and contained a calendar and an address book It even enabled a form of predictive text Smartphones really came into their own though with the BlackBerry [BB] These phones with their iconic QWERTY keyboards popularised emailing on-the-go as well as instant messaging via BlackBerry Messenger (BBM) The ‘iPhone moment’ was less of a story about a single technological innovation (though its radical upgrade on touchscreen technology certainly transformed the usability of these devices) Rather iPhones transformed smartphones from mere productivity aids and added a leisure layer At the time of its launch in June 2007 the iPhone’s most tangible breakthrough was its intuitive touchscreen technology This was a marked contrast to the incumbent BlackBerry devices which relied on a physical keyboard; a rushed response to create a touchscreen alternative the BlackBerry Storm backfired disastrously Beyond the interface however iPhones’ mass consumer appeal set them apart Despite costing approximately $200 more than the BlackBerry Pearl at the time the iPhone offered access to video and music through the device opening up a market of younger more casual consumers which the business-oriented BlackBerry hadn’t addressed The iPhone also built naturally on an earlier Apple product the iPod The iconic portable mp3 players accounted for nearly 40% of Apple’s revenue in 2006 but by 2014 — the last year Apple tallied iPod sales in their own categories — they had fallen 74% from their peak sales volume in 2008 While the iPhone in this sense cannibalised Apple’s own market it underscores the point that this single product synthesised what had hitherto been multiple separate niches: music player cell phone camera and personal computer The original iPhone featured 2G connectivity a two-megapixel camera the Safari web browser and access to apps like Google Maps Models released over the following years expanded the offering with 3G connectivity built-in GPS the App Store FaceTime video calling and advanced security features It took the iPhone 74 days to sell one million units By the end of the fiscal year on 29 September 14 million units had been sold The iPhone’s impact on Apple’s stock market performance was immediate Between the close on 28 June the day before it launched and the last day of 2007 Apple’s share price gained 644% In the prior six months its stock had gone up 49% Despite its rapid adoption the iPhone spent three years in BlackBerry’s shadow With the exception of Q3 2008 quarterly BlackBerry sales outweighed those of iPhones until midway through 2010 However from then on iPhone sales exploded while BlackBerry shipments began a gradual decline which culminated in BlackBerry decommissioning its operating systems by January 2022 The firm now predominantly operates in the cybersecurity and IoT markets That said it took until 2023 for the iPhone to become the world’s best-selling smartphone Between 2011 and 2022 the crown was held by Samsung [005930:KS] which lost market share in the lower price segments last year in its drive to concentrate on its mid- to high-end segment All told the iPhone has now sold over 23 billion units Since the product’s launch Apple’s share price has gained 5247% But Samsung has not thrown in the towel and is positioning itself to encroach onto the iPhone’s premium market segment Samsung’s Galaxy S24 series launches on 31 January and promises a raft of new features that incorporate advances in AI technology making it the first (presumably of many) smartphones to leverage AI as a differentiator Real Apple bulls probably won’t be phased by this however Recent research from PitchBook has shown that Apple has bought up more AI start-ups than any of its big tech peers This suggests how disruption is rarely a question of a one-off big-bang moment Rather it is the product of sustained investment and research Innovation is a marathon not a sprint and this is why certain stocks with vision and staying power disrupt the market time and time again Further to this despite the company’s reputation for disruptive innovation few of Apple’ s most iconic products — be they smartphones personal computers or tablets — were the first of their kind The iPhone defined the smartphone era not because it was the first smartphone but because it was the first product that bundled smartphone features together in a package with genuine mass-market appeal The figures outlined above might suggest that the Cupertino company is moving to do something similar when it comes to AI Apple is expected to unveil its own suite of AI features for the iPhone at its Worldwide Developers Conference in June Will these new AI-enabled iPhones be as influential as their forebears?

No Apple says because this is not the safest system for our users Translation: If you want us to do this anywhere else youll need a new law That could come in the future In the meantime Thursdays news is a milestone for Apple and regulators: Proof that if pushed hard enough one of the worlds most powerful companies can change things it said it never wanted to change Read next Jump to"

18,"This Is How Much Apples Top Executives Were Paid in 2023","1/28/2024","https://247wallst.com/jobs/2024/01/28/this-is-how-much-apples-top-executives-were-paid-in-2023/","Apple is one of the most successful powerful and wealthy companies in the history of the world It’s hard to fully grasp just how much money flows through Apple and how much control they have over the computer and smartphone industry Just a fraction of that money is spent on top executives but even that amount is still incredibly large compared to the regular earnings of the average American But how much are they paid and how does it compare? This is how much Apple’s top executives were paid in 2023 For this list we use the data filed by Apple in their annual proxy statement to the SEC We will include basic facts about their compensation and background on the executives Apple is the largest company in the world by market capitalization the largest by revenue (totaling $3943 billion in 2022 alone) the fourth-largest personal computer seller the largest manufacturing company and the second-biggest phone manufacturer Despite criticism of Apple’s poor labor practices environmental damage business ethics anti-competitive business decisions and unethical mining people continue to flock to Apple’s products proving the power that cool flashy branding has over the moral fabric of our society Apple’s CEO pay ratio is 1177:1 which means that Tim Cook earns over a thousand times more per hour than Apple’s median worker wage The median worker wage at Apple is $84493 most of whom live in California so their wage might not last as long as a similar wage in other states The lowest-paid employees are paid much less than that Of course this doesn’t include those people in other countries who are working in mines factories and manufacturing sites as contractors for Apple who are paid less than a few Dollars a day The median pay for CEOs in America is around $145 million while the average annual salary is $59428 and the average hourly rate is around $2834 As with most high-level executives at large companies much of the compensation paid comes in the form of equity instead of a normal paycheck If the company does well the value of this equity can increase rapidly above its value when it is given These executives don’t need regular paychecks to buy groceries or save up to buy their kids something special; they already have enough to cover all their needs and more so equity payments are a perfect way to gain an asset that increases in value and motivate the executives to run the company in a profitable way Just a couple of decades ago the gap between executive pay and the lowest earner was still ridiculous but much smaller at just a few hundred times more than the median At more than a thousand times the median the pay gap has expanded beyond greed to actual human rights abuse and corruption Advocates of addressing the growing wage gap face a significant uphill battle with much opposition coming from those who misunderstand the issue The issue with a massive wage gap isn’t that those on the bottom are jealous of the rich it’s that it creates financial obstacles for those who are already struggling As corporate profits increase the rich take a larger percentage of those profits If those at the bottom of the corporate ladder go just one year without a raise or increase in compensation they will be earning less money than before due to price increases and inflation The view of those who support reducing the wage gap through legislation is that if someone creates a product they should be compensated a fair portion of the value that product generates If they work a full day contributing to society then they should be able to afford to live in and enjoy that society instead of starving and living in dangerous homes Tim Cook was Apple’s COO under Steve Jobs and assumed the position of CEO after the resignation and passing of Jobs in 2011 He joined Apple in 1998 after Jobs asked him personally to join his company Under Cook’s leadership Apple’s revenue and profit have more than doubled and the value of the company has increased from $348 billion to over $3 trillion becoming the first trillion-dollar company in history in 2018 Tim Cook is Apple’s highest-paid CEO and the fourth-highest-paid CEO in the United States Cook is an extremely active and public executive He is open about his political and charitable donations (which have increased under his leadership) and is vocal about his support or opposition to social problems and political issues He regularly begins his workday around 4:30 every morning In 2015 Cook pledged to donate his fortune to charity Yet as the CEO of one of the most powerful companies in the world all the work done by Apple ultimately is his responsibility to justify This includes censoring online content in China removing apps that protestors in Hong Kong used to organize exploiting poor workers in third-world countries and more Cook was the first CEO of a Fortune 500 company to come out as gay Luca Maestri is an Italian businessman with experience as an executive at General Motors (NYSE:GM) Nokia Networks and Xerox Maestri was appointed as CFO in 2014 Like the other executives on this list Maestri’s actual salary is much lower than his final compensation All high-level executives are eligible for Apple’s performance-based cash bonus program and receive significant stock and equity as compensation Jeff Williams joined Apple in 1998 the same year as Tim Cook and became the vice president of operations in 2004 He became the COO of Apple in 2015 following the shakeup of the executive team by Cook In 2019 leadership changes in Apple meant that Williams now leads the Industrial Design and Human Interface Design departments Williams played a significant part in the launch of the iPhone and has led global iPod and iPhone operations ever since Kate Adams is an experienced attorney with experience at Sidley Austin LLP in New York general counsel at Honeywell a trial attorney for the United States Department of Justice a law clerk for Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O’Connor and much more For whatever reason Adams is the only Apple executive who receives media scrutiny for her compensation Dozens of articles reacting to her high pay were published in January of 2024 alone while other members of the team have no articles about their compensation Deirdre O’Brien oversees everything having to do with Apple’s employees from recruiting and employee development to partnerships benefits and diversity along with her retail responsibilities She is the longest-serving employee of Apple joining the company in 1988 straight out of college She was appointed to her current position

along the way Tim Cook calls O’Brien the “Veep of People” since she runs the HR division She was one of the first people to join Cook’s operations team when he joined the company in 1998 In 2019 she

When viewed alongside bull cases for the stock like the companys long track record of good capital-allocation decisions a $51 billion net-cash position and the optionality for new potential product lines over the next decade I think the answer is yes With Apple shares falling several percentage points on the first trading day of the year it may be a good time to buy shares of one of the most resilient tech companies in the world Could shares rise to $250 by the end of the year like Ives thinks they will? Its possible But investors who buy shares shouldnt be looking for a quick fix As always investors who buy stocks should have long time horizons -- typically five years or more Over this horizon Apple stock looks poised to do well Suzanne Frey an executive at Alphabet is a member of The Motley Fools board of directors Daniel Sparks has no position in any of the stocks mentioned His clients may own shares of the companies mentioned The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Alphabet Apple and Microsoft The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy Invest better with The Motley Fool Get stock recommendations portfolio guidance and more from The Motley Fools premium services Making the world smarter happier and richer © 1995 - 2024 The Motley Fool All rights reserved Market data powered by Xignite and Polygonio"

Well that depends on what metrics youre considering Looking at its price-to-earnings and price-to-sales ratios Apple doesnt strike me as overvalued especially compared to other big tech companies like Nvidia and Microsoft AAPL PE Ratio data by YCharts Even if Apples current valuation seems high it shouldnt deter long-term investors If youre waiting for the perfect time to invest in Apple (or any stock for that matter) you may never invest in it A decade from now you may not even remember whether or not Apple was overvalued If you have reservations but are interested in investing in Apple I recommend dollar-cost averaging your way into a stake Dollar-cost averaging can help reduce the impact of volatility and hedge against any sudden drops that may happen Apple has been one of the premier companies of our generation and still has plenty of growth opportunities in front of it Its a stock you can feel comfortable holding onto for a long time John Mackey former CEO of Whole Foods Market an Amazon subsidiary is a member of The Motley Fools board of directors Suzanne Frey an executive at Alphabet is a member of The Motley Fools board of directors Stefon Walters has positions in Apple and Microsoft The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Alphabet Amazon Apple Goldman Sachs Group Microsoft and Nvidia The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy Invest better with The Motley Fool Get stock recommendations portfolio guidance and more from The Motley Fools premium services Making the world smarter happier and richer © 1995 - 2024 The Motley Fool All rights reserved Market data powered by Xignite and Polygonio"

28,"Forget Apple: 3 Magnificent Seven Stocks to Buy Instead","1/9/2024","https://finance.yahoo.com/news/forget-apple-3-magnificent-seven-114500809.html","The Magnificent Seven stocks led the market in 2023 and many believe they will do it again in 2024 This cohort headlined by the big tech stars includes: Apple Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) Microsoft Nvidia Tesla Apple is one of the most prominent companies within this group especially with its consumer-facing products Its also the worlds largest company valued at $287 trillion (compared to Microsofts $275 trillion) However I dont think its worth the investment right now especially when this group has three better stocks to choose from Years ago Apples stock was reasonably valued Now its not Apples stock trades for around 30 times earnings -- a level reserved for perfectly executing companies growing at an above-market pace While its hard to dispute Apples execution its revenue shrank every quarter in 2023 As a result Apple has a long way to go to earn its valuation However three stocks within the Magnificent Seven are cheaper and growing faster than Apple making them superior investments for 2024 Of the remaining six I think Alphabet Amazon and Meta Platforms make for stronger buys While Alphabet and Meta have other investments and businesses they are primarily advertising businesses In late 2022 and early 2023 this industry struggled However in Q3 they lapped those comparisons which allowed their ad divisions to grow much faster than in previous quarters (Metas ad revenue grew 24% to $336 billion and Alphabets rose 94% to $596 billion) The same tailwinds that boosted these two in Q3 will prevail throughout Q4 and 2024 setting them up for a strong year Amazon also has an ad division but it didnt experience the same weakness as the other two because its ad segment is relatively new (at least compared to Meta and Alphabet) However the rise of ads and other high-margin segments marks the transition of Amazon from solely an e-commerce business to one with vital services As a result Amazons gross margins have substantially risen over the past decade with AWS (its cloud computing division) ad services subscriptions and third-party seller services High gross margins allow for better profit margins which have also risen alongside its gross margin This paints an optimal picture for Amazon as it is finally turning the corner to become a consistently profitable business This is something investors havent experienced before making 2024 an exciting year for Amazon With these three there is a lot of excitement and buzz about what 2024 could be With Apple the consensus is: I hope the iPhone weakness doesnt get worse I prefer to invest in more optimistic companies making these three no-brainers compared to Apple Theyre also priced a lot more competitively From a forward-looking perspective Meta and Alphabet are far cheaper than Apple Historically these two have traded around the same range as Apple which means their stocks are slated for strong growth in 2024 Amazon is much harder to compare because its in an entirely different business and hasnt had a full year of optimized profits However if you consider analyst revenue estimates for Amazons 2024 fiscal year and if the company can pull off an 85% profit margin for the entire year it will produce nearly $50 billion in profits With Amazons current market cap that would price the stock at 31 times 2024 earnings which is still more expensive than Apples valuation However thats a short-term view as Amazon is just starting its optimization journey As a result I still think Amazon will outperform Apple by a wide margin over the next few years and could increase its profit margin even more Apple may have been the stock to own over the past decade but there are much better options now Should you invest $1000 in Alphabet right now?

Will it take a decade to get it down to the price of a MacBook Air? Will the weight get shrunk enough that you could wear it all day? These are all major questions that we don’t know I know that when the Apple Watch was originally released it was all about the digital connection aspect and morphed into a health and fitness device over time The original iPhone couldn’t record video or send picture messages but today those are probably the most common use cases My advice to anyone looking at the possible use cases of Vision Pro at work is to stay curious Even if you don’t want any part of the Vision Pro today don’t judge what the platform can evolve in 5-10 years Apple bringing device management support to the Vision Pro is your signal to begin dreaming Be Curious Not Judgmental FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links More Check out 9to5Mac on YouTube for more Apple news: Apple @ Work is a 9to5Mac series where Bradley C… Bradley lives in Chattanooga TN Tips feedback corrections and questions can be sent to Bradley@9to5maccom The MacBook Air is the best value on the market for laptops The best day to day headphones for iOS and macOS"

38,"None","2/19/2024","https://news.yahoo.com/apple-vision-pro-doesn-t-074200971.html","There are many technically impressive aspects of Apple’s Vision Pro the digital face eater the tech giant released earlier this month But perhaps the most fascinating element is EyeSight which displays a dynamic digital rendering of your eyes (or generic eyes if you don’t choose to personalize it) on the device’s front screen Smize and the device smizes with you Cry though and it sounds like EyeSight will not display your tears This function features prominently in the Vision Pro ad that has followed me around the internet for weeks It’s a close crop of a woman in her 20s with perfect skin and bouncy hair staring into the camera She makes eye contact—well “eye contact”—with the audience: What we see is not her eyes of course but her EyeSight Apple hopes that this facsimile is enough to fool our lizard brains and CEO Tim Cook has even insisted that this “augmented reality” with its high-resolution internal live stream of one’s surroundings will actually keep us in touch with the world around us People donning the Vision Pro may be able to convince themselves they are still connected to others—to family and friends and colleagues—despite the bulky computers strapped to their faces But they will never be able to convince anyone else The spark of human connection we feel making eye contact with EyeSight is a fraud and even our lizard brains will know it I have not tested a Vision Pro or encountered one in person and I realize that may discredit my case with some readers But for all its technical novelty and glint when it comes to human connection the Vision Pro differs from familiar screens in degree more than kind When we are absorbed in an ordinary screen it is obvious to those around us Even very small children can tell when we’re giving them half our attention making half a human connection (I speak from regrettable experience) You no doubt know what this is like having been on both sides of such conversations yourself: the little half-glances upward the slightly too frequent confusion over a simple narrative (wait who said that?) the steady murmurs of mhm and yeah wow and oh totally meant to suggest at least some attention is diverted from the screen The face computer will be this but worse The same disconnect only more apparent Talking to someone while looking at their EyeSight—while they look through you to the Word document in the middle distance—will never feel quite like a normal human interaction It can’t because it isn’t a normal human interaction It’s half an interaction at best mediated by an animation expressly designed to fool our loved ones into forgetting we have other more absorbing things in view Apple’s trailer for the Vision Pro couldn’t disguise this fact particularly in its depiction of a father who wears the device while interacting with his kids then uses it to review videos of them while sitting on his couch The time with the children is bad enough He’s positioned just a little too far from them half his face concealed while they play with each other and make halfhearted attempts to include the digital hybrid crouching where their father should be But the father’s rewatch of the interaction on the couch is even worse He sits alone in a darkening room—a spotless gorgeous room bereft of any sign of childish inhabitants—gazing at happier moments in which he chose not to participate His smile beneath the screen is no doubt intended to communicate happy nostalgia but it plays instead as sorrow If EyeSight showed tears surely we’d see them Why is he alone like this too lonely to even turn on the lights? Is he divorced? Did his whole family die in a freak accident? Either explanation is more plausible than the patently ridiculous notion that this man is having a good time “Relive a memory as if you’re right back in the exact moment” the narrator offers over the couch scene though all the evidence suggests this man did not actually live the moment the first time around Maybe he can tell himself he’s connecting with his kids Outside the goggles however it’s obvious he has not augmented reality; he’s sacrificed it Apple’s long-term plan for the Vision Pro likely does not include EyeSight with the not-yet-attainable goal being a device that looks like normal glasses and includes a single transparent screen that can change from clear to shaded and back again—like those transition lenses your uncle uses That effect if achieved might feel a little more natural But the user’s attention would be no less divided and the human connection no less inadequate This disconnect has implications beyond personal relationships especially for the work uses laid out in this Wall Street Journal review The Vision Pro may be good for some kinds of focused desk work though I have my doubts (I also suspect a certain somnolent effect) For any kind of social or collaborative work and especially any situation with power dynamics in play the artifice and interruption of normal interaction will be a serious detriment Can you tap someone on the shoulder to talk when they’re off in a digital world? Can you ask your supervisor to take off her face computer and give you her full attention? Do you just have to gut through a presentation to a conference room full of EyeSights? Imagine asking for a raise via Vision Pro’s video chat using Apple’s Personas the full digital avatar of which EyeSight is just one part How do you have that conversation in Uncanny Valley? How do you gauge your conversation partner’s reactions when they’ve undergone digital Botox? How do you ask for due recognition of your skill and expertise while taking the form of a cartoon? And it’s not just those slightly awkward compensation conversations Imagine trying to make a sale like that Or working through a contentious project plan Or firing someone Or telling your boss you need the day off because your mom just died This is not a medium for serious adult human interaction Even a phone call would offer a better connection a connection not glazed with half-truth None of this is to suggest there are zero good use cases here Some early coverage suggests the device might prove an asset in the quest to expand accessibility And set aside all this nonsense about staying connected and the Vision Pro sounds like a nice toy Good for streaming TV I bet though I’ll personally stick with holding ye olde-fashioned iPhone four inches from my face I’m not going to pony up $3500 just to put a new screen two inches closer But hey if they can figure out a good way to clean the fabric-looking part—and if I turn out to have a rich elderly uncle of whom I’m currently unaware—I’ll happily try the one included in my suite on Emirates first class Read more at The Dispatch The Dispatch is a new digital media company providing engaged citizens with fact-based reporting and commentary informed by conservative principles Sign up for free"

Apple Vision Pro is Apples first new product in nine years since the Apple Watch in 2015 It is a future strategy introduced by Apple which did not produce any new technologies or results last year when it was hot due to the AI craze But according to Bullumberg a significant number of customers have recently returned their Vision Pro It was because the device was too heavy too cumbersome to manage and caused headaches It has been criticized for not being more productive than using an external monitor when working CEO Zuckerberg of Meta which is dominating the headset market with virtual reality (VR) devices used Vision Pro himself and left a review Many people think that Vision Pro will be better in quality because it is $3000 (about 4 million won) but I was surprised that Quest is much better for most uses Zuckerberg said Metas VR device Quest 3 is 120g lighter than Vision Pro The key to a VR or MR headset is 1) It shouldnt be heavy to wear on the head 2) It should be affordable 3) It should not be stuttering (delay) We can meet our customers needs only if we meet the above three The degree of stuttering is seen as a problem that can be overcome by the sophisticated development of the software However Vision Pro is still heavy (600g) to wear on the head You need to be able to use it often to increase utilization so youll have a headache every time you use it Perhaps theres a price at the base that highlights all the problems more Quest 3 a VR device that was previously the best-selling device in the market costs $499 (about 670000 won) for the basic type while the non-pro basic type costs $3499 (about 468 million won) People who buy and use MR headsets are likely to have already used VR devices and they paid seven times more but they didnt have a particularly better experience After the launch of Vision Pro it became clear that the MR headset market was still in the development stage Bloomberg said Given the initial response to the first version it will take a long time for some (waiting for the second generation) The vision programs eye tracking function is really good Zuckerberg praised Quests previous model had similar features and were going to add it back to the future model he said Matthew Panjano editor-in-chief of IT specialized media Tech Crunch also said The movements gaze tracking is almost perfect adding It is a real leap in the function and execution of mixed reality Apples eye-tracking feature is attributed to the company using two of Apples self-developed M2 chips and R1 chips in Vision Pros semiconductors The M2 is a chip used in Mac computers and iPads Existing M2 chips are used for overall vision pro operations and R1 chips are used independently for camera sensor and microphone driving In particular this eye tracking function plays a big role in R1 chips The R1 chip can stream new images to the display in 12 ㎳ (millissecond one ㎳ is one-thousandth of a second) eight times faster than the blink time The R1 chip processes information entered by 12 cameras 5 sensors and 6 microphones to make the content feel like it looks real-time in front of the users eyes It reduces delay as much as possible and prevents digital motion sickness that is motion sickness caused by delay associations Although the issue of the usability of Vision Pro is still large the commercialization itself can be seen as a new electricity for Apple in semiconductor design and production Metas Quest series which dominated the virtual reality headset market also uses Qualcomms Snapdragon XR2 while Apple uses its own semiconductors If you use your own semiconductor you can be more free from supply and demand than receiving and using goods If you drastically reduce the cost you can leave a huge margin Above all Apple confirmed early that designing semiconductors that fit the finished product will increase the completeness of the product This is because software runs smoothly only when you have hardware equipped with its own semiconductor Apple has received architecture (design) from British fabless company Arm and is designing chips to suit its products Indeed Apple has significantly increased its own semiconductor design resources in recent decades In particular we have been steadily acquiring semiconductor companies PA Semi (processor) in 2008 Anovit (flash memory) in 2011 Otentech (biometrics sensor) in 2012 and Dialogue (power management) in 2018 In addition Apple expanded its semiconductor patent portfolio by acquiring 9000 US patent assets from Nortel Networks Panasonic and others This power has been demonstrated by designing increasingly capable processors such as M1 M2 and R1 chips Finally in October last year we also released the M3 series TSMCs 3-nano process was used It is installed on the professional laptop MacBook Pro and the all-in-one desktop iMac Apple Silicon has allowed Apple to create the most powerful product line in the history of personal computers said Tim Cook CEO of Apple Only Apple can operate an integrated ecosystem that encompasses hardware (HW) software (SW) and semiconductors The problem is that semiconductor development requires a long time This is why analysts say that Apple is already developing a Mac processor to unveil in 2026 Computer Worlds Johnny Evans said The Mac processor which will only be unveiled in 2026 will be equipped with a new on-chip technology that no one outside Apple Labs has ever heard of at this point Looking at it that way you might think that the M3 MacBook Pro the biggest concern right now is a reflection of the decisions Apple has already made even before it unveiled its first M1 Mac In fact Apple spent a whopping $30 billion on research and development during fiscal 2023 Considering that R&D costs were $18 billion when we first switched to Apple silicon chips in 2010 its a 16-fold increase Thats why its more important what chips will be on board than a simple upgrade of Apples Vision Pro Rather than dismissing Vision Pro as not as good as I thought its time to focus on what kind of technological evolution Apple is making 2024-03-21

44,"None","2/24/2024","https://au.finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-reveals-details-spotifys-business-223014774.html","With the European Commission set to rule on Spotifys complaint focused on competition in the streaming music market there are hints that the ruling will not be in Apples favor This week the Financial Times reported the EC will issue its first-ever fine against the tech giant for allegedly breaking EU law over competition in the streaming music market The fine is expected to be around €500 million (about $539 million USD) the report noted Instead of chalking up the fine as the cost of doing business as a company that made history as the first to be valued at $3 trillion surely could the tech giant is taking the fight to the public In a statement shared with media today Apple argued against the idea that Spotify has been harmed by any anticompetitive practices on its part (The statement was not issued by a single spokesperson but rather comes from Apple itself) It reads: We’re happy to support the success of all developers — including Spotify which is the largest music streaming app in the world Spotify pays Apple nothing for the services that have helped them build update and share their app with Apple users in 160 countries spanning the globe Fundamentally their complaint is about trying to get limitless access to all of Apple’s tools without paying anything for the value Apple provides Apple pointed out also that Spotify has a 56% share of the market compared with 20% for Amazon Music and Apple Musics 11% per MIDiAs 2022 report on the subscription music market In addition Apple shared a number of non-public details about Spotifys business as it pertains to Apples platforms including for example that Spotify uses thousands of Apples APIs across 60 frameworks; that Spotify uses Apples beta testing platform TestFlight; that Spotify has submitted over 420 versions of its app to App Review which were approved; and even that Apple engineers have helped Spotify solve various challenges like those impacting hardware-accelerated media playback and battery optimization And for those number watchers out there Apple also said that Spotifys app had been downloaded re-downloaded or updated more than 119 billion times across Apple devices -- a stat we had not heard before we should note The fact that Apple is front-running the ECs decision with its own commentary is remarkable in and of itself It speaks to a company that so solidly believes that its doing the best thing for its own customers and developer partners that any sort of ruling that deems otherwise is so absurd that it demands comment and pushback Apple believes its system of in-app purchases for things like music subscriptions saves consumers not only the headache and inconvenience of having to visit external websites on the iPhones small screen -- they can just click the side button instead -- but also protects against fraud excess data collection consumer confusion over cancellations and errant purchases by children (Of course Apple is familiar with the latter itself) Apple believes that Spotify only wants to increase its profits by leveraging regulations to its advantage In the case of the EU complaint the concern is that Apples App Store distorts competition in the music streaming market It is not solely a complaint that Spotify has been harmed in other words but that the nature of the App Store may have thwarted other rivals Spotify is a big player in the music streaming market but we don’t know what would have been the conditions without this EVP and competition chief Margrethe Vestager said about the ECs investigation back in 2021 There are other rivals to Apple Music — there are Deezer there are Soundcloud Smaller competitors and here we have real concerns about their developments This is not a Spotify case — this is a music streaming case she noted Spotify however has been the loudest of the Apple Music rivals and has fought against the company on other matters for instance by calling Apples new DMA rules extortion and a complete and total farce To protect its interests (and Apple argues consumers) Apples response to the EUs DMA (Digital Markets Act) regulation is the introduction of a new system that requires developers to pay for its services beyond just App Store payment processing Rather it now separates payment processing from other services by levying a Core Technology Fee for those developers who want to do business under the new DMA rules In other words it wants developers to pay Apple for the work it does to create and maintain its iOS platform where apps can run rather than acknowledging that access to consumers favorite apps helps sell its iPhones For the record Apple disputes Spotifys claims that its been harmed by any anticompetitive practices It speaks to the success Spotify has seen over the years having grown its streaming app over eight years from 25 million to 160 million subscribers -- a 27% average growth rate It points out that Spotify users regularly subscribe to the service outside its app and that Spotify qualifies for the Reader app exception to Apples rules which allows it to link directly to its website for account creation and payment similar to Netflix However Apple seems to ignore the fact that Spotify turning a quarterly profit still makes headlines that it just laid off 17% of its workforce and that you know Spotify does face competition on iOS globally from Apple Music which is preinstalled on iPhones iPads and other Apple devices In addition to being offered as a standalone service Apples music streaming app is upsold to customers as part of the Apple One bundles which combine multiple Apple services like iCloud+ News+ Apple TV+ and others under one roof Apple also stresses how closely Spotify has worked with the Commission on its complaint having met with the regulators more than 65 times since the investigation began The investigation however has been ongoing for years A rep for the EC declined to comment on news related to Spotifys complaint or any pending fines The FT had reported the fine is expected to be announced early next month Spotify responded to Apples statement with one of its own saying: Spotify’s success has happened despite Apples best efforts to gain an artificial advantage by favoring their own music service at every turn while placing roadblocks and imposing unfair restrictions on ours Under their current rules Apple controls Spotify’s access to its own customers and gives Spotify one of two untenable options: We either have to deliver a poor user experience where we can’t directly communicate how to buy or subscribe to Spotify on iPhones or we have to accept a 30% cost disadvantage against our biggest competitor This is not a level playing field We support the European Commission and trust that they will take action soon to create a fair ecosystem for everyone

58,"How Apple is Juicing Payments – Digital Transactions","3/1/2024","https://www.digitaltransactions.net/magazine_articles/how-apple-is-juicing-payments/","John Stewart March 1 2024 The iPhone maker is known for its impeccable technology What is less obvious is its nuanced but multipronged assault on the payments business Ask anyone on the street what Apple Inc does and such is the company’s fame that even the least technology-inclined will respond immediately with examples like the Mac computer the iPhone or lately the VisionPro virtual-reality headset Some may cite Apple Pay or even tap-to-pay on iPhone But few will think of the consumer-tech Goliath as a payments company Until now “Definitely they’re a fintech company at this point” says Sheridan Trent director of market intelligence at TSG an Omaha Neb-based payments research firm “Are they a payments company? They’re definitely trending in that direction” Surprised? Long-time Apple watchers aren’t The company has for years made forays into payments-related ventures with the advent of the iPhone in 2007 setting the stage Here was a device that was sold as a mobile phone but that could ultimately serve as a wallet with the power to make online and contactless payments—all with the notoriously strict oversight commonly exercised by the notoriously fussy management in Cupertino Sure enough seven years later came Apple Pay with Apple Wallet tucked along for the ride At the center of just about all of this activity is the iPhone a now iconic device that commands an estimated 24% share of all new smart-phone sales Name the payment service it’s available on the phone—a device tightly controlled by Apple So tightly controlled indeed that the company has attracted the notice of skeptical courts snappish regulators and disgruntled app developers as well as much speculation about its intentions not only in payments but in that crucial gateway to financial transactions—personal identity “It’s strategy is not obvious to the casual observer” notes Richard Crone who has observed Apple’s moves for years as proprietor at Crone Consulting LLC a San Carlos Calif-based firm “Paymentization is where the golden nugget is” Record Revenue Apple is characteristically tightlipped about the numbers behind its products and services but it’s especially quiet when it comes to its ventures in payments A spokesperson for the company did not respond to repeated messages regarding an interview for this story So quiet is Apple’s approach to payments in fact that it surprised veteran observers late in January when it uncharacteristically announced that its Apple Card a Mastercard credit card it launched in 2019 with Goldman Sachs as the issuer had attracted 12 million cardholders (Goldman unfamiliar with consumer credit last summer began negotiating with Apple to exit its role as the card’s issuer) The product includes a physical card—said to be made of titanium—along with a digital version chiefly intended for use with the iPhone and its Apple Pay digital wallet The release included other numbers about the card including the fact that users last year earned more than $1 billion in “Daily Cash” when using the card (users earn 1% 2% or 3% on purchases depending on the merchant and such factors as whether Apple Pay is used) In a key move Apple equipped its phone with a near-field communication chip that works with Apple Pay That enables owners to make contactless payments in stores—allowing the phone to reap a share of the growing trade in in-person digital-wallet traffic But while revelations from Cupertino are rare observers can profit from paying close attention to Apple’s earnings calls The size of the company’s payments business has become a matter of concern for investors not only because of its increasing importance on the balance sheet but also because of litigation in the US market and action by the European Commission overseas Apple doesn’t disclose what it earns on payments but it dropped a hint on an earnings call Feb 1 held to discuss its December-quarter results On the call the company celebrated what it called a record for quarterly revenue in its Services business some $231 billion worldwide To put that number in perspective in the same quarter Apple took in $697 billion just on iPhone sales But the company also noted that its payments revenue which is a component of that Services number also hit a record high Apple earns money from Apple Pay transaction fees charged to merchants and on interest on funds held in Apple Pay Cash Gene Munster a managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management estimates revenue from Apple Pay alone accounts for conservatively 3% of that Services number or about $700 million in the December quarter—some $28 billion if we simply annualize the number without seasonal factors That number includes various fees but principally of course Apple’s share of Goldman’s interchange The advantage to Apple is that payments creates value—and hence relevance—for Apple Pay Munster says With payments he says a digital wallet “becomes more important” to Apple as the company collects “a fraction of transaction value” On the flipside though the digital wallet becomes more than just another feature “You have to have a wallet or your phone is going to become irrelevant” Munster warns Regulatory Rumbles But if Apple has pursued a clear strategy in payments and has pushed that strategy with help from the company’s hardware it has lately faced pushback from courts and regulators In a case that could have far-reaching implications for Apple the company has had to bend the knee to the European Commission which in 2022 concluded the company restricts competition by monopolizing access to the iPhone’s NFC chip a violation the commission said of Europe’s Digital Marketing Act To appease the regulator Apple said it would allow third parties to access the chip; offer new features for users including access to payments apps they may prefer; and refrain from discriminating against competing developers It was a clear breach of the company’s longstanding walled garden The Commission in January began seeking reaction to Apple’s proposal The EU action came on top of a 2021 verdict in a US antitrust lawsuit against Apple in which Epic Games a major digital-game developer lost on nine of 10 counts But the one count on which it prevailed calls on Apple to allow app developers to process payments through pipes outside of Apple’s walls if they so choose As a result Apple slapped a 27% fee on app sales which comes on top of the approximately 3% the developer would have incurred anyway for marked-up interchange on credit card transactions That gave Apple “ridiculously high margins on in-app payments” notes Stewart Watterson a strategic advisor for retail banking and payments at Datos Insights The move had at least one other effect “It wipes out any saving you would have had by not using Apple’s payment system” says Eric Grover a Minden Nev-based payments consultant Other observers argue developers will stick with Apple in any case “It eliminates some liability for app creators I would imagine a lot of developers would continue to rely on Apple’s payment system” argues TSG’s Trent Against the backdrop of the EU case the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has also taken note of what it calls “big tech firms in mobile payments” noting in reports it issued in September and November that Apple’s restrictions on its NFC capability could hurt consumer choice and dampen competition With Apple’s example clearly in view the CFPB in November proposed that it should have supervisory authority over “larger” technology companies “that offer digital wallets and payment apps” That puts Alphabet Inc’s Google platform in the regulator’s sights in addition to Apple though in contrast to Apple the NFC chip on Android phones is owned and controlled by the network operator The Bureau has become notably more activist in payments since the 2021 appointment of Rohit Chopra a former McKinsey & Co executive and Treasury Department student loan ombudsman as its director Notes Grover: “You have Rohit Chopra trying to figure out how to go after Apple and Google This story isn’t over in the United States” Still payments firms appear to be ready to take advantage of any opening the EU case might create for them at Apple In an earnings call in early February PayPal Holdings Inc chief executive Alex Chriss said the company was “tracking this very closely” according to a transcript of the event Customers he said “are demanding being able to have an omnichannel and offline solution as well So we’ll be working closely on this” The Identity Gambit But some observers aren’t convinced Apple is into payments simply to provide a lucrative convenience or added service for iPhone users The real purpose they argue lies deeper “Identity the identification validation authorization of payment hasn’t changed It’s about to change dramatically” argues consultant Crone By controlling payments on its devices—the iPhone installed base alone has reached an all-time high Apple said in its February earnings call without citing a number—Apple will ultimately control a system of record that could authenticate user IDs and authorize transactions with unheard-of accuracy and on an unheard-of mass scale That Crone says is the Holy Grail that lies behind the company’s drive for device installations with biometric user verification such as facial recognition on the iPhone Iris scans he predicts will be next “Being the system of record for the federated ID is the long-term gain for Apple” he says The jackpot in all this Crone argues will lie the addition of government IDs such as driver’s licenses passports or visas “There’s no bank that can do this because they don’t have the token the iPhone” he points out Payments he argues is a means to an end “The endgame is identity What government entity won’t play?” he asks Depending on various factors Crone says the revenue from ID services spread across an estimated 22 billion active devices—the number Apple cited in its earnings report—could amount to anywhere from $84 billion to $516 billion annually “Whoever is the system of record for ID will shift value creation from processors to someone like Apple” Crone argues The real value though lies in Apple’s mastery of biometrics he says though he adds a close rival in this game could be Amazoncom Inc with its Amazon One technology What about the card networks? After all they’re the platforms that made digital payments possible in the first place Here Crone is dismissive “Visa and Mastercard are a dumb pipe” he says “They left ID to Apple and Google” Not all Apple observers are quite as enthusiastic about this play “It sounds good but there are too many hurdles in the way privacy for example” argues Brian Riley director of the credit advisory service at Javelin Strategy & Research “I don’t know how it would ever be executed” Even if it were “executed” it would “represent monopolistic control” Riley says “And that doesn’t play well” The question now confronting the payments business is how well that business can contend with a resourceful tech company that clearly has designs on a much bigger slice of a payments pie it has spent years sinking its teeth into Maybe everyone will just have to think different March 21 2024 March 21 2024 March 21 2024 Digital wallets accounted for $139 trillion in payments volume last year or 50% of e-commerce … Search Entire SiteSearch by TopicSearch Entire Site Search for: Search by Topic Choose Topic Topics All Topics Acquiring (5345) ATMs (518) Automated Clearing House (791) Breaking News (5) Competitive Strategies (6973) Credit Cards (3456) Debit Cards (3214) Digital Currency (975) E-Commerce (3756) Electronic Bill Payment (539) Electronic Checks (452) Fraud & Security (1930) Issuing/Originating (2211) Kiosks & Ticketing Machines (154) Law and Regulation (1072) Magazine (26) Marketing (2154) Mergers & Acquisitions (878) Mobile Commerce (3493) Mobile Wallets (2040) Near-Field Communication (NFC) (868) Person-to-Person Payments (824) Point-of-sale (2353) Prepaid Cards (716) Presented By (3) Pricing (1132) Radio Frequency Technology (247) Real-time Payments (342) Remote Deposit Capture (80) Smart Cards (542) Sponsored Content (133) Transaction Processing (6617) Uncategorized (81) Vending (113) Search Chosen Topic If Top Card Execs Must Testify So Shoul posted on 02-15-2024 For Cap One the Pulse Network Is the ‘R posted on 02-20-2024 Capital One May Acquire Discover What C posted on 02-19-2024 With 2024 Looming the EPC Vows to Conti posted on 12-20-2023 Global’s ‘Profac’ Model Starts Paying Di posted on 02-14-2024"

To explore whether or not shares are attractive today lets look at both the bear and bull cases for the tech stock The bear case for Apple (the case against owning the stock) can be summarized in two points: Regarding the Cupertino-based companys growth fiscal 2023 revenue fell nearly 3% year over year Further earnings per share barely budged coming in at $613 for the period -- up from $611 in the year-ago quarter A pullback in iPhone sales and a dramatic decline in Mac sales weighed on the years results Foreign exchange headwinds were also a major factor pulling down revenue and earnings Also raising some eyebrows is the stocks valuation Over the last year the stocks price-to-earnings ratio has gone from 22 to more than 30 Viewed another way the company has a $29 trillion market capitalization despite annual earnings only coming in at $97 billion This high valuation bakes in robust earnings-per-share growth for years to come More specifically a valuation at this level demands average annual earnings-per-share growth in the mid-to-high single digits over the next decade and more importantly continued market dominance in lucrative segments like its iPhone and services businesses But dont count Apple out The bull case (the case for owning the stock) highlights several reasons the company could deliver strong earnings growth in the coming years First theres Apples fast-growing services segment This segment which includes revenue from services like Apple Pay Apple Music AppleCare and revenue share from third-party applications in the App Store grew 16% year over year in Apples most recent fiscal quarter Further management said the company expects similar growth when adjusted to exclude revenue from the extra week in the year-ago period in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 Longer term theres good reason to expect Apples momentum in services to persist The tailwinds for the segment are numerous including a nascent but meaningful advertising business Apples ability to bring new services to market over time and rapid growth in third-party app subscriptions Another reason to be bullish on Apple stock is its strong balance sheet combined with managements excellent track record of good capital allocation The company ended fiscal Q4 with a net cash and marketable securities position of $51 billion With a goal to become cash neutral (the point at which total cash and marketable securities equals total debt) over time Apple has been steadily repurchasing its shares and paying dividends Further Apple has a history of opportunistically buying back more stock when shares appear cheaper This prudent approach to repurchases makes every dollar go further than if the company purchased the same amount of shares every quarter no matter where the stock traded Of course with annual free cash flow of nearly $100 billion its going to take some time for Apple to become net cash neutral So investors can expect the company to repurchase shares in substantial sums and pay meaningful dividends for the foreseeable future Combining these positive developments (a fast-growing services segment and prudent capital allocation backed by a healthy balance sheet) with the companys loyal customer base and Apples long history of innovation the tech stock arguably deserves to trade at a premium valuation While it may not make sense to be an aggressive buyer of Apple stock at this valuation it may make sense for investors without exposure to the stock to start a small position following its recent dip Daniel Sparks has no position in any of the stocks mentioned His clients may own shares of the companies mentioned The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Apple The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy Invest better with The Motley Fool Get stock recommendations portfolio guidance and more from The Motley Fools premium services Making the world smarter happier and richer © 1995 - 2024 The Motley Fool All rights reserved Market data powered by Xignite and Polygonio"

Annabelle Chih/Getty Images News TSMC (NYSE:TSM) is and will likely remain for years to come a prudent choice to invest in the semiconductor industry which has been and is expected to remain a growing market over time As a (pure play) foundry TSMC derives its revenue from hundreds of customers including a dozen or so major ones However one key risk for what would otherwise be a relatively low-risk company with a very digestible valuation (outside of perhaps some geopolitical concerns) that is becoming increasingly apparent is the rise in competition at the leading edge which is both the largest and fastest-growing part of the market This could ultimately result in market share and pricing power loss or even the (almost) complete loss of customers in the case TSMC would be unable to provide them with the technology that allows them to be successful in their own markets (ie loss of process leadership) My prior coverage on the stock from over half a year remains relevant (as the thesis as described there continues to play out): TSMC: Losing Leadership Apple (AAPL) as its largest customer has been a major contributor to TSMCs success over time Both in terms of revenue (perhaps on the order of 20-25% of total revenue) but also as primary adopter of basically all of TSMCs latest nodes for the last decade which the companies do partner closely According to this source Apple accounted for $175B of TSMCs 2022 revenue However recently Apple Silicon lead Johny Srouji and John Ternus Senior VP of hardware engineering said some quite concerning things in an interview (emphasis mine) We do rely on TSMC for a good part of our internal chips…Its actually very complicated Those transistor technologies are very advanced and complicated but I distill it down to a few principles: We always want to deliver and build the best chips on the planet for the best products So thats the North Star And that means we need to have access to the best tools including the best transistor technology So thats extremely important - Srouji Srouji said Apple needs the best process technology The issue here for TSMC is that it is on a quick pace to lose the leadership it inherited due to Intels (INTC) stumbles around 10/7nm back to Intel (around 2nm) Coincidentally Intel also started a foundry business Some have already speculated the prepayment Intel received to accelerate the build-out of its 18A Arizona fab even was from Apple Although I wouldnt go that far yet altogether these developments do mean that the Apple foundry business is right open for grabbing for anyone who can deliver to Apple what it deems is its North Star Indeed further in the interview he confirmed that Apple is not religious about partnering with TSMC 8/11 Srouji said that while diversification of the supply chain is important his first principal is key: where can you get the best technology and where can you get the scale if some foundry has that and they meet our requirements we are always exploring - including outside of Taiwan Note that while Intel is new to the foundry business there certainly shouldnt be any concerns about scale As a (primarily) CPU company most of Intels manufacturing capacity has always been on the leading edge and given its ambitions in foundry (and growth in general) Intel has been planning and building many new fabs including in Arizona ($30B) Ohio ($20B initially) Germany ($30B initially) and Israel ($25B) As a further recent indication of how TSMC seems to be struggling to keep up in the upcoming gate-all-around transistor era this recent TSMC roadmap shows how the A10 node is planned for 2030 On the surface this seems to keep up with Moores Law which is slowing down from a 2-year towards a 3-year cadence and indeed this roadmap has gaps of either 2 or 3 years between nodes TSMC TSMC However the target for a monolithic chip with over 200B transistors just seems low/unambitious since even on N5 (2020) there are already monolithic chips with nearly 100B transistors Even when noting that the introduction of high-NA lithography will reduce the (maximum) size of a monolithic chip by half it remains to be seen if TSMC can re-accelerate its rate of shrinking from the slow rate at N3/N2 (similar to Intel at its 10/7nm nodes) For example if 100B is the goal for N2 (despite this already being possible with N3 although TSMC has disclosed that N2 would be a very minor shrink) then A10 with 200B transistors on half the area would require a 4x shrink in two nodes which is aligned with Moores Law Like many (including Intel) TSMC had been expecting a recovery in H2 However Q3 revenue was down 15% to $173B EPS was $129 marking a 25% decline More in general beyond the Apple risk the importance of leading-edge nodes is shown in that 7nm and below nodes accounted for 59% of revenue While TSMC already has a competitor in that segment with Samsung the added competition from Intel Foundry Services only adds further pressure especially given TSMCs expanded margins in recent years This has indeed been acknowledged by Pat Gelsinger who said TSMCs margins are so high that there is ample room to undercut TSMC on pricing and still end up with a lucrative business Note that this contrasts with some popular comments one might have read (The (leading edge) foundry industry is definitely large enough to support a few players but also so advanced that no more players could compete thereby securing the overall profitability for all competitors) So in a few years TSMC is on a path to both lose its (foundry) process leadership as well as potentially becoming a more expensive foundry in general At that point there do not seem many (if any) reasons for TSMC to maintain such a market share resulting in the loss of pricing power as well as market share Nevertheless contrary to the comment just referred to there should not be any reason to expect a race-to-the-bottom price war since both companies are very much focused on achieving high margins Looking forward even the top end of Q4 guidance would still see revenue decline by about $1B marking the fourth consecutive quarter of decline Note that this means the surge in GAI has not benefited TSMC very much since most of the gross margin dollars have gone to Nvidia (NVDA) with the BOM (bill of materials) for the H100 silicon (a few hundred dollars at most assuming on the order of 75 chips per wafer and a $15k per wafer) being pretty much a rounding error compared to the actual sales price (well into the 5 digits) Despite the forward-looking uncertainty in TSMCs business as described the company on the surface is actually very investible which remains in line with my prior analysis This is shown by the forward P/E of just 20x despite trading at the high end of its one-year range One could only guess why the stock doesnt have a higher valuation Perhaps it is the Asia/China effect that has also affected stocks such as Alibaba (BABA) Perhaps it is the Taiwan effect in particular the China invasion risk Perhaps it is just the actual financial performance with investors awaiting a new upcycle The risk of literally losing a quarter of its business while as described seems very real in reality likely isnt considered yet by investors Even if it were to happen similar to the transition from Intel to Apple silicon this would be a multiyear process even after it started with the start itself in the first place likely still years away By that time the rest of the market might have grown so much that TSMCs financials could remain quite stable compared to the current level Overall while at least in principle the risk of TSMC losing its biggest customer is a real one how to factor this into the valuation is quite tricky since the actual probability is unknown Disregarding any black swan events TSMC is an investible stock At this point perhaps even more so than its new competitor Intel as the formers valuation hasnt increased much at all yet As trends such as GAI show the semiconductor industry remains a long-term growing market so investing in a leading foundry such as TSMC which is the definite leader in terms of market share with hundreds of (major and minor) customers would be a prudent choice for investors Of course as described one possible black swan event would be the rise of new competitor Intel In fact there already seems to be some initial notable activity shown by the prepayment Intel got from an undisclosed 18A customer to accelerate the build-out of the new Arizona fabs The possibilities here range from customers looking for an alternative supplier for at least some of their chips to even completely losing the business for their flagship highest volume chips as they flock toward the best technology in the market At the end of the day at the leading edge the only that matters for TSMCs customers is how their chips stack up against their competitors Using a foundry/process that is further along the Moores Law curve to that end has been a proven strategy for decades to outcompete competitors So ultimately as quoted while Apple has not made any formal announcements it did say that it is not religious about which foundry it uses The company is only religious to the goal of creating the best possible chips Since TSMC losing its process leadership is getting ever more guaranteed (with Intel already delivering the 09 PDK of 18A to customers) this is one key risk investors will have to face as at least a possibility Beyond just Apple these competitive dynamics in general could result in loss of market share and/or pricing power putting downward pressure on revenue and earnings which could balance out any general market growth of which TSMC has been a prime

71,"Estimating The Intrinsic Value Of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)","1/21/2024","https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/tech/nasdaq-aapl/apple/news/estimating-the-intrinsic-value-of-apple-inc-nasdaqaapl","Stock Analysis Does the January share price for Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) reflect what its really worth? Today we will estimate the stocks intrinsic value by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to todays value We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose Believe it or not its not too difficult to follow as youll see from our example! We generally believe that a companys value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future However a DCF is just one valuation metric among many and it is not without flaws If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model Check out our latest analysis for Apple We are going to use a two-stage DCF model which as the name states takes into account two stages of growth The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value captured in the second steady growth period To start off with we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows Where possible we use analyst estimates but when these arent available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow over this period We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in todays dollars: (Est = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$999b After calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period we need to calculate the Terminal Value which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a countrys GDP growth In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (22%) to estimate future growth In the same way as with the 10-year growth period we discount future cash flows to todays value using a cost of equity of 82% Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$195b× (1 + 22%) ÷ (82%– 22%) = US$33t Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$33t÷ ( 1 + 82%)10= US$15t The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value which results in the Total Equity Value which in this case is US$25t The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding Relative to the current share price of US$192 the company appears around fair value at the time of writing Remember though that this is just an approximate valuation and like any complex formula - garbage in garbage out We would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a companys future performance so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry or a companys future capital requirements so it does not give a full picture of a companys potential performance Given that we are looking at Apple as potential shareholders the cost of equity is used as the discount rate rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital WACC) which accounts for debt In this calculation weve used 82% which is based on a levered beta of 1191 Beta is a measure of a stocks volatility compared to the market as a whole We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies with an imposed limit between 08 and 20 which is a reasonable range for a stable business Whilst important the DCF calculation ideally wont be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company Its not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model Preferably youd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the companys valuation For example changes in the companys cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation For Apple there are three essential aspects you should consider: PS The Simply Wall St app conducts a discounted cash flow valuation for every stock on the NASDAQGS every day If you want to find the calculation for other stocks just search here Find out whether Apple is potentially over or undervalued by checking out our comprehensive analysis which includes fair value estimates risks and warnings dividends insider transactions and financial health Have feedback on this article?

resources and more Learn More Apple (AAPL -409%) stock finished 2023 up 47% but the shares have slipped about 4% in 2024 so far Wall Street is nervous about slowing iPhone sales (roughly half of Apples business) and weakness in China where the company generates one-fifth of its sales But something is cooking in Cupertino California Apple spent 78% of its total sales last year on research and development (R&D) expenses or nearly $30 billion Thats the highest percentage of its revenue in 20 years around the time when the tech titan was expanding its iPod and music business and developing the first iPhone AAPL R&D to Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts Apples R&D has been steadily climbing over the last decade but there hasnt been a major new product since the Apple Watch in 2015 The new Vision Pro headset is coming this year but the company hasnt made any significant changes to the design of its existing products in years When we look at where Apple is investing its cash it may not necessarily point to lots of innovation on the product front but it could still have a major impact on Apples returns to investors When asked on the companys fiscal fourth-quarter earnings call CEO Tim Cook explained that the increase in R&D is going toward a lot of things: Its some things I cant talk about Its Vision Pro Its [artificial intelligence] and [machine learning] Its the silicon investment that were making the transition with the Mac and other silicon The silicon hes referring to is the transition away from Intel processors to its own chips for Mac and other products Apple has invested for many years in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning most notably in the Siri voice assistant Cook hinted theres more going on but that could mean many things for Apples product development road map The problem is that Apple is a gigantic company with $383 billion in annual revenue When the iPhone was first released in 2007 Apple was a fraction of that size The days of releasing a single device that moves the needle and sends the stock to the Moon are long gone However all the things Cook mentioned are going toward widening the companys competitive moat and building a more profitable business This explains why Warren Buffett continues to hold a massive stake in Apple stock and why investors should consider holding shares too Apple is not releasing groundbreaking new products that change the world but its enjoying a strong profit margin that is starting to trend toward record highs again This is why the stock climbed 47% in 2023 despite lower sales AAPL Profit Margin data by YCharts Higher margins can be traced back to the companys boost in R&D spending Cook mentioned some of the R&D increase is going toward AI This technology is the backbone of many features on the iPhone including Siri searching photos Face ID and the neural engine that enables the iPhones camera to capture better images These features raise customer satisfaction and spending on services which generate twice the margin of hardware products Services including sales from apps and subscriptions is Apples fastest-growing business expanding 9% year over year in fiscal 2023 Management clearly sees more growth for services over the long term Our installed base of over 2 billion active devices continues to grow at a nice pace and establishes a solid foundation for the future expansion of the ecosystem CFO Luca Maestri noted on the last earnings call Because services still only makes up 22% of Apples total sales and is growing faster than other sales categories its margins and profits should remain on an upward trajectory Management is directing investment at the heart of Apples competitive advantage which is its brand and user experience and that spells rising profits and dividend increases as well as a stock that should be hitting new highs for years to come John Ballard has no position in any of the stocks mentioned The

90,"How to Share Focus Status on iPhone","2/10/2024","https://nerdschalk.com/share-focus-status-iphone/","With Focus mode you can customize and schedule how you want to be notified about calls messages and apps throughout the day When a Focus is active people trying to contact you will see a banner at the bottom indicating that you’re away or busy to receive texts In this post we’ll explain how you can enable Focus Status sharing how to share it with everyone or specific people and what happens when you share it on your iPhone Related: What does Focus Status sharing mean? To share your Focus Status your Focus settings must be shared across all your Apple devices When you don’t share your Focus routines between your Apple devices you won’t be able to use Focus Status on any routines; so people who message you won’t see when you’re busy or when a Focus is active on your iPhone Related: How To Share Focus Status on iPhone By default when you enable Focus Status on iOS it is shared with everyone in your contacts list on your iPhone So once you set up a Focus Status you do not need to do anything more to share it with everyone That means anyone who sends you a text during a Focus routine will be able to see that notifications on your iPhone are silenced This alert will show up at the bottom of a conversation inside the Messages app But if you exclude a contact manually from Focus Sharing then they won’t get the notifications of your Focus Status If you know that your Focus Status is not being shared with someone make sure they are not being excluded from the Messages app See our guide below for that Related: List of iOS 15 Focus Mode Issues Since Focus Status is enabled for everyone by default you may want to disable it for someone you don’t want to share this status with While you can add this contact to your Allowed People list you may not essentially want messages from them during a Focus routine If your Focus Status isn’t being shared with your contacts you can fix it by enabling the feature for the Messages app inside iOS’s privacy settings When you turn on any Focus routine inside iOS iOS gains the ability to tell anyone who texts you that you’re busy and that any messages they send you will not be notified This is what Apple calls Focus Status and this is enabled when you select any routine to be activated on your iPhone iPad or Mac Focus Status adds a banner at the bottom of conversations you are a part of inside the Messages app However it’s up to you to decide whether or not you want to broadcast that you’re away or busy to receive texts Focus Status is a polite way to let people know that you’re busy with something important during which period all messages will be delivered quietly unless you allow others to bypass it Sharing Focus Status is a good idea with people who respect your downtime and will not bug you unless necessary If they have something really important to tell you they can choose the Notify Anyway option that gets their messages delivered to you normally If the Share Focus Status toggle isn’t available when you access someone’s contact info inside the Messages app then the feature may be disabled by default on iOS This can be because in iOS 156 and newer versions the ability to share the Focus on the Messages app has been disabled automatically when you update your iPhone to the latest version of iOS When disabled the Share Focus Status option won’t show up at all when you access someone’s contact info underneath “Send Read Receipts” The Share Focus Status option will only show up on Messages when you re-enable the Messages app inside the iOS privacy settings screen When enabled the share feature would appear back again allowing you to share your Focus status with the selected individual When you enable Focus Status it is by default visible to everyone who sends you a message on iMessage Only users who have sent you a message via the Messages app recently can see whether messages from them are being silenced or not If you add a person to a Focus routine’s Allowed People list their messages will go through as usual without them knowing if Focus is currently active on your devices Regardless of this at no point will the other person know which Focus routine you have enabled on your iPhone Your Focus Status appears inside conversations inside the Messages app for those people you have sent you a text recently When someone tries to text you while a Focus routine is active on your iPhone they’ll see a “Delivered Quietly” label just underneath the message they send At the bottom of the conversation screen they’ll also see an alert that says “ has notifications silenced” No When you whitelist a contact inside Focus their messages will bypass any Focus routine you may have enabled This way when a person you added inside “Allowed People” on a Focus messages you you will get their messages instantly the same way you’ll get messages from anyone when no Focus routine is applied on your iPhone Since messages sent from whitelisted contacts are delivered normally these contacts won’t see your Focus Status; thus won’t be able to tell whether a Focus routine has been activated on your iPhone Ideally Focus Status when enabled will be active for everyone who texts you via the Messages app If someone isn’t able to see it at the bottom of a conversation thread it could be for any of the following reasons: That’s all you need to know about sharing Focus Status with everyone on iPhone RELATED: Ambivalent unprecedented and on the run from everyones idea of reality A consonance of love for filter coffee cold weather Arsenal AC/DC and Sinatra Enter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email Email Address Subscribe This fix still does not work I share across devices messages is on in the focus settings I even reset my phone Still does not work Have tried everything listed multiple times Still doesn’t deliver my status to sender =( if you are whitelisted and they had read receipts on for you will it disable the read receipts when they add you to the whitelist?

building?","2/16/2024","https://www.sfexaminer.com/news/business/did-an-ex-apple-designer-just-drop-60m-on-a-sf-building/article_658ee166-ca13-11ee-97cc-af92804b74ff.html","The Little Fox Theatre Building at 535 Pacific Ave in San Francisco was purchased Friday by an entity that appears to be connected to Jony Ive’s design firm LoveFrom The Clint Reilly Organization has sold a historic Jackson Square structure for nearly $60 million to a business entity that appears linked to former Apple designer Jony Ive In a deal completed Friday an entity named 535 Pacific LLC paid $597 million for the Little Fox Theatre building at 535 Pacific Ave according to records filed with the county Assessor-Recorder’s Office That works out to about $1695 per square foot for the 35221 square-foot building according to documents from the Assessor’s Office The structure which ranges from three to five stories is around the corner from a collection of buildings Ive’s design firm LoveFrom has purchased over the last three years The San Francisco address listed for 535 Pacific LLC is the same given for entities used to make other purchases in the area Derek Giovanetti the contact person listed in the documents filed with the Assessor’s Office for 535 Pacific LLC was listed on a previous document filed by LoveFrom 535 Pacific LLC took out a $63 million loan related to the purchase from 535 Pacific Partners LLC Giovanetti and Ive did not immediately respond to requests for comment In an emailed statement Reilly — who also owns The Examiner — declined to confirm the name of the purchaser citing a confidentiality agreement but said he was “pleased” with the deal Reilly said he’d grown attached to the Little Fox Theatre building which he’d owned since 1991 “The transaction is great for San Francisco and augurs a comeback which is certainly coming in future years” he said The purchase price was well above the property’s assessed value and the going rate for commercial properties in the area The land and structures at 535 Pacific had an assessed value of $66 million for fiscal year 2022-23 In the last quarter two properties sold in the Jackson Square neighborhood One in the North Waterfront-Jackson Square area built in the 1980s fetched $279 per square foot while a smaller structure built in 1919 sold for $446 per square foot or $111 million — less than double its $57 million appraised value Assuming Ive and LoveFrom purchased the Little Fox Theatre building the deal would be their biggest in the area and add to the $78 million they’ve already spent since 2020 Over that time LoveFrom has purchased five properties in the Jackson Square block bordered by Columbus and Pacific avenues and Montgomery and Jackson streets according to the real-estate database Reonomy and records filed with the San Francisco Assessor-Recorder’s Office Those purchases include: The band responds to life’s biggest questions with disco-infused joy Giants games will sound much different at Oracle Park this year San Francisco Baykeeper alleges that The City discharges a mix of sewage and other pollutants during heavy rains which could pose a public-health risk Ive the design guru behind the iPhone iPod and iMac founded LoveFrom in 2019 the same year he left Apple His design firm has since worked with Apple Airbnb and Ferrari among other companies according to published reports Last year Ive and Sam Altman and their respective companies LoveFrom and OpenAI began talking about collaborating to develop an AI-powered device that would be a kind of successor to a smartphone according to multiple reports The two companies have been in discussions to raise as much as $1 billion from SoftBank the Japanese conglomerate that runs the two mega-sized Vision Funds according to numerous reports This month Tang Tan who previously headed up iPhone and watch design at Apple is joining LoveFrom to lead hardware engineering of the new product Bloomberg reported in December By purchasing the Little Fox Theatre building — which dates to 1907 according to city records — Ive would add to his growing cluster of early 20th-century buildings in the Jackson Square Historic District San Francisco’s “oldest remaining commercial area” is “a living reminder of Gold Rush days as well as the colorful period of the Barbary Coast” according to a 1971 city report nominating the area for the National Register of Historic Places The district contains The City’s “earliest and sole surviving buildings” from the 1850s and ’60s and is remarkable for the ornateness and refinement of its structures according to the report Ive a British native wrote a May 2022 essay for the Financial Times about falling in love with Jackson Square North Beach and Chinatown when he first arrived in The City in 1989 He said he felt a debt of gratitude to the neighborhood and LoveFrom the creative collective he formed with Marc Newson had made Jackson Square its home “We have dreams and plans for our buildings and our studio but that’s for another time” he wrote The City’s “ferocious intoxicating history” was in the area where Gold Rush prospectors landed in their giddy scramble to make fortunes and ships were abandoned in the Bay some of them subsequently buried in landfill beneath buildings Ive wrote Ive cited the lawlessness of the Barbary Coast days and the numerous writers who lived or

safe The Apple Vision Pros $3499 price tag may be part of the companys marketing plan Some claim the headsets price is an example of Apple using mimetic desire to stir up interest Public figures with a Vision Pro may in theory inspire their followers to buy it if its cheaper The Vision Pros whopping $3499 price tag may be part of Apples marketing ploy to entice more customers to purchase the mixed-reality headset in the future At least thats what some members of the business community think In a post on X formerly Twitter Jason Levin a marketing strategist who writes about spatial computing characterized Apples so-called promotional tactic as a concept known as mimetic desire Rooted in philosophical thought mimetic desire refers to the notion that people desire the same things that their role models want In the context of the Vision Pro that theory could mean consumers may be more likely to purchase the device because celebrities or influencers they admire own it When consumers see high-status people rocking Vision Pros in public it becomes a status symbol to have one Levin told Business Insider If these people are models to you—which they are for many young people—mimetic desire kicks in and you subconsciously want a Vision Pro too Some public figures whove been open about their experiences with the Vision Pro on the internet include YouTubers Logan Paul and Casey Neistat rappers like T-Pain and Kid Cudi and tech leaders like former Microsoft strategist Robert Scoble according to Levin Sam Altman the CEO behind OpenAI even said on X that the Vision Pro is the second most impressive tech since the iPhone I just went on my walk again This time on my couchIf you have an Apple Vision Pro some photography tips More in a couple videos I am uploading1 The camera can focus close Get very close to things Move quickly around them When you see it later in the headset it is… pictwittercom/bB0XTzJ291 — Robert Scoble (@Scobleizer) February 7 2024 To support his point on mimetic desire Levin linked a clip on his X post from an interview with Palmer Luckey the founder of the Oculus VR headset thats now Metas Quest from last July In it Luckey shared his thoughts on how the Vision Pros multi-thousand dollar price is aligned with Apples plans to attract people to the product The price just doesnt matter for the group of early adopters that theyre targeting he said in the interview referring to Apple But what theyre going to do is to inspire lust in a much larger group of people After all the Oculus founder who did not respond to BIs request for comment said he believes the Vision Pro will eventually be cheaper for the masses During its initial phase after launch the headset he said was purposefully designed with cutting-edge screen resolution display quality and ergonomics to target a wealthier customer base Those with more disposable income would have no problem dishing out thousands of dollars for the glossy device compared to those who dont he said This wealthier customer base who buy and flaunt their headset out in the open may eventually stir up greater consumer interest in the product once its price drops If Apple had tried to go to the low end of the market that wouldve been a mistake Luckey said in the interview Its not just Apple trying to lure future customers to expensive shiny new objects Levin said that Tesla the electrical vehicle company run by CEO Elon Musk has used mimetic desire by putting an expensive price tag on the companys first model to make owning an electric car cool As a result those who see people they respect purchase an expensive Tesla would in theory increase their desire for one Apple didnt immediately respond to BIs request for comment Read the original article on Business

headset from Apple can transport you to Hawaii or the surface of the moon It displays high-resolution computer graphics a few millimeters from the users eyes all while allowing the user to control a desktop-like interface using their eyes and subtle hand gestures The Vision Pro provides a preview of what using a computer could be like in five years early adopters say The Vision Pro starts at $3499 After adding storage and accessories such as straps the whole package can cost as much as $4500 Thats a lot more expensive than competing headsets such as Metas Quest 3 which starts at $499 Its pricier than Metas high-end headset the Quest Pro which starts at $999 Its also more expensive even after controlling for inflation than the first iPad ($499) or the first iPhone ($499 with a two-year contract) The Vision Pro includes lots of pricey state-of-the-art parts One estimate from research firm Omdia puts the bill of materials for the headset at $1542 and that doesnt include the costs of research and development packaging marketing or Apples profit margin The most expensive part in the headset is the 125 inch Sony Semiconductor display that goes in front of the users eye Its a key component that helps the virtual experience feel more realistic than previous consumer headsets The displays have a lot of pixels and lifelike colors and are built with state-of-the-art manufacturing techniques Apple pays about $228 for the Micro OLED displays it uses according to the Omdia estimate Each Vision Pro needs two of them one for each eye Sony Semiconductor declined CNBCs request to comment for this story The Vision Pro displays are the latest example of Apple embracing a new kind of display technology at a larger scale and earlier than the rest of the electronics industry Apples usage of LCD touchscreens for the first iPhone in 2007 and its later transition to organic LEDs or OLED displays with the iPhone X in 2017 upended existing supply chains and after Apple shipped millions of units ultimately drove the cost of the parts for the entire industry down Apple has a massive effect on the display industry said Jacky Qiu co-founder of OTI Lumionics which makes materials for manufacturing OLED panels He said display makers fight for Apples business which can be make or break for these companies Apple is now the biggest player in terms of OLEDs in terms of displays They are the ones that are basically taking all the high-margin displays all the stuff that is the high-spec type of stuff that is allowing the panel makers today to become profitable Qiu said You look at the display business you either work for Apple and make the iPhone screens and youre profitable or you dont and you lose money Its as brutal as that Qiu said The Vision Pros displays are a defining feature Theyre packed with pixels and are sharper than any competing headset Its one of the main points that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg complimented when comparing the $499 Quest 3 headset to Apples headset Apples screen does have a higher resolution and thats really nice Zuckerberg said in a video posted on his Instagram page while saying that Quests screens are brighter Whats so revolutionary about the OLED displays that are in the Vision Pro the difference between Micro OLED and the OLED that you find on a television in your living room is that the pixels are actually a lot denser theyre smaller and theyre more compact said Wayne Rickard CEO of Terecircuits a company that makes materials and techniques for display manufacturing According to a teardown analysis from repair firm iFixit each Vision Pro display has a resolution of 3660 by 3200 pixels Thats more pixels per eye than the iPhone 15 which has a screen resolution of 2556 by 1179 pixels Metas Quest 3 comes in at a resolution of 2064 by 2208 per eye The Vision Pros screens are much smaller than the iPhones screen which makes the pixels closer together and more difficult to manufacture The Vision Pro displays have 3386 pixels per inch versus the iPhone 15 which has about 460 pixels per inch on its display In total Apple says the Vision Pros displays have more than 23 million total pixels Theyre some of the densest displays ever built According to iFixit 54 Vision Pro pixels can fit in a single iPhone pixel and each pixel is about 75 microns from the next pixel a measurement called pixel pitch according to Apples specifications With Micro LEDs in particular it can get down to about below 10 microns For comparison a red blood cell might be about 20 microns so half the size of a red blood cell Rickard said Apple opted for high-resolution displays so theyd be closer to simulating reality when using the headsets passthrough mode which uses outward-facing cameras to show video of the real world inside the headset It also helps users read text or numbers in virtual reality It helps remove the screen door effect of other headsets where you can see the pixels VR headsets need pixel-dense displays because the users eyes are so close to the screen TVs have significantly fewer pixels but it doesnt matter because viewers are feet away The production of this kind of display requires cutting-edge manufacturing For example most displays are built on a backplane made out of glass The Vision Pro displays are so pixel-dense that they use a silicon backplane much like a semiconductor The second most expensive part in the Vision Pro is the companys main processor which includes Apples M2 chip the same chip it uses in the MacBook Air and the R1 chip which is a custom processor to handle video feeds and other sensors on the device Bill of materials estimates dont take into account research and development costs packaging or shipping They also dont take into account capital expenditures that can add up-front costs to big parts orders but theyre useful for people in the manufacturing world to get an idea of how expensive the parts are in any given device Display technologies embraced by Apple typically come down in price after Apple makes them mainstream and as multiple suppliers compete for business South Korean suppliers like Samsung Display and LG Display have shown their interest in this technology Chinese suppliers like Seeya and BOE are also small-scale mass-produced [OLED on silicon] products said Jay Shao Omdia analyst for displays in an email He expects the costs for Vision Pro spec screens to come down in the coming years Apple declined to comment but Apple CEO Tim Cook is not a fan of cost estimates and teardowns Ive never seen one thats even close to accurate he said on an earnings call in 2015 Apple doesnt typically discuss its suppliers but in February Cook was asked about the devices price tag on an earnings call If you look at it from a price point of view theres an incredible amount of technology packed into the product Cook said He mentioned some of the most expensive parts in the device and emphasized the R&D costs that Apple spent developing it Theres 5000 patents in the product and its built on many innovations that Apple has spent multiple years on from silicon to displays and significant AI and machine learning All the hand tracking the room mapping all of this stuff is driven by AI and so were incredibly excited about it Cook continuedDont miss these stories from CNBC PRO: Got a confidential news tip?

130,"Which Magnificent Seven Stocks Are Screaming Buys Right Now?","1/1/2024","https://finance.yahoo.com/news/magnificent-seven-stocks-screaming-buys-123000871.html","The Magnificent Seven stocks dominated the market in 2023 The worst performer in the group Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) rose 49% and the best Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) jumped nearly 240% But with such strong runs behind them do any of them have room left to grow in 2024? The answer: Yes and some are still worth buying at their current prices Im breaking the seven up into buy sell and hold groups Starting with the sell set I think Apple and Nvidias stock prices far outpaced their businesses Nvidias 2023 success has been spurred on by the artificial intelligence (AI) arms race and its business has responded in kind In its fiscal 2024 third quarter (which ended Oct 29) revenue rose 206% year over year Furthermore management guided for $20 billion in fiscal Q4 revenue up 231% The stocks movement was warranted given the companys sales growth but Im concerned that investors are forgetting that Nvidia operates in a cyclical industry Nvidia goes through boom and bust cycles and right now is certainly a boom However its unknown how many AI data centers will need to be built in the near to medium term If demand for its high-powered chips is satisfied shortly the stock may come crashing back down to earth Plus its trading at 65 times earnings -- a quite expensive premium From a business standpoint Apple is the opposite of Nvidia Its sales declined throughout 2023 Even so its stock skyrocketed This makes little sense and more headwinds are coming up: a US International Trade Commission order this month forced Apple to halt the import and sale of some Apple Watches due to a patent dispute (although a court ruling temporarily allowed sales to resume) With all this in mind 2024 could be a tough year for the company And considering that Apple stock has a higher valuation than Magnificent Seven members Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) it doesnt make a lot of sense to own it compared to its peers I view Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) as holds currently Microsoft had a strong year as its revenues and earnings per share (EPS) steadily rose However Microsoft trades at a steep premium even on a forward earnings basis Microsoft is executing well but its valuation is a bit too much from a historical perspective to consider buying Still its far from a sell Tesla is one of the hardest companies to value on Wall Street as its valuation is wrapped up in expectations for future products Its also set to face some added headwinds Starting in 2024 some Tesla models will only qualify for half of the $7500 federal EV tax credit due to where the automaker sources materials for their batteries and where it produces them When judging whether any given moment is a better time to buy or sell Tesla stock I like to look at its price-to-earnings and price-to-sales ratio compared to historical trends For Tesla these are trading roughly near the midpoint of valuations seen since mid-2022 Im taking a wait-and-see approach to Tesla stock heading into the new year as the stock doesnt look like a bargain at these prices That leaves Alphabet Meta Platforms and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) in the buy now category These stocks trade at reasonable levels and are expecting strong tailwinds next year Even though Alphabet and Meta have AI investments they are mostly advertising businesses In 2022 and 2023 the advertising market was fairly weak as companies pulled back on their marketing spending due to fears that a recession was coming However now that we have lapped that pullback Alphabet and Meta are posting meaningful growth in their advertising businesses Their ad revenues grew by 9% and 24% respectively in Q3 Next year should be another strong recovery year for advertising which will boost both companies Amazon has also had a strong 2023 with its margins rising However this chart doesnt tell the full story as this takes into account Amazons profits over the past 12 months If you focus on its latest quarterly results Amazons margins are nearing (or have already set) all-time highs The fact that Amazon posted solid results in historically weak quarters bodes well for Q4 which is usually its strongest one No investor knows what a fully profitable Amazon looks like but 2024 could give us a glimpse making it a strong buy now Should you invest $1000 in Nvidia right now?

planet Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) faces some large potential risks The question is can the company get back to innovating to overcome these hurdles AAPL designs hardware and software for its own brand of smartphones computers laptops tablets wearable devices and accessories Sales of iPhones made up over half its revenue in fiscal 2023 The company also generates Service revenue through its App store marketplace cloud storage services payment services and advertising Services accounted for about 22% of its FY23 revenue The first big risk that AAPL faces is with its app store Services has been the big bright spot for the company Services revenue reached $852 billion in fiscal year 2023 (ended September) up 9% while it recorded a quarterly record in its FQ4 with Services revenue of $223 billion up 16% The segment also carries much high gross margins of over 70% compared to 365% for its Products segment Now AAPL Services has several components including advertising cloud storage services and payment services But a large portion of this revenue comes for its App store where the company receives a 30% fee (15% for small developers) for every app and in-app purchase made on its platform Earlier this month AAPL updated its policy in response to a court decision that developers could use payment methods outside of AAPL In response the company will allow app developers to use additional payment methods but said it would collect a 27% commission (12% for small developers) for use of its platform While AAPL seems to have found a way to keep control of its app store commissions this fight is likely far from over Developers are not happy with the cut AAPL is getting and will likely continue to press the issue The original lawsuit stems from Epic Games the maker of Fortnite but others such as Spotify (SPOT) have also voiced their displeasure The fight is likely to spill over into Europe and SPOT has urge EU and UK courts to prohibit these fees Meanwhile it appears the US Department of Justice is planning a large anti-trust lawsuit against the iPhone maker AAPL meanwhile also noted in court filings that collecting the commission fees could prove very difficult Whether this is true or not is still to be seen However at the end of the day a big chunk of AAPL’s app store revenue could be in jeopardy down the road Legal cases are never easy to predict and AAPL undoubtedly will have the best lawyers in the business It can argue that it is no different than any other e-commerce market place such as eBay (EBAY) or Etsy (ETSY) that takes a commission although those two companies have much lower commissions than 27% As such I think there is a real risk that its App Store take rate may come down at some point If the App store makes up half its Services revenue a cut to a 20% take rate from 30% would be an over $4 billion hit to revenue and likely over $3 billion in profits At the same time Alphabet (GOOGL) is being pressured over the payments it makes to companies under its default search agreements These agreements are currently being challenged by the Justice Department as being anti-competitive So why does this matter to AAPL because it was revealed that GOOGL pays AAPL 36% of its search revenue that comes from Safari That appears to between $10-18 billion a year of very high margin revenue that could be lost if this practice is deemed anti-competitive These risks come at a time when AAPL has seen its revenue decline for four straight quarters For fiscal 2023 revenue fell -28% to $3833 billion It’s the third time AAPL has seen a yearly revenue decline in the past 10 years with the company also seeing sales declines in FY16 and FY19 Given the risks AAPL is facing and the revenue declines it has seen the company really needs to return to its innovative ways Under now deceased founder and former CEO Steve Jobs AAPL was at the forefront of innovation and elegant design During his second tenure with the company AAPL introduced the iPad MacBook iPhone and iPad while the iWatch was released shortly after he passed away The biggest innovations since Tim Cook has taken over are iPods AirTags Apple making its own chips and yearly incremental upgrades to the iPhone That is why the company’s introduction of the Vision Pro is important The mixed reality headset is one of the biggest innovations to come from AAPL since Tim Cook took over the company in 2011 The product has gotten pretty good reviews and undoubtedly over time the product will get better in later iterations But at $3500 this is a very expensive toy at the moment The Vision Pro will likely do well with AAPL’s biggest fans and early adopters although I wouldn’t expect it to be a mainstream success at current prices Later generations at lower prices will be key for this to be a true success but it is good to finally see AAPL innovating again Another area AAPL will have the opportunity to innovate is with the upcoming hardware cycle to run AI-powered solutions Users can’t run programs like Adobe (ADBE) Photoshop’s new generative AI features on older Macs and as more apps and program incorporate AI consumers will need more powerful smartphones and tablets as well AAPL has tended to slow play its iPhone advancements each year generally making smaller incremental changes However with AI upon us it could have an opportunity to make some larger important upgrades that will drive sales across its hardware product lines Samsung just launched its latest Galaxy smartphones with a heavy emphasis on AI AAPL currently trades at an EV/EBITDA multiple of 217x the FY24 (ending September) consensus of $1323 billion Based on FY25 EBITDA projections of $1413 billion it trades at a 204x multiple On a P/E basis the company trades at 24x the FY25 consensus of $659 and 20x the FY26 consensus of $713 Revenue is projected to grow nearly 4% in fiscal year 2024 and nearly 6% in FY2025 AAPL trades towards the high-end of large mega-cap tech stocks (growing under 15%) although its projected revenue growth is among the slowest AAPL Valuation Vs Peers (FinBox) Given its modest growth and the risks it faces I’d value the company between 13-16x FY26 EBITDA That would be a range between $115-$145 AAPL stock has been a huge winner both the past decade and past five years However coming out of the pandemic much of its gains have from multiple expansion This was especially true in 2023 where it saw revenue and net income decline but its stock rise 54% AAPL EBITDA Vs EV/EBITDA Multiple (FinBox) Meanwhile the company faces some potential risks to two large high-margin revenue streams I wouldn’t expect its app store and search default revenue to go away or be reduced soon but there is a real possibility that they do get a haircut at some point And while I think a hardware upgrade cycle and the Vision Pro could help in 2024 the stock’s valuation isn’t attractive given some of the potential risks the company faces As such I’m going to place a “Sell” rating on AAPL with a $145 target I would become more constructive on the name as its legal battles get cleared up This article was written by Analyst’s Disclosure:

139,"Top 5 Reasons to Use AI to Invest in Bitcoin Ether and Apple Stock","1/28/2024","https://beincrypto.com/top-5-reasons-to-use-ai-to-invest/","We use cookies to improve your experience Any time people buy and sell crypto stocks or any other asset class them are going to need to dedicate time to researching tracking market movements and analyzing data The financial markets offer endless opportunities to grow your wealth but effort and expertise are necessary if you want to make the right move at the right moment This is even more important when we consider the exceptional volatility of the crypto markets where rapid responses are critical to success This is where an artificial intelligence (AI) crypto investing app comes in and there are a variety of ways in which an AI crypto investment platform will give traders an edge One of the primary reasons to use an AI for investing in crypto is that unlike people machines don’t tire and can work 24/7 simultaneously capitalizing on short-term price swings on Bitcoin oil EUR/USD the NASDAQ or Apple stock without needing a break An AI crypto trading bot can process data in every language from a wide variety of alternative and traditional sources to identify patterns and exploit emerging opportunities whenever they might arise across multiple markets and time zones One of the newest AI crypto investing platforms is Algosoneai An exciting newcomer that launched in late 2023 AlgosoOne is smashing financial barriers by making institutional-caliber AI technology free to anyone with an initial deposit as low as $300 It combines the most advanced large language models with proprietary deep neural networks to create a smart user-friendly AI that can reach unmatched success rates It learns as it goes improving in accuracy with each new user data set and trade In particular for strategies that demand high frequency trading capabilities like crypto arbitrage an AI is the only viable option In general the crypto markets are exceptionally volatile Rapid fluctuations mean that there is the potential for high rewards but the risks are equally steep When it comes to Bitcoin Solana and Bonk everything can change in a matter of minutes Speed is of the essence and this is why using an artificial intelligence for investment in crypto is the only way to ensure you don’t miss profitable but fleeting opportunities AlgosOne tracks enormous volumes of live streaming data the second it hits the web ranging from social media posts on-chain activity and investor sentiment analysis to financial reports economic breaking news and historic price data Its natural language processing (NLP) models and cutting-edge machine learning capabilities enable it to sift through and assess the significance of all these data sources at lightning-speed analyzing them to gain actionable insights The AI crypto trading bot is able to respond within a split second to multiple opportunities at once ensuring no profit opportunity is missed The rapid price fluctuations on the crypto markets require users to place guardrails to ensure that all their capital is not lost in a single trade AI-based automated risk management will ensure that even when you are away from your screen your balance is being protected and the risk to your funds is being carefully controlled AlgosOne has advanced risk parameters in place These include stop loss trailing stop and take profit orders hedging tools caps of 5%-10% on the amount of a balance that can be allocated to any one trade as well as 24/7 market tracking and system monitoring by expert human risk management teams who can intercede if the case of an extreme market event AlgosOne also mitigates risk through diversification Rather than just trading a range of cryptocurrencies the AI trading bots buys and sells across multiple markets including forex bonds crypto stocks commodities and indices In addition as a licensed regulated AI platform AlgosOne complies with strict technological safety protocols to guard against hacks it also segregates company and user funds implements ID verfication procedures and maintains a reserve fund At all times the fund holds sufficient capital to cover all user account balances in cases such as company collapse major market upheaval fraud or technical failure The AI is consistently monitoring the market and using its machine learning (ML) capabilities to refine risk parameters based on its experiences Always learning it gets better all the time at mitigating losses and increasing its trade win rate Another major reason why an AI is a great way to invest in Bitcoin Apple Stock or energy commodities is that it will never be derailed by emotion Even the most experienced traders can sometimes abandon their trading plan due to fear or greed This is nowhere more relevant than when investing in cryptocurrency where prices can rise or fall by 20%-30% in a single afternoon AlgosOne bases every trade on a huge volume of technical and fundamental data using historic price patterns and a wealth of real time statistical data to forecast market direction with a level of accuracy no human could ever match Never getting “stuck in its ways” or overly-attached to a strategy AlgosOneis constantly evaluating the current state of the market adjusting risk parameters tweaking techniques and honing its strategies to adapt to shifiting conditions improving its predictive accuracy along the way Trading the financial markets is incredibly complex It requires study to understand technical analysis market dynamics and drivers and much more To be successful traders need to perform in-depth research and analysis involving a significant a commitment of time effort and resources However by using an AI-powered trading platform traders can automate a lot of processes The can set triggers for exiting a trade if it reaches a certain price so they can get out at the right time even if they are not in front of their screen They can also select assets for the AI to trade picking markets in time zones where market hours are in the middle of the night for the trader They can also program custom strategies to suit their financial means and level of risk tolerance Yet all this frequently requires programming experience and a thorough knowledge of the market Here is where AlgosOne shines bright Due to its ML capabilities Algosone can do it all for traders Users just sign up deposit funds and the user’s part is over Get on with your day and the AI trading bot will monitor the markets gather and analyze data manage your portfolio set risk parameters and build strategies which it will constantly be refining as it broadens its knowledge base The only requirement is that for certain trades users will need to provide approval They simply receive a trade confirmation message to their phone and click the “APPROVE” button in the notification The significance of AlgosOne’s ML capabilities can’t be underestimated There is no coding or market experience required so absolutely anyone who wants to can trade using AI technology as advanced as the software used by hedge funds and banks But the minimum deposit is just a couple of hundred dollars and there is no subscription fee no deposit fee and there are no transaction fees! The only charge is a commission which is only paid on trades that result in a profit All the money from commissions is funneled back into the platform and used to pay for live support and risk management compensation on losing trades and maintaining the reserve fund balance It is also worth noting that commission fees have already been factored into the calculations of the expected profit percentages for each trading tier The user’s tier is based on their deposit amount The higher the trading tier the more trades are made through their account each day and for larger sums Additionally compensation will be higher for losing trades and commissions on winning trades will be lower With no hidden charges or transaction fees eating into profits low minimum deposit and user-friendly hands-off approach AlgsoOne is genuinely accessible to everyone and not just those with substantial financial resources AI is an essential tool these days for anyone stepping foot into the trading arena It offers immense processing power the ability to trade 24 hours a day 7 days a week unmatched speed and efficiency automated risk management and a guarantee of emotion-free data-driven trading AlgosOne stands out for its advanced generative AI technology ease of use security and accessibility to all To trade Bitcoin Apple stock and a range of other assets just register with the AlgosOne app Try it with 14-day commitment-free trial and give the app a go to put your capital to work today Disclaimer This article is sponsored content and does not represent the views or opinions of BeInCrypto While we adhere to the Trust Project guidelines for unbiased and transparent reporting this content is created by a third party and is intended for promotional purposes Readers are advised to verify information independently and consult with a professional before making decisions based on this sponsored content Please note that our Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy and Disclaimers have been updated Want to know more?

concerns","1/31/2024","https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/wizz-tinder-app-aimed-teens-removed-apple-google-stores-rcna136607","Morning Rundown: Ohtani scandal comes at a pivotal moment for MLB Gazans increasingly support a two-state solution and rare disorder causes man to see ‘demonic’ faces Profile Sections tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News There are no new alerts at this time Wizz a social media app growing popular among teens in the US was removed from the Apple app store and Google Play this week Apple removed the app Tuesday after the National Center on Sexual Exploitation contacted the company with concerns about the alleged use of Wizz in sextortion scams according to a series of emails reviewed by NBC News In an email from an Apple representative in response to the center a representative wrote “We take App Store violations seriously and appreciate your outreach The app has been removed from the Store and we are in touch with the developer” In a public post Wednesday on X the National Center on Sexual Exploitation thanked the stores for removing Wizz Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment A Google spokesperson said that the Wizz app was suspended from Google Play the online store for Android apps on Tuesday The spokesperson cited the company’s child endangerment policy that requires apps to “prohibit users from creating uploading or distributing content that facilitates the exploitation or abuse of children” A Wizz spokesperson said in an emailed statement that “Apple and Google are seeking more information on our app and we are working closely with their teams to clarify our platform’s extensive safeguards for users We hope to resolve this matter soon” The Tinder-like Wizz app is owned by the French parent company and mobile publisher Voodoo which was funded by Goldman Sachs Tencent and GBL among others It allows users to set up and scroll through profiles that show a person’s photo first name age state and zodiac sign Wizz has marketed its platform as a “safe space” to make new friends and has allowed users as young as 13 to set up accounts and start connecting with other users in the same “age-gated” group Concerns around Wizz have risen in recent months as child safety and technology research groups gathered more information about the increasingly popular app At least two content creators pulled out this month from a Wizz-sponsored content creation house where influencers gathered to make TikTok videos to promote the app They cited concerns raised by child safety advocates about Wizz and sextortion according to creators directly involved in the project who requested anonymity because they signed nondisparagement agreements A Wizz spokesperson said that the recent house event in Miami was “a success” and showed “how our app helps create meaningful relationships between young people” “All of the influencers who spent the week with us say they are excited to participate in Wizz House 2 and others have reached out saying they want to join” the spokesperson said The Wizz app has been used by people to find and connect with young users in “financial sextortion” scams according to a recent study by the Network Contagion Research Institute a nonprofit organization that studies the spread of extremism hatred and crime online to help combat and prevent it The FBI defines sextortion as “a crime that involves adults coercing kids and teens into sending explicit images online” After the images are sent the criminals threaten to widely publish or send the explicit photos or videos to the victims’ friends and family unless the victims pay up repeatedly through a variety of peer-to-peer payment apps gift cards and cryptocurrency transfers Sextortion can be so devastating that victims died by suicide in at least 20 known cases in the US according to the FBI In its most recent study of rising sextortion levels in North America and Australia the institute strongly criticized Wizz along with Meta-owned Instagram Snapchat and TikTok for what it called an inadequate effort to protect minors and young adults online “Some victims report being targeted by sextortion within minutes of joining the app suggesting that criminals have saturated Wizz” the study said adding that researchers found frequent complaints to the Google Play Store and Apple App Store about Wizz with users claiming the app was “serving pornographic ads to minors” Adam Sohn CEO of the Network Contagion Research Institute said in an email that generally “social media platforms struggle to adequately address” risks to underage users and “are at times financially incentivized to overlook them” The research institute’s director of intelligence Alex Goldenberg said app stores can significantly impact the reach of social media platforms “Wizz has something in the ballpark of 20 million active users” he said “But if the app store doesn’t continue to carry it they cannot sustain let alone grow their user base” Goldenberg said that he believes Wizz’s age verification system is not strong enough “We’ve seen threat actors who can bypass age verification facial recognition by having their cousin or brother take a selfie and then they will be off and running on the platform” he said “And it’s not just threat actors — if you’re under the age of 13 it’s very easy to have an older sibling have a photo taken as well” Wizz declined to say what steps it would take to try to get reinstated on the Apple App Store or Google Play But it posted a “story” on Instagram with an emoji-laden message on a tie-dyed background that told users: “Hey there Just wanted to drop in with a quick heads up Wizz is currently taking a break from the app stores due to a technical hiccup We’re working super hard to get everything sorted out and back to normal ASAP” Ben Goggin is the deputy editor for technology at NBC News Digital © 2024 NBC

managing director of equity research at Wedbush Securities is ubiquitous throughout Seeking Alpha CNBC and Bloomberg among other venues While he doesnt always make the right call he has conviction and

anticipated We vowed we were going to learn from that experience and that was going to make us better Ives said You have to use your failures as opportunities to get better Ives is a public figure and he owns it when hes wrong Mark Freed a venture capitalist and friend of Ives for more than two decades when the pair attended Penn State together said They share a love of Penn State athletics season tickets for football games and talk frequently Given he is in the business of looking forward he accepts and owns being wrong and is always guiding the recipient of his conviction towards looking ahead versus looking backward Freed said in an interview If you think about it theres nothing that can be done about what happened yesterday so what people want to hear from him is whats going to happen next Its his ability to relate to anyone that is part of his success Freed said People may disagree with his views but you wont find a person that will have a negative or disparaging thing to say about Dan Hes prepared hes passionate he has conviction and he connects well with everyone To Wedbush colleague Taz Koujalgi part of Ivess success comes from how broad his view is While most Wall Street analysts hone in on their own sectors Ives looks at the bigger picture Though he officially covers software names he also pays attention to Teslas (TSLA) automotive business and Apples hardware business He can tie in a lot of those things and his perspective is a lot broader and more holistic Koujalgi said in a phone interview this week I am amazed by how much he can cover the way he can combine what he is seeing in the Apple supply chain ecosystem and how that impacts the world of software… We all make a mistake just looking at whats happening in our own sector and ignoring whats happening outside Koujalgi — who speaks with Ives some 10 times a day or more — now looks beyond the software industry that he also covers and into semiconductors and hardware among others to incorporate different data points He also admires Ivess collaborative nature and lack of back-stabbing behavior which can be prevalent on Wall Street Ives who often paints a distinctly non-Wall Street vibe with his pastel pink and turquoise jackets and plaids has naysayers of course like the following Seeking Alpha subscribers who commented last month on stories featuring the analyst WealthWisedca in response to Ives saying Apple will go to $4T: Dan is so bullish it makes me wanna go bearish Nate311 on Ivess wish list for 2024: [Ives] understands apple as few analysts do (munster is another) but $4T seems unrealistic Jamiemcdaniel on Microsofts AI bet not being priced in: With any analysis by Dan super-mega-tech-bull Ives all risks are always priced in and the market is ignoring the many incredible practically guaranteed positives that only he and the company CEO so clearly sees To which combatcorpsmanVN responded: @jamiemcdaniel You can criticize all you want but Ives has been spot on regarding Microsoft and Apple and other tech stocks Instead of criticizing him you should listen to him you’d make some money Among what Ives thinks are his biggest successes include calling the Microsoft has undergone under Satya Nadella The stock is up 10 times since Nadella became Chief Executive in February 2014 Ives said On Apple which he thinks will hit $4T this year Ives understands the criticism that the company has been lacking in innovation since Steve Jobs died What investors have underestimated is the pure breadth of Apples installed base which is 2 billion iOS devices and their ability to monetize Ives said Investors who are so focused on valuation can’t see forest through the trees Ives is excited to keep covering tech as artificial intelligence is causing the industry to go at 90 miles per hour in a Ferrari — while the regulatory environment goes at 25 miles per hour The new tech bull market has begun and is being led by AI Ives said This is just the start of a decade-long trend"

150,"Apple: Buy Sell Or Hold? (NASDAQ:AAPL)","1/9/2024","https://seekingalpha.com/article/4661975-apple-buy-sell-or-hold","yalcinsonat1 Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) the worlds most valuable company has recently become the subject of intense scrutiny There are concerns regarding iPhone sales especially in China There have also been downgrades by Piper Sandler Barclays and others Analysts cite hardware concerns including iPhone 15 weakness and other factors Perhaps most troubling is Apples jacked-up valuation Apple trades at 26 times forward EPS estimates (consensus) and could have an EPS growth of only about 8% next year At a 325 PEG ratio Apple is relatively expensive Therefore Apple will likely go through another stagnant period making its stock a hold now However despite Apples transitory setbacks its stock becomes increasingly attractive around the $150 zone as its forward P/E ratio should remain above 20 Also there are plenty of positive angles to the Apple story There is still considerable growth in its services and wearable businesses iPhone sales should rebound and China sales will likely return to growth Also Apples non-iPhone hardware segment can improve in future quarters Therefore while Apple may be a hold here it becomes a strong buy around the $150 range I will look for an opportunity to enter Apple on weakness as we advance through 2024 Apples stock has gone through transitory periods of stagnant growth weakness and sideways price action several times We saw its stock stagnate around the 2014-2016 time frame We saw another low growth period around 2017-2019 Then we witnessed a sideways phase around the 2021-2022 time frame and Apple may continue consolidating before moving higher again iPhone sales still account for approximately 50% of Apples total revenues Therefore Apple is heavily dependent on the growth of its iPhone sales Last quarter iPhone sales increased by only 3% YoY after posting a 3% YoY decline in the previous quarter illustrating some softness in the iPhone segment iPhone sales (businessofappscom ) However weve seen this dynamic with prior iPhone cycles The market has become highly saturated by Apples iPhone 12-15 Models and its expected to see a slowdown Also the design is relatively old and has become stale Additionally Apples iPhone 15 looks very much like the 12 13 and 14 models and consumers need more incentive to upgrade aside from incremental performance increases that may be unnoticeable to many users For example I still use my iPhone 12 Pro Max that I purchased in late 2020 It works perfectly fine to this day My wife keeps saying I should upgrade but I dont see a reason to upgrade because there is very little difference between my phone and the new line I will likely upgrade to the iPhone 16 in the fall but four years is a long upgrade cycle I am not alone and there isnt a comprehensive catalyst to compel consumers to upgrade to a new iPhone sooner (every 2-3 years) Of course when the redesign comes with more advanced features it will catalyze increased sales There are rumors for minor redesign features for the iPhone 16 but the iPhone 17 model may get major adjustments similar to what we witnessed in the iPhone X jump from the iPhone 8 line-up As the iPhone 12-15 models are so similar its normal to see a slowdown in sales growth Other newer phones are likely taking incremental market share away from Apple in the smartphone market also However iPhone sales should rebound and could surge as Apple introduces its iPhone 16 and 17 line-ups with possible price increases in the future Services revenues (businessofappscom) Services revenues continue expanding at a healthy clip with 77% sales growth last quarter Also services are becoming an increasingly significant portion of total revenues with annual revenues likely to hit $100 billion soon (2025) While we may not see a return to substantial double-digit growth in the services segment it should continue contributing to the increase for many years as we advance Analysts say China iPhone sales dropped by 30% in the first week of 2024 Also 2023 sales likely declined by about 3% from the previous year Apples most recent quarter saw China revenues come in at $151 billion below the $1542 billion in the same quarter one year ago The declines are attributed to new flagship model phones from Huawei Xiaomi and others China is Apples third most significant market behind the Americas and Europe Despite Apples slip in China the sales and market share declines are likely transitory Again this dynamic boils down to Apples stale and still expensive iPhone line-up The new models arent exactly new anymore because aside from color changes the designs are about the same Yet Apple remains at the pinnacle of the electronic hardware pyramid and its products should continue garnering high demand in China and globally Also this is not a China-isolated story Sales in almost all significant regions declined in 2023 compared to a year ago Nonetheless the tide should turn for Apple in China and globally as the iPhone remains a top smartphone Its also a status symbol in many countries and even if some users switch away from the iPhone to try new Huawei or Xiaomi phones they may return to Apple for their future iPhone products In the meantime Apple can improve sales and regain market share by decreasing prices before introducing new and updated iPhones Wearables (businessofappscom) Wearables sales also declined YoY in the previous quarter However were dealing with a relatively slow economy high-interest rates and other challenging factors Still this segment should rebound as the economy strengthens and the Fed introduces a more accessible monetary policy in future years Apples AirPods business alone is estimated to be around a $10B annual revenue business Its Apple Watch segment contributes about $14-$18B in annual sales We should see growth improve in these and other product segments and Apples Vision Pro headset will likely achieve increasing growth in sales as well Apple EPS (SeekingAlphacom ) Of course Apple is not cheap here at 26 times forward EPS estimates However if Apple continues consolidating and dips into my $150-$160 buy-in range it will be priced much more attractively especially with increased future growth prospects Apple should earn around $700-$750 next year implying that its P/E ratio is about 20-22 in the $150-$160 range Due to Apples dominant global positioning high level of profitability future growth prospects and other advantages its stock deserves a 20-22 P/E multiple or higher Therefore we may not see a sustainable move below the $150-$160 range limiting the downside in Apples shares Moreover a significant dip will likely attract substantial dip buyers to Apples stock making it a strong buy if it goes lower on multiple contraction and growth fears Where Apples stock could be in the future Source: The Financial Prophet The most significant risk to Apple may be its valuation/growth dynamic If Apple cant deliver growth its stock may experience multiple expansion beyond my anticipated 20-22 forward P/E contraction If Apples P/E ratio drops back down into the teens its stock price could experience a considerable repricing While this scenario is unlikely it is possible and investors should consider it and other risks before investing in Apples stock Other risks include increased competition geopolitical tensions and macroeconomic factors Are You Getting The Returns You Want?

for instance the hand tracking and the room mapping are driven by AI In addition the Vision Pro is starting with 1 million apps with 600 of them specifically developed for the device as Tim Cook pointed out: Vision Pro its -- when you look at the ton of use cases I mean were starting with a million apps and 600 plus that are -- have been designed particularly for Vision Pro When I look at what is coming out of Enterprise its some of the most innovative things Ive seen come out of Enterprise in a long time And so I think theres a like there is for the Mac and iPad and of course iPhone has been in enterprise since the early days of iPhone I think theres a nice opportunity there for Vision Pro as well When I looked at several videos on YouTube about the Vision Pro review I noticed that there were very interesting applications I saw one in which you have a Formula 1 car in front of you and then you can take each part of that car to assess it properly with so many details about that part This can work perfectly for those who are studying engineering to breakdown each part of an engine to understand it more easily and dynamically I saw another app where the competition of Formula 1 can be watched from the air giving a wider perspective of the different cars in competition in real time In this sense we might see different possibilities for the Vision Pro in the future Architecture might be a field where the Vision Pro could add value; imagine an architect using the glasses to see how a specific design of a house or infrastructure might fit in a specific place using this combination of virtual reality and reality An interior designer could use the device to portrait the insides of a house or a building while making changes in certain aspects These kinds of things are already made with software in the construction sector but its another level to do so in virtual reality Maybe companies like Autodesk (ADSK) Ansys (ANSS) or Nemetschek that offer software for the construction sector could develop apps or integrations that enable Vision Pro to connect with their construction software while improving the experience of designers Flight simulations could be another field where the Vision Pro could add value since future pilots could have an immersive experience as if they were in a real situation where they might polish their skills faster with higher effectiveness The other situation is more related to virtual travel where travel agencies could offer a wide range of experiences in certain places offering the chance for a person to have that experience himself feeling as if he were in that place There are lots of ways in which the Vision Pro could be used and I feel the Vision Pro has surprised consumers which is a very good sign to anticipate some projections about future sales and how important they will become for Apples total revenues Statista Statista The chart above shows a projection until the year 2028 but I will be even more conservative in my projections and include Vision Pro as part of my intrinsic value I think that the Vision Pro has a lot of prospects even when some think that the product is expensive and that its prospects are limited Apples strategy seems sound as its just the start; consumers are using and exploring the different apps available on the device Despite setting a high price for the Vision Pro Apple has not prevented consumers from buying the device The Apple Stores contribute enormously to introducing the experience to consumers unlike any other company that sells these devices Its expected that the new versions of the Vision Pro might be offered at lower prices while adding improvements; that might be a strong emotional trigger to convince new buyers to buy a cheaper and better device I think that setting a high price for the first version is an emotional strategy to capture more consumers in future versions to deliver faster growth On the other hand we should not forget that the integration of the Vision Pro with other Apple devices is another factor that might convince more consumers as the Vision Pro could be integrated with the iMac iPad AirPods and iPhone while performing different tasks at the same time; for instance while editing videos a user could expand the Macs screen in front of him using the Vision Pro According to different multiples we can see that Apple seems fairly valued: Seeking Alpha Seeking Alpha In the table above we can see that most of the multiples indicate that the stock is fairly valued or expensive; for instance the P/E in its different forms shows that Apple is fairly valued compared to the sector However a limitation of this ratio is that its assumed that Apple and its comparables have the same quality which is not necessarily the case On the other hand the PEG ratio is a multiple that calls the attention of growth investors and it indicates that Apple is more expensive than its comparables The main problem is that the ratio is not incorporating the growth opportunities associated with Vision Pro prospects Furthermore I do not use every multiple of valuation that takes the sales as a denominator such as EV/Sales or Price/Sales particularly if we are assessing a high-quality company like Apple; the reason is that these multiples do not consider the net income or the FCF which are way more important metrics to gauge the real performance of a high-quality company So the fact that Apple is more expensive than its comparables using these ratios does not tell me that much The ratios that I consider the most important ones are graded C or C+ such as P/E EV/EBIT and P/Cash Flow so according to these ratios Apple is mostly fairly valued; the P/Cash Flow (FWD) which is a very important ratio in my view is graded B+ which indicates even a reasonable price Considering that Apple has a very consistent generation of free cash flows each year I would have expected that this multiple would be way more expensive than its comparables In my view we need a method that incorporates Vision Pros growth prospects and the share buybacks impact on Apples valuation which is a very important factor that is mostly overlooked As such I propose a DCF model that will include both important factors to get a better approximation of Apples intrinsic value In this sense I will use Vision Pros assumptions made by BofA Securities analyst Wamsi Mohan and UBS analyst David Vogt This is a first approach without considering the Vision Pro and share buybacks effect: Author Author To find the perpetuity we used the formula: Perpetuity = FCF 2027/(discounted rate - g) where g = FCF growth in perpetuity which was assumed to be 9% annual The FCFs are calculated by multiplying the revenues projected by the FCF margins assumed at 26%; in this way I get the FCFs estimated for the next few years With perpetuity we calculate the present value of all the FCFs beyond 2026 Then we calculate the enterprise value using the following: Enterprise Value = Present Value of FCF (from 2024 to 2026) + Perpetuity + Cash - Total Debt Finally the intrinsic value is calculated by taking the enterprise value and dividing it by the outstanding number of shares In this way we could get $17519 per share as an intrinsic value under the assumptions presented To this intrinsic value I will need to include the value that will be generated by Vision Pro and the share buyback effect To include the Vision Pros impact I will include a present value of all the free cash flow that might be generated by the Vision Pros sales in the next few years So I will need the assumptions made by Wamsi Mohan and UBS analyst David Vogt about the sales forecast of the Vision Pro and other assumptions: Author Author I am assuming that Apple will reduce the price of the Vision Pro in the next few years so I could make a forecast according to all these assumptions: Author Author The different colors in my projections of the revenues indicate the different prices per unit assumed for the Vision Pro for those periods Notice that I consider the shipments of 78 million units for 2028 whereas the Statista chart shown above projects 126 million units for 2028 To find the perpetuity we used the formula: Perpetuity = FCF 2032/(discounted rate - g) where g = FCF growth in perpetuity which was assumed to be 6% annual So I follow the same process as the previous calculation of the intrinsic value calculating first the FCF generated by multiplying the revenues by the FCF margins of 20% in each year projected Taking the present value of the perpetuity which is the FCF generated beyond 2031 and the present value of all the FCF generated from 2024 to 2031 I added both groups to have a total present value of 294587 million for the Vision Pro So I added this number to the enterprise value previously calculated which boosted the previous intrinsic value from $17519 to $19438 per share: Author Author Now I will need to somehow include the share buybacks impact in the intrinsic value as its a very important policy used by Apple each year That impact will need to be included in the intrinsic value of $19438 per share I think that share buybacks are a very important policy that Apple frequently uses to deliver long-term value Most analysts do not incorporate this important policy in their assessments of the stock which I consider a big mistake as Apple uses an average of 80% of its FCF each year To do this I need to see the evolution of Apples outstanding number of shares in the last few years: Author Author Before the 4-to-1 split in 2020 the rate of reduction of the number of shares through the share buyback policy was between -4 and -7% annually After the split that rate declined to -33% average over the last 3 years so thats the rate that I will take to project the outstanding number of shares for the next few years: Author Author So I make a projection of the outstanding number of shares until 2027 in which that number of shares is declining by 33% each year Then the model assumes that the number of outstanding shares in 2027 will be the same beyond 2027 Thats a limitation since Apple will likely keep doing repurchases beyond 2027; nevertheless that restriction in our model will make our calculation more conservative As such I add the enterprise value calculated first where I got $17519 then I add Vision Pros projected present value of the FCFs getting $19438 and finally I divide all of this by the outstanding number of shares projected in the year 2027 getting $21298 per share Of course the intrinsic value could be boosted if the revenue growth of the current businesses is higher than my conservative assumptions; remember that I am assuming a revenue growth for Apple considering the iPhone iMac iPad accessories and services—not counting the Vision Pro—of 1% for 2024 2% for 2025 and 3% annual for the years beyond 2025 If Apple grows at 5% annual in the next few years in those segments the intrinsic value could reach $233 per share while keeping my conservative assumptions about the Vision Pro If I keep the very conservative revenue growth assumptions of the older Apple products and if the Vision Pro shows higher growth rates than expected for instance rather than 40% of annual sales growth Apple reaches 50% annual sales growth I could get $221 per share One risk is if the Vision Pro does not grow as expected because there are other devices that capture more market share or attract more consumers or if the device ends up not appealing with a large demand Both scenarios could impact my assumptions and the calculation of the intrinsic value in my model Nevertheless Apple has been working on this device for many years since 2007 showing advanced technology ahead of any competitor with a clear strategy of offering very innovative solutions applications and experiences It is really hard to believe that they do not catch the attention of many consumers particularly those who are fans of technology In addition its likely that in the next few years Apple will reduce the price of the Vision Pro while offering an even better product which could trigger an emotion among consumers to buy the product You should remember that Apple has 22 billion active devices worldwide which is a metric that is growing year by year so thats another hidden catalyst for the Vision Pro as it would be expected that a growing proportion of all those active devices would be this new glasses as more consumers would be keen to integrate the Vision Pro as part of Apples ecosystem Another risk is when an investor buy Apple stock now expecting a short-term return I believe the companys strategy is designed to reward long-term shareholders so thats an important factor to consider if you are considering adding Apple stock to your portfolio Tim Cook seems to believe in having a long view if any investor wants to buy Apple shares since a long horizon would enable your shares to capture that value thanks to excellent management execution and strong competitive advantages Probably another risk is the market cannibalization of the Vision Pro with other Apples products such as the Mac iPad or even the iPhone which could reduce the revenue growth of those products Nevertheless I think that Apple has anticipated that scenario to make the Vision Pro a part of Apples ecosystem in which each product can complement rather than substitute each other As such even when a certain degree of market cannibalization is possible I do not think that the Vision Pro is designed to replace any of the main Apples products Apple Vision Pro is a very good opportunity for Apple to build up new growth avenues in different fields that would enrich the immersive experience of the users to a level never reached before The strategy of setting an expensive price for the first version of the Vision Pro is a sound long-term strategy as its expected that Apple will make gradual improvements to the product with a better design lower weight more technology and more advanced chips at a lower price I trust in the managements execution to further develop the product so I can make decent projections for the next few years that enable me to calculate a very achievable intrinsic value under very conservative assumptions I would say that its a buy for investors who are already holding Apple but a more moderate buy for new investors who have never bought an Apple share before New investors would need to be aware that Apple delivers more value in the long term than in the short term so their horizon is an important factor to consider We should never forget that the lower the price the higher the long-term returns for our investment particularly if we are talking about Apple This article was written by Analyst’s Disclosure: I/we have a beneficial long position in the shares of AAPL either through stock ownership options or other derivatives I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha) I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Seeking Alphas Disclosure: Past performance is no guarantee of future results No recommendation or advice is being given as to whether any investment is suitable for a particular investor Any views or opinions expressed above may not reflect those of Seeking Alpha as a whole Seeking Alpha is not a licensed securities dealer broker or US investment adviser or investment bank Our analysts are third party authors that include both professional investors and individual investors who may not be licensed or certified by any institute or regulatory body"

Some of them have become friends and others I hadn’t seen for a long time” Back in 1984 Macintosh engineer Andy Hertzfeld had told Levy “We’re all maniacs People want to be computer scientists but we are also hackers trying to make Macintosh incredibly small and tight and fast” And Levy’s book cites CEO John Sculley’s observation that the Mac team almost exuded “some spiritual force mesmerizing people… Excitement showed on everyone’s face” Andy_Hertzfeld_1985_(cropped) – photo by Tony Wills – Creative Commons via Wikipedi But Levy makes a counterpoint “Day by day the evidence accumulated that they had it within their power to create something a quantum leap better than anything the industry indeed the world had ever witnessed They believed they could make a dent in the universe” And whatever scale of reverberations might lay ahead Levy had already heard this particularly far-reaching pronouncement from a 28-year-old Steve Jobs “Computers and society are out on a first date in this decade and for some crazy reason we’re just in the right place at the right time to make that romance blossom…” Dan’l Lewin the Computer History museum’s president and CEO warmly opened the event — and then told the audience “This one is special” since Lewin had also led the initial launch of the Macintosh during his time at Apple Lewin believes history is about the present as much as the past — a conversation between both eras he said bringing a chance to “reflect forward… and ideally make the world a better place” And then Lewin added almost as an aside that changing the world had been Douglas Engelbart’s intent from the very beginning… Working over at Xerox’s legendary PARC R&D center Engelbart had engineered (and eventually demoed) the ideas which “begot all of these things” — including the idea of the mouse and of overlapping application windows In 1994 Levy wrote that Engelbart remained at least somewhat overlooked while “His vision was at the mercy of those he inspired” Specifically Levy recounted the tale of Engelbart’s legendary demonstration for eight people from Apple where an excited Steve Jobs “nearly exploded” when he said… “Why aren’t you doing anything with this? This is the greatest thing! This is revolutionary!” The first panel included Susan Kare creator of all the Mac’s icons and fonts as well as three development team members Macintosh engineer Bill Atkinson remembered demonstrating the Mac’s predecessor the Lisa to Engelbart and getting some impactful advice: “In your quest to make something user-friendly be sure you don’t lock out the power user who wants to go fast later” That very night Atkinson added a feature still in use today “The fact that there are keyboard shortcuts I credit a little goading from Doug Engelbart” The panel also remembered how the Macintosh project had originally been started in 1979 (and supervised for its first year) by Jef Raskin who had written the manuals for the Apple II But while Rafkin started the project he told Levy that “It was clear that Macintosh was the most interesting thing at Apple — and Steve Jobs took it over” Speaking in January Macintosh engineer Andy Hertzfeld said Rafkin deserved a lot of credit “for putting together the vision of the Macintosh which was if we could make a computer that was inexpensive and easy to use we could sell computers by the millions” Hertzfeld says that even though Rafkin left the team his original vision stuck with the project throughout its development Steve Capps added that “the whole team — from manufacturing manuals to software to hardware — was 100 people And that’s just unheard of today” Levy’s book says the team started as “a scrappy assortment of outcasts and mutts…” The audience applauded when Susan Kare remembered the positivity and encouragement she’d experienced from Steve Jobs Levy’s book also notes that in January of 1983 Steve Jobs scrawled three words onto an easel “Real artists ship” But Bill Atkinson remembered another way Jobs motivated them “He said ‘Real artists sign their work’ And he brought around a piece of white paper and sharpies and all of us got to sign on them — and then he had those engraved on the hard tooling for the case So if you take off the back of an original Mac all of us have signed it He wanted us to take pride in our work” Levy captured more of that sentiment in his book — remembering his 1984 interview with Steve Jobs “I look at most of the people I get to work with as artists” Jobs had said “I look at myself as an artist if anything” And when Levy said “Really?” Jobs had joked “Sort of a trapeze artist” “With or without a net?” “Without” But then Jobs said seriously “It’s a way of expressing feelings Wanting to put something back into the world” While we spend our lives eating the food that others have grown “It’s a wonderful ecstatic feeling to create something that puts it back in the pool of human experience and knowledge… “I’m one of those people who think that Thomas Edison and the light bulb changed the world a lot more than Karl Marx ever did” Levy himself appeared on the final panel along with Chris Espinosa Apple’s longest-serving employee and former Apple Chief Evangelist Guy Kawasaki And Levy remembered that using computers at that time “was like throwing messages over a fence” — whereas opening folders on a Mac or using a cursor felt like finally interacting with the digital world “That was the inflection point that I was seeing right at that moment” The museum also held a panel with the marketing team — Andy Cunningham Dan’l Lewin and Mike Murray — who remembered how Apple’s Board of Directors had originally demanded that they not broadcast their soon-to-be-famous Super Bowl ad Murray said even after their eventual triumph he continued feeling a pressure to succeed “The technical team was just so brilliant and the work they had done — it was just so extraordinary taking from Lisa and taking from PARC and putting it all in this small box They had worked so hard — and we couldn’t fail them… Though it was imperfect for the marketplace at the time we had to get it out there and we had to make it stick” Levy spoke to Jobs before the launch who insisted his motivation was a love for the users the product and the company that Apple could become “If we fail that will mean my entire worldview is all wrong” And Jobs went on to predict they’d sell two million by the end of the next year He was wrong Levy’s book notes that even in its first five years barely one million Macs were sold (“It almost failed…” Levy writes “The Macintosh factory kept churning out gorgeous boxes that gathered dust in dealerships… Apple would experience months where it moved no more than five thousand Macs”) Apple showed a quarterly loss; it laid off 20% of its workforce and “The board decided finally that Jobs was the problem” Just 16 months after the launch Steve Jobs left Apple — not to return until 1997 In Levy’s book the Mac ultimately makes inroads with the arrival of serious business applications like the desktop publishing software PageMaker The Macintosh was upgraded with more memory and a second plug-in floppy drive — and crucially a redesigned “Mac Classic” was released for under $1000 So in its second five years from 1989 to 1994 Apple sold roughly 10 million Macintoshes In his book Levy called the Mac “but a step in a path that was probably inevitable the trail leading to a Digital Nirvana where all information all music all pictures all transactions and all mental activity gets parsed into seething bits of ones and zeros” But still — it was “the crucial step the turning point…” Pogue told the audience at the Computer History Museum that the Macintosh was the result of people who’d worked for “insanely long hours for insanely low pay — because they believed in their mission…” And when he asked his audience to stand if they’d ever worked on the Macintosh — dozens did At the end of the night Lewin also acknowledged all of the people who’d worked on the hardware — “the manufacturing infrastructure and everything else Because software’s pretty and there’s a lot of good stories about marketing and everything else but those who had anything to do with hardware — associated with any of these products — I just want to acknowledge the fact that we weren’t able to put it all on stage” And the audience applauded loudly At the end of the night the museum invited anyone who’d worked in the Mac division to join a group photo for the museum’s collection (Computer History Museum) Community created roadmaps articles resources and journeys for developers to help you choose your path and grow in your career"

Company","1/12/2024","https://english.aawsat.com/technology/4784801-microsoft-briefly-overtakes-apple-worlds-most-valuable-company","Microsoft on Thursday briefly overtook Apple as the worlds most valuable company for the first time since 2021 after the iPhone makers shares made a weak start to the year on growing concerns over demand Reuters said Microsofts shares have risen sharply since last year thanks to the early lead the company has taken in generative artificial intelligence through an investment in ChatGPT-maker OpenAI Microsofts stock closed 05% higher giving it a market valuation of $2859 trillion It rose as much as 2% during the session and the company was briefly worth $2903 trillion Shares of Apple closed 03% lower giving the company a market capitalization of $2886 trillion Microsoft and Apple have jostled for top spot over the years It was inevitable that Microsoft would overtake Apple since Microsoft is growing faster and has more to benefit from the generative AI revolution said DA Davidson analyst Gil Luria Microsoft has incorporated OpenAIs technology across its suite of productivity software a move that helped spark a rebound in its cloud-computing business in the July-September quarter Apple meanwhile has been grappling with weakening demand including for the iPhone its biggest cash cow Demand in China a major market has slumped as the countrys economy makes a slow recovery from the pandemic and a resurgent Huawei chips away at its market share China could be a drag on performance over the coming years brokerage Redburn Atlantic said in a client note on Wednesday downgrading Apples shares to neutral At least three of the 41 analysts covering Apple have lowered their ratings since the start of 2024 Shares of Cupertino California-based Apple have fallen 33% in January as of the last close compared with a 18% rise in Microsoft Both stocks are expensive in terms of their share price-to-earnings (PE) ratio a common method of valuing publicly listed companies Apple is trading at a forward PE of 28 well above its average of 19 over the past 10 years according to LSEG data Microsoft is trading around 31 times forward earnings above its 10-year average of 24 Shares of Apple whose market capitalization peaked at $3081 trillion on Dec 14 ended last year with a gain of 48% That was lower than the 57% rise posted by Microsoft Microsoft has briefly taken the lead over Apple as the most valuable company a handful of times since 2018 including in 2021 when concerns about COVID-driven supply chain shortages hit the iPhone makers stock price Currently Wall Street is more positive on Microsoft The company has no sell rating and nearly 90% of the brokerages covering the company recommend buying the stock Apple has two sell ratings and only two-thirds of the analysts covering the company rate it a buy The General Assembly approved the first United Nations resolution on artificial intelligence Thursday giving global support to an international effort to ensure the powerful new technology benefits all nations respects human rights and is “safe secure and trustworthy” The resolution sponsored by the United States and co-sponsored by 123 countries including China was adopted by consensus with a bang of the gavel and without a vote meaning it has the support of all 193 UN member nations US Vice President Kamala Harris and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan called the resolution “historic for setting out principles for using artificial intelligence in a safe way Secretary of State Antony Blinken called it “a landmark effort and a first-of-its-kind global approach to the development and use of this powerful emerging technology” “AI must be in the public interest – it must be adopted and advanced in a way that protects everyone from potential harm and ensures everyone is able to enjoy its benefits” Harris said in a statement At last Septembers gathering of world leaders at the General Assembly President Joe Biden said the United States planned to work with competitors around the world to ensure AI was harnessed “for good while protecting our citizens from this most profound risk” Over the past few months The United States worked with more than 120 countries at the United Nations — including Russia China and Cuba — to negotiate the text of the resolution adopted Thursday “In a moment in which the world is seen to be agreeing on little perhaps the most quietly radical aspect of this resolution is the wide consensus forged in the name of advancing progress” US Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield told the assembly just before the vote “The United Nations and artificial intelligence are contemporaries both born in the years following the Second World War” she said “The two have grown and evolved in parallel Today as the UN and AI finally intersect we have the opportunity and the responsibility to choose as one united global community to govern this technology rather than let it govern us” At a news conference after the vote ambassadors from the Bahamas Japan the Netherlands Morocco Singapore and the United Kingdom enthusiastically supported the resolution joining the US ambassador who called it “a good day for the United Nations and a good day for multilateralism” Thomas-Greenfield said in an interview with The Associated Press that she believes the worlds nations came together in part because “the technology is moving so fast that people dont have a sense of what is happening and how it will impact them particularly for countries in the developing world” “They want to know that this technology will be available for them to take advantage of it in the future so this resolution gives them that confidence” Thomas-Greenfield said “Its just the first step Im not overplaying it but its an important first step” The resolution aims to close the digital divide between rich developed countries and poorer developing countries and make sure they are all at the table in discussions on AI It also aims to make sure that developing countries have the technology and capabilities to take advantage of AIs benefits including detecting diseases predicting floods helping farmers and training the next generation of workers The resolution recognizes the rapid acceleration of AI development and use and stresses “the urgency of achieving global consensus on safe secure and trustworthy artificial intelligence systems” It also recognizes that “the governance of artificial intelligence systems is an evolving area” that needs further discussions on possible governance approaches And it stresses that innovation and regulation are mutually reinforcing — not mutually exclusive Big tech companies generally have supported the need to regulate AI while lobbying to ensure any rules work in their favor European Union lawmakers gave final approval March 13 to the world’s first comprehensive AI rules which are on track to take effect by May or June after a few final formalities Countries around the world including the US and China and the Group of 20 major industrialized nations are also moving to draw up AI regulations The UN resolution takes note of other UN efforts including by Secretary-General António Guterres and the International Telecommunication Union to ensure that AI is used to benefit the world Thomas-Greenfield also cited efforts by Japan India and other countries and groups Unlike Security Council resolutions General Assembly resolutions are not legally binding but they are a barometer of world opinion The resolution encourages all countries regional and international organizations tech communities civil society the media academia research institutions and individuals “to develop and support regulatory and governance approaches and frameworks” for safe AI systems It warns against “improper or malicious design development deployment and use of artificial intelligence systems such as without adequate safeguards or in a manner inconsistent with international law” A key goal according to the resolution is to use AI to help spur progress toward achieving the UN’s badly lagging development goals for 2030 including ending global hunger and poverty improving health worldwide ensuring quality secondary education for all children and achieving gender equality The resolution calls on the 193 UN member states and others to assist developing countries to access the benefits of digital transformation and safe AI systems It “emphasizes that human rights and fundamental freedoms must be respected protected and promoted through the life cycle of artificial intelligence systems” Apple CEO Tim Cook opened Apples new store in Shanghai drawing a large crowd on Thursday Some people queued up overnight according to posts on Chinese social media Cook arrived in Shanghai on Wednesday he said on his personal Weibo account Meanwhile the US Department of Justice (DOJ) is preparing to sue Apple for allegedly violating antitrust laws by blocking rivals from accessing hardware and software features of its iPhone Bloomberg News reported on Wednesday Taking action against Big Tech has been one of the few ideas that Democrats and Republicans have agreed on During the Trump administration which ended in 2021 the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) opened probes into Google Facebook Apple and Amazon A DOJ spokesperson and Apple did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment The UN General Assembly will turn its attention to artificial intelligence on Thursday weighing a resolution that lays out the potentially transformational technologys pros and cons while calling for the establishment of international standards The text co-sponsored by dozens of countries emphasizes the necessity of guidelines to promote safe secure and trustworthy artificial intelligence systems while excluding military AI from its purview AFP said On the whole the resolution focuses more on the technologys positive potential and calls for special care to bridge the artificial intelligence and other digital divides between and within countries The draft resolution which is the first on the issue was brought forth by the United States and will be submitted for approval by the assembly on Thursday It also seeks to promote not hinder digital transformation and equitable access to AI in order to achieve the UNs Sustainable Development Goals which aim to ensure a better future for humanity by 2030 As AI technologies rapidly develop there is urgent need and unique opportunities for member states to meet this critical moment with collective action US Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield said reading a joint statement by the dozens of co-sponsor countries According to Richard Gowan an analyst at the International Crisis Group the emphasis on development is a deliberate effort by the US to win goodwill among poorer nations It is easier to talk about how AI can help developing countries progress rather than tackle security and safety topics head-on as a first initiative he said Male-dominated algorithms The draft text does highlight the technologys threats when misused with the intent to cause harm and also recognizes that without guarantees AI risks eroding human rights reinforcing prejudices and endangering personal data protection It therefore asks member states and stakeholders to refrain from or cease the use of artificial intelligence systems that are impossible to operate in compliance with international human rights law or that pose undue risks to the enjoyment of human rights Warnings against the technology have become increasingly prevalent particularly when it comes to generative AI tools and the risks they pose for democracy and society particularly via fake images and speech shared in a bid to interfere in elections UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has made AI regulation a priority calling for the creation of a UN entity modeled on other UN organizations such as the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) He has regularly highlighted the potential for disinformation and last week warned of bias in technologies designed mainly by men which can result in algorithms that ignore the rights and needs of women Male-dominated algorithms could literally program inequalities into activities from urban planning to credit ratings to medical imaging for years to come he said Gowan of the International Crisis Group said he didnt think the US wants Guterres leading this conversation because it is so sensitive and was therefore stepping in to shape the debate A race is underway between various UN member states the United States China and South Korea to be at the forefront of the issue In October the White House unveiled rules intended to ensure that the United States leads the way in AI regulation with President Joe Biden insisting on the need to govern the technology Neuralink on Wednesday streamed a video of its first human patient playing computer chess with his mind and talking about the brain implant making that possible Noland Arbaugh 29 who was left paralyzed from the shoulders down by a diving accident eight years ago told of playing chess and the videogame Civilization as well as taking Japanese and French lessons by controlling a computer screen cursor with his brain said AFP Its crazy it really is Its so cool said Arbaugh who joked of having telepathy thanks to Elon Musks Neuralink startup Musks neurotechnology company installed a brain implant in its first human test subject in January with the billionaire head of Tesla and X touting it as a success Arbaugh said he was released from the hospital a day after the device was implanted in his brain and that he had no cognitive impairment as a result There is a lot of work to be done but it has already changed my life he said I dont want people to think this is the end of the journey He told of starting out by thinking about moving the cursor and eventually the implant system mirrored his intent The reason I got into it was because I wanted to be part of something that I feel is going to change the world he said Arbaugh said he plans to dress up this Halloween as Marvel Comics X-Men character Charles Xavier who is wheelchair-bound but possesses mental superpowers Im going to be Professor X he said I think thats pretty fitting Im basically telekinetic A Neuralink engineer in the video which was posted on X and Reddit promised more updates regarding the patients progress I knew they started doing this with human patients but its another level to actually see the person who has one in one Reddit user commented Really crazy impressive and scary all at once Neuralinks technology works through a device about the size of five stacked coins that is placed inside the human brain through invasive surgery The startup cofounded by Musk in 2016 aims to build direct communication channels between the brain and computers The ambition is to supercharge human capabilities treat neurological disorders like ALS or Parkinsons and maybe one day achieve a symbiotic relationship between humans and artificial intelligence Musk is hardly alone in trying to make advances in the field which is officially known as brain-machine or brain-computer interface research Apple CEO Tim Cook said he is currently visiting Shanghai according to a post on his Weibo account on Wednesday Cook said he spent the morning walking along Shanghais historic Bund River with Chinese actor Zheng Kai and having a local breakfast but did not disclose what other plans he had for this China visit His visit comes after the iPhone maker announced that it would open a new retail store in the heart of the Chinese financial hub on Thursday and as Apple battles falling iPhone sales in China and rising competition from domestic rivals such as Huawei Cook made at least two visits to China Apples third-largest market by revenue last year He also travelled to Beijing around the same time last year where he visited an Apple store and attended the China Development Forum Samsung Electronics expects $100 million or more of revenue from its next batch of advanced chip-packaging products this year co-CEO Kye-Hyun Kyung said on Wednesday Samsung set up advanced chip packaging as a business unit last year and Kyung said he expects the results of Samsungs investment to come out in earnest from the second half of this year Kyungs remarks were made during Samsungs annual general shareholders meeting Samsungs memory chip business seeks to achieve a greater profit share than its market share this year Kyung said Samsungs market share in DRAM chips used in tech devices reached 455% in the fourth quarter last year according to data provider TrendForce To do this Samsung seeks to secure a competitive advantage in high-end memory chips required by booming artificial intelligence demand including mass producing a 12-stack version of high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips called HBM3E For a future generation of HBM chips called HBM4 likely to be released in 2025 with more customized designs Samsung will take advantage of having memory chips chip contract manufacturing and chip design businesses under one roof to satisfy customer needs Kyung said Answering a shareholder question on Samsungs recent setback in the current HBM market compared to rival SK Hynix Kyung said: Were better prepared to prevent that from happening again in the future Samsung Electronics shares rose as much as 604% on Wednesday and are set for their highest one-day jump since early September after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said the AI semiconductor leader is qualifying Samsungs HBM chips for use Samsung expects tangible results soon from other memory products being developed for use in AI including compute express link (CXL) and processing-in-memory (PIM) products Kyung added Frances competition watchdog on Wednesday said it fined Google 250 million euros ($27173 million) for breaches linked to EU intellectual property rules in its relationship with media publishers Google has pledged not to contest the facts as part of settlement proceedings the watchdog said adding the company also proposed a series of remedy measures to certain shortcomings The fine is linked to a copyright dispute in France over online content in a case triggered by complaints from some of Frances biggest news organizations including Agence France Presse (AFP) The dispute seemed resolved in 2022 when the US tech giant dropped its appeal against an initial 500 million euro fine issued at the end of a major investigation carried out by the Autorite de la Concurrence In Wednesdays statement the watchdog said Google violated the terms of four out of seven commitments agreed in the settlement agreement including conducting negotiations with publishers in good faith and providing transparent information Google could not immediately be reached for comment Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi reported a 109% rise in fourth-quarter revenue on Tuesday boosted by strong smartphone sales in an industry showing signs of recovery Revenue reached 7324 billion yuan ($1017 billion) in October-December versus the 7317 billion yuan average of 15 analyst estimates compiled by LSEG Adjusted net profit rose 2361% from the same period a year earlier to 49 billion yuan That compared with the 389 billion yuan average analyst estimate SK Hynix Inc said on Tuesday it has begun mass production of next-generation high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips used in artificial intelligence chipsets with sources saying initial shipments will go to Nvidia this month The new type of chip - called the HBM3E - is a focal point of intense competition Last month Micron Technology said it had started mass production of the chips while Samsung Electronics said it had developed the industrys first 12-stack HBM3E chips SK Hynix has however led the HBM chip market by virtue of being the sole supplier of the version currently used - the HBM3 - to Nvidia which has 80% of the market for AI chips The company expects successful mass production of HBM3E and with our experience as the industrys first provider of HBM3 we expect to cement our leadership in the AI memory space SK Hynix said in a statement The new HBM3E chip by the worlds second-largest memory chipmaker offers 10% improvement in heat dissipation and processes up to 118 terabytes of data per second SK Hynixs HBM capacity is fully booked for 2024 analysts said as explosive demand for AI chipsets drives up demand for high-end memory chips used in them SK Hynix has secured an absolute market position and its volume increase in high-end memory chips is also expected to be the most aggressive among chipmakers said Kim Un-ho analyst at IBK Investment & Securities Nvidia unveiled on Monday its latest flagship AI chip the B200 said to be 30 times speedier at some tasks than its predecessor as it seeks to maintain its dominant position in the artificial-intelligence industry Shares in SK Hynix have doubled in value over the past 12 months on its leading position in HBM chips By Brian X Chen and Yiwen Lu To a growing number of youths a wallet stuffed with cash and cards is as unfashionable as the millennial tuck no-show socks and skinny jeans Carrying only a smartphone is the way Iykyk — that’s “if you know you know” for those who don’t know I Brian Chen a graying 39-year-old tech columnist am not one of those in the know It’s unfathomable to me to part with my wallet which holds crucial items like my driver’s license So in an effort to be hip again I recruited my 23-year-old colleague Yiwen Lu to ask the young ones how they live like this and then I took the jump myself In ditching my physical wallet I am joining youths like Ruby Hegab a 19-year-old student in Fremont Calif As soon as she got her first credit card last year she said she went all-in on using her iPhone to pay for groceries parking meters and restaurant meals and for carrying insurance cards “If a store doesn’t accept Tap to Pay I won’t give them business” Ms Hegab said But that rarely happens because the overwhelming majority of merchants she visits including big box retailers and mom-and-pop shops now accept some form of mobile payment from services like Apple Pay and Venmo In a survey asking just over 2500 Americans about digital payments some 80 percent of Gen Z respondents said they were using mobile wallets and among them half were eager to use their phones for much more than paying for things according to recent data from Pymnts Intelligence a research firm that studies commerce Younger people are increasingly using their phones for purposes that older adults would use a traditional wallet for like carrying documents such as a driver’s license boarding passes and event tickets Some of these digital items can be added into the Apple and Google wallet apps while others like insurance cards can be downloaded through third-party apps The shift in behavior is a reflection of how far mobile wallets have come About a decade ago when I covered emerging mobile payment apps most people shrugged at the technology because tapping a phone on a scanner was no more convenient than swiping a credit card In recent years amid a global pandemic that drove people toward contact-free payments Apple and Google expanded their software to support digitized driver’s licenses and transit cards a perfect storm that made mobile wallets more useful Braving it without a wallet for a week I used only my phone to do my shopping; go to bars out for dinner and to the movies; and even buy crab from a fisherman’s boat The phone sufficed in almost all those situations though paying for dinner was more complicated and using a digital driver’s license to buy wine at a grocery store was a nonstarter If you’re hoping to ditch your wallet or simply want to cut down on some bulk in your pocket here’s what you need to know Payments In many stores Android and iPhone users can use Google Pay and Apple Pay by tapping their phones on readers next to the cash register Many small businesses such as food trucks accept payments through third-party apps like Venmo which let you scan a bar code to send money Yet there is inherent risk when you rely fully on a mobile wallet Abi Hoyer 21 in Punta Gorda Fla said she didn’t carry a wallet for safety reasons: In the event of a mugging a thief would get only her phone Still thieves could potentially make payments and drain money from your account if they coerced you into sharing your passcode That’s why it’s important for iPhone users to activate a new safety feature in settings called Stolen Device Protection which prevents passcode access to data such as passwords and stored credit cards when the device is in an unfamiliar location And Android users should be aware of the steps to lock and purge data from the device in the event of theft In addition not all businesses take mobile payments Ms Hoyer learned this the hard way at Walmart when she discovered she was unable to pay for her items and didn’t have her full credit card number to sign up for the store’s wallet Walmart Pay One workaround: Password manager apps like 1Password and Bitwarden can safely store sensitive data including credit card numbers in case you need to look them up Jillian Gillespie 27 in Chicago switched to Apple Pay after losing her wallet over a year ago she said This works out fine for fast-casual restaurants where you pay at the counter but at sit-down restaurants where waiters drop off a bill and expect to run a credit card she occasionally has to rely on friends to pay In those cases she typically uses Venmo to reimburse her friends “I don’t really carry my wallet around with me which sometimes can bite me in the butt” Ms Gillespie said I ran into similar snags Out of three restaurants only one brought a reader for me to tap my phone to pay while the others asked for a credit card which required my wife to pay Insurance cards and other documents Digital scans or photos of important documents like health insurance and car insurance cards are now broadly accepted as substitutes for the real thing Some insurance providers like State Farm Aetna and Anthem make their digital cards available through their apps which can be added to your mobile wallet Not all insurance cards work this way though and it can be a hassle to find those cards at a moment’s notice — you don’t want to be stuck sifting through photos or finding the right app to load your insurance card after a car crash for instance I found that the simplest method to make insurance cards easy to look up is to attach images of all of them to one digital note stored on your phone On iPhones you open your photo of the insurance card tap the button in the lower left corner and select the Notes app to save the image to a new note Then rename the note “Insurance Cards” Similarly Android users can use the Google Keep note-taking app In Keep at the bottom tap “add image” Then pick the photo of your insurance card and label the note Other types of cards and documents like my Clipper card for public transit movie tickets and gift cards were all simple enough to digitize: Tapping the Add to Apple Wallet button loaded them inside my Apple wallet app Identification Digitized versions of driver’s licenses are still relatively new and being tested in various states including California Arizona Connecticut Maryland and Utah This is where the mobile wallet falls short Here in California for example you sign up for the digital driver’s license through the California Department of Motor Vehicles app The app generates a temporary bar code that can be scanned to verify your age and identity Airports in some states now display signs stating that they will accept the digital ID from those who have signed up for the Transportation Security Agency’s PreCheck program — but many states have yet to participate in this experiment which makes it impractical to leave your driver’s license at home The digital ID is also not yet an acceptable substitute for a physical driver’s license The California DMV says law enforcement officers cannot accept the mobile driver’s license if you are pulled over and Arizona’s Motor Vehicle Division says people are still required to carry a physical ID In the event of an emergency a person may also have trouble identifying you Apple’s Medical ID and Google’s Personal Safety features can be set up to show people your name age and emergency contacts by pressing a shortcut on the phone — but emergency medical workers would have to know how to use the feature So it’s best to continue carrying a physical ID To do that without carrying a wallet you could do what some younger people do and sandwich the ID between your phone and phone case I found that to be an imperfect solution because the card elevates the phone closer to the edges of the case which makes the screen more susceptible to damage when it’s dropped After a week I settled on what I felt was the best solution: a magnetic wallet that attaches to the back of my phone and carries only two cards — my ID and one credit card That felt like cheating But Ms Hegab the 19-year-old admits that she uses a similar card holder for carrying only her driver’s license As soon as digital driver’s licenses work everywhere she said she’ll be getting

Apples stock is currently trading at 27 times the consensus calendar 2024 earnings-per-share estimate among analysts polled by FactSet (This article uses calendar years for all estimates because some companies including Apple have fiscal years that dont match the calendar) Alphabet Incs Class A shares (GOOGL) are trading at a P/E ratio of about 20 times the consensus calendar 2024 estimate while Meta Platforms Inc (META) trades at about 20 times its consensus 2024 EPS estimate Here is a list of the Magnificent Seven stocks that led last years rally for the S&P 500 SPX sorted by marker capitalization and including expected compound annual growth rates through calendar 2025 based on consensus estimates among analysts polled by FactSet Estimates for the full S&P 500 are at the bottom of the table Apple is expected to grow its earnings at an annual pace of 82% over the next two years while increasing its annual sales at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5% Analysts expect much higher growth rates for EPS and sales for Alphabet and Meta and those stocks trade at much lower P/E valuations than Apple does Even the S&P 500 is expected to increase EPS and sales more quickly than Apple through 2025 The benchmark US index trades at 193 times weighted aggregate consensus EPS estimates for 2024 - much lower than Apples P/E of 27 The P/E multiple on Apple has basically doubled over the last five years and increased by 50% in 2023 wrote Barclays analyst Tim Long in a downgrade note this week He added that Apples current valuation has reached a high-water mark Long was one of two Wall Street analysts who called attention to Apples diminished growth prospects in the first trading week of the new year He cut his rating to underweight and lowered estimates for the March quarter citing incrementally weak iPhone 15 data out of China and muted enthusiasm for the forthcoming iPhone 16 We believe the continued period of weak results coupled with multiple expansion is not sustainable Long wrote We also believe 2024 will bring more services risk to light Apples services business increased at a 9% rate in fiscal 2023 (which ended Sept 30) but Long is expecting services growth to grow 10% in fiscal 2024 and then slow to 8% in fiscal 2025 Services has been a big bright spot of consistent growth for Apple in the last few years Another analyst Gil Luria of DA Davidson picked up coverage of Apple shares last week with an neutral rating and a price target of $166 noting that he believed the current share price reflects expectations for significant resumption of growth which is less likely without an innovation breakthrough Read more here: Apples stock needs to get unstuck and its innovation rut may not be helping Apple needs a new growth engine in the form of a new product or landmark service Clearly Apple needs a new growth engine in the form of a new product or landmark service The companys $3499 Vision Pro mixed-reality headset will be available in US stores and online Feb 2 with pre-orders starting Jan 19 but it is an expensive product in a market that has yet to really take off Apple doesnt comment on unannounced products and keeps close guard over any secret projects it may have under development So investors will be in the dark for a while until other new product plans are unveiled That is part of the mystique of the company but it is also a bane for long-term investors The company is of course dealing with the law of large numbers: As its revenue number hits greater heights Apple will have a tougher time posting the sort of double-digit growth it last did in fiscal 2018 and in the Covid-19 pandemic boom year of fiscal 2021 with an anomaly of 332% growth The low single-digit growth analysts now forecast for Apple seems hardly worthy of its stocks current multiple Apple still has plenty of defenders Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives recently pounded the table for the stock saying the growth demise story of Apple being spun by bears is a dynamic we have seen constantly over the past decade and this is just another chapter in that book Ives says that with 240 million iPhones ripe for upgrades both the iPhone and services by his estimates are poised to reaccelerate in fiscal 2024 and now is a golden opportunity to own Apple for the next year This is an existential question that investors must ask right now The additional pressure of a potential US Justice Department case looking into how Apple exerts control to lock in users adds more uncertainty Investors will have to decide for themselves if Apple has dramatically better growth ahead of it If not the stocks paltry but reliable dividend and its stock buybacks may not be enough to satiate Wall Street Philip van Doorn contributed to this article

185,"None","1/14/2024","https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stock-split-watch-apple-next-131000148.html?ref=biztoc.com","Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has split its stock five times since its IPO in 1980 It executed three 2-for-1 splits in 1987 2000 and 2005 a 7-for-1 split in 2014 and a 4-for-1 split in 2020 Those splits would have turned 100 shares bought prior to the first one into 22400 shares -- and anyone who bought 100 shares at its IPO price of $22 and held on would have seen their initial $2200 investment turn into a holding worth more than $42 million today Now those stock splits didnt actually make Apples shares more valuable They simply carved its existing shares into smaller ownership slices of the company which reduced their prices and made them easier to trade on the options market where a single contract needs to be tethered to 100 shares The underlying valuation of the company and of investors positions in it remained the same Most brokerages now make it easy for retail investors to buy and sell fractional shares so they wont be prevented from putting money into a company because it has too high a share price and stock splits dont matter as much as they used to That said stock splits still usually generate a lot of media buzz and attract the attention of retail investors who might be more inclined to purchase shares of a stock with a double-digit price tag instead of a triple-digit one So could Apple split its stock which currently trades at around $186 per share in the near future? When Apple announced its last 4-for-1 split on July 30 2020 its stock was trading at $385 When it announced its previous 7-for-1 split on April 23 2014 it was trading at $525 Based on those two decisions it doesnt seem likely that Apple will choose to split its stock at its current level of around $200 a share It has also been just three and a half years since its last split and the shortest period between its stock splits has been nearly five years (2000 to 2005) so far Therefore it will probably be at least a few more years before Apples board approves another stock split Apple is already worth almost $29 trillion which makes it one of the two most valuable companies in the world alongside Microsoft (Microsoft briefly moved ahead of Apple to take the No 1 spot on Thursday) It could be difficult for Apple to grow its market cap meaningfully from there as its revenue growth and earnings growth cool off Analysts expect Apples revenue and earnings to only rise 4% and 8% respectively in its fiscal 2024 (which will end in September) as iPhone sales slow down Its iPhone sales fell 2% in fiscal 2023 -- due to the end of the 5G upgrade cycle and macroeconomic challenges in China -- but the flagship smartphone still accounted for over half of the companys total revenue Declining sales of Macs in the post-pandemic market and currency headwinds exacerbated that slowdown Apple is trying to offset that pressure by expanding its services ecosystem which now features more than a billion paid subscriptions but it remains overwhelmingly dependent on the iPhone A patent dispute also recently disrupted the sales of Apple Watches in the US and the $3500 price tag of the new Vision Pro headset will limit its mainstream appeal when it launches in early February Considering all the challenges Apple faces its stock doesnt look like a bargain at 28 times forward earnings And its paltry dividend yield of 05% wont attract any serious income investors at a time when CDs and Treasuries offer risk-free yields of more than 5% Instead of wondering when Apple might split its stock again investors should focus on the companys cash flows and buybacks as it navigates the near-term headwinds It generated $996 billion in free cash flow (FCF) over the past 12 months and it spent $776 billion of that total on buybacks and $15 billion on dividends It bought back 38% of its outstanding shares over the past 10 years and it has raised its dividend every year since it reinstated the payout in 2012 Those moves indicate Apple is a shareholder-friendly company that would rather return its excess cash to its investors instead of di-worsifying itself with reckless investments or acquisitions That might be why Warren Buffetts Berkshire Hathaway has allocated nearly half of its stock portfolio to Apple But with $162 billion in cash and marketable securities on its books at the end of its latest quarter Apple still has plenty of room to make big acquisitions to expand its ecosystem That cash cushion also makes it a good safe haven stock to own during economic downturns Apples upside might be limited this year but its core strengths should limit its downside potential until its next growth cycle starts Therefore it might still be a good time to accumulate this stock as the bears bemoan its lack of near-term catalysts Should you invest $1000 in Apple right now?

Apple has already spent a year considering that question The introduction of the answers is still months away Until then investors should expect a bumpy ride But if you’re there for it if you buy the dips I think you’ll make money down the road Apple’s AI vision is based on the two areas where it made its reputation client devices and safety A recent paper by Apple scientists explains it Apple plans to install its large language model onto its devices by using flash memory and reading the data in large chunks These chunks are defined as “neurons” taken out of memory as new questions are posed Apple thinks this technique can let it run LLMs that are twice the size of the Dynamic memory available increasing inference speed up to 500% Current LLMs also have a huge Garbage In Garbage Out problem When you “train” software on bad data you get bad answers Apple is working to license legitimate data to solve this problem This is in contrast to ChatGPT backed by Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) ChatGPT wants to take copyrighted data for free and run Generative AI through its Azure cloud Apple’s view is a big risk but it could result in big rewards for APPL stock Apple plans to tie its AI to the iPhone through the Siri spoken interface Contrast this with Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) which just laid off people from its speaking interface and device units Like Microsoft Google wants to run AI through its cloud Apple is also consolidating its AI work in Texas telling 121 workers in San Diego to move or leave the company This could send some talent to rivals But the move means Apple is past the point of thinking about how its AI will work Implementation is usually the work of a single unified team All will be revealed in early June when Apple holds its Worldwide Developers Conference The event will be held at its Cupertino headquarters and be fully available online It may be the most important Apple event since the 2007 launch of the iPhone A host of new tools are due to be launched While working on its next revolution Apple must maintain excitement for its current offerings Judging from the crowds I saw at an Atlanta Apple store over the holidays there’s little to fear Apple has enormous customer loyalty even for older models Apple also has more control over its supply chain and distribution than any company this side of Lululemon (NASDAQ:LULU) It’s this control that let Apple earn gross margins of 44% in its most recent quarter Those margins aren’t going down The risk is in the volume of iPhone sales That’s still half of the business But remember that higher-margin services are now one-quarter of revenue Apple is considered a dark horse in AI because it’s focused on the broad consumer market which will take time to develop For the next year the biggest gains will come from businesses Enterprises will be spending billions building their own LLM models loading them with databases built over the last two decades That’s why Microsoft is now worth slightly more than Apple having nearly doubled its stock gains in the last year The spread accelerated over the last few months But that’s also why a smart investor will buy more Apple than Microsoft stock over the next few months It’s cheaper and by this time next year your patience will be rewarded As of this writing Dana Blankenhorn had LONG positions in MSFT GOOGL and AAPL The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer subject to the InvestorPlacecom Publishing Guidelines Dana Blankenhorn has been a financial and technology journalist since 1978 He is the author of Technology’s Big Bang: Yesterday Today and Tomorrow with Moore’s Law available at the Amazon Kindle store Tweet him at @danablankenhorn connect with him on Mastodon or subscribe to his Substack Artificial Intelligence Cloud Consumer Discretionary Retail Software Technology Blue-Chip Stocks Article printed from InvestorPlace Media https://investorplacecom/2024/01/apple-stock-is-a-dark-horse-bet-on-ai/ ©2024 InvestorPlace Media LLC Market Analysis Stocks to Buy Market Analysis Hot Stocks Stocks to Buy Stocks to Buy Stocks to Buy Todays Market Financial Market Data powered by FinancialContent Services Inc All rights reserved Nasdaq quotes delayed at least 15 minutes all others at least 20 minutes Copyright © 2024 InvestorPlace Media LLC All rights reserved 1125 N Charles St Baltimore MD 21201 Not Yet a Premium Subscriber?

investors dont appear to fully understand how the stock had a remarkable year disconnected from how bad the business actually performed during 2023 The tech giant went all year without growing yet the stock ended the year trading right off all-time highs My investment thesis remains ultra Bearish on Apple with the hope current shareholders use this gift to unload shares at a premium valuation Source: Finviz Apple shares were up nearly 50% for the year starting 2023 just below $130 The company failed to report a single quarter of growth during the year and the tech giant has limited prospects for excessive growth in 2024 due to missing out on the generative AI demand surge Source: Seeking Alpha The problem is that most investors think Apple rallied due to the successful ability of the tech giant to generate growing profits Too many investors just judge the company based on the performance of the stock and appear to have completely missed the lessons from the 2000 Internet bubble and the 2021 Covid bubble Stocks become detached from logical valuations all the time and alert investors to take advantage of these dislocations by selling the stock otherwise the gifts are given back Everyone should be well aware of how Zoom (ZM) surged to over $500 on Covid demand and now trades for only $72 The market convinced a lot of people Zoom was worth over $120 billion yet the 100%+ growth rates were clearly not sustainable and the company was hardly generating $4 billion in annual revenues In a similar manner Apple has seen the stock rally due to Magnificent 7 hype The big tech stocks surged during 2023 due to AI hype for NVIDIA (NVDA) and Microsoft (MSFT) and to a lesser extent Google (GOOG) At the same time Meta Platforms (META) completed a year of efficiency but investors need to step back and ask what has Apple delivered to warrant a massive rally in the stock The company has now reported 4 consecutive quarters of declining sales The forecast is for Apple to squeak out less than 1% growth in the important holiday quarter just ended followed by barely 2% sales growth in the March quarter Apple has the promising Vision Pro headset launching possibly in February soon but the company is nowhere to be found in generative AI technology The latest estimate has Apple delivering only 500000 mixed-reality units for 2024 with sales in the $175 billion range based on a $3500 cost Source: Ming-Chi Kuo medium All while Apple is running into patent issues with the Apple Watch The International Trade Commission has banned sales of the Watch due to a patent from Masimo (MASI) but the Federal Circuit court has paused the ban for now At best Apple appears set for a long-term software fix to avoid the dispute on most Watch models Apple enters 2024 trading at nearly 30x FY24 EPS targets Yet the base case is for the tech giant to grow EPS in the 7% to 8% range in the next couple of fiscal years Even under the best scenario the stock should trade at ~15x forward EPS targets or ~$99 in order for investors to generate solid total returns The odd part of this scenario is investors have other examples when investor brand loyalty trips up investing decisions Coca-Cola (KO) has been one of the most popular stocks to own in the last 50 years yet the stock massively underperformed the market in the last decade per the below chart Source: Seeking Alpha A similar theme with Apple is a stock still trading at an excessive forward PE multiple compared to the growth The market usually isnt willing to pay more than 2x the growth rate yet Coca-Cola currently trades at 21x 2024 EPS targets with a forecast for minimal 4% growth An investor can probably stretch a long-term growth target in the 6% to 7% range with 2024 subdued due to potentially deflationary pressure in the sector The key here is Coca-Cola still trading at 3x the normalized EPS growth rate and Apple falls right into that same category Investors need to realize the growth story for Apple is now all centered on Services which is constantly under pressure from regulators now The tech giant doesnt have a software solution to where enterprise customers will potentially pay double the price for new AI technology like Microsoft with CoPilot Apple Services grew 9% in FY23 to reach $85 billion and analysts are generally forecasting a rebound towards growth in the 15% range Services are still only ~22% of the business limiting the impact on overall growth Source: Six Colors After a period of weak growth for Services due to Covid pull forwards with people locked at home Apple has forecasted maintaining double-digit growth The Services sector would provide about $12 billion in additional revenues this year to reach the 15% growth rate Apple reported $383 billion in FY23 revenues so Services would contribute only 3% to total growth in FY24 despite the solid 15% growth rate Investors have long not seemed to understand that Services growth is impressive but the amount is hardly material to the overall business due to the massive $300+ billion annual revenues from the products division led by the iPhone In essence Apple has to produce revenue growth from other categories in order to really move the needle to warrant the current stock valuation The company forecasts iPhone growth in the December quarter but the Apple Watch patent issues and tough comps in iPad and Wearables including the Watch will lead to revenue challenges in these categories Our dead money research going on 2 years now correctly forecasts how Apple would run into problems growing due to issues with new product development Neither the Apple Car nor the AR/VR device has reached the market yet and the company just reported an FY with sales declining 3% Investors were also informed the stock could make an irrational run to $200 or more One cant always predict how influential analysts and other external factors will impact a stock Source: Seeking Alpha/SFC With Dan Ives from Wedbush Securities gaining in popularity and pushing $250 price target on the stock despite Apple literally reporting horrible quarterly results the stock has flown to $200 to end 2023 The stock would reach an incredible market cap of $4 trillion and the stock would trade at 35x FY25 EPS targets due to a rally based purely on multiple expansion What ultimately matters is that Apple is only forecast to earn $656 per share in FY23 and a 15x P/E multiple just gets the stock to $100 Even if one goes out to the $712 EPS targets for FY25 and applies a 20x P/E multiple Apple would only be worth $142 or ~$24 below where we predicted the stock would be dead money for 4 years The key investor takeaway is that investors need to understand the gift from the stock rally in 2023 Apple could definitely rally more in 2024 but investors need to understand the current disconnect between the stock here and the results being reported by the company At some point in the next couple of years investors are likely to face a scenario where Apple trades below $150 and the fear is the stock falling even further One of the worst scenarios in investing is giving up gains due to being greedy and the easy scenario is to lock in gains here and move on If youd like to learn more about how to best position yourself in under valued stocks mispriced by the market in 2023 consider joining Out Fox

WAMSI MOHAN: Yeah so its funny to talk about financial immateriality when you can do $700 $800 million in revenue right? Like 200000 units at 3500 to 4000 thats the kind of number were looking at And yes in the context of a $400 billion revenue company its not a big number but in isolation it really is When you think about the size of the VR market right its about eight million units a year its about $4 and 1/2 billion So Apples already making a dent in its own category right in year one We think over time this is going to be a real game changer The way we think about it is really anyone who has a Mac is potentially someone who could own the Vision Pro at $1500 to $2000 price point We think we get to that price point in a couple of years Its not immediate It takes a little time It gives time for development of apps for a lot of the app ecosystem around Vision Pro to get a lot more better But the place where we see the most opportunity is if we can build out an install base of several tens of millions of the Vision Pro You can get very unique experiences of content whether it be a concert very immersive experience of that or sports which other people have tried and failed but we would give Apple the benefit of the doubt in doing something like that and then being able to monetize It you can pay $20 $30 $40 I was in Vegas for the CES show and I looked up how much U2 tickets were going for the Sphere $750 at the Sphere in Las Vegas So $20 $30 $40 for an immersive experience I think absolutely consumers would pay that When you layer that on a tens of millions install base its a huge opportunity for Apple Related Quotes"

war","1/21/2024","https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/jan/21/british-inventor-seeks-to-take-18bn-bite-out-of-apple-in-bitter-patent-war","Patrick Racz is in a long-running patent fight with the tech company over claims it stole his filesharing and payment system for iTunes As a plumbing tycoon Patrick Racz was used to enduring a deluge But circumstances led to a very different kind of drenching sitting in his local park in the rain contemplating the demise of his business during the dotcom crash “I lost everything I had young children I was embarrassed upset that I’d let my family down I couldn’t look them in the face” he recalls His nadir came just before the emergence of a patent battle with Apple that would define his life Nearly two decades on he remains at loggerheads with the company and the US courts He presents an intriguing figure: a credible established British inventor who first gained wealth and success in the 1980s but clearly bruised and angry after years of a David v Goliath dogfight that now dominates his online reputation and leaves onlookers questioning whether Racz or Apple is in the right Racz was the man behind the Triflow – the world’s first three-way mixer tap The system took a typical sink mixer and added a extra waterway and valve to supply filtered water alongside hot and cold A “multimillion-pound” sale in 1998 locked in his gains after expanding the business to sell in 45 countries However he says his second chapter turned sour as his dotcom-era venture – a filesharing and payment tech company – was usurped by Apple’s iTunes store He claims the US corporation stole his system “I went through a period of deep depression” Racz says opening up on the emotional toll for the first time “I’m ashamed to say I hit the bottle I was totally lost in a haze of time and I couldn’t remember a lot” What gave him a “new lease of life” was patents for the tech that were first lodged in 1999 and granted nearly a decade later teeing up a huge court battle that is still playing out as he targets $18bn in damages Apple is no stranger to fighting such patent disputes: a standoff with medical technology company Masimo led to sales of Apple’s Series 9 and Ultra 2 smartwatches being paused in the US before Christmas Racz has won some of his rounds in court against the company but there is no guarantee of ultimate victory for either side The only certainty is that the road ahead will be long winding and costly Racz grew up on a strawberry farm in Jersey and spent his early career in sales When he sold his tap business Avilion he pursued the digital download market just as Napster upended the music industry with illegal filesharing Racz quickly filed for patents for his anti-piracy alternative Smartflash and accompanying systems to allow payments and secure downloads He lined up deals with retailers and manufacturers including Gemplus a French sim card company Pop star Britney Spears signed up as a brand ambassador But in the fallout from 9/11 and the dotcom crash Spears and Gemplus pulled out and Racz says in court that Gemplus – also a partner to Apple – then claimed the product as its own His blood boiled as he saw late Apple boss Steve Jobs “soak up the praise” for a series of products marrying hardware and software in the way Racz claims he first devised starting with iTunes in 2003 After receiving patent approval in 2008 he scored an unlikely victory – landing $533m in damages in 2015 after suing Apple in Texas It was one of the biggest jury awards to a private inventor Racz says But the court’s decision was later unwound: first hurt by a ruling by the US Patent Trial and Appeal Board that his patents were invalid and then losing as Apple appealed in the commercial courts He has since lost his own appeals but has vowed to fight on He has faced a sizeable backlash online among Apple supporters in recent years which even included death threats emailed by unknown individuals “Those things start to sting – when you’re told that your kids should be burned at the stake and that you should be beheaded for what you’re doing My kid was being bullied – with kids saying: ‘Your dad say he invented this he didn’t he stole it Apple invented it Your dad’s a liar’” Racz says over coffee in London Tall burly and with a short crop of dark hair he is visibly still riled as he retells his story Racz’s latest tussle is with the US Patent Office which he is suing for refusal to disclose uncensored emails and documents related to his intellectual property He is attempting to prove that panels of judges were intentionally stacked with ex-lawyers and close supporters of Apple Racz argues the company has used its “wealth and power” to influence the US patent system Approached for comment Apple pointed to a previous statement issued in 2015 which said: “Smartflash makes no products has no employees creates no jobs has no US presence and is exploiting our patent system to seek royalties for technology Apple invented “We refused to pay off this company for the ideas our employees spent years innovating and unfortunately we have been left with no choice but to take this fight up through the court system” Gemplus did not respond to a request for comment Away from his legal pursuits he is a backer of Regent Sounds a musical instrument shop in central London’s Denmark Street once used by the Rolling Stones as a studio and which engaged in its own tussle with the landlord behind the huge development by media venture Outernet His main mission remains telling his story He’s written Smartflash an autobiography and says he has interest from publishers His friend Simon Morris the ex-global chief creative officer at Amazon and the man behind Amazon Prime Video has signed up to sell the rights to a documentary about Racz’s life and is pitching the project to studios Meanwhile Racz remains focused on his legal campaign which is backed by private investors who would share in any winnings “They say what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger – it’s made me even more determined”"

Mint","1/24/2024","https://www.livemint.com/technology/apple-plans-new-fees-and-restrictions-for-downloads-outside-app-store-11706094496440.html","Apple is planning to add new fees and restrictions when it begins allowing third-party software downloads outside its App Store in response to a new European law intended to tear down its closed iPhone app ecosystem The company’s plan which would only apply in Europe will allow users to download software onto the iPhone for the first time without using the App Store The new policies set up a test of the legislation and how it will be enforced as Apple faces challenges from courts regulators and software makers globally about its tight control of third-party software Meta Platforms Spotify and other companies are preparing new download options for customers in anticipation of the new rules Meta is considering a system that would allow people to download apps directly from Facebook ads Spotify plans to offer users the ability to download some of its iPhone apps directly from its website according to the company Microsoft has weighed a launch of its own third-party app store for games in the past Apple has defended its policy of controlling downloads via the App Store saying it is necessary for keeping the iPhone safe and relatively free from viruses Critics have called Apple’s system anticompetitive saying it collects unnecessarily high commissions and unfairly competes with Apple’s own apps Apple’s approach to the EU law will help ensure the company maintains close oversight of apps downloaded outside the App Store a process known as sideloading The company will give itself the ability to review each app downloaded outside of its App Store Apple also plans to collect fees from developers that offer downloads outside of the App Store said people familiar with the company’s plans The company hasn’t yet announced its plans and they could change The restrictions and fees could renew tensions with app developers some of whom had expected the new law to allow them to deliver their apps to users free of Apple’s restrictions or what they see as a high commission The new European law “is a regulation with teeth with the possibility to apply fines and with a possibility for the commission to have powers of investigation said Olivia Regnier a senior director of European policy at Spotify Earlier this month developers including Spotify and Fortnite-maker Epic Games criticized new policies Apple unveiled to allow third-party payment systems in keeping with a US federal court ruling Apple’s response to the new EU rules marks another potential battleground in the company’s intercontinental war to maintain control over third-party software and the outsize profits that come with it Apple’s operating margin on the App Store is between 70% and 80% estimated Martin Yang an analyst at investment firm Oppenheimer Apple has been working on its solution for more than a year now to meet the March deadline for complying with the EU law the people said In 2022 the European Union passed the Digital Markets Act with the intention of reining in the alleged anticompetitive practices of technology companies One of the issues the law sought to address was Apple’s strict control over how software is downloaded onto iPhones through its App Store The DMA also applies to Google and its Android mobile operating system will have to comply with several of its provisions Unlike Apple’s iOS devices however Android phones allow users to install apps outside the Google Play store likely making them already compliant with that element of the law Officials from the European Commission the EU’s executive body have been holding meetings in recent months with Apple and other tech companies to discuss the new rules Apple hasn’t provided a final package describing its solution to the commission or tested its plans with market participants Once it does the commission will review the full package to look at whether it will make the market more open and contestable and whether the company’s plans meet all the individual provisions of the law according to a person familiar with its plans The legislation has some requirements that are clear-cut and other rules that leave room for interpretation antitrust lawyers said One provision in the law says app stores that are covered by the act are expected to have conditions that are fair reasonable and nondiscriminatory Last week Apple was obligated to follow through with a court order related to Fortnite-maker Epic Games’s antitrust case against the company The order requires the company to let developers direct their app users to payment systems other than Apple’s Apple has said it plans to give developers an option to offer an alternative payment system to users and will charge a 27% commission on such payments Apple typically places a 30% commission on developers for payments for many services made through Apple’s payment system That 27% commission would likely dissuade most developers from offering alternate payments app makers said During a Bay Area trip earlier this month Europe’s top antitrust official Margrethe Vestager met with Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook at the company’s headquarters where the two spoke about Apple’s compliance with the requirement to allow the distribution of apps outside of the App Store Speaking to reporters in San Francisco Vestager said she expects all companies will comply with the March deadline but Europe “also stands absolutely ready to do noncompliance cases Tech players like Meta and Microsoft have been hoping to take advantage of any opening Apple will make in Europe Microsoft has previously tried to launch a cloud-based game subscription service but was shut down because Apple wouldn’t support the offering of multiple games through a single app Microsoft said in 2020 Meta has a yearslong effort called Project Neon that would allow smartphone users to download apps they find through ads on Facebook directly from the social media app according to people familiar with the matter Meta in 2020 also tried to launch an iOS app that would allow users to play various games but Apple rejected the submission until Meta stripped the app of any gameplay functionality “We’ve always been interested in helping developers distribute their apps and new options would add more competition in this space a Meta spokesman said in a statement “Developers deserve more ways to easily get their apps to the people that want them On Wednesday streaming company Spotify announced its plans in Europe to start communicating directly with app users about subscription offerings and deals to make it possible for users to purchase audiobooks directly and to allow downloads

Weve got good news and bad news for you According to a new report by The Information (via 9to5Mac) Apple is actively developing several foldable devices and has at least two prototypes of clamshell folding models The bad news: The foldable iPhone appears to be in early development and it may not launch very soon Worse news: Apple still seems to be hitting all the old roadblocks that cause the company to halt the foldable phone development back in 2020 According to the report Apple wanted this phone to be really thin when unfolded about half the thickness of the current phone models and the company also looked into adding an outward-facing display But it appears the companys designers and engineers were unable to achieve these goals Theyre also working on a way for the phones display to be fully flat when unfolded but theres no word on whether theyve achieved this either All of this means that the foldable iPhone likely isnt coming this year or the next Maybe 2026 is the year? Apple is also reportedly working on a larger device a foldable iPad if you will The report says that this device would have an 8-inch inward folding display; so youd get something thats as large as an iPad mini when folded and close to the larger iPad Pro when unfolded Such a device might actually be closer to production than the iPhone as Apples standards regarding thickness may not be as strict when it comes to a larger tablet-like device Topics Apple Stan is a Senior Editor at Mashable where he has worked since 2007 Hes got more battery-powered gadgets and band t-shirts than you He writes about the next groundbreaking thing Typically this is a phone a coin or a car His ultimate goal is to know something about everything"

this Sept 28 2021 file photo people try out iPhone products at an Apple Store in Beijing The Supreme Court on Tuesday Jan 16 2024 allowed a court order to take effect that could loosen Apple’s grip on its lucrative iPhone app store potentially siphoning billions of dollars away from one of the world’s most profitable companies (AP Photo/Andy Wong file) The US Supreme Court is bathed in afternoon sun Thursday Jan 11 2024 in Washington (AP Photo/Mariam Zuhaib) WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court on Tuesday allowed a court order to take effect that could loosen Apple’s grip on its lucrative iPhone app store threatening to siphon billions of dollars away from one of the world’s most profitable companies The justices rejected Apple’s appeal of lower-court rulings that found some of Apple’s app store rules for apps purchased on more than 1 billion iPhones constitute unfair competition under California law Apple outlined in court documents filed late Tuesday how it plans to change in-app payments while indicating it will preserve most of the fees it collects from developers who make money from their services provided on iPhones and iPads The proposal provoked claims that Apple is acting in bad faith and set the stage for more legal sparring The rejected appeal to the Supreme Court stemmed from an antitrust lawsuit filed in 2020 by Epic Games maker of the popular Fortnite video game Epic lost its broader claim that Cupertino California-based Apple was violating federal antitrust law and the justices also rejected Epic’s appeal Tuesday But in turning away Apple’s effort to maintain exclusive control over in-app payments the court lifted a hold on an order to allow app developers throughout the US to insert links to other payment options besides its own within iPhone apps That change would make it easier for developers to avoid paying Apple’s commissions ranging from 15% to 30% In its Tuesday court filing Apple said it will now allow app developers to provide payment links to external websites but would still seek to collect commissions ranging from 12% to 27% from them to prevent “free-riding” on the software system that powers its iPhones and iPads Apple also plans to impose a potentially cumbersome approval process before the external links or buttons can be placed within iPhone and iPad apps in an effort “to minimize fraud scams and confusion” The protections also will include a so-called “scare screen” warning to consumers who click on a link for an alternate payment system saying that Apple is “not responsible for the privacy or security of purchases made on the web” In a series of social media posts Epic CEO Tim Sweeney attacked Apple’s plan with as “bad-faith compliance” and maintained the revised commissions remain anti-competitive He vowed to oppose Apple’s proposal in federal court Apple has strong incentive to maintain as much of its commissions on in-app transaction as possible Those fees have turned into a significant part of Apple’s service’s division which generated $85 billion in revenue during the company’s last fiscal year ending in September The specter of consumers being able to defect to other payment channels for in-app transactions is one of several factors that has been weighing on Apple’s stock which has declined 5% so far this year The drop has enabled Apple’s long-time rival Microsoft to eclipse it as the world’s most valuable company Apple’s shares dipped 1% Tuesday leaving the company with a market value of slightly more than $28 trillion Microsoft whose stock has edged up 4% so far this year is valued at $29 trillion Besides the possibility of the Supreme Court refusing to consider the payment issue in the Epic case investors also have been fretting about new European regulations scheduled to take effect in March that also could force Apple to allow alternate payment methods inside iPhone apps Epic based in Cary North Carolina had claimed that Apple’s app store — which was launched in 2008 a year after the first iPhone went on sale — had turned into an illegal monopoly that stifles innovation and competition while generating billions of dollars in profit for Apple Although a federal judge rejected the assertion that Apple had a monopoly on mobile apps she concluded consumers should have more discretion in how to pay inside apps Back in August 2020 Epic tried to offer an alternative way to get its mobile app attempting to evade Apple’s commissions charged when digital goods were purchased by players on Fortnite and other games Apple ousted Epic from its app store after it tried to get around Apple’s restrictions Although it lost most of its claims in the Apple case Epic last month won a jury trial against Google and its Play Store for apps on Android phones in a lawsuit mirroring its action against Apple A federal judge still must determine what changes Google will have to make to its Play Store Liedtke reported from San Ramon California Copyright 2024 The

GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with NVDA As of 2024-01-01 Apple Incs intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $16257 Its currently trading at a price of $19249 Therefore the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -184% The company is fair valued The GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage In the growth stage the company is experiencing faster growth while in the terminal stage a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run Apple Incs intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps Term Value Explanation EPS without NRI $612 GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow Discount Rate 10% An appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 387% rounded up to the nearest whole number which is 4% A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate Growth Stage Growth rate (g1) = 1620% Years of Growth Stage = 10 We choose the growth rate based on the availability prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10 5 or 3 years in that order and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate The default growth period is set to 10 years Terminal Stage Growth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10 For the terminal stage the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation Growth Stage = EPS without NRI * [ (1 + g1) / (1 + d) * (1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2 + + (1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ] = 8377 Terminal Stage = EPS without NRI * (1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 * [ (1 + g2) / (1 + d) + (1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2 + + (1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ] = 788 Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based) = Growth Stage + Terminal Stage = 16257 GuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $14488 This valuation indicates that the Apple Inc is modestly overvalued accompanied by a margin of safety of -3286% You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page Please note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model: Future Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings Embracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role All else being equal a company with rapid growth will have a higher value Predictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance For companies with unpredictable performance such as cyclical companies the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized Discount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate Using the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based) To identify undervalued predictable companies focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based) This article generated by GuruFocus is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice Our commentary is rooted in historical data and analyst projections utilizing an impartial methodology and is not intended to serve as specific investment guidance It does not formulate a recommendation to purchase or divest any stock and does not consider individual investment objectives or financial circumstances Our objective is to deliver long-term fundamental data-driven analysis Be aware that our analysis might not incorporate the most recent price-sensitive company announcements or qualitative information GuruFocus holds no position in the stocks mentioned herein This article first appeared on GuruFocus Related Quotes"

While uses will evolve Apple is focusing attention on watching TV and movies editing and reliving “memories” and – perhaps most importantly for the product’s success – having its customers not look like total weirdos Apple hopes the new device will redefine personal computing like the iPhone did 16 years ago and Macintosh did 40 years ago But if it succeeds it will also redefine concerns about privacy as it captures enormous amounts of data about users and their environments creating an unprecedented kind of “biospatial surveillance” Apple is careful about its brand and how it packages and describes its products In an extensive set of rules for developers the company insists the new headset is not to be referred to as a “headset” What’s more the Apple Vision Pro does not do “augmented reality (AR) virtual reality (VR) extended reality (XR) or mixed reality (MR)” – it is a gateway to “spatial computing” Spatial computing as sketched out in the 2003 PhD thesis of US software engineer Simon Greenwold is: “human interaction with a machine in which the machine retains and manipulates referents to real objects and spaces” In other words the computer can interact with things in the user’s physical surroundings in real time to provide new types of experiences The Vision Pro has big shoes to fill for new user experiences The iPhone’s initial “killer apps” were clear: the internet in your pocket (including portable access to Google Maps) all your music on a touch screen and “visual voicemail” Sixteen years later all three of these seem unremarkable Apple has sold billions of iPhones and some 80% of humans now use a smartphone Their success has all but killed off earlier tools like paper maps and music CDs (and the ubiquity of text image and video messaging has largely done away with voicemail itself) We don’t yet know what the killer apps of spatial computing might be – if any – but here is where Apple is pointing our attention The first is entertainment: the Vision Pro promises “the ultimate personal theatre” The second is an attempt to solve the social problem of walking around with a weird headset covering half your face An external screen on the goggles shows a constantly updated representation of your eyes to offer important social cues about your gaze to those around you Admittedly this looks weird But Apple hopes it is less weird and more useful than trying to interact with humans wearing blank aluminium ski goggles The third is the ability to capture and and relive “memories”: recording and playback of 3D visual and audio from real events Reviewers have found it striking: this was stuff from my own life my own memories I was playing back experiences I had already lived Apple has patented tools to select store and annotate digital “memories” These memories are files and potentially products to be shared in “spatial videos” recorded on the latest iPhones There is already a large infrastructure devoted to helping tech companies track our behaviour in order to sell us things Recent research found Facebook for example receives data from an average of around 2300 companies on each individual user Read more: Explainer: what is surveillance capitalism and how does it shape our economy? Spatial computing offers a step change to this tracking In order to function spatial computing records and uses vast amounts of intimate data about our bodies and surroundings One study on headset design noted no fewer than 64 different streams of biometric and physiological data from eye tracking and pupil response to subtle changes in the body’s electromagnetic field This is not “consumer” data like the brand of toothpaste you buy It is more akin to medical data For instance analysing a person’s unconscious movements can reveal their emotional state or even predict neurodegenerative disease This is called “biometrically inferred data” as users are unaware their bodies are giving it up Apple suggests it won’t share this type of data with anyone and Apple has proven better than most companies on privacy But biospatial surveillance puts more of ourselves in use for spatial computing in ways that are expanding It starts simply enough in the pre-order process where you need to scan your facial features with your iPhone (to ensure a snug fit) But that’s not the end of it Apple’s patent about memories is also about how to “guide and direct a user with attention memory and cognition” through feedback loops that monitor “facial recognition eye tracking user mood detection user emotion detection voice detection etc [from a] bio-sensor for tracking biometric characteristics such as health and activity metrics […] and other health-related information” Biospatial surveillance is also the key to Apple’s attempt to solve the social problems created by wearing a headset in public The external screen showing a simulated approximation of the user’s gaze relies on constant measurement of the user’s expression and eye movement with multiple sensors Your face is constantly mapped so others can see it – or rather see Apple’s vision of it Likewise as passersby come into range of the Apple Vision Pro’s sensors Apple’s vision of them is automagically rendered into your experience whether they like it or not Apple’s new vision of us – and those that surround us – shows how the requirements and benefits of spatial computing will pose new privacy concerns and social questions The extensive biospatial surveillance that captures intimate biometric and environmental data redefines what personal data and social interactions are possible for exploitation Copyright © 2010–2024 The Conversation"

FactSet has quarterly data going back to 1998 and in that span Apple has never logged five quarters in a row of year-over-year revenue declines Wall Street will be most focused on the health of the iPhone business when Apple’s management holds its earnings call — and the Street is particularly interested in iPhone trends in China “While concerns around iPhone sales in China have been around since Huawei resurgence our recent supply chain checks don’t show near-term production cuts for [the December and March] and quarters” Citi Research analyst Atif Malik wrote recently He noted that while Apple’s market share slipped in China during the calendar fourth quarter based on third-party estimates the company ended up the top smartphone vendor in the country for the year Still he acknowledged that the “patriotism sentiment” that is helping brands like China’s Technologies Co “could be a near-term headwind for iPhone sales in China” UBS’s David Vogt saw upside potential for overall Apple revenue in the December quarter “driven by [a 2 million to 3 million] inventory build of iPhone units in China” He said that better iPhone performance in the December quarter would come as “a modest relief” but noted that the channel buildup in China “creates risk” for the March quarter Evercore ISI’s Amit Daryanani chimed in that Apple had the potential to deliver “modest upside” to overall results for the December quarter and with its March-quarter forecast especially in light of pressure on the stock so far this year Apple’s stock has lost about 3% in the year to date while the S&P 500 is up by the same amount “China risk [is] in focus but we think emerging-market share gains and developed-market [average-selling-rice] uplift should help [the] iPhone stay stable in December and potentially March” he said While iPhones will be the main focal point on the call investors will also likely want to hear a bit about Apple’s newest device the $3499 Vision Pro mixed-reality headset Whether they get much information there however is another story See more: Apple’s Vision Pro headset is selling out — but what does that really mean? Preorders for the Vision Pro kicked off earlier this month so the device wasn’t a factor in the just-completed quarter And Apple doesn’t tend to give numerical specifics on some of its “newer” hardware like the Apple Watch and AirPods More than eight years out from its launch the Apple Watch still doesn’t get its own line item on Apple’s financials so Wall Street probably shouldn’t get too excited about the prospect of useful Vision Pro nuggets Shares ended the day around $50 well above the IPO price of $34 Emily Bary is a MarketWatch news editor based in New York Emily Bary is a MarketWatch news editor based in New York Visit a quote page and your recently viewed tickers will be displayed here"

Let’s look at its financial metrics to know more… Jan 3 2024 Apple Inc (AAPL) made history in mid-2023 by being the first tech company to reach a $3 trillion market value while the tech sector garnered significant investor attention due to the hype surrounding Artificial Intelligence (AI) However for the fiscal fourth quarter (ended September 30 2023) the company’s total net sales declined marginally year-over-year to $8950 billion due to weaknesses in the Mac and wearables segment Moreover the iPhone maker forecasted weakness for its holiday quarter About this forecast the brokerage Bernstein said “Apple’s revenue growth has stalled over the past few quarters – and appears likely to continue to stagnate over the next year” On top of it Barclays downgraded AAPL on the backs of weak iPhone sales in China Analyst Tim Long believes that this softness in sales will persist even after the company launches the iPhone 16 this year as the model is unlikely to have any drastic updates compared to the latest model in circulation This paints an uncertain picture of this big tech company’s outlook Therefore investors could wait and monitor AAPL for an opportune moment to invest in its stock Let’s look at the trends of its key financial metrics to gain further insight Tracking Apple Inc’s Financial Performance: Analyzing Key Metrics and Growth Over Two Years (2021-2023) The trailing-12-month net income of AAPL has shown a fluctuating trend over the last two years from March 27 2021 to September 30 2023 with general overall growth seen From these figures the growth rate from the initial to the final value shows a significant 2709% increase in AAPL’s reported net income over these years 3 STOCKS TO DOUBLE THIS YEAR The emphasis on more recent data reflects that even though there were some declines in the second half of 2022 and the start of 2023 the upward tick in the third quarter indicates potential resilience and recovery in AAPL’s profitability with the final noted net income of $9699 billion This is a crucial trend to consider for future projections and appraisal of AAPL’s financial performance The trailing-12-month revenue trends and fluctuations of AAPL from March 2021 to September 2023 are as outlined: Annual Revenue Trend: From this data the annual growth from March 2021 to September 2022 was approximately 212% Recent Fluctuations: The most recent data shows that as of September 2023 AAPL’s revenue stands at $3833 billion reflecting a downward trend from its peak in 2022 Overall between the first value in March 2021 and the latest in September 2023 there has been growth of approximately 178% The data series provided offers a view into the gross margin trends of AAPL Beginning on March 27 2021 decoding the data series unveils: The gross margin demonstrated an overall upward trend from the beginning of the series in March 2021 to the end in September 2023 The growth rate calculated by measuring the last value from the first value suggests a positive growth of approximately 410% However there were periods of relative stability such as roughly half of 2022 when the gross margin plateaued at around 4330% It’s also worth noting a slight dip at the end of 2022 before it continued on its upward trajectory throughout 2023 This data underlines that although fluctuations (and some steady periods) were present within each fiscal quarter the overall gross margin for AAPL increased over the specified timeline reflecting positively on its economic performance The current ratio of AAPL exhibited a decreasing trend for the period from March 27 2021 to June 25 2022 It decreased from 114 in March 2021 to 087 in June 2022 However from that point on the numerical trend indicated a slight rebound demonstrating minor fluctuations but ultimately climbing to 099 by September 30 2023 Here are a few highlighted data points: The overall growth rate measured by comparing the current ratio from March 27 2021 (114) to the most recent observation on September 30 2023 (099) indicates a decrease of around 13% Analyzing Apple Inc’s Share Price Fluctuations: July 2023 – January 2024 The trend and growth rate of AAPL share prices from July 2023 to January 2024 is characterized by variability and some degree of volatility To summarize AAPL’s stock exhibited initial stability followed by a decline a period of volatility and then a robust increase towards December 2023 This was however followed by another price reduction at the start of the subsequent year Despite these fluctuations the overall

There are capital gains taxes to think about Generally speaking any time you earn money the IRS gets a piece of it So if you sell stock at a profit you create a tax liability for yourself Thankfully Ive held my Apple shares for more than a year and a day This puts them in the long-term capital gains tax category which has a top tax rate of 20% (your rate will depend on your income) Short-term capital gains taxes -- those that apply to assets held for a year or less -- are comparable to taxes on ordinary income and top out at 37% So the potential to owe money there is a lot higher But either way once I unload some Apple shares I need to think about what I owe the IRS And thats not fun Owning stocks that gain value over time is a great thing But its important to keep tabs on your portfolio when the assets you own do increase in value because that has the potential to throw your portfolio out of whack You may also want to set a benchmark like I do that tells you when to sell a stock As mentioned Im not comfortable having any single stock comprise more than 5% of my portfolio You may be comfortable going higher and thats fine But its a good idea to establish a system so you know when its the right time to sell This credit card is not just good – it’s so exceptional that our experts use it personally It features a lengthy 0% intro APR period a cash back rate of up to 5% and all somehow for no annual fee!Click here to read our full review for free and apply in just 2 minutes Maurie Backman is a personal finance writer covering topics ranging from Social Security to credit cards to mortgages She also has an editing background and has hosted personal finance podcasts Share this page Were firm believers in the Golden Rule which is why editorial opinions are ours alone and have not been previously reviewed approved or endorsed by included advertisers The Ascent does not cover all offers on the market Editorial content from The Ascent is separate from The Motley Fool editorial content and is created by a different analyst team Related Articles By: Ben Gran Published on Jan 26 2024 By: Steven Porrello Published on Feb 28 2024 By: Ben Gran Published on Feb 27 2024 By: Maurie Backman Published on Feb 27 2024 By: Chris Neiger Published on March 2 2024 The Ascent is a Motley Fool service that rates and reviews essential products for your everyday money matters Copyright © 2018 - 2024 The Ascent All rights reserved"

31 2023 There werent too many sizable moves but one noticeable one was that Berkshire sold around 10 million shares of Apple (AAPL -409%) trimming the position by a little over 1% Lets discuss Berkshires stake in Apple what Berkshires moves could indicate about its thoughts on the market and what you should do if you own or want to buy the tech stock Image source: Getty Images Berkshire began acquiring Apple stock in 2016 By the end of 2018 Berkshire had racked up just shy of 1 billion shares As of the end of 2023 Berkshire held 9056 million shares Apple has become Berkshires largest holding because the buying spree between 2016 and 2018 proved to be a genius move Apple stock is up 3666% between the end of 2018 and Feb 14 Berkshire sold 935 million shares in 2020 But aside from that the position has remained relatively unchanged Even after the fourth-quarter 2023 sale Apple remains 455% of Berkshires public equity portfolio with Berkshire owning 59% of the company I have two key takeaways from Berkshires decision to keep its Apple position mostly unchanged between 2021 and 2023 The first is that Berkshire doesnt have better ideas than Apple If it did it could divert its enormous profits from Apple stock elsewhere Effectively Berkshire doesnt have a good enough alternative idea to justify selling Apple stock and suffering the associated tax consequences The second takeaway is that Berkshire views Apple as a good value not necessarily as a growth stock Berkshire CEO Warren Buffett is a value investor at heart and Berkshires overall portfolio is incredibly value-oriented The top five holdings in its public equity portfolio are Apple Bank of America American Express Coca-Cola and Chevron Outside of its public equity portfolio the most valuable assets Berkshire owns are its property and casualty insurance business its 100% ownership of BNSF railroad its 92% ownership of Berkshire Hathaway Energy and several stakes or partial stakes in other companies Berkshire isnt the kind of company to go out and ride the hot trend like artificial intelligence (AI) today or the metaverse a few years ago Its also not the kind of company to change its investment strategy In its 2023 annual shareholder meeting from last May Warren Buffett praised Apple saying the following: Our criteria for Apple isnt different than the other businesses we own it just happens to be a better business than any we own and we put a fair amount of money in it but we havent got more money in it than weve got in the railroad Our railroad is a very good business but its not remotely as good as Apples business In other words Apple doesnt get preferential treatment over other companies it just continues to check all of the boxes A couple of minutes later in the meeting Buffett said: I made a mistake a couple years ago and I sold some shares What hes referring to are the 935 million shares sold in the second half of 2020 that we discussed earlier Buffett defended it by saying some tax-related factors made the move advisable but he still seemed to regret it So if Buffett said that selling Apple was a mistake you may wonder why Berkshire sold a little over 10 million shares in Q4 2023 Since it is a relatively small amount my guess is that this may have been tax-related We will hear more about Buffetts opinions on Apple during Berkshires 2024 annual meeting on May 4 If I had to guess the investment thesis on Apple hasnt changed Berkshire is a big believer in the power of stock buybacks but only if the business is good This is why Berkshire famously doesnt pay a dividend preferring instead to repurchase its own stock Dividends are double taxed because they are paid with income that is taxed to the company and then taxed again when distributed to shareholders Buybacks can be a better use of capital because they avoid this double taxing problem They also reduce the outstanding share count of a company which boosts earnings per share (EPS) and makes each existing share own a higher percentage of the company Over the last 10 years Berkshire has reduced its outstanding share count by 122% whereas Apple has reduced its share count by 36% Buybacks continue to be the main driver of Apples capital return program In its recent quarter Apple spent $201 billion on buybacks and $38 billion on dividends Its no secret that Apples top- and bottom-line growth has slowed The stock is also down 45% year to date compared to a 55% gain in the S&P 500 Buybacks help boost EPS when organic growth is slow Buffett and his team dont seem too concerned about Apples current slowdown or its valuation After all there are aspects of the business that are thriving -- namely the high-margin services segment which just set a record for operating income and revenue Berkshires decision to leave its Apple position mostly unchanged makes sense The company isnt exhibiting the growth to make it a screaming buy Unlike other big tech stocks Apple has yet to make a meaningful splash with AI namely because it doesnt have the business-to-business AI potential of a company like Nvidia or Microsoft Apple is a well-run business that is missing out on the market rally for a good reason There doesnt seem to be any real reason to pile into Apple stock now However if the broader market continues to become more expensive (and Apple languishes) it will begin to look like a better value Apple is a stock worth putting on the top of a watchlist or buying a starter position in if you dont own any The stock is out of favor on Wall Street right now compared to other big tech plays but that could change quickly if fundamentals improve or the valuation comes down Bank of America is an advertising partner of The Ascent a Motley Fool company

on Wednesday released a free new iPhone app for tracking sports scores its latest effort to become a major provider of sports content and news The app called Apple Sports does one thing well: show sports scores from all the major teams and leagues Users in the US Canada and the UK can download it Wednesday the first day of the Major League Soccer season Apple services chief Eddy Cue said the company designed the app to be fast and simple for multiple quick checks per day It will stand out from other sports scores apps because Apple doesnt represent a team or league and isnt incentivized to engage users for long sessions he said You want your scores basically to be real time You want them to be really easy to get to And nothing else is getting in the way And thats the primary purpose of the app said Cue hoarse from cheering at the Super Bowl in an interview last week Apple has moved into sports in recent years by buying rights and airing Major League Baseball and Major League Soccer games adding additional sports journalism to its News app and airing sports-related documentaries about teams such as the Golden State Warriors and the New England Patriots on Apple TV+ Apple also bid for rights to National Football League games last year before losing out to YouTube CNBC reported and is expected to be a player in upcoming rights negotiations for the National Basketball Association Apple like Google and Amazon sees major live sports events as a potential anchor for its streaming services This new app which wont come pre-installed on iPhones is tightly integrated with Apples other Services apps such as the TV app and News app For example it will take the users existing preferences for favorite teams sports and leagues from those apps so when the Sports app is first opened many will already see scores from their favorite teams Notifications and live activities are also handled by the Apple News and Apple TV apps including existing features such as notifications for game start times or an alert for a close game the user is interested in Most game pages will include sport-specific information such as who scored goals which players are on the court or whos on first base Pages will also include live betting odds but users can turn them off in settings The game pages will also often include an Apple TV button That means the user can tap the button to view a livestream of the game It works for sports Apple carries as well as games on streaming services that are connected to the Apple TV app many of which still require a cable subscription but will increasingly be available from over-the-top streamers In an ideal world when Im looking at the Duke game it says open the TV app Id like it to get me to the game of basketball Cue said And thats what we try to do Notably there isnt a special version for Apples new Vision Pro headset which is the best Apple product for watching sports on a big virtual display Cue has spoken about Apples desire to fix sports distribution since before Apple had a streaming service He critiqued cable channel guides in a 2016 interview with The Hollywood Reporter and how it was tough to find the Duke game In 2019 Apple gave Sports Illustrated a look into a war room the company built to monitor games and send notifications Cue said Apple does a fair amount of behind the scenes to work with app developers and streaming providers to get their services working seamlessly with Apples services for example Apples goal is to make it simple and clean to find sports information and eventually seamlessly cue up the game with a few taps As a huge sports fan theres never been a better time theres never been a worse time Cue said The best time is that pretty much everything in the world is televised in some fashion But its never been worse Because of the amount of services the rights the blackouts the restrictions Apple will also have features that will allow users to follow college basketballs March Madness tournament in the app Cue said Heres a list of leagues Apple says it will support: Dont miss these stories from CNBC PRO: Got a confidential news tip?

partners who compensate us This may influence which products we write about and where and how the product appears on a page However this does not influence our evaluations Our opinions are our own Here is a list of our partners and heres how we make money 45 For Apple users Apple Pay Later may be an especially convenient way to delay full payment on a purchase without incurring interest or fees Apple is the newest entrant into the “buy now pay later” space Its classic pay-in-four plan known as Apple Pay Later is similar to other BNPL plans but promises no interest or fees making it a particularly affordable credit option for borrowers You can use Apple Pay Later to make online and in-app purchases up to $1000 and eligible users can apply in the Apple Wallet mobile app » COMPARE: The best buy now pay later apps Loan amount $75-$1000 Payment structure Pay-in-four plan Interest 0% Availability Available online and in-app Conducts soft credit check Yes Minimum credit score None Late fee No late fee Other fees No other fees Option to reschedule a payment No Pauses account when payment is missed Yes Apple Pay Later divides your purchase into four equal installments with the first installment due at checkout and the remaining three installments due every two weeks until the loan is paid off For example if you use Apple Pay Later to make a $400 purchase you’ll pay $100 at checkout You’ll then have three remaining installments — each $100 — spread out over six weeks The first payment is taken from the debit card you use to check out Future payments are managed in the Apple Wallet mobile app where you can change your payment method make payments early make extra payments or pay off the loan entirely You can also view the total amount due for Pay Later loans in the next 30 days Apple Pay Later is available for online and in-app purchases but the merchant must accept Apple Pay » MORE: Apple announces BNPL feature Apple Pay Later Whether you should use Apple Pay Later depends on your financial situation Weigh the pros and cons below to decide whether it’s the right fit for you No interest or fees: Apple Pay Later charges zero interest or fees which makes this a particularly affordable way to access credit especially compared with other financing options like a credit card where you can accrue interest and fees each month depending on your repayment behavior Convenient application and approval: If you already have an iPhone or iPad with access to Apple Pay Later you can apply for a Pay Later loan directly from your device with no hit to your credit score For Apple users this may be a more convenient option than setting up an account with a different BNPL provider Consumer-friendly features: Apple Pay Later has several built-in features that help protect users For example if you miss a payment Apple won’t approve you for additional Pay Later loans until you’ve caught up which can help you avoid overextending yourself You also can only check out with a debit card Many BNPL providers let you tie your account to a credit card which means you’re paying for credit with credit Autopay flexibility: You aren’t required to opt in to autopay to check out with Apple Pay Later Though autopay can be a convenient way to make payments it can also lead you to overdraft your bank account if you don’t have enough money on your debit card to cover an installment If you do check out with autopay you can turn it off at any time Also if your payment is declined while autopay is enabled Apple will automatically turn off autopay to prevent overdrafts Credit reporting: Apple reports payment history for Apple Pay Later loans to the credit bureau Experian That means other lenders can see your Apple Pay Later loan information if they pull your Experian credit report which could help prevent overextension across credit products According to Experian this reporting isnt currently factored into credit scores but may be in the future Small loan amounts: Apple Pay Later offers loans only up to $1000 which is smaller than those of some BNPL providers If you want to break up a large purchase like a new computer or furniture you may not be able to use Apple Pay Later Only one type of payment plan available: Apple doesn’t offer a monthly financing option which other BNPL providers do Monthly plans let you break up payments over a longer period — think three months to five years — which can help you finance a larger purchase These plans can come with interest though and are not always a good fit for borrowers Not available for in-store use: Apple Pay Later is available only for online and in-app purchases which means you can’t use Apple Pay Later to shop in stores unlike most other BNPL providers You can now use “buy now pay later” to check out at most retailers The type of payment plan — and whether it charges interest or fees — depends on the BNPL provider so it’s important to pay close attention to the loan terms you’re offered at checkout For some users BNPL is a smart way to break up a purchase especially if you get a zero-interest offer and are positive you can afford the installments Getting approved may also be easier compared with credit cards or loans because there’s no minimum credit score requirement But BNPL is still a form of debt and there are risks The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau released a study in September 2022 raising concerns about inconsistent consumer protections the ease of debt accumulation and overspending and data harvesting and monetization Another CFPB study from March 2023 identified BNPL users as more likely to show signs of financial distress BNPL pros BNPL cons Zero-interest plans available No minimum credit score required Available at most major retailers during checkout Some plans may charge interest Some plans may charge fees Payments may not be reported to the three main credit bureaus Easy to overspend Disputes and returns can be challenging NerdWallet recommends using BNPL only for necessary expenses Though BNPL can be a convenient and low-cost payment option you’re still taking on debt and it’s rarely a good idea to go into debt for a nonessential purchase Approval for Apple Pay Later is based on your credit report details about your purchase and any previous payment history you may have with Apple Pay Later Every purchase you make is a separate loan and requires individual approval To get approved you’ll need to be at least 18 years old and be a US citizen or a lawful resident with a valid US address thats not a PO Box You might need to verify your identity with a driver’s license or other state-issued ID You’ll also need to update your iPhone or iPad to the latest version of iOS or iPadOS and set up two-factor authentication A valid debit card is required to check out with Apple Pay Later Apple may conduct a soft credit pull when you apply for Apple Pay Later This won’t affect your credit score Though there’s no minimum credit score required users with a 610 FICO score or lower may have a harder time getting approved according to Apple’s website Apple Pay Later is similar to pay-in-four plans offered by Affirm and PayPal which also come with no interest or fees But Affirm and PayPal offer monthly payment options with larger loan amounts and Affirm is available for in-store purchases Interest Terms Fees Affirm 0% for pay-in-four 0%-36% for monthly financing Pay in four installments due every two weeks Pay monthly with terms of 3-60 months No fees Afterpay 0% for pay-in-four

comes to watching immersive videos and interacting with the world around you Its rare to find a new technology that feels groundbreaking but in the two demos CNN experienced ahead of the launch its easy to see the future — or at least an early and very pricey prototype of it The headset itself looks like a pair of designer ski goggles It features a soft adjustable strap on the top a digital crown on the back — a bigger version than what youd find on an Apple Watch — and another digital crown on the top that serves as a kind of home button Although its still a computer around the eyes its surprisingly light and comfortable to wear The setup process is easy: First the headset tracks the eyes scan hands and maps the room Users will then see an iOS-like interface placed in front of their environment By using eye movements and touching the thumb and pointer finger together it activates a select button allowing people to seamlessly go in and out of apps such as Messages FaceTime Safari and Photos The interface also responds to voice to activate Siri Photos can be viewed at life size or as if youre watching them on a giant movie screen Panoramics meanwhile place you directly within the scene Vision Pro also offers a spatial photo option which lets users view images and videos in 3D for an even more life-like experience Use cases for the Vision Pro vary from cooking and meditating to working Users can sync up their Mac computer to turn the screen into an enormous display and connect a physical keyboard To maximize productivity its possible to have several windows open at once: Email can be kept on one side a Safari browser opened perhaps in the middle and a FaceTime call on the right If a user is wearing Vision Pro while on FaceTime they appear as a Persona or an avatar-like digital representation of their face The real magic of the Vision Pro however is in the immersive videos During a recent demo we watched Star Wars clips on Disney+ while sitting inside a virtual representation of Luke Skywalkers landspeeder vehicle a viewing experience that will delight any movie fan Watching an underwater scene from Avatar 2 in 3D meanwhile was also surreal seemingly placing users right in the ocean Apple has taken steps to reduce the motion sickness problem that has plagued other headsets thanks to a custom chip that cuts down on the latency issue found in similar products Vision Pro includes surround sound with audio pods that sit outside the ears to deliver rich immersive audio To help users navigate their new headset Apple has included a nearly 10-minute guided tour on its website Almost every new Apple product from the iPhone to the Apple Watch promises to use screens of varying sizes to change how we live work and interact with the world The Vision Pro has the potential to do all of that in an even more striking way But out of the gate the Vision Pro will likely remain a niche product for die-hard Apple enthusiasts and developers largely due to the price tag Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said during the first pre-order weekend last month the company sold an estimated 160000 to 180000 Vision Pro headsets Shipping times remained largely unchanged after the first 48 hours indicating demand could wane after core fans have placed orders Shipping windows typically widen after new iPhone models sell out Morgan Stanley analysts project the company will ship up to 400000 Vision Pro units this year The-CNN-Wire ™ & © 2024 Cable News Network Inc a Warner Bros Discovery Company All rights reserved Your browser is out of date and

305,"Tim Cook rise at Apple from education to CEO","1/13/2024","https://www.businessinsider.com/tim-cook","Tim Cook has helped Apple become the most valuable company in the world with a market cap approaching $3 trillion Hes steered the tech giant through the death of Steve Jobs multiple product launches and the growth of Apples subscription business While Cook is globally recognized today as the leader of one of the most important tech companies he came from a modest beginning Cook was born in Mobile Alabama in 1960 His father Donald Cook was a shipyard worker and his mother Geraldine Cook worked at a pharmacy He graduated from Alabamas Auburn University in 1982 with a degree in industrial engineering After college Cook worked at IBM for 12 years While working at IBM he earned an MBA at Duke by taking night classes Cook was misdiagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 1996 an experience he said made him view the world in a different way Since then hes become known as a fitness buff Cook left IBM and jumped into a COO role at a company called Intelligent Electronics He eventually became vice president of corporate materials at Compaq then one of the hottest PC manufacturers around Meanwhile Steve Jobs had just come into power as Apples CEO following the ouster of Gil Amelio Jobs had the tough task of turning the company around after many years of fading relevance He went looking for fresh blood for his executive team Jobs approached Cook identifying him as a strong prospect for the new Apple Cook signed on to Apple in 1998 as SVP of worldwide operations It must have been a difficult decision for Cook In 1997 Apple was an industry laughingstock: Michael Dell one of Microsofts closest partners once said that if he were in Jobs shoes Id shut it down and give the money back to the shareholders And experiencing Jobs biggest flop first-hand just a few years later probably didnt make the transition easier either: In 2000 Apple released the Power Mac G4 Cube but the small PC which Cook called an engineering marvel never found its audience But Cook said the spectacular failure taught him an important lesson in humility and intellectual honesty This was another thing that Steve taught me actually Cook said during a visit to Oxford University in 2017 Youve got to be willing to look yourself in the mirror and say I was wrong its not right One of Cooks biggest early coups was closing Apples own factories and warehouses and replacing them with contract manufacturers meaning that devices could be made in larger quantities and get delivered faster In 2005 Cook also started making investments that would lay the groundwork for the future of the company including forming critical deals with manufacturers on flash memory the computer-storage component that would form the basis for the iPhone and iPad Cooks prescience meant that when competitors sought to build their own phones and tablets they had to compete for what little factory capacity and components those factories could spare after they had already fulfilled their commitments to Apple Thanks to Cooks management expertise his star within the company rose rapidly Apple was on the track toward growth and big profits and Cook got a lot of the credit As his influence grew Cook became known within the company for his no-mercy relentless questioning style his willingness to hold hours-long meetings and his propensity for sending emails at all hours and expecting answers In 2007 Apple introduced the iPhone — the device that would change everything That same year Jobs brought Cook closer to the core of the business by naming him COO Related stories As COO Cook helped run Apples business and made more appearances at public events getting out in front of executives customers partners and investors In 2009 Tim Cook was named interim CEO while Steve Jobs was on leave to manage his declining health Jobs had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2003 and it was starting to take its toll Cook even offered Jobs a portion of his liver since they share a rare blood type But Jobs refused saying Ill never let you do that Ill never do that In January 2011 Cook took over as interim CEO once again while Jobs was on medical leave In August 2011 Jobs resigned his role to focus on his health — the board then named Cook the permanent CEO of Apple When Jobs died in October 2011 Cook had the flags on the campus of Apple headquarters flown at half-staff in his memory Cook reportedly considers the time following Jobs death the loneliest time of his life Cook told Stanford Universitys graduating class of 2019 that mentors can leave you prepared but not ready Cook said that after Jobs death when the dust settled all he knew was that he was going to have to be the best version of himself that he could be Cook had some big shoes to fill The iPhone especially is an internationally beloved Apple product and Jobs is held up as one of the greatest CEOs in history His greatest gift was not a singular product but rather Apple itself Cook said of Jobs in 2017 Jobs once said that making things with a great deal of care and love is ultimately the thing that keeps Apple Apple and Cook has said that he believes Jobs vision lives on everywhere in the company In the months following Jobs resignation and then his death there was a lot of uncertainty over whether or not Apple could keep the momentum going under Cook Though Cook was now in the limelight as CEO of Apple he followed Jobs example as a public figure and has remained intensely private when it came to his personal life directing the attention as much as possible back on Apple In 2014 though Cook ended years of speculation by publicly announcing in an editorial in Bloomberg Businessweek that he was gay That made Cook the first openly gay CEO of a Fortune 500 company During his tenure as CEO Cook has kept a lot of important Apple traditions alive including appearances by rock stars like the Foo Fighters at Apples events and Jobs famous one more thing product announcements In 2015 Apple released the Apple Watch the companys first entirely new product in the post-Jobs era And in 2016 Apple introduced AirPods tiny wireless earbuds that have become a runaway hit and an important product for Apples growth The company has since released several upgraded versions of the buds — analysts estimate theyre among Apples best-selling products Apple has also expanded its iPhone lineup under Cook adding lower-cost iPhones like the iPhone SE as well as more expensive pro models that cost more than $1000 In recent years Apple has expanded beyond hardware to focus on subscription services like Apple Music Apple TV+ and Apple News+ services that help retain existing Apple customers Apples

mixed-reality headset and said it was the most advanced personal electronics device ever The headset which is priced at $3499 has 12 cameras and features a technology Apple calls Eyesight which allows someone approaching to see the face of the person wearing the headset Vision Pro sales will begin February 2 In the last few years Apple has seen some more high-profile execs depart: Apples retail chief Angela Ahrendts departed in April 2019; Jony Ive Apples design chief and another of Jobs close friends left the company that June; and marketing chief Phil Schiller announced he was stepping down in August 2020 though he remains involved at Apple as a fellow But the companys growth hasnt slowed — in fact Apples market cap has tripled since 2018 When Apple surpassed a $2 trillion market cap in 2020 it helped Cook reach billionaire status for the first time In 2021 Cook received the 10th in a series of payouts from a deal he received when he took over as CEO Cook lives in a $23

BRAD SMITH: Yeah SEANA SMITH: Were not going to be talking about $3500 device Well be talking about $1500 device And you would think that maybe that would be enough for people to try it out But well see BRAD SMITH: Absolutely Related Quotes"

Login Apple wants the Albanese government to clarify when the Reserve Bank would be able to deploy new powers allowing it to create rules on bank access to the tech giant’s tap-and-go mobile payment system after Apple said it would allow European bank apps to make payments with iPhones without sending them through Apple’s digital wallet Apple provided the concessions in Europe as part of moves to settle antitrust charges brought by the European Commission which has been investigating banks’ access to the Apple Pay system Reuters reported at the weekend Apple wants the Albanese government to rethink new RBA powers Josh Robenstone The case arose because Apple restricts access to its near-field communication (NFC) technology which lets iPhones communicate with payment terminals Currently all contactless payments that use iOS-based devices such as iPhones and Apple Watches are sent through Apple Pay The EU says that by limiting third-party access Apple is making it tougher for banks to develop rival mobile wallets which are becoming a more common way to pay The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has been examining similar issues after the big banks flagged concerns eight years ago that Apple’s payments architecture was “closed and controlling” The federal government is consulting on new laws that would expand the powers of the RBA over Apple and other global payments platforms The changes to the Payment Systems (Regulation) Act of 1998 would let the RBA create an “access regime” creating rules about bank use of iPhones for payments which has emerged as a key issue in submissions to Treasury on the bill late last year The Australian Banking Association argues the new law should ensure regulators can consider bank access to “gatekeeper” or “must-have” payment technologies which are being used by a growing proportion of consumers and businesses “The ABA strongly supports the intention for the RBA to have clear powers to address a spectrum of issues that may affect access to payment systems” it said Whether Apple is acting as a “gatekeeper” – by controlling critical economic infrastructure that iPhones have become part of as they digitise payment cards – was flagged last year by Commonwealth Bank CEO Matt Comyn He has been warning policymakers for several years about Apple’s increasing power in the financial services sector Apple told Treasury in its latest November 1 submission that if Australian regulators are given powers to impose such a regime decisions should be “appropriately weighed against potentially harmful consequences for participants and the public more generally” The Cupertino California-based company expressed concerns that draft bill “does not identify any specific matters that must be taken into account” when proposing an access regime or standards Apple has previously argued its control of the iPhone NFC antenna which also lets it charge banks fees when iPhones make card payments is necessary to maintain the security of iPhones It has also argued banks’ arguments are being made to protect their own market power in payments given Apple Pay makes it easy to switch between cards issued from different banks In Europe where it faces a potential fine from the commission Apple’s position appears to be softening “We have offered commitments to provide third-party developers in the European Economic Area with an option that will enable their users to make NFC contactless payments from within their iOS apps separate from Apple Pay and Apple Wallet” Reuters reported Apple as saying on Friday The decision may embolden Australian banks which have been seeking fair access to the NFC since Apple Pay arrived in Australia in 2016 The following year the ACCC refused to grant the other big banks authorisation to collectively bargain with Apple over access to NFC technology But ACCC chairwoman Gina Cass-Gottlieb said in 2022 that the competition watchdog had been collaborating with the EU on NFC access including considering whether Apple “engages in self-preferencing and restriction of competitor access to functionality is in its reservation of tap-and-go contactless payments using the NFC chip on Apple mobile devices to its own Apple Pay app and Apple Wallet” Apple told Treasury in its latest submission that the bill “is not a proportionate nor evidence-based regulatory response” for services that are simply a digital presentation of a physical card It reiterated it had a “limited role in payment systems” and no material risks caused by Apple Pay had been identified that would make regulatory intervention necessary Copy link Copied Copy link Copied Subscribe to gift this article Gift 5 articles to anyone you choose each month when you subscribe Already a subscriber?

research investing resources and more Learn More Apple (AAPL -409%) made headlines last week with its most significant product launch in almost a decade On Feb 2 the company released the Apple Vision Pro a virtual/augmented reality (VR/AR) headset or spatial computer as Apple describes it The new product is equipped with the same chip powering its MacBook Air allowing the Vision Pro to perform everyday computing tasks such as web browsing word processing video editing and various entertainment tasks Data by YCharts It remains to be seen how successful the headset will be but this chart shows Apple is currently dedicating about 8% of its annual revenue to research and development The last time that figure was higher the tech firm was gearing up to launch the first iPhone So whatever the company is cooking up now could mean big things for Apple over the next decade Although the company has encountered some challenges over the last year its significant cash reserves and potent brand make me confident in its long-term success Heres why its not too late to buy Apple stock Apple hasnt had it easy over the last year In 2023 macroeconomic headwinds caught up with the company leading to four consecutive quarters of revenue declines The streak was finally broken in Apples latest quarter with revenue rising 2% year over year to $120 billion in the first quarter of 2024 The company beat Wall Street forecasts by more than $1 billion However outperforming estimates wasnt enough to quell investor concern over its iPhone business with its stock down 3% year-to-date Smartphone sales rose 6% in Q1 2024 yet fell 13% in China The East Asian country has increased restrictions on the iPhone threatening business from Apples third-largest market China accounts for about 17% of the companys revenue Sales in China look unlikely to improve soon or perhaps ever with the rise of rivals like Xiaomi and Huawei However growth in other regions could offset losses in China over the long term while the company also gradually reshapes its business to rely less on the iPhone In Q1 2024 product sales in Europe Apples second-largest market posted revenue growth of 10% year over year Meanwhile sales in Japan soared 15% Moreover despite recent hurdles Apples free cash flow climbed 10% to about $107 billion in the last year indicating slowing Chinese sales arent having the detrimental effect that the companys stock dip would have you think Additionally it shows the firm has the funds to overcome current headwinds and keep investing in other high-growth areas of tech Apples research and development hit just under $8 billion last quarter Its unclear what the tech firms roadmap looks like for the next decade However market trends and the launch of its Vision Pro headset suggest it will include journeying further into artificial intelligence (AI) VR/AR and digital services Consistent growth in these sectors could allow Apple to lean less on product sales and more importantly the iPhone over the long term The AI market on its own is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 37% through 2030 which would see it exceed $1 trillion Meanwhile data from Fortune Business Insights shows the VR market will grow at a CAGR of 31% in the same period Apples brand loyalty and substantial cash reserves make it well-positioned to see major gains from both industries Additionally digital services are gradually becoming Apples best-performing business and could overtake the iPhone Services include income from the App Store and subscription platforms like Apple TV+ Music and iCloud The digital business is Apples second-highest-earning segment accounting for about 20% of the companys revenue Meanwhile services growth has outperformed the iPhone for more than a year with revenue for the segment rising by 11% year over year in Q1 2024 compared to the iPhones 6% It will take time for Apples investments to pay off and be reflected in its stock price However now could be an excellent time to make a long-term investment in Apples business Its stock offers significantly more value than some of its rivals indicating it is lower risk than other Big Tech stocks Data by YCharts This chart shows Apples forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) and price-to-free cash flow are considerably lower than those of Microsoft and

Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) recent journey through turbulent times marked by dropping iPhone sales within the key Chinese market has cast a shadow over its ubiquitous dominance The fourth-quarter results showed a 13% dip in iPhone sales across China exacerbating concerns among investors and stakeholders Yet it’s imperative to recognize that this setback is part of a broader narrative that doesn’t undermine Apple’s inherent value and many opportunities In dissecting Apple’s situation it’s critical to acknowledge the resilience and adaptability that has become synonymous with its brand Despite the slowdown in hardware sales Apple’s services segment has emerged as a powerful counterbalance demonstrating stellar growth and compensating for any perceived shortcomings in device sales Furthermore Apple’s capacity to exceed Wall Street’s top and bottom-line expectations amidst these challenges underscores its operational ability and market understanding Furthermore the introduction

earlier $2 billion forecast Its data center revenue in the last quarter alone increased by 38% YOY bolstered by a remarkable quarterly bump of 43% This surge stems from its triumph in CPU and data

Would Apple really go so far as to degrade the consumer experience on iPhone to protect its revenue in other words? The iPhone maker on Thursday published an update to its website detailing its DMA-related changes in the EU to address the matter after the discovery that iPhone web apps — also known as progressive web apps or PWAs — were no longer functional in the recent iOS betas in the EU Initially there was concern that the issues were just a beta bug but Apple soon put that theory to rest On its website Apple explains that to comply with the DMA it’s being forced to support other web browser engines besides WebKit — the browser engine used by Safari iOS Home Screen web apps have relied on WebKit and its security architecture to keep users safe from online threats This involves the isolation of storage and the enforcement of “system prompts to access privacy-impacting capabilities” Apple said Without this isolation and enforcement malicious web apps could read data from other apps and gain access to a user’s camera microphone or location with user consent the company noted Since Apple is being forced to allow alternative browser engines via the DMA’s requirements the company chose not to put users at risk and instead degraded the web app experience on iOS for users in the EU Now web apps will function as website bookmarks — without support for local storage badges notifications and dedicated windowing I suspect Apple’s real reason for killing PWAs is the realization that competing web browsers could do a vastly better job of supporting PWAs – unlike Safari’s intentionally crippled web functionality – and turn PWAs into legit untaxed competitors to native apps https://tco/RrqQamVdYX — Tim Sweeney (@TimSweeneyEpic) February 15 2024 Though Sweeney arguably has a bone to pick with Apple there may be some truth to his claims Within Apple’s explanation of why it has ended support for web apps in the EU the company admits there’s a technical solution to the security issues problem — but it simply chose not to implement it Apple wrote (emphasis ours): Addressing the complex security and privacy concerns associated with web apps using alternative browser engines would require building an entirely new integration architecture that does not currently exist in iOS and was not practical to undertake given the other demands of the DMA and the very low user adoption of Home Screen web apps In short Apple is saying it knows how to fix the problem but because it’s been burdened by having to comply with the DMA — which it noted had required “more than 600 new APIs and a wide range of developer tools” — it decided to skip fixing this one While it may be no small feat to build “an entirely new integration architecture” it also isn’t as if Apple was surprised by the DMA a regulation that’s been in the works for years It had time to prepare for this To further deflect any culpability here Apple suggests that people won’t mind that it broke Home Screen web apps given their “low user adoption” But Apple’s own moves contradict that explanation If anything Apple has been working to make PWAs more useful over the years adding features that allowed web apps to function more like native apps and be easily distributed outside its App Store Meanwhile user adoption has been growing not shrinking Analysts estimated that the PWA market would reach $1044 billion by 2027 at a compound annual growth rate of 319% It’s entirely possible that alternative browser engines could make PWAs even more useful as Sweeney argues which would be a threat to Apple’s App Store business given the web apps are now nearly as functional as native apps are Apple had been asked to comment on its decision around PWAs but it only published an explanation to its DMA website as its response Apple confirms it’s breaking iPhone web apps in the EU on purpose Apple’s answer to EU’s gatekeeper rules is new ‘core tech’ fee for apps"

Stocks To Buy For a quick overview of such stocks read our article 5 Best NYSE Penny Stocks To Buy Markets wavered as latest data showed inflation in January 2024 was hotter-than-expected But many analysts believe the markets overreacted as a single months data can only delay the Feds planned rate cuts for 2024 UBS Global Wealth Management on February 20 said it expects the Federal Reserve to begin cutting rates in June instead of May UBS expects the first rate cut to be of 25 basis points Given the upside surprises to both payrolls and inflation we now expect the Fed to wait a bit longer before cutting rates UBS economists said in a note UBS is expecting 75 bps of cuts in 2024 lower than its previous estimate of 100 bps cuts The era of elevated interest rates might be prolonged amid a resilient labor market and stubborn inflation but sooner or later the Fed will begin to cut rates That means good times might be coming for small-cap stocks or risky equities including penny stocks which have hitherto suffered as investors shunned smaller companies to find refuge in high quality stocks like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) Amazoncom Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) Historical data showed small-cap stocks perform exceptionally well in the first 12 months of the Feds first rate cut Lord Abbett in its December 2023 report took a detailed look at what the private investment management company called a dovish pivot of the Federal Reserve where it hinted that its interest rate cycle might have peaked The Lord Abbett report also said small-cap companies perform well during rate cuts Currently in fixed income we find the short duration space to be attractive and underallocated A “bull-steepening” environment like what we’ve seen when the Fed turns dovish on policy favors short duration At the same time the normalized rate environment can make active opportunistic credit an attractive diversifier with expected returns at current yields rivaling equities Equities particularly small caps historically have done very well when inflation falls and in Fed rate-cut cycles while growth equities have done well when growth slows Finally a more normalized rate environment means less of the “financing for everyone” that was prevalent in the zero-interest-rate era Going forward quality companies with greater financial strength should be able to differentiate in terms of financial performance and demand a premium All in all the Fed’s dovish December pivot shocked the markets and set the table for better performance by risk assets in 2024 What a difference

In a nutshell the technology aims to suck carbon dioxide out of the air The CO2 is then stored underground In August 2023 Occidental announced the acquisition of Carbon Engineering for $11 billion a leader in developing DAC technology The company is also constructing the billion-dollar Stratos plant in the middle of oil fields in West Texas Once Stratos is operational it will be the biggest DAC facility ever by a factor of 100x Carbon capture could present a massive opportunity ExxonMobil estimates that it could be a $4 trillion market by 2050 Occidental CEO Vicki Hollub believes DAC in particular could give new life to the oil and gas industry She told National Public Radio in December 2023 that theres no reason not to produce oil and gas forever if her vision of DAC is achieved Buffett appears to be fully on board with Occidentals DAC focus He praised Hollub in his interview with CNBC last year saying that she is extremely competent and understands oil as well as political realities His aggressive buying of Occidental stock will likely continue Berkshire won regulatory approval in August 2022 to purchase up to 50% of the oil company; its stake currently stands at a little over 28% Will Buffett ever like Occidental as much as he does Apple?

Apple scrapped plans to build the self-driving iCar after a decade of development perhaps disappointed it didnt autonomously make a success of itself What does this mean? Apple put “Project Titan” into motion in 2014 sketching plans for a self-driving electric vehicle with a swanky limo-style layout A company needs to be pretty confident in its driverless car to put it on the roads though – and even after a decade Apple’s just not there That’s why the iCar team has switched its focus to generative AI the type of technology that fuels OpenAI’s ChatGPT Apple’s already teasing more progress than it did with its eco-friendly limousine dropping hints earlier this year that investors can expect a serious announcement in the not-too-distant future Why should I care? Zooming out: Apple’s been reading the news Apple might not be missing out on much Drivers aren’t buying electric cars like they once were mainly because their higher prices are less justifiable in today’s economy So realistically the iCar wouldn’t have helped Apple catch up to competitors Google Amazon and Microsoft But if Apple can craft an AI service that takes its signature iPhones and iPads to the next level the company could win big-spending gadget aficionados over – not to mention eagle-eyed tech-obsessed investors The bigger picture: Baidu bai-dont The tech industry moves fast and companies that can’t keep up risk being left behind Just look at Baidu: the Chinese firm secured its spot as the country’s go-to search engine ten years ago but rivals Alibaba and Tencent have since stolen a march on the company when it comes to AI Baidu created the “Ernie” language model sure but the other two were quicker to throw a lot more money into their own budding systems That go-getter attitude has already paid off with Alibaba and Tencent’s stocks and AI-related revenue beating the old timer’s so far this year ai alibaba amazon apple electric vehicles evs microsoft tencent tesla stocks us ai apple ecommerce fintech Disclaimer: These articles are provided for information purposes only Occasionally an opinion about whether to buy or sell a specific investment may be provided The content is not intended to be a personal recommendation to buy or sell any financial instrument or product or to adopt any investment strategy as it is not provided based on an assessment of your investing knowledge and experience your financial situation or your investment objectives The value of your investments and the income derived from them may go down as well as up You may not get back all the money that you invest The investments referred to in this article may not be suitable for all investors and if in doubt an investor should seek advice from a qualified investment advisor /3 • Your free quarterly content is about to expire Uncover the biggest trends and opportunities Subscribe now for 50% off Cancel anytime"

354,"Huawei gains more ground in the Chinese smartphone market with a 362% shipment increase as Apple’s shipment falls by 2%","2/3/2024","https://www.gizchina.com/2024/02/03/chinese-smartphone-market-huawei-apple-shipping/","IDC an authoritative market research agency has released its latest report on the Chinese market for the fourth quarter of 2023 According to the report Apple’s iPhone shipments in China dropped 2% in the fourth quarter of 2023 while Huawei’s shipments increased by 362% during the same period This growth has positioned Huawei as the fourth-largest smartphone vendor in China The Chinese brand now has a market share of 139% up from 103% in the same period a year ago The Chinese mobile phone market is the third-largest for Apple and the company takes this market seriously However the intensifying competition from local rivals led by Huawei is not an easy hurdle to climb In the global setting Statista Counterpoint Research and IDC agree that Apple and Samsung are the two dominant players in the market Apple did hold on to the top spot in terms of market share in 2023 Other major players include Xiaomi Huawei Oppo and Vivo The market is highly competitive with companies vying for market share through aggressive trade-in offers There are also many interest-free financing plans and competitive devices in the lower price range of the high end The global smartphone market grew 19% YoY but declined by 7% QoQ as 323 million units were shipped led by Samsung Huawei has experienced a significant resurgence in the Chinese smartphone market following the challenges posed by US sanctions The company’s substantial growth in shipments has solidified its position as a major player in the Chinese market Huawei’s success can be attributed to its new product launches and the increasing demand for its 5G handsets Back in 2020 Counterpoint Research reported that Huawei was the outright leader in the Chinese smartphone market In the first quarter of 2020 its market share that grew to 36% in Q1 2020 reaching a record high The company also captured a massive 60% share of the 5G smartphone market and reached its highest-ever share in China capturing 46% of sales volumes However over the next two years Huawei saw a significant fall in its market performance because of the US ban Not giving up in Q3 2023 Huawei’s China smartphone sales surged with a 37% year-on-year increase in smartphone sales This helped the company narrow the market share gap with top brands such as Apple The company’s growth has been attributed to the success of its new smartphones such as the Mate 60 Pro which has contributed to its strong sales performance In October 2023 Huawei and Xiaomi led a double-digit rebound in the China phone market with Huawei improving by 83% The growth of Huawei’s smartphone sales in China has outpaced that of Apple with the company being the fastest-growing smartphone maker in China in the third quarter of 2023 according to Counterpoint Research This growth has been particularly notable in the 5G smartphone segment where Huawei has made significant strides The decline in Apple’s smartphone shipments in China reflects the increasing competition from local players and the impact of government restrictions on the use of Apple devices Despite offering substantial discounts Apple faced a 21% decrease in its shipments in the final quarter of 2023 This decline has raised concerns about the company’s position in one of its key markets Apple was not impressed with its financial report in Greater China The company’s executives did not fail to openly express their dissapointment with the performance Apple CFO Luca Maestri said that the company is not satisfied with the decline in revenue in China However he affirms that the Chinese market contains long-term major opportunities Of course the sharp decline in revenue in Greater China is mainly due to weak iPhone sales In this regard Apple’s CEO Tim Cook reiterated in an interview that it is not that the iPhone is difficult to sell He said that the iPhone’s performance in China is still excellent but the company can achieve more He showed confidence that Apple will bounce back from the slight decline Cook also reiterated that iPhone occupies four of the top six sales positions in China The decline in revenue is not due to the loss of iPhone popularity but is mainly a reflection of overall economic problems Cook said that taking into account exchange rate factors the overall impact of the 13% year-on-year decline in Greater China on the company will become a “mid-single digit” Cook added: “China has always been the most competitive smartphone market in the world and that hasn’t changed” The Chinese mobile phone market is a dynamic and highly competitive landscape with over 285 million smartphone shipments in 2022 Domestic brands such as Huawei Xiaomi Oppo and Vivo have established strong footholds through their brand reputation extensive distribution networks and competitive pricing strategies These brands are expected to continue dominating the market especially in the mid-range and budget segments International brands like Apple and Samsung also have a significant presence in the premium segment The market is highly competitive driven by evolving consumer preferences technological advancements and intense competition among domestic and international brands The smartphone market in China can be segmented based on price range brand positioning screen size and camera capabilities Chinese consumers are highly tech-savvy and place a strong emphasis on smartphones’ features design and value for money The market is also influenced by factors such as localized features ecosystem integration and tapping into the untapped rural market Huawei maintained its market leadership with a 45% market share in the third quarter of 2022 and the company’s 5G smartphones received positive market feedback driving it to the top of China’s best-selling models list Despite the challenging environment and sluggish consumer demand Huawei and Apple were the only vendors with a positive year-on-year growth in the top 5 ranking indicating the intense rivalry and competition in the market IDC’s latest report on the Chinese smartphone market highlights the contrasting fortunes of Apple and Huawei in the fourth quarter of 2023 While Apple faced a 2% decline in iPhone shipments Huawei experienced a remarkable 362% growth solidifying its position as a major player with a 139% market share Huawei’s resurgence fueled by new product launches and increasing demand for its 5G handsets underscores its resilience despite past challenges The dynamics of the Chinese mobile phone market continue to evolve with intense competition among domestic and international brands Domestic players like Huawei Xiaomi Oppo and Vivo dominate through brand reputation and competitive pricing while Apple and Samsung maintain a presence in the premium segment The market’s competitiveness reflects consumers’ emphasis on features design and value for money driving innovation and adaptation among manufacturers For Apple the decline in smartphone shipments in China signals the need to navigate the competitive landscape and address evolving consumer preferences Despite challenges Tim Cook’s optimism about the long-term opportunities in China underscores Apple’s commitment to the market As Huawei’s growth reshapes the competitive landscape both

WTF is going on in the games world? Imagine a few months from now you use Unity 6 (dumb move #1) and end up getting dinged per install TWICE Plus the Core Technology Fee What a year it’s gonna be he wrote Epic Games boss Tim Sweeney seemed to agree with that assessment responding with a resolute yes to an X post that asked whether Apple just introduced the equivalent of Unitys runtime install fee He also shared a lengthy takedown of his own that described Apples new terms as an illegal anticompetitive scheme rife with new Junk Fees Sweeney of course has a longstanding beef with Apple Epic and Apple previously took chunks out of each other in court after the latter pulled Fortnite from the App Store in 2020 for breaching guidelines by using third-party payments Apple claims the new EU guidelines will result in more than 99 percent of developers reducing or maintaining their current fees and like we explained earlier the CFT is optional for developers in the EU–but only if they have no interest in exploring their options beyond the App Store ecosystem For those keen to scour pastures new success might come at a cost Read more about: Chris Kerr News Editor GameDevelopercom Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry His byline has appeared in notable print and digital publications including Edge Stuff Wireframe International Business Times and PocketGamerbiz Throughout his career Chris has covered major industry events including GDC PAX Australia Gamescom Paris Games Week and Develop Brighton He has featured on the judging panel at The Develop Star Awards on multiple occasions and appeared on BBC Radio 5 Live to discuss breaking news You May Also Like Mar 21 2024 Mar 14 2024 Mar 13 2024 Copyright © 2024 All rights reserved Informa Tech a trading division of Informa PLC"
378,"Hot garbage: Developers are not pleased with Apples unlocked App Store","1/27/2024","https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-app-store-shakeup-in-europe-triggers-fury-2024-1","Apples absolute rule over the App Store has just been broken for the first time since its launch in 2008 Are developers celebrating? Hardly On Thursday changes were made to the way app distribution works on iPhones — changes that should have been welcomed by developers who have long been at the mercy of strict rules around that process Specifically the changes take effect in the European Union where Apple has been pushed to comply with the Digital Markets Act by March this year Its a law that designates the App Store which takes a 30% commission from developers as an unfair gatekeeper by acting as the only digital store from which apps can be sold and bought on iPhones Despite trying to retain that control ruthlessly over the years Apples changes in the face of the EU legislation mean two main things for developers First third-party stores will finally be allowed onto Apples operating system once iOS 174 is released It means developers can simply bypass the App Store Second Apples cut on transactions will drop from 30% to 17% with an extra 3% fee for use of its payment processing As my colleague Peter Kafka writes this has all made Apple quite unhappy In a release announcing the changes Apple said this new system under the EU act opens new avenues for malware fraud and scams as well as other harmful content But it seems to have made a lot of people quite unhappy too Tim Sweeney CEO of Fortnite-maker Epic Games described the changes as hot garbage as he pointed to the fine print that seemingly complicates matters for developers Apple for instance will have tight control over which third-party app stores end up on its system and compete with it Apple said this was to ensure marketplace developers commit to ongoing requirements that help protect users and developers Sweeney suggests otherwise Related stories Apple proposes that it can choose which stores are allowed to compete with their App Store Sweeney wrote on X They could block Epic from launching the Epic Games Store and distributing Fortnite through it for example or block Microsoft Valve Good Old Games or new entrants Nikita Bier who founded businesses acquired by Discord and Meta took aim at a new core technology fee being introduced by Apple The fee means that apps sold from its App Store or third-party marketplaces will have to pay €050 for each first annual install per year over a 1 million threshold Using Apples own fee calculator he estimated that companies that made $10 million in sales from 10 million customers would result in an annual cut of $62 million for Apple However when the revenue per user was placed to higher than $1 it resulted in much better returns for app makers Eric Seufert general partner at Heracles Capital noted that the fee presents an appreciable financial hurdle to clear for apps that are downloaded from third-party stores seemingly defeating the purpose of those stores being allowed onto iOS in the first place It seems odd to me that the European Commission would approve these platforms charging fees on apps that are sideloaded / downloaded from third-party stores Seufert said Others like Ashley Gullen lead developer of game-making software Construct likened Apples new fee structure to a controversial install fee introduced by Unity last year Did did Apple just introduce the equivalent of Unitys runtime install fee but for all iOS app developers in the EU?! pictwittercom/Z7KMiWEqmD Unity creator of a game engine platform initially planned on charging developers $020 per install for games with over 200000 installs but later revised the plans after facing backlash In a statement Apple said its changes which came after spending months in conversation with the European Commission comply with the DMA However it said it would limit the changes to the EU because it is concerned about their impacts on the privacy and security of users Apples focus remains on creating the most secure system possible within the DMAs requirements But even with these safeguards in place many risks remain — and in the EU the DMAs changes will result in a less secure system the company said It added that it created new tools for developers such as a fee calculator and developer documentation to help them understand the options available for their EU apps and make informed decisions Developers will be forced to reckon with a whole new reality of app distribution that theyve barely begun to grasp As Epic Games Sweeney put it: It will take more time to parse both the written and unwritten parts of this new horror show so stay tuned Read next Jump to"

China","1/4/2024","https://fortune.com/asia/2024/01/04/huawei-homegrown-os-harmonyos-second-most-used-in-china-apple-ios/","Just a few years ago Huawei was so pressured by US trade blacklists that it offloaded its budget smartphone division But the Chinese electronics giant is having a comeback with a buzzy return to the high-end phone market that’s pulling consumer attention away from Apple’s iPhone Now Huawei may soon be on the verge of surpassing Apple in one metric as its homegrown HarmonyOS operating system is poised to overtake Apple’s iOS in China this year according to the South China Morning Post citing a report from tech research firm TechInsights iOS and Android the open-source OS primarily developed by Google will continue to dominate the global market Huawei’s decision to develop its own operating system took on greater importance following US sanctions on the company The Chinese company originally used the Android operating system in its smartphones yet announced HarmonyOS in August 2019 just a few months after the Trump administration added Huawei to the Entity List which forced the company to get Washington’s approval for any purchases of US technology Huawei executives had previously described the development of its own operating system as a “Plan B” as the company faced the prospect of being barred from using key hardware or software with US origins Huawei’s initial success in getting HarmonyOS off the ground could be an indicator that the Chinese firm is maintaining its technical expertise in spite of US sanctions Huawei is now gearing up for another major transition by preparing to abandon Android entirely Previous versions of HarmonyOS supported apps developed for Android yet Huawei’s next update will end this compatibility creating what the company calls a “pure” operating system Chinese tech companies are scrambling to develop HarmonyOS-compatible versions of their apps Chinese firms are reportedly ramping up efforts to hire developers for HarmonyOS including companies like Alipay owner Ant Group and McDonald’s China In August Huawei said at its annual developer conference that more than 700 million devices currently run on HarmonyOS with more than 22 million third-party developers creating apps for the platform The rise of HarmonyOS is also coming as Huawei successfully returns to the 5G smartphone market symbolized by its surprise release of the Mate 60 Pro in August last year The phone features an advanced locally developed seven-nanometer chip despite US sanctions on both Huawei and China’s broader chip industry Huawei’s Mate 60 Pro smartphone was an immediate success with state media outlets and commentators proclaiming the phone a national achievement The company sold 16 million Mate 60 handsets in its first six weeks of sales according to market research firm Counterpoint Research “The clear standout in October has been Huawei with its turnaround on the back of its Mate 60 series devices Growth has been stellar with its new launch marketing and strong media coverage around its ‘Made in China’ chipset” said Archie Zeng a China analyst for Counterpoint Research in a report on the Chinese smartphone market released in November Huawei captured about 13% of China’s smartphone market in 2023 up from 76% in 2022 estimates Ivan Lam senior analyst at Counterpoint Research The company predicts that it generated almost $100 billion in sales in 2023 up from a recent low of $896 billion in 2021 “After years of hard work we’ve managed to weather the storm” Huawei rotating chairman Ken Hu said to employees in late December Still the company has yet to surpass the $137 billion in revenue reported in 2020 Huawei’s return could be bad news for Apple which counts China as one of its most important overseas markets Sales of Apple’s iPhone 15 which the company released a few weeks after Huawei’s Mate 60 Pro underperformed in its first 17 days on sale compared to Apple’s previous models Apple is also contending with new regulations from Beijing Chinese officials will soon require all programs sold on Chinese app stores including Apple’s to have a license from the government Apple may be forced to remove thousands of apps from its Chinese store once the grace period ends in March © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited All Rights Reserved Use of this site constitutes

390,"The latest news headlines and business stories for January 9","1/9/2024","https://www.businessinsider.com/news-today-january-9-apple-vision-pro-2024-1","Hi! CES officially kicks off today but Ive already seen some wild tech including a transparent TV (More on that below) In todays big story we have a release date for Apples next big product Whats on deck: Markets: The economy is entering its first super cycle in 40 years Tech: Carta is in hot water for secretly using client information Business: Tiger Woods and Nike are splitting ways after nearly three decades But first can you try this headset on? If this was forwarded to you sign up here Apples new reality On the eve of the biggest tech conference a company not officially in attendance had the days biggest news Apple which typically avoids a large public presence at CES announced the launch date of its Vision Pro a mixed-reality headset it hopes will eventually be its biggest product since the iPhone You can buy the Vision Pro online and in US Apple Store retail locations starting February 2 as long as youre willing to fork over at least $3499 Business Insiders Sarah Jackson has all the details on Apples big upcoming launch The release of the Vision Pro has been a long time coming We got our first look at it in June but the rumors about Apple launching a VR-type product had swirled for a while And with tech rival Meta having been in the space for a few years it seemed natural Apple would enter the fray But Apple doesnt launch a new product on a whim — its last big product launch was over eight years ago — so this release is a big deal There has also been a level of mystery surrounding the Vision Pro The initial reviews of the headset were good but it was all very cloak and dagger Journalists who tested it back in June could only do so in a private room couldnt take photos or videos and only had 30 minutes The launch of the Vision Pro feels like a make-or-break moment for virtual reality The concept of using some type of goggles to create a virtual reality has existed for decades Old-school gamers will remember Nintendos ill-fated Virtual Boy which was one of the companys biggest failures But in the almost 30 years since now feels as good a time as any for the tech to finally take off Add in the fact that a good chunk of employees are working partially from home and there are real use cases for it Beyond it feeling like a cultural turning point for the tech theres also the fact that the most valuable company in the world really wants it to work With a market cap nearing $3 trillion Apple isnt hurting But the company is facing its fair share of headwinds from a ban on Apple watches to underperformance in China one of its major markets Apple could use a big win and the Vision Pro could be just that As BIs Julie Bort previously wrote the headset could be at the core of creating a multi-billion dollar market for entertainment A recession could still be possible Talk of a soft landing has been ramping up lately with lower inflation and strong employment numbers driving the conversation But according to Deutsche Bank such trends could indicate a downturn Markets are stumbling despite a red-hot end to 2023 On Friday the S&P 500 notched its first losing week in 10 weeks bond prices dropped by the most since October — and strategists are saying investors may have gotten ahead of themselves in December The economy is on the verge of a new super cycle The coming super cycle or period of rapid expansion is underpinned by AI and decarbonization a Goldman Sachs analyst said The chip industrys false promise America is spending $52 million to counter Chinas edge in semiconductor chips But economic conditions construction slowdowns and the slow distribution of government funds have dampened the promised semiconductor job boom The latest tech flex — a transparent TV LG calls it the worlds first wireless transparent OLED TV The device can double as a digital fish tank fireplace or other artwork And the company said it could make rooms feel larger or give owners more options with home decor Silicon Valley is blasting Carta for misusing customer information Carta handles sensitive information for more than 30000 startups And now its under fire by companies like Linear for secretly using client information to fuel its brokerage business Below Deck cast members

In the early 1980s the company had established itself as a promising tech business with products like the Apple II In an attempt to make personal computers more accessible it had then developed the Lisa named after Steve Jobs’ daughter Though innovative the computer had sold poorly especially compared to IBM’s (IBM) PC which was released in 1981 Meanwhile Apple had begun working on the Macintosh which was meant to accelerate the adoption of the personal computer by the masses “Apple came into 1984 being walloped by IBM in the personal computing market and needing a new big hit … the company had bet it all on the Macintosh spending huge on its R&D building a new state-of-the-art factory for it” said Margaret OMara the Scott and Dorothy Bullitt chair of American History at the University of Washington But then arose the question of how to advertise the revolutionary new product Steve Hayden now 76 then a copywriter at Chiat/Day still remembers receiving the assignment from Steve Jobs directly The young tech visionary reportedly wanted to “stop the world in its tracks” and entrusted the LA-based firm with the job Along with art director Brent Thomas Hayden began brainstorming He rifled through old ad concepts he had worked on in San Francisco and found one with the headline Why 1984 wont be like 1984 a line Hayden attributed to fellow Chiat/Day copywriter Gary Gussick At first Hayden and Thomas toyed with a comical conception of 1984 “like the Jetsons” But the ad’s director a well-known talent by the name of Ridley Scott had a better idea “He came and looked at our initial board … he brought in this wonderful coffee table book about the making of Metropolis the movie and the dramatic huge machines and the interface between humans and these kinds of overwhelming technologies” Hayden explained “And so the art direction took a really sharp turn at that point to meet that vision” The advertising experts had already come up with the Big Brother character and Scott insisted that they introduce another a heroine who would contrast starkly with the all-male cast and break the spell Hayden said A new age The heroine symbolized more than simple rebellion against Big Brother As historian O’Mara pointed out the ad aired during the height of the Cold War and year of the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles “I think its telling that shes dressed as a track athlete and dressed as if shes running for the United States she said The heroine also represented the Macintosh While computers had previously been monopolized by experts — think mainframes and IBM — the Macintosh offered a revolutionary user interface that made personal computers accessible to the mass market “She was supposed to represent freedom and the dawning of a new age and therefore Macintosh” Hayden said Added Chiat/Day’s Schwartz: “You have to remember that this was a time when computers were only used for business … When she throws that sledgehammer she is all of us … and she represents all of us trying to destroy any kind of tyranny or dictatorship even if its just a dictator for a day we dont want that We want to be free And I think the power of that is the reason why people talk about it 40 years later” But there were some naysayers within the company Apples board of directors hated it and almost stopped it from airing Meanwhile Hayden himself felt unsure about his work “I had my own concerns that it might be too foreign in structure and content for an American audience” he said “It didnt match the traditional advertising forms” But Jean-Louis Gassée now 79 who was then running Apple France still recalls the first time he saw the ad at a 1983 meeting to prepare for the January launch of the Macintosh “We had never seen advertising like this it was absolutely stunning And then the lights went up a little bit and from the top of the theater machinery a Mac came down on a wire and halfway through the descent it [was amplified by microphones]” he told Yahoo Finance “So we could hear what became the highly recognizable “bong” of the Mac starting There was this hysteria in the room” Though Hayden and the rest of his team at Chiat/Day had never specifically intended “Big Brother” to represent IBM Jobs quickly adopted that framing After showing the ad Jobs gave a “fiery” anti-IBM speech “saying that the Macintosh would change the world” according to Gassée “It was easy at the time to superimpose the Big Brother and the big IBM images” Holding up It is actually stunning to watch the ad today and see how it still holds up Only this time you can imagine Big Brother appearing on your screen as Tesla’s (TSLA) Elon Musk Meta’s (META) Mark Zuckerberg and the developers of ChatGPT and other artificial intelligence products At least Jean-Louis Gassée sees it that way He asserted that the ad is still relevant as we grapple with the likes of AI and user privacy in the world of Facebook and Google It serves as “a good way to remind us of the necessary fight between established powers and upstarts” He added: “I think the ad presents two views of technology One that is Big Brother-like oppressive and one which is the Macintosh a way to break through the domination of Big Brother technology” he said “So this ad in 1983 1984 presented a view of the conflict between usages of technology I think that that conflict is still alive”

Microsoft Nvidia & *now* Meta Leading in AI Era” Raymond James analyst Josh Beck said in a note to clients This year Microsoft is up 10 per cent to $405 - overtaking Apple as the worlds biggest company - Nvidia is up 44 percent to $693 and Meta formerly Facebook is up 33 percent to $459 Tesla is down 27 percent since January 1 while Apple is flat Amazon and Netflix are both up but are not seen as having the AI-fuelled potential of MnM DailyMailcom asked another analyst about MnM - and whether it was too late to invest Bret Kenwell from eToro said: It’s been a fantastic stretch for the so-called “MnM” trio — Microsoft Nvidia and Meta Meta and Nvidia are up about 30 percent and 40 percent year to date and about 145 percent and 220 percent over the past year respectively Microsoft hasn’t been a slouch either up almost 60 percent over the past 12 months Can it continue? Some consolidation certainly would be reasonable given the recent run not just in these specific stocks but for the Nasdaq and S&P 500 in general Still secular tailwinds remain strong for the MnM trio By that he means there is still positive news for the three stocks in light of the rush to AI Before Beck came up with MnM on Friday there had been other - less creative - alternatives to the Magnificent Seven Bret Kenwell from eToro gives his thoughts on MnM - Microsoft Nvidia and Meta The Super Six for example would exclude Tesla while the Fabulous Five left out Apple too Beck focused Fridays note on Meta which saw shares rise 22 percent that day - gaining more than $200 billion in market value That is the biggest single-say increase in a company’s value ever for a US-traded company according to Dow Jones Market Data DailyMailcom also asked eToros Kentwell his thoughts on the three indiviuallly Read his thoughts below META Despite Meta’s meteoric rise to new highs the company initiated a dividend and added a whopping $50 billion to its buyback plan on top of a strong quarterly report Yet it only trades at 23 times forward earnings estimates which are forecast to grow almost 32% this year Metas share price was also boosted last week when it announced its first ever quarterly dividend of 50 cents a share and an additional $50 billion in share buybacks Buybacks and dividends help boost stock prices by rewarding investors with cash simply for holding stock in the company Metas first cash dividend of 50 cents a share will be paid out on March 26 and on a quarterly basis going forward NVIDA It’s easy to critique Nvidia simply based on the stock’s immense rally (and on the idea that AI is just a passing fad) Kentwell said But that’s not the case with AI — a movement that Nvidia is at the forefront of It’s a clear leader in the AI revolution and a high-quality company at that With a $17 trillion market cap Nvidia is hardly flying under the radar anymore But it’s not as if the stock gains have come without a catalyst Earnings and sales have ballooned as have margins and free cash flow The rally isn’t simply due to feverish speculation it’s in anticipation of strong AI-fueled demand Nvidia’s valuation is a bit more stretched thanks in large part to its near-50% rally in the last three months However it would be shortsighted to forget that Nvidia spent the second half of 2023 consolidating below $500 The recent breakout has been powerful but shouldn’t be considered all that surprising MICROSOFT Microsoft is a bit more muted this year up about 8 per cent but its fiscal year wraps up in June Kentwell said After that consensus expectations accelerate calling for double-digit earnings and revenue growth in fiscal 2024 and 2025 respectively With its balance sheet strength immense cash flow and strong margins it remains a blue-chip name within mega-cap tech With an expected acceleration in earnings and sales along with its AI exposure via OpenAI and various business units it’s reasonable that Microsoft will be attractive to investors looking for safer ways to play AI All three in MnM stocks are seen as leaders in AI Nvidia has got a jump on rival chipmakers Intel and AMD on AI processors It not only makes AI chips for home and busiuness computers phones and other gadgets - but also mega powerful ones for data centers used by big businesses Microsoft meanwhile has invested billions of dollars into artificial intelligence - making it a leader ahead of Apple Google and Amazon It got attention for taking a stake in Chat GPT creator OpenAI the leading chatbot that is also now built into its Edge internet browser But it has started selling Copilot an AI assistant that can summarize an email inbox or craft a slide show for $30 per month Facebook and Instagram-owner Meta is moving into AI - with chatbots that businesses can use to talk to customers The company also launched AI tools for businesses that allows ad buyers to create and track campaigns - and get around strict rules from Apple that block cookies on apps and web browsers Nvdia which manufactures computer chips has enjoyed returns of nearly 250 percent this year and is the top performer in the S&P 500 CAN NVIDIA OVERTAKE AMAZON?

396,"Apple Vision Pros Are Practically Dress Code at This Crypto Hacker House","2/15/2024","https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-vision-pros-practically-dress-175600378.html","SALT LAKE CITY – Looking for a glimpse of what an office might look if everyones wearing Apples Vision Pro headsets? You can find it here in Salt Lake City at an in-person gathering of developers focused on the Solana blockchain known as mtnDAO The common theme? Theyre geeks and theyre rich – a natural demographic for testing out the newly released devices which can cost upwards of $5000 including accessories Over 20 attendees of this month-long coworking event have purchased Apples Vision Pro They spend their days staring into sleek goggles slipping between its digital recreations of reality and the massive workspaces that only they can see MtnDAO might offer a glimpse of Apple CEO Tim Cooks era of spatial computing – where the meatspace environment is enhanced by the digital goggles Everyone is simultaneously using them to work play and even socialize and maybe even physically eat alongside each other while still wearing them Cook unveiled the Vision Pro in June 2023 Whats perhaps most interesting of all is that the whole thing is completely organic – a future-of-work laboratory that has just popped up without influencers or corporate sponsorships These people dont work for a single company developing VR technology Theyre nearly all independent tech workers in the crypto industry They spend their days building products for the future of finance: a world built on cryptocurrencies NFTs and the Solana blockchain That so many 20- and 30-somethings can afford Vision Pros might be possible only because of crypto riches or with Solana specifically Since October the blockchains flagship token SOL rallied over 10-fold to become the best-performing large-cap crypto of 2023 Believers in Solana aplenty the mtnDAO attendees have plenty of SOL to spend And then theres the airdrops – essentially token giveaways by blockchain projects to incentivize early users In the past few months a parade of financial applications built on Solana have created their own tokens and rewarded power-users with princely sums Just by trading tokens on platforms like Jupiter some of the Vision Pro buyers said they received airdrops worth tens of thousands of dollars I know its a $5000 impulse buy but f_ck it I just got a $5000 impulse airdrop said ZenLlama a pseudonymous Solana contributor and mtnDAO attendee who does developer relations for the Monad blockchain We legitimately think that we have the largest amount of Vision Pros in one area anywhere said MJ a former animator for Netflix and Disney and one of the few headset owners here at mtnDAO actually building a product for the Vision Pro The headset owners purchases are fueled by jealousy as much as curiosity Only a handful preordered the Vision Pro Most of the rest bought their pairs because of FOMO Their friends had one at mtnDAO So they too made the one mile pilgrimage to Apples downtown store and got their own The result: a WeWork bustling with headset-wearers staring off at who-knows-what and the normies around them experiencing regular old reality These two groups mingle frequently Normies chat with headsetters headsetters chat with other headsetters The front of their headsets display purplish digital eyes that mimic the real ones theyre covering Their real ones are staring at invisible screens even though theyre typing on actual keyboards Time to get some real work done said Marbius a product manager for a crypto fitness game as he entered the box He said he goes entire days in his Vision Pro He sets up a few desktops within the VR and allows just a smidge of reality to pass through around them Im spending more time in it than I expected said Anders Jorgensen the head of growth at crypto borrow and lend protocol MarginFi one of mtnDAOs hosts He pre-ordered his Vision Pro months ago and then brought it to the WeWork where mtnDAOs crypto workers gather every weekday in February Inside his Vision Pro Jorgensen opts for a fully immersed setup – no distractions with his Airpod Pros providing extra noise-cancellation Instead of inside busy WeWork he types away atop mountains and moonscapes Jorgensen and another regular at mtnDAO TJ Littlejohn a former Apple employee who also pre-ordered his headset says they inspired a lot of other people at the coworking event to buy their own Vision Pros Two others went with Littlejohn to the Apple store when he picked him up and came back with pairs of their own That spawned a local run on Vision Pros By mid-February the rumor at mtnDAO was that Apples local store had sold out Not every Vision Pro owner at mtnDAO is a crypto developer Two of them are building programs for the device itself Littlejohn and MJ the animator were some of the earliest mtnDAOers to own the headsets and helped seed the FOMO that set off the buying frenzy Our whole operating vibe right now is finding these really compelling experiences that we can make that would be so dope on the Vision Pro said Littlejohn who now runs a VR gaming studio startup called Middle Curve with MJ Their short term plan is to build spatial video games for the Vision Pro and then leverage that tech for other applications in the professional space perhaps by building character-avatars that Vision Pros users can consult in lieu of menus Littlejohn said he was surprised so many other mtnDAO attendees bought Vision Pros Its been a bigger hit among professionals than he expected – plenty of people spending their entire days in mixed reality Theres something powerful about using the Vision Pro in an office environment attendees told CoinDesk It lets them toggle between immersion in their work and the myriad distractions around them in seconds Part of me wonders if Im only gonna like it at a place like this said Marbius"

Since the value of money is tied to the trend in interest rates the dollar index could lower if or when the FED cuts rates A lower dollar drives oil prices higher (good for Chevron) and makes domestic consumption decline (alarming for Apple); so Warren is timing the market as futile as it seems? Even analysts at The Goldman Sachs Group NYSE: GS have expressed their view toward the manufacturing sector maybe betting on the lower dollar sparking new export demand from the US They are pointing toward a breakout of the sector which of course includes Chevron as a prime member for rising profits One word of caution: this does not mean you should dump all of your Apple stock in case you own any; guys like Buffett can sell a stock only to rebalance their portfolio or to book some profits to be reinvested in other more attractive deals So here are the reasons why – beyond the macro – Chevron can be more attractive than Apple If there’s anything your portfolio should be after in this coming cycle it is growth and above-average growth When it comes to Apple and its peers growth is a lacking factor considering today’s analyst projections and just the opposite is the case for Chevron Taking the energy stocks as a group they are expected to grow their earnings per share by an average rate of 71% over the next twelve months Analysts believe that Chevron stock can jump 146% to be above the industry average and superior to its close competitor Exxon Mobil NYSE: XOM which expects only 83% growth On the opposite end of the spectrum you have the mega-cap technology stocks which are expected to grow their EPS by a respective 112% over the next year; Apple sits well below this average at only 84%; it also happens to be below its closest competitor Microsoft NASDAQ: MSFT who expects to see 131% Knowing what you know now it should come as no surprise to learn that Chevron – in its $1809 price target – brings you a 170% potential upside while Apple only comes at 126% along its $2053 targets The reason behind this divergence? Well you should be able to answer that by now So now you see Buffett gave you the initial hint but it is the actual marketplace and analyst expectations that are literally confirming the thesis as to where the new growth can be found in the new upcoming cycle Before you consider Berkshire Hathaway youll want to hear this MarketBeat keeps track of Wall Streets top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis MarketBeat has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on and Berkshire Hathaway wasnt on the list While Berkshire Hathaway currently has a Hold rating among analysts top-rated analysts believe these five stocks are better buys View The Five Stocks Here Wondering what the next stocks will be that hit it big with solid fundamentals?

GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with NVDA As of 2024-02-26 Apple Incs intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $15547 Its currently trading at a price of $18252 Therefore the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -174% The company is fair valued The GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage In the growth stage the company is experiencing faster growth while in the terminal stage a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run Apple Incs intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps Term Value Explanation EPS without NRI $642 GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow Discount Rate 11% An appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 424% rounded up to the nearest whole number which is 5% A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate Growth Stage Growth rate (g1) = 1620% Years of Growth Stage = 10 We choose the growth rate based on the availability prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10 5 or 3 years in that order and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate The default growth period is set to 10 years Terminal Stage Growth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10 For the terminal stage the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation Growth Stage = EPS without NRI * [ (1 + g1) / (1 + d) * (1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2 + + (1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ] = 833 Terminal Stage = EPS without NRI * (1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 * [ (1 + g2) / (1 + d) + (1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2 + + (1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ] = 7217 Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based) = Growth Stage + Terminal Stage = 15547 GuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $14319 This valuation indicates that the Apple Inc is fair valued accompanied by a margin of safety of -2747% You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page Please note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model: Future Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings Embracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role All else being equal a company with rapid growth will have a higher value Predictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance For companies with unpredictable performance such as cyclical companies the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized Discount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate Using the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based) To identify undervalued predictable companies focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based) This article generated by GuruFocus is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice Our commentary is rooted in historical data and analyst projections utilizing an impartial methodology and is not intended to serve as specific investment guidance It does not formulate a recommendation to purchase or divest any stock and does not consider individual investment objectives or financial circumstances Our objective is to deliver long-term fundamental data-driven analysis Be aware that our analysis might not incorporate the most recent price-sensitive company announcements or qualitative information GuruFocus holds no position in the stocks mentioned herein This article first appeared on GuruFocus Related Quotes"

Platforms","2/5/2024","https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zacks-investment-ideas-feature-highlights-110000886.html","Chicago IL – February 5 2024 – Today Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Microsoft MSFT Alphabet GOOGL Amazon AMZN Apple AAPL and Meta Platforms META We saw a slew of earnings this week from the market’s leading stocks and they didn’t disappoint In addition to many other companies that reported earnings five of the ‘Magnificent 7’ informed us of their performance Last Tuesday we heard from Microsoft and Alphabet and then on Thursday afternoon from Amazon Apple and Meta Platforms All these market leading companies have put up incredible stock performance over the last 18 months and it looks like that trend may well continue In this article we are going to take a look at the quarterly earnings reports valuations and Zacks Ranks and attempt to identify which are the most attractive investments right now Microsoft: Q2 2024 saw Microsoft soar past expectations with 18% revenue growth and a 33% EPS jump Their cloud product Azure fueled the gain with a 30% surge and doubled its AI integration showcasing commitment to the future However a lower-than-expected Q3 revenue forecast was a notable concern Despite this Microsoft remains a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) with its thriving cloud business and dedication to AI advancements Alphabet: While Q4 2023 earnings for Alphabet topped EPS estimates by 2% ad revenue missed expectations slightly leading to a stock price dip despite an overall 14% YoY sales growth Their cloud business continues to shine but concerns linger about growth in the core advertising engine With a Zacks Rank 3 (Hold) may be a bit less appealing based on earnings estimate trends Amazon: Q4 2023 earnings were music to investors ears with Amazon exceeding estimates on both revenue and EPS Their cloud computing arm AWS continues to be a major growth driver and advertising revenue also surpassed expectations This positive report led to a stock price rise and solidified Amazons Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating Apple: Q1 2024 earnings saw Apple beat analyst expectations for both revenue and EPS Revenue grew 2% YoY to $1196 billion and EPS increased 16% YoY to $218 While iPhone sales slightly missed expectations Services revenue reached an all-time high suggesting a shift towards recurring income streams The company also achieved a record number of active devices Apple has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rating Meta Platforms: Q4 2023 earnings surpassed expectations leading to a more than 20% surge in stock price Both revenue and EPS beat analyst estimates with revenue growing 25% YoY The company announced its first-ever quarterly dividend and a $50 billion stock buyback further contributing to investor excitement Metaverse investment continues and its profitability remains a concern for some investors META has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating The chart below shows the forward earnings multiples of each of the stocks discussed in this article We can see that GOOGL and META have the lowest near 20x and AMZN has the highest at 435x AAPL and MSFT are in the middle of the pack with 284x and 362x respectively It is also worth noting that AMZN META and GOOGL are all below their 10-year median valuations while AAPL and MSFT are above them I think Meta Platforms and Amazon are showing the most promise for further big moves ahead Amazon’s development is just so impressive to me with AWS still growing at 20% and their new advertising business growing at 23% annually and suddenly bringing in $60 billion in sales annually The success in ads is even more impressive when compared to Alphabet the leading online ad platforms whose growth is slowing significantly Meta Platforms too is just absolutely killing it Even with its 250% rally in the last year and a half it still trades at a very reasonable earnings multiple And now with its new $50 billion buyback plan and a new dividend it is showing a real commitment to returning cash to shareholders Alphabet although it has some concerning growth data regarding its ad business does continue to chug along I don’t think it has the best growth prospects but there is no doubt it is the cheapest of the Magnificent 7 which makes it a worthy investment consideration Apple and Microsoft are of course fantastic businesses that should be a part of any well diversified investment portfolio but I think at this point in time are less appealing than the other three Apple is seeing a slowdown in iPhone sales growth and Microsoft seems to have a lot of future news priced in especially regarding its recent gains with AI The premium valuations are a concern as well Nonetheless this group of the world’s leading companies have shown that even at their mammoth sizes they continue to thrive Furthermore they are showing that the US economy is still performing at a steady rate Since 2000 our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&Ps +62 average

418,"Here are my favorite Vision Pro apps (so far)","2/8/2024","https://finance.yahoo.com/news/favorite-vision-pro-apps-far-235120057.html","Since Apple launched the Vision Pro last Friday I’ve been hammering home the importance of immersive content This isn’t a radical suggestion by any means At this point we’re all keenly aware that hardware platforms live and die by content offerings Remember all the way back for a moment to the end of 2014 When Tim Cook unveiled the first Apple Watch alongside the iPhone 6 the product was met with some blank stares What many wondered was the point of such a device? It wasn’t the Dick Tracy wristwatch we’d been promised since the mid-1940s but rather a small-screen extension of the iPhone It took Apple a few years to really hone in on fitness as the device’s single biggest driver When you wear a smartwatch these days you get a lot fewer questions about why you would possibly want to own such a gadget There’s no guarantee that the Vision Pro will follow a similar trajectory but if does it will be on the backs (faces) of app and game developers The Vision Pro is an unquestionably impressive piece of hardware It does several key things — including passthrough spatial association and high-res displays better than anyone else in the consumer space But plenty of people are understandably still asking “Why?” As in why would someone spend $3500 on that? The price and extended reality’s long spotty history have cast additional doubt on Apple’s first headset Ultimately however the “why” can be traced back to content A little less than a week after the device’s launch what should we point to as the Vision Pro’s killer app? For the moment it’s computing This is where Apple has leaned heavily partially in a bid to appeal to enterprise customers with deep pockets If these organizations purchase headsets in bulk scaling will help bring down the cost of subsequent models The beauty of the platform play is that it’s a method to crowdsource functionality Apple may have more money than any deity you can name but its developer resources are still finite By leaning on 3D parties you tap into a wealth of outsider perspectives that bring the sort of outside-the-box thinking that is often considered counterproductive to the bottom line inside the gears of a large corporation In the lead-up to the Vision Pros release whether Apple still possessed the standing to attract key developers remained something of an open question Six hundred “optimized” apps at launch was a strong showing for a first-gen device in a category with a rocky track record That figure is bolstered by significantly more iPadOS apps that can run on the device As for what constitutes “optimization” the answer isn’t as straightforward as you might think This can be as simple as tweaks to the UX in line with the shift from touch to hand gestures or as complex as full immersion and advanced hand tracking For the sake of this piece I am most interested in optimized apps with immersive properties Using an iPad app on the headset generally isn’t a bad experience (nor do you want full immersion all the time) but we’re here to talk about a bleeding edge $3500 piece of hardware — let’s see what this bad boy can do [youtube https://wwwyoutubecom/watch?v=tvK6Q2FdyCg?version=3&rel=1&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&fs=1&hl=en-US&autohide=2&wmode=transparent&w=640&h=360] I’m a staunch believer in screen breaks Take a walk read a book speak with a human touch the proverbial grass If anything this is more important when that screen is strapped to your head After spending a little over a week with Vision Pro in my home I’ve found that my usage tends to be divided in clusters For instance I’m writing this to you on my desktop — the real one not the virtual My interaction with the infinite desktop experience is still limited I find the device is best used with intentionality Rather than simply attempting to convert as much of my life to spatial computing using the Vision Pro is an ongoing process of determining when it is the best tool for the job at hand (I will wholly admit that my philosophy might be different if I had paid the upfront costs rather than reviewing a loaner unit) Your mileage will vary but I tend to get motion sickness relatively easily so I’ve been limited to sessions around 30 minutes A few apps have crept into my morning routine during this time I’ve been suffering from degenerative disc disease spinal stenosis and sciatica for several months now Things like that put a real damper on your ability to head to the gym As I’ve been engaging in a little self-rehab however I’m more able to do moderate exercise My mornings now involve 20 minutes of Apple Fitness+ Pilates followed by a game of Synth Riders on the Vision Pro The latter has been ported over from the Meta Quest It’s a Rock Band/Guitar Hero rhythm game wherein your hands become instruments that collide with orbs barreling toward you at great speeds It’s a fun quick game that’s reminiscent of Beat Saber Here all the levels revolve around synth tracks and the broader aesthetic can be described as “’80s Trapper Keeper” It features either full or partial immersion depending on how aware you need to be of your surroundings Synth Riders is about the most exercise you can get away with on the Vision Pro given price weight and battery pack I don’t break a sweat playing the game; it’s more about getting the blood pumping It’s also suitable for a 3–4 PM workday break when your energy starts flagging If you do sweat a little you can always hand wash the light seal insert Moving forward I would love more apps that bring some light exercise to the platform — and Quest ports are a solid starting point I would be curious to see how the system handles boxing and form-correcting à la products like Tonal and Mirror I wrote a bit about Apple’s Mindfulness app It’s pretty bare-bones on the feature side but that’s not a terrible thing in the world of meditation I’ve also been trying out Endel Realms after a brief morning workout I’ve written about Endel’s mobile app and how its algorithmically produced music has helped me get back into the meditation groove Realms is a far simpler application at the moment creating calming or energizing environments You basically sit there for five to 10 minutes and let the light bath wash over you I’ve so far found it to be centering There are three things I want to see more of on the Vision Pro: dinosaurs ocean exploration and space I’ve mentioned Dinosaur Experience a few times on here because it serves as a great example of what can be done with immersive interactive technology Being up close with dinosaur bodies that are based on the latest scientific research is one of those experiences that shows what a system like this is capable of More than anything however it’s proof of concept It’s short plays and loops and the whole of its interactivity is limited to a butterfly landing on your finger and a trio of dinosaurs looking at you as you walk around There’s not a ton of meat on this proverbial bone but it’s beautiful compelling and will hopefully point the way to bigger things Image Credits: SkyGuide As I wait for a guided tour through the solar system I’m happy to spend some time with SkyGuide The app operates similarly to NightSky on iPhone providing an immersive look at the stars constellations and planets SkyGuide is a bit less tied to place than NightSky (which is honestly one of its best features) and is instead about simulating locations (a light-pollution-free cityscape the top of a mountain range and the open ocean) Lego has been absolutely killing it with Nintendo AR demos Builder’s Journey is an extremely pleasant experience that takes full advantage of the system’s object recognition plopping a box of bricks directly on the table in front of you as you follow the storyline and build virtual structures Loona occupies a similar space — albeit an even chiller one This is what our Danish friends refer to as hygge Here you’re piecing together some basic objects like a scooter or fireplace It’s good for turning your brain off though unfortunately you have to pay to unlock all but the first puzzle Microsoft Word doesn’t bring much to the table on the immersion front but if you plan to do some work inside the Vision Pro the 40-year-old app remains a gold standard for word processing As with any apps that entail a lot of typing I strongly recommend pulling out a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse Voice dictation still has its limitations and while I’ve gotten pretty quick with gesture typing the idea of using it to enter much more than a username and a password makes me want to jump off the roof The coolest UI piece here is the addition of a small predictive text field that sits directly above the keyboard — more or less the same one you’ll find in iOS Thus far I’ve mostly limited longer form typing to sending off some emails I’ve written a bit about Vision Pro enterprise apps over the last couple of weeks (as has Ron) My current take on the category is that it’s the place where Apple sees the highest and most immediate return on investment Companies have deep pockets and they’ll buy products in bulk if they think it will save them in the long run Bring on enough customers and you begin to approach a place where scale has a tangible impact on manufacturing prices Training is a no-brainer It can be especially useful for more complex tasks that require a three-dimensional understanding of objects in space That last bit is also a fundamental aspect of JigSpace which is designed to build AR demonstrations Right out the gate you can explore objects like a jet turbine an F1 car and a human heart The app offers a glimpse into how this tech might be used in the future This article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunchcom/2024/02/08/here-are-my-favorite-vision-pro-apps-so-far/ Related Quotes"
419,"AAPL Stock Forecast: Surprise! Why Apple Is In Better Shape Than People Realize","2/9/2024","https://www.tradingview.com/news/investorplace:07d546bd1094b:0-aapl-stock-forecast-surprise-why-apple-is-in-better-shape-than-people-realize/","Despite some ongoing concerns according to my Apple AAPL stock forecast there are still plenty of reasons to buy Questions continue to surround Apple some of which were not answered by the company’s recent fourth-quarter financial results Sales of the company’s legacy technology products such as its iPhone and MacBook computer remain tepid and it’s not yet known how its new augmented reality headset will fare with consumers But these questions don’t take away from the fact that Apple remains one of the best stocks investors can hold in their portfolio A Strong Quarter There was a lot of nail-biting when Apple issued its Q4 2023 print Analysts and media zeroed in on the fact that Apple’s iPhone sales in China declined 13% in the October through December quarter Home to its main iPhone manufacturing plant and with 20% of its global iPhone sales coming from China the nation of 14 billion people remains strategically important to Apple However all the handwringing over China obscured some very strong results from the company Apple’s revenue rose 2% year-over-year in Q4 ending four consecutive quarters in which the company’s annual sales declined Apple’s gross margin came in at 459% versus 453% that was forecast Despite a decrease in China iPhone sales globally totaled $6970 billion beating Wall Street forecasts of $6782 billion It was the company’s first full quarter of iPhone 15 sales Revenue from the MacBook computer also came in ahead of estimates at $778 billion In fact Apple’s consumer electronic devices showed sales growth in all regions of the world except for China which is undergoing an economic slowdown and where Apple faces growing competition from domestic smartphone makers such as Huawei But overall Apple produced very strong results beating analysts’ estimates on both the top and bottom lines Management said they expect iPhone sales in the current first quarter to be similar to last year’s $5133 billion and that its services should grow 11% The New Headset The day after Apple’s Q4 print the company’s new Vision Pro mixed-reality headset went on sale around the world Reviews of the device have been positive This is Apple’s first entirely new electronics product since 2015 and pre-orders were so strong that Apple moved up the launch date to February from a previous schedule of late spring While some analysts have taken issue with the Vision Pro’s price of $3499 reviewers seem to agree that the headset is worth the expense The Vision Pro’s global sales will be included in Apple’s next earnings report and should help counter any slowdown in sales of its iPhone or other devices In recent days it was reported that Apple’s manufacturing facilities in China have increased production of the Vision Pro to meet growing demand Apple is also working with software developers to create apps that can be used with the augmented reality headset Analysts are forecasting 200000 to one million unit sales of the device this year Prioritizing the Shareholder Outside China Apple’s business continues to fire on all cylinders But even in China Apple is managing the situation as best it can In mid-January Apple announced discounts on its devices to spur sales including knocking the equivalent of $70 off its iPhone 15 The company is also moving its manufacturing out of China and to low-cost centers such as India Other US companies ranging from Nike NKE to Starbucks SBUX have also run into trouble in China and are pulling up stakes At the same time Apple continues to prioritize its shareholders In Q4 2023 Apple spent nearly $27 billion on dividend payments and stock buybacks The company continues to buyback more of its own shares than any other publicly traded company It’s also one of the few mega-cap technology companies that pays a dividend And AAPL stock continues to appreciate rising 25% in the last 12 months bringing its five-year gain to 345% Buy AAPL Stock Apple’s future outlook and growth are being questioned but its current problems are mainly in China Outside that country Apple remains a strong brand and continues to post strong sales That its Vision Pro headset has just gone on sale should give the company’s earnings a jolt going forward There’s no question that Apple continues to provide solid returns to investors with its share price gains dividend payouts and stock buybacks Anyway you look at it AAPL stock is a

Going to a website that already has a large number of users such as Instagram is a great option And the more people who join the platform the more attractive it becomes Meta has also been ramping up new monetization initiatives The companys Reels (short-form videos across Facebook and Instagram designed to compete with TikTok) is soaring in popularity while paid messaging on WhatsApp is also delivering excellent results The company is also making a push in artificial intelligence Additionally Meta Platforms hasnt given up on its metaverse idea although that likely wont yield any significant return on investment soon Still it is another potential long-term opportunity for the company E-commerce is another obvious growth opportunity for Meta Platforms given its large ecosystem Meta should soon rejoin the trillion-dollar club but that wont mark the end of the companys growth journey That story still has plenty of chapters left Investors can buy the stock sit back and enjoy the ride Should you invest $1000 in Apple right now?

DAN HOWLEY: Hey Jared Right now Im actually coming through the setup process to try to get one of these When you do youre going to have to have an iPhone or iPad with you basically to take a scan of your face Its going to tell you to look up down left right kind of similar to what you do when you set up face ID And thats the way that it takes measurements for you to ensure that youre getting a right fit when you have this The big reason why you want a good fit is because you dont want light leaking in to take you away from that immersive experience that Apples offering So far though it looks like there are backups as far as the delivery date So theyre appear to be slipping as far away as March Its going to take quite a while I just set one up $3500 $3499 I set one up with Zeiss Optical inserts for my glasses $4147 is what I would pay I dont think I got paid this week so its not happening But I do think that its something worth watching to see how many people actually buy and how long those delivery times end up getting delayed just because it shows how much people are interested in this product And its still a nascent market but you know weve seen Meta in here for quite a while and it hasnt taken off as much as maybe Mark Zuckerberg would have hoped So well have to see if Apple can stoke these fires JOSH LIPTON: And Dan what do you think the most popular use cases for this device are going to be? Not just in the near term but kind of farther out Do you think this is going to be-- listen this is really going to be for gamers? Is it going to be for people watching movies or sports or are people going to use it at work? DAN HOWLEY: I mean hands down the reason why people have these headsets right now is gaming right? And so if youre not a gamer or youre not even you know interested in gaming at all then its not really a system for you Thats how it is with the Meta Quest There are some work options where you can dip into meetings and things like that But lets face it you dont want to turn on your camera on your laptop for a meeting youre not going to want to strap on a headset for a meeting You dont want to see something-- someone in the flesh you dont want to see a virtual version of them either The thing that I think Apple is banking on is that you would use this as a productivity device to extend your screen So you would look down at your Mac and then oh heres a giant version of that screen up here Thats very cool I got to look at a version of that The other is watching interactive videos or 3D videos things like that When I tried it in June at WWDC I got to see a version-- a 3D version of the Avatar movie which looked very cool you know I got to say the overall between any of the devices that Ive used the Vision Pro is the best The fidelity for the screen is amazing You put it on and you see the pass through and it looks great I think the real question is do people want something like this? And if so why? Ive said it before I have a 65-inch OLED TV I have my PlayStation there I can get up and walk to the fridge I can lay down I dont have to worry about a headset Ill have to see when I get my hands on the Vision Pro if that makes me change my mind Related Quotes"

products","1/23/2024","https://therecord.media/cybersecurity-experts-warn-of-vulnerabilities-apple-atlassian-fortra","Multiple new vulnerabilities are being exploited by hackers in recent days prompting alarm from experts worried about how they will be used by cybercriminals and nation states Over the last week vulnerabilities affecting tech giants including Apple VMware Atlassian Fortra Apache and others have been highlighted both by cybersecurity experts and government agencies like the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) On Tuesday CISA echoed warnings from Apple that CVE-2024-23222 — a vulnerability affecting several versions of iPhones and iPads — is being exploited by cybercriminals The vulnerability is the first zero-day announced by Apple in 2024 — the company patched 20 zero-days last year The bug allows hackers to execute code on a victim’s device “Processing maliciously crafted web content may lead to arbitrary code execution Apple is aware of a report that this issue may have been exploited” Apple said on Tuesday CISA ordered all federal civilian agencies to patch the bug by February 13 That order came on the same day that cybersecurity researchers raised alarms about the latest vulnerability affecting Fortra’s GoAnywhere file transfer software which was at the center of controversy last year when a Russian ransomware gang used a different issue with the tool to attack dozens of companies and governments In an advisory published on Monday Fortra said CVE-2024-0204 was discovered in December and allows an attacker to create an admin user account through the administration portal — giving them widespread access to a victim’s system The company urged customers to patch the vulnerability and noted that it carries a 98 CVSS severity score indicating that it is a critical vulnerability In a statement to Recorded Future News the company said they “have no reports of active exploitation in the wild regarding this CVE” They also shared a letter that was sent to customers in December warning about the vulnerability and providing detailed guidance about how customers can resolve the issue Hackers were recently revealed to be actively attacking two vulnerabilities affecting products from Atlassian and Apache Researchers at Greynoise observed steep spikes in attempts to exploit CVE-2023-22527 — a vulnerability Atlassian announced last week that affects Confluence Data Center and Confluence Servers Atlassian said the vulnerability carries the highest possible severity score of 10 and urged customers to patch it as soon as possible Experts at Shadowserver said they have seen over 600 different IP addresses attempting to exploit the more than 11000 instances that are exposed to the internet Cyber defenders raised similar concerns with a relatively old vulnerability affecting Apache products that cybercriminals began exploiting this weekend According to findings from cybersecurity firm Trustwave a surge in attacks exploiting CVE-2023-46604 in Apache ActiveMQ hosts Apache ActiveMQ is widely-used software that helps applications communicate with each other and share data “Since a proof of concept of the exploit was made publicly available in October 2023 threat actors have been using it to deploy crypto-miners rootkits ransomware and remote access trojans” the company said in a blog post CISA said the vulnerability was exploited as far back as November and forced all federal civilian agencies to address the issue by November 23 Incident responders at the time reported that hackers using the HelloKitty ransomware were behind a campaign to exploit CVE-2023-46604 In the latest campaign outlined by Trustwave hackers are using the bug to infiltrate systems and deploy tools that allow them to fully control a system Another popular tool is facing attacks this week according to CISA and incident responders at Google-owned cybersecurity firm Mandiant Mandiant warned last week that an espionage group tied to the Chinese government has been exploiting CVE-2023-34048 — an issue affecting VMware vCenter Servers The vulnerability was disclosed in October but VMware updated the advisory last Wednesday to confirm that it was seeing exploitation attempts Mandiant said that in its investigation of the issue it discovered Chinese espionage hackers have been exploiting it as far back as 2021 The company said the hackers had a window of about a year and a half to exploit the issue before VMware became aware of it Researchers at Censys said they have seen hundreds of systems that may be vulnerable to the issue CISA added the bug to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog on Monday giving federal civilian agencies until February 12 to patch it Jonathan Greig is a Breaking News

Reichman University An Israeli startup has created a smart wristband that uniquely turns an Apple Watch into a camera capable of taking photos and recording video and audio without relying on an accompanying phone Wristcam’s special strap includes two cameras (front and rear facing) to allow users to take the images or record short messages which they can then send directly to others with the app or upload to their paired phone to share in other ways “The developer ecosystem for the Apple Watch is nowhere near [as advanced as] the iPhone” Writstcam CEO Roi Ginat tells NoCamels “Many companies on an ongoing basis struggle with their phone applications and they did not want to share any resources with developing a watch app” But for Wristcam the evolution into a camera for the watch was a natural one Seeking to make an easy-to-use video platform the company initially produced a live streaming app for the iPhone but soon realized that it did not offer any unique features to attract new users Instead the company transformed their product into the device for the Apple Watch which according to analysts was on 115 million wrists by December 2022 While the Wristcam is not formally affiliated with Apple the tech giant did provide the company with a special security chip to embed into the strap so that it can properly connect to an iPhone The Made for iPhone (MfI) chip is provided to third-party companies whose products such as chargers and headphones are deemed compatible by Apple The app is downloaded onto the paired phone and therefore automatically the watch too and once installed the app connects to the camera on the strap This allows the strap to send audio and video messages directly to another device with the same app or to a paired phone in order to share via messaging services such as WhatsApp or even post to social media In order to work all devices must be connected to the internet While most of the audio and video messages are designed to be around 20 seconds long the app can record for several minutes at a time The strap can also store a large number of messages as it has eight gigabytes of memory Safety Strap The unique camera also works as a safety feature with a separate Wristcam app called Protect This allows a user to automatically live stream in an emergency to up to three people with the app who form what Ginat calls a “safe network” “Protect is a first of all on a mission to try and prevent emergencies prevent physical or mental damage and suffering if possible and improve handling of those situations when they occur with better speed and better accuracy” Ginat explains All the user needs to do he says is push a button that will start live broadcasting for people in their safe network The application is set up to immediately alert everyone in that safe network as a critical notification which is sent even when the phone is in silent or do not disturb mode (Israel’s national alert system for incoming rocket fire also bypasses these modes) The Protect app automatically uploads the live-streamed video and audio to the cloud for review at a later date The app even works without the camera only recording audio Once another person is watching the live stream they can start voice communication with the original user through the app Ginat says this particular feature works well when people are in distress and need someone to calm them down “Whether it’s making sense of the person in distress whether it’s calming them down or directing them on the right things to do – it’s basically being there” he says “That’s already helpful and it’s fast” In the US and in Israel Protect is also designed to facilitate calls from someone watching the livestream to the emergency services The feature was made available for free in Israel last year following the massive terror attack of October 7 When the emergency services in either country are contacted the caller can easily transmit the video and audio from the Protect app to the call center giving the operator an understanding of the situation who is involved and where the caller is located “911 calls typically start with a lot of very basic questions like your name where are you who’s there with you” he says and the app helps to provide this information The emergency call can be made while still watching the live stream which Ginat says is a crucial feature as it means the line of communication with the person in distress remains open The company which was founded in 2012 and has offices in Ramat Gan California and China is funded by private investors rather than venture capital firms They are Ginat says nonetheless always looking for new sources of support The wristband is currently available on Amazon in the US and Europe as well as in certain European countries that do not have the option to purchase from the online shopping platform Future plans Ginat says include incorporating artificial intelligence to improve the technology both for communication and personal safety “What’s most exciting for me now is the combination of AI and our rich media technologies because it’s just a perfect match both for safety and health” he says NOCAMELS Straight To Your Inbox Accessibility Tools"

Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: A potential antitrust lawsuit against Apple by the federal government could be a turning point as big in the company’s 48-year history as the return of founder Steve Jobs or the invention of the iPhone according to legal experts Speculation about a landmark case is again on the rise after The New York Times reported Friday that the Justice Department is in the final stages of a years-long investigation into Apple which could lead to a lawsuit later this year The probe reportedly focuses on everything from the seamless integration between the iPhone and Apple Watch to the company’s digital payments system and Apple’s use of green text bubbles to differentiate Android text messages from iMessage communications — in short a broad look at Apple’s tightly controlled walled-garden ecosystem that’s turned it into $28 trillion behemoth Apple — the most valuable company in the world — is the only leading tech giant the US government has yet to sue on antitrust grounds within the past few years If antitrust officials do go after Apple expect it to be a “full-frontal assault” on Apple’s business said Adam Wolfson an antitrust attorney at the law firm Quinn Emanuel “Depending on what the Department of Justice actually alleges it could potentially attack all the ways or many of the ways that Apple runs its business and maintains itself as one of the most profitable companies in the world” Wolfson said Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment A DOJ investigation does not mean the agency intends to bring a case and regulators could still opt not to sue But a decision to take Apple to court would be “a very big deal” according to William Kovacic a former chairman of the Federal Trade Commission one of the country’s top antitrust agencies “The stakes for consumers here the stakes for the company are very high” Kovacic said Some of the most important milestones in Apple’s roughly half-century of existence include Jobs’ ouster from Apple in 1985 along with his return in 1997 and his fateful pivot to launch the iPhone the iPad and the Apple app store ushering in the mobile era of computing that has forever transformed global society A DOJ lawsuit targeting the bedrock of Apple’s success would become another major chapter in the company’s storied narrative and Apple would likely draw on much of that history — as well as the goodwill it has created with millions of consumers who love the company’s products — as part of its court defense legal experts said Despite its popularity with users Apple has attracted mounting criticism from app makers rivals and policymakers who have accused the company of locking users in and of forcing competitors to accept restrictive terms to reach Apple’s users Some US lawmakers have proposed legislation to force open Apple’s app store though the bill has stalled amid opposition by Apple and Google In other situations Apple’s opponents have successfully challenged the company most recently in a roiling patent dispute that led to an import ban on certain Apple Watches last month before Apple obtained an emergency court order pausing the ban In 2020 a US House investigation found that Apple along with Amazon Google and Meta all wielded monopoly power in potentially harmful ways The 16-month investigation featured high-profile hearings with tech CEOs and culminated in a 450-page congressional report detailing some of the companies’ allegedly anticompetitive business practices It also fueled a wave of antitrust scrutiny that has since led to US government lawsuits against all the companies named in the report except for Apple Apple’s handling of Android messages has emerged as a high-profile example for critics of how the company tries to leverage its power By showing Android messages on iPhones within a green text bubble instead of a blue one as it does with its proprietary iMessage platform Apple has created a kind of status differential said Wolfson “People with an iPhone are more entrenched because they don’t want to be on that other side” he said “And for the people who are on Android phones they want to get an iPhone because they don’t want to be excluded The question is is that an exercise of power that has anticompetitive effects?” Last year Apple announced plans to improve interoperability with Android messages by adopting a standard known as Rich Communication Services although experts anticipate Apple will continue using the green message bubbles Beginning in 2020 Apple fought a highly public antitrust court battle over its app store against Epic Games maker of the video game “Fortnite” but a US district court and federal appeals court both ruled that Apple has not illegally monopolized the market for distributing apps on its platform Aspects of the case have been appealed to the US Supreme Court though the justices have not yet determined whether to hear the matter Those existing rulings highlight the challenges ahead for the Justice Department which will need to bring in any lawsuit a strong legal theory about how Apple has allegedly harmed competition The DOJ would also need to prove that the benefits Apple has delivered to consumers don’t outweigh its alleged antitrust violations “All of these matters are extremely challenging” Kovacic said “[Apple] will argue as have Google Amazon and Facebook that their behavior isn’t sinister but crucial to providing users with a good experience” If the Justice Department brings a lawsuit against Apple it would likely be considered as significant as the US government’s antitrust prosecution of Microsoft during the 1990s legal experts said It may also be interpreted as a symbol of President Joe Biden’s economic agenda Leading the DOJ’s antitrust division and the FTC are a fresh generation of officials who have argued the United States has historically under-enforced the nation’s antitrust laws leading to a wave of corporate consolidation and anticompetitive practices that ultimately harmed the public through higher prices fewer choices or reduced innovation Both agencies have since pursued high-profile cases against powerful companies and mega-mergers “One of the greatest accomplishments of the Biden administration especially in terms of economic policy is to have moved antitrust from the storage sheds to the front burner” said David Balto a former policy director at the FTC Members of Congress have also expressed concern about rising economic concentration and have passed legislation increasing the budgets for the FTC and DOJ That along with the House investigation and the proposals to regulate US app stores shows how lawmakers have a pivotal role to play in curbing competition abuses said Charlotte Slaiman an antitrust attorney and vice president at Public Knowledge a consumer advocacy group A case against Apple would reflect what enforcers can do with more resources Slaiman added It could also potentially lead to sweeping changes to the tech sector not seen since the Microsoft case which ended in a groundbreaking settlement that experts credit for the rise of the modern internet “If they were to bring a case against Apple now it would be at the same level in terms of magnitude and enforcement” Wolfson said “It would be a marked elevation in what they’re going after” Most

At US$3500 the Vision Pro headset (pictured above) is certainly not a cheap piece of gear However the original iPhone was not either when it launched in 2007 Apples first crack at a cell phone carried a price tag of US$499 or US$733 when adjusted for inflation at a time when other phones valued between US$350 to US$400 were considered the top end Plenty of naysayers dismissed the product overlooking the value of its exceptional software and interface The real aha moment came when developers flocked to iOS Quality touchscreen displays unlocked endless possibilities for entertainment and productivity applications allowing customers to assign more value to the iPhone beyond just a phone Id argue the same could be true of Vision Pro once developers exploit the immersive interface Apple App Store developers generated US$11 trillion in billings and sales in 2022 Owning this enormous ecosystem Apple collects fees of between 15% and 30% on its sales This revenue stream forms part of the companys services segment which accounted for about 19% of net sales in Apples last quarter The services category is critical to why I bought more Apple shares As more use cases are addressed by apps Apple can clip the ticket at near-nil cost With more of our everyday tasks and activities passing through a glass display Apples toll booth-style business has delivered solid growth Now

The entire behind-the-scenes video was shot using iPhone 15 Apple says that this video was shot using over 40 iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max devices These devices were placed throughout the show itself and rehearsals including being strapped to performers themselves The behind-the-scenes video was directed by Mike Carson who said: “Choosing iPhone allowed me to have my dream amount of coverage which was necessary for a docu-style project like this because we had to be in so many places at once And since it is an all-in-one device and we didn’t use any external lenses we were able to have a multitude of angles and operators in spaces that would have proven to be both difficult and expensive given the sheer scale needed for this film While we had an incredibly talented crew I truly believe it also freed us up to be able to just shoot and focus on beautiful compositions camera movement and storytelling and it made shooting a lot more fun & exciting Being able to switch lenses instantly when the moment called for either more information or a more intimate close-up allowed our team to stay focused on their frames versus having to overthink especially in high-pressure “think quick on your feet” scenarios For example we embedded camera operators into the field cast/mosh pit of the live performance and our operators were able to literally have a camera a few feet away from guest talent’s face creating beautiful wide angle frames and 10 seconds later when action was happening on the main stage 50ft away we’re able to have a high-quality medium shot instantly” Carson also explained why the iPhone 15 Pro’s support for LOG and Pro Res recording was such a key factor for this project: “This was a game-changer especially with so many uncontrollable lighting scenarios given our docu-style approach We were able to retain so much visual information and data with the amount of dynamic range we had and Log was paramount in that I was blown away in the color session by the final image” Overall Carson concluded: “Overall it was great As a director who also likes to be hands-on I especially had fun being able to just pick up a camera and shoot without having to overthink about gear and I could focus on what was in my frame and the overall story and emotion I wanted to evoke The learning curve was small As someone who just loves creating regardless of scale or medium seeing the results of what we shot has definitely inspired me to pick up iPhone and just shoot so I’m excited to keep exploring the possibilities and embedding iPhone into my process” Xiaolong Liu director of photography for the behind-the-scenes video added: “iPhones are significantly more portable and discreet compared to traditional cameras allowing for shooting in a wider variety of locations and rigs with minimal setup The ability to swap between lenses (Wide Ultra Wide Telephoto) quickly without additional equipment is an efficient advantage for schedule-intensive shooting situations The unobtrusive nature of an iPhone can help capture more natural and spontaneous shots The size and flexibility of iPhone allows for capturing footage from unique angles and tight spaces where traditional cameras wouldn’t fit For example the throne shot of Usher and the piano shot of Alicia Keys” You can find the full 11-minute behind-the-scenes video below How long until we see an actual Super Bowl Halftime Show shot on iPhone?

its just checking the destination service for matching songs and compiling playlists using those matched songs Transferring playlists doesnt take long at all Once youve set the app up chosen your sources and picked which playlists you want to move across to Spotify from Apple Music the actual process of matching songs and creating new playlists on Spotify only takes a few minutes at most Thats because its not actually physically moving any music; its just checking the destination service for matching songs and compiling playlists using those matched songs Yes you can Thats the beauty of SongShift and other similar services You can link several different services and it supports a lot of popular music platforms You can transfer from Amazon Music Deezer Qobuz Tidal and YouTube Music (among others) Its a great way to consolidate all of your playlists from your different music streaming platforms onto a single platform You can also use SongShift to share your playlists with friends who dont have the same music streaming accounts as you For example if your friend is on Deezer just set up a free Deezer account and use SongShift to transfer your playlist from Spotify to Deezer You can then share that playlist with your friend Any Deezer playlists they share with you can quickly be converted into Spotify playlists using SongShift Yes you can although youll need a Pro subscription in order to do so With a free subscription you can still transfer multiple playlists you just have to do them one at a time If you only have a few playlists to transfer this isnt too onerous but if you have hundreds of playlists to transfer you might want to consider getting a Pro subscription There are a few different ways to transfer playlists so if SongShift doesnt suit youre not short on options Theres FreeYourMusic which has a user-friendly user interface and is probably the best one to use if you want a simpler process Soundiiz is a browser-based service which doesnt make you use an app so that you can transfer playlists from a desktop Theres one called Tune My Music too By subscribing you agree to our Privacy Policy and may receive occasional deal communications;

Best Stocks To Buy Before Recessions For a detailed overview of such stocks read our article 13 Best Stocks To Buy Before Recessions Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 134 Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of the best stocks to own during or before recessions as well as during market bull runs since Apple Inc’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) products have a strong demand which is expected to remain robust for decades to come Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is also a dividend payer with years of consistent payments and a strong growth track record Apple Vision Pro is the latest Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) product to create waves around the world Wedbush’s Dan Ives recently said he’s surprised to see a strong demand for the headset “While price points are clearly high at $3500 with a limited audience outside of developers out of the gates we are surprised at the early mass market appeal Vision Pro is sparking with a jaw dropper 600 apps (and counting) built for Vision Pro well above expectations” Ives said in a note He has a $250 price target on the stock Bireme Capital stated the following regarding Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter: “We also shorted Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) in Q3 At our average price of around $190 per share Apple traded at 30x peak earnings and a $28 trillion market cap While Apple is indeed a magnificent company this valuation is simply too rich for a business with a substantial cyclical component The company is projected to grow revenue at a mere 4% rate between 2022 and 2026 We think the total return on Apple stock will be lower than the market and especially our long positions over the next few years” Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 167 Visa Inc (NYSE:V) continues to thrive even during recession because Visa Inc (NYSE:V) is the backbone of a major chunk of financial transactions taking place in the world Visa Inc (NYSE:V) is also a dividend payer with 15 years of consistent dividend increases In its October 2023 investor letter Lakehouse Capital stated the following regarding Visa Inc (NYSE:V): “Visa Inc (NYSE:V) reported a strong result with net revenue increasing 11% year-on-year to $86 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share increasing by 21% to $233 As has been the case for many years now the scalable nature of the business allows for revenue growth to outpace its costs which places the company in a good position to navigate through this inflationary period The network continues to grow with credentials and merchant locations up 7% and 17% respectively Cross-border travel-related spend also maintained its robust growth increasing 26% year-on-year while Visa Direct reported 75 billion transactions up 19% yearon-year progressing on penetrating categories such as cross-border remittances Altogether we’re pleased with how the business is tracking and remain positive on Visa’s outlook” Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 221 Search YouTube Health Sciences Cloud AI Machine Learning The list of growth catalysts for Alphabet Inc Class A (NASDAQ:GOOGL) keeps increasing Many believe it is one of the undervalued stocks to buy for the long term as the market is still not appreciating Alphabet Inc Class A’s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) business expansion while the stock’s valuation also remains depressed amid fears that AI tools like Perplexity and ChatGPT might dent Alphabet Inc Class A’s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) search business But experts say such fears are overblown The FPA Crescent Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter: “Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) continued going from strength to strength during 2023 despite concerns that competition may infringe on the company’s dominant position in Search Thus far Alphabet has continued to hold its own and we look forward to seeing how the company incorporates further AI developments across the Alphabet ecosystem Lastly we are hopeful that the impending arrival of a new CFO will bring a renewed focus on efficiency – an area where we believe Alphabet has ample room for improvement” Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 286 Amazoncom Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) keeps thriving even during recessions since Amazoncom Inc’s (NASDAQ:AMZN)

Amazoncom Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) Salesforce and ServiceNow Amazon shares appreciated 88% in 2023 driven primarily by rapidly expanding operating profit margins and free cash flow growth After the pandemic Amazon experienced a period of inefficiency and overinvestment in its distribution and logistics infrastructure Amazon is now leveraging these investments as growth returned to its e-commerce business in 2023 after a highly unusual 2022 At the same time Amazon’s rapidly growing and high-margin advertising business is contributing strongly to the entire company’s operating profit growth The AWS (Amazon Web Services) cloud infrastructure and services business continued to slow in 2023 as customers anticipating a more difficult economic environment looked to save money on their cloud spend but these cloud spending optimizations began to stabilize in the second half of 2023 We now expect customer interest in generative AI will begin to contribute to growth” Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 306 Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is among the most popular stock among the elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey It is also the biggest holding of the Goldman Sachs’ Defensive Equity ETF What

Neither Apple nor Google allow users to skirt their app stores For example code driving someone to a website to purchase Fortnites in-game currency V-Bucks rather than in an app breaks the terms of service and will as happened to Fortnite result in removal from the store When Fortnite was removed Epic filed an antitrust lawsuit and lost But in a nearly identical case it defeated Google which resulted in a $700 million fine against the company Now Sweeney is back taking another swing at Apple after the companys recent decision to scrap web apps entirely in the EU The EU passed the Digital Markets Act (DMA) which Apple is using as an excuse to snub home screen web apps Users will no longer be able to download apps on their iPhones in the EU unless they are on the Apple App Store They will be able to open links to websites from their home screens just not stand-alone apps This is yet another blow to anyone trying to avoid the 30% fees Sweeney and other critics argue Apple’s latest policy update which effectively stifles the functionality of web apps by imposing stringent limitations will undermine the open nature of the web and restrict consumer choice Trending: This startup is accepting investors for as little as 25 cents – what’s the catch? The policy change comes at a time when the European Union is pushing for greater digital openness through initiatives like the DMA Critics including Sweeney argue that Apple’s move is not only antithetical to the spirit of the DMA but also represents a significant step back for digital innovation and accessibility in Europe Legal experts and industry watchers predict this latest conflict could lead to increased regulatory scrutiny of Apple’s practices in Europe and potentially beyond The European Commission has already shown a willingness to tackle what it sees as anti-competitive behavior by tech giants and Sweeney’s fight against Apple could catalyze further action Sweeney recently went to X to speak about Apples continued anti-competitive practices posting Apple needs to completely reset its relationships with regulators and developers on the foundation of enlightened lawful business practices as Microsoft did after the DOJ [Department of Justice] case They cant go on like this not as a self-respecting company thats honest with itself and the world As this saga unfolds the tech world watches closely recognizing that the outcome could have far-reaching implications for how digital markets operate how developers create and distribute apps and how consumers access digital content Sweeney’s crusade against Apple’s monopoly is more than a corporate skirmish; it’s a battle for the soul of the digital age Read Next: Harvard-founded AI startup is solving paywalls growing 5x yearly and looking for new shareholders This startup in the climate tech industry could unlock the riches flowing 30 feet above your head ACTIVE INVESTORS SECRET WEAPON Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 news & everything else trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!

court earlier this week dismissed a lawsuit claiming that the tech giant had illegally monopolized the US market for heart-monitoring apps for the Apple Watch The lawsuit filed by medical technology startup AliveCor comes amid years of legal tussle between the two companies centered around claims of antitrust and intellectual property infringement by Apple “AliveCor’s lawsuit challenged Apple’s ability to improve important capabilities of the Apple Watch that consumers and developers rely on and today’s outcome confirms that is not anticompetitive” Apple said in a statement provided to media outlets The details of the judgment made Tuesday remain sealed but a redacted version is expected to be made public in the coming weeks AliveCor said it plans to appeal the ruling saying in a

of Apple Watches in the US AliveCor claims that during a 2015 meeting its cofounder had with Apple executives to demonstrate AliveCor’s heart-monitoring device KardiaBand it was told Apple wanted to collaborate on the technology Apple countered that it has hosted hundreds of such meetings without promises of partnership According to the antitrust lawsuit Apple announced the heart health feature for its Apple Watch more than a year after the meeting and just hours after AliveCor informed them of the Kardiaband launch date The Apple Watch went on to dominate the market and according to AliveCor to effectively prevent third parties from offering competing heart-rate-monitoring apps on the device In 2020 medical technology company Masimo sued Apple for infringing on 10 of its patents including technology to measure blood oxygen levels and heart rate In December the ITC imposed a ban on the Series 9 and Ultra 2 models of the Apple Watch after finalizing its decision that the blood oxygen sensors in the devices did indeed infringe on patents owned by Masimo and its subsidiary Cercacor Laboratories That ban was paused after just one day on Dec 27 by a federal appeals court allowing the watches to go back on sale But the court decided to reinstate the ban in January—a move welcomed by Masimo “It affirms that even the largest and most powerful companies must respect the intellectual rights of American inventors and must deal with the consequences when they are caught infringing others’ patents” Joe Kiani Founder and CEO of Masimo said of the reinstated ban in a statement To get around the import ban Apple redesigned the Series 9 and Ultra 2 watches dropping blood oxygen features for the two models While the redesigned watches which have been on sale in the US since Jan 18 still include the blood-oxygen-monitoring sensor it has been made not functional pending an appeal Masimo has been feuding with Apple since 2013 when the latter hired an engineer who was previously the chief technical officer of Cercacor Laboratories followed by about 20 other ex-employees from Masimo Masimo accused Apple of poaching its staff to steal its patented technology It’s not just companies that are going up against Apple Individuals have also engaged in David vs Goliath-style legal battles with the tech giant In 2019 Apple was sued by Joseph Wiesel a New York cardiologist in a federal court alleging that the company used his patented monitoring toolto detect heartbeat irregularities A trial date has not been set yet for that case with the court granting Apple’s application for a stay of the proceedings in 2021 pending a decision from the US Patent and Trademark Office on Apple’s request for a reexamination And in a 2021 lawsuit not to do anything with cardio technology an app developer and former Pinterest engineer alleged that Apple had banned his app for a FlickType watch keyboard from the App Store but later allowed competing keyboard apps that ripped off the FlickType keyboard which led to the plummeting of FlickType’s revenue That lawsuit was settled with undisclosed terms in 2022 Contact us at letters@timecom"

I mean really can see like the investment Nadella makes in Microsoft versus how that stock-- what a great deal I guess the question for Apple though is what is their AI story? Youll hear rumors of this and whispers of this but what do you think is coming there? RAY WANG: Well the interesting thing is Apple has never explicitly had said they have an AI strategy but weve all experienced what an ambient experience looks like right? Take a photo the lighting is off Suddenly it looks better I mean weve done with gray sky pictures every picture now looks blue right? Its kind of crazy like that And so their AI is embedded in the background They have a lot of it already Its starting from the chip level all the way down to the user experience I think they just have to tell the story more if they want to tell that AI story JOSH LIPTON: You dont think theyre going to put time and effort and money into building out those capabilities? Maybe would you not expect maybe a bit some big announcement coming at the big software show in June? RAY WANG: Im not sure theyre going to have a Samsung the whole world is Galaxy AI kind of strategy that was announced at CES I think its been here all the time And I think people are going to see what it means to actually have AI that works versus hey were talking about AI JARED BLIKRE: Ray we were talking over the brink-- over the break and you mentioned that the CES has become an auto show a car show Lots to do in mobility and the advances for AI of course its integrated in every facet youve got to think But how does this roll out to the public? How does AI become I guess more a part of everyday internet of things objects as those become embedded in our lives? RAY WANG: Yeah so were seeing across a couple of fronts You saw it in energy management You saw it in the ability to help you as an assistant help anything from translation to be able to manage your day-to-day activities We see it in smart lighting and smart buildings Theyre actually adjusted to your needs Were seeing it in the health arena as people are quantifying their self and saying oh yeah is that a heart murmur or is that not a heart murmur? Wait am I allergic to this thing? Right so were starting to see that as augmenting humanity Over time what we may get to a point and thats probably 10 to 15 years out is there will be more situational awareness So right now its augmenting humanity In the future its how do we train the machines to get to the level of precision I want to get to And then at some point were going to get to that full automation that we all are dreaming of And remember the automation is the only other way you want it not the way someone else does JARED BLIKRE: The way Im dreaming of it right? Yes RAY WANG: Yes the way all were dreaming it JOSH LIPTON: And Ray I want to bring it back to Apple real quickly too because we do have earnings on deck coming up here pretty shortly Theres some kind of nervousness creeping into that story Weve seen a series of downgrades on the street Ray I think obviously some concern maybe from some quarters about weaker iPhone sales specifically in China What would you expect when they report? RAY WANG: So Im not sure because what weve seen over the last couple of quarters is declining revenues but profits are still increasing And thats because the services equation or the rationale is actually growing and service is a lot more profitable than putting out a piece of hardware So I would say that wed probably see those same kind of trends But we did supplier checks and suppliers arent like that nervous in the sense that theyre saying hey were going to see a decrease And its mostly because were still in a supercycle That supercycle thats going on is because weve got a lot probably 250 to 260 million more iPhones to move on to 5G and thats going to take you into the 15 and the 16 cycles Thats a lot of iPhones Plus we havent ramped up India yet So even if China shuts down and Chinas economy is really really bad right India is the one that theyre hoping to pick up Related Quotes"

Apples App Store Despite other investment analysts downgrading Apple Evercore is more positive and is maintaining a $220 stock price target because of the continued growth of the App Store Evercore has previously been positive on Apple because of what in 2020 it described as the firm benefiting from a confluence of strong iPhone 11 trends wearables momentum and continued services traction Now according to a new note seen by Apple-centric finance site Apple 30 Evercore is maintaining its existing price target but specifically because of its research into App Store growth For Q4 2023 Evercore says that Apples App Store grew by 10% — and also that revenues for solely the month of December were also up by 10% This follows a 9% growth rate for the month of November 2023 and Evercore says that there was a continued broad strength across all categories Significantly though gaming by itself grew 5% in December compared to a 3% growth the month before Evercore claims that gaming accounts for 54% of App Store revenue We think this sets up 2024 to also sustain positive growth writes its analysts Reportedly entertainment — which Evercore says chiefly concerns streaming — grew 17% over the year and 36% in the last two months Social media apps brought in 9% which is down from 12% the year before Evercore says that there are differences across the globe though Chinas App Store grew 10% while Japans fell 2% year over year The US App Store grew 7% year over year which is fractionally down on the year befores 8% growth Financial doom and gloom predicted for Apple These App Store growth reports paint a rosier picture for Apple than other analysts currently believe Given how significant the iPhone is to the company Barclays claim that the iPhone 16 will have no compelling new features saw the firms market share fall If correct the predictions of falling iPhone demand from other analysts could put a limit on the App Stores growth But analysts have previously also said that around 25% of Apples 12 billion users have not upgraded their iPhone in 4 years meaning that its likely significant numbers will upgrade at some point Perhaps users entirely new to the iPhone are likely to buy more apps than existing customers but the market remains large and perhaps especially so for key titles such as new games There are though other issues that could significantly alter how the App Store performs in the near future Future App Store issues Separately since October 2023 Chinas App Store has been affected by new laws that are likely to decrease the number of apps being added While Apple initially resisted the change it now requires new apps to show that the developer has a license from the Chinese government There may also be a change in App

software engineering Craig Federighi going so far as to blast Mac security in order to stress how important it is to keep the App Store a closed system The idea is that if iPhone users can buy apps from anywhere its unlikely that the apps will have gone through what Apple describes as its rigorous vetting system Others have said that in practice its easy to get a fraudulent apps through the official App Store review process However its still the case that Apple at least attempts to ensure that iPhone users are not subjected to malicious apps It remains to be seen though how many

Vacatures Foto: Apple; Mike Kemp/In Pictures via Getty Images; Alyssa Powell/BI The reviews are in and the tech press is lauding the Apple Vision Pro headset for delivering on the companys promises Its well-designed the video and sound are startlingly precise the Minority Report-style gestural interface is future-tastic Nobodys exactly sure what its for or whether even the Readiest Players One will spend $3500 on it but hey — thats gadgets for you Still this is a new gadget frontier The Vision Pro like the similarly kitted-out Quest 3 and Quest Pro headsets from Meta uses whats known as passthrough video — cameras and other sensors that capture imagery of the outside world and reproduce it inside the device They feed you a synthetic environment made to look like the real one with Apple apps and other non-real elements floating in front of it Apple and Meta are hoping that this virtual world will be so compelling that you wont just visit Theyre hoping youll live there That unfortunately could have some very weird and very messy consequences for the human brain Researchers have found that widespread long-term immersion in VR headsets could literally change the way we perceive the world — and each other We now have companies who are advocating that you spend many hours each day in them says Jeremy Bailenson director of the Virtual Human Interaction Lab at Stanford Youve got many many people and theyre wearing it for many many hours And everything magnifies at scale Meaning: Our brains are about to undergo a massive society-wide experiment that could rewire our sense of the world around us and make it even harder to agree on what constitutes reality The short-term side effects of virtual reality are well established People in synthetic environments tend to misjudge distance both at a distance and close up Thats no surprise: Even in the real three-dimensional universe our ability to determine how close or far away something is is subject to all kinds of external factors Virtual environments with their lower resolution and synthetic 3D make all that worse — which is especially bad if youre one of those users posting videos of yourself doing things like skateboarding and driving while wearing a mixed-reality headset You think your hands are in one place theyre actually in another and pretty soon youre driving your Honda Civic through a supermarket Objects in a headset can also get funhoused Thats called object distortion — things get warped and change size or shape or color especially when you move your head A video render cant compete with the processing speed and fidelity of your eyes and brain Apple Vision Pro Foto: Apple These are all as the IT people say known issues For a few minutes or an hour long enough to play a game or watch a movie theyre minor annoyances But wear perception-shifting glasses for days at a time — as Bailensons team of researchers did — and the problems get worse Way worse The team wore Vision Pros and Quests around college campuses for a couple of weeks trying to do all the things they would have done without them (with a minder nearby in case they tripped or walked into a wall) They experienced simulator sickness — nausea headaches dizziness That was weird given how experienced they all were with headsets of all kinds And they felt all the distance and distortion effects: thinking elevator buttons were farther from their fingers or experiencing difficulty bringing food to their mouths But as any of us would they adapted — their brains and muscles learned to compensate for their new view of the world That seems like a solution but it aint When people adapt to a perceptual change for long enough the real world starts to look wrong in the opposite direction If you wore glasses that turned your vision upside down lets say youd have to adapt again when the glasses came off The longer youre inside a funhouse world the longer the weird perceptual aftereffects last So people who spend their workday inside a Vision Pro might go home at night with a miscalibrated targeting system and what feels like a shroom hangover Heres where the passthrough video gets uniquely important Old-school cyberpunk envisioned virtual reality as an all-encompassing synthetic environment New-school techies meanwhile proposed an augmented reality of digital pop-ups floating on see-through lenses Google Glass-style But both of those approaches have limits Full sense-isolating VR hasnt progressed much further than niche entertainment while AR tends to make both its apps and the real world look bad From a visual standpoint passthrough is the least-worst solution — but its social consequences are scarier Because passthrough captures and then re-renders reality it can have an unnerving distancing effect over time When Bailensons colleagues actually tried to talk to people the world turned into a giant confusing Zoom Video chats as weve all experienced are plagued by delays in responses and missed social cues Conversations lose subtlety but its good enough for a meeting But passthrough magnifies the effect — the people you talk to start to seem unreal Up close they look like avatars Farther away they become just part of the background Bailenson describes the feeling as one of social absence Other people just arent fully there He doesnt put it this way but Ill wave the warning flag: Long-term use of passthrough headsets could make it easier to think of other people as unhumans — non-player characters in a gamified uncanny valley We all live in our own perceptual bubbles Every person has slightly different sensory thresholds — we see colors a little bit differently hear at different levels of acuity are more or less sensitive to different odors And we process all that with brains uniquely tuned first by our genes and then by a lifetime of neural changes of thinking and doing But in general we agree on some common ground Even if your blue looks a little different than mine we can agree on what color the sky is Maybe my tolerance for chili peppers is higher than yours but we both know when were eating them Headsets make the walls of those sensory bubbles even thicker and harder to bridge We already lack for common ground politically Now as millions of Americans wear VR headsets for hours at a time we may find ourselves unable to agree on our physical reality The headsets will put things into our visual world that arent there for anyone else The objects arent objective And thats not all These headsets can not only add things to the real world they can also delete them Bailenson says He first realized VRs strange editing function while he was playing a game on the Quest 3 that knocked out portions of the real walls around him and replaced them with a virtual scene Ive been doing VR and AR for a while he says and I had never in my life seen deletion work so well At first that seems pretty great Stuck on a crowded bus? Delete everyone and replace them with the first-class cabin of a jumbo jet Hate intrusive billboards? Replace all the commercial images with soothing vistas of your choosing But what happens when the technology gets good enough to delete say homeless people? Or Pride flags? You can see where Im going here — literal erasure When the sci-fi writer William Gibson came up with the concept of cyberspace he described it as a consensual hallucination This is the exact opposite — billions of discrete unshared hallucinations each one snowflake-special What were about to experience is using these headsets in public common ground disappears Bailenson says People will be in the same physical place experiencing simultaneous visually different versions of the world Were going to lose common ground Stipulated: Everyone always freaks out about new consumer technology and the freak-out is almost always the same The new form of sensory input will harm kids! Its a dangerous distraction! Its socially alienating! They said it about the iPhone about the Walkman … hell half a millennium ago they said it about the book New technologies arrive and we adapt And I dont need to lean hard on my nerdiness to imagine fun sci-fi uses for passthrough The real potential here is the ability to see the invisible informational metastructure of the world — translation overlays; pop-up tags that display peoples names and pronouns and where you know them from; walking directions; user-manual-linked X-ray vision for assembling an Ikea coffee table Link my shopping list to the aisles I need to visit in the supermarket Maybe even expand my vision beyond what my meatbag eyes can do and let me see into the ultraviolet or perceive electrical fields Passthrough has limits but it might also have superpowers Like me Bailenson isnt a freaker-outer; he loves VR and thinks the new headsets are keen He knows that over time screens will get better resolution and faster rendering New algorithms will minimize distortion Its not the technology hes worried about Its how much were going to become immersed in it The worlds going to be just fine he says People adapt to media These headsets are incredible But philosophically I do not believe we need to be wearing these headsets for hours every day Weve been here before — and very recently at that A decade or so ago no one paused to consider the unintended consequences of thrusting millions of people into impossible-to-moderate social networks And we all know how that turned out Now were on the verge of sticking millions of people into helmets that give us all our own editable realities Thats why the kind of research that Bailenson is conducting on passthrough headsets is so important Im encouraging all scholars to act with some urgency to understand them he says In the meantime while hes doing his work maybe dont forget to take that Vision Pro off once in a while The longer you keep it on the more youre turning yourself into a human guinea pig — one with really really bad depth perception Adam Rogers is a senior correspondent at Business Insider India koopt steeds meer Amerikaanse olie en juist minder Russische olie nu de sancties op Rusla Voor de populaire rentevaste periode van 10 jaar kunnen de verschillen tussen de hoogste en laags Beursexperts Gökhan Erem en Michael Nabarro laten zien waar je de komende week op moet letten als Volgens het ministerie van Defensie is het wapen erg accuraat en goedkoop Het kost slechts 12 eu De oorlog heeft het tekort aan arbeidskrachten in Rusland verergerd wat de wapenproductie parten Door zelf pensioen op te bouwen kun je meestal meer belastingvoordeel behalen dan je zou denken De oorlog in Oekraïne heeft de druk verhoogd op Europa om veel meer te investeren in de productie Veel andere luchtvaartmaatschappijen hebben de kerosine slurpende gigantische Airbus A380 dubbel Het tempo waarmee China zijn leger opbouwt is sinds de Tweede Wereldoorlog niet meer gezien zegt Omdat de EU weinig graan uit Rusland importeert zou er geen gevaar zijn voor hogere prijzen van Bekijk alle vacatures → Door zelf pensioen op te bouwen kun je meestal meer belastingvoordeel behalen dan je zou denken De oorlog in Oekraïne heeft de druk verhoogd op Europa om veel meer te investeren in de productie Veel andere luchtvaartmaatschappijen hebben de kerosine slurpende gigantische Airbus A380 dubbel Het tempo waarmee China zijn leger opbouwt is sinds de Tweede Wereldoorlog niet meer gezien zegt Omdat de EU weinig graan uit Rusland importeert zou er geen gevaar zijn voor hogere prijzen van The FBI told Alaska Airlines blowout passengers they might be victims of a crime per The Seattle Copyright © 2024 Business Insider Nederland Alle rechten voorbehouden Registratie of gebruik van deze site vindt plaats onder Algemene Voorwaarden en Privacybeleid Algemene voorwaarden Privacybeleid Cookie-overzicht Adverteren Vacatures"
511,"Apple Amazon Microsoft Meta and Nvidia are part of Zacks Earnings Preview","2/12/2024","https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-amazon-microsoft-meta-nvidia-110000505.html","Chicago IL – February 12 2024 – Zackscom releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises This week’s list includes Apple AAPL Amazon AMZN Microsoft MSFT Meta META and Nvidia NVDA The overall picture that has emerged from the Q4 earnings season is one of stability and resilience as a whole with key pockets starting to enjoy notable acceleration regarding growth momentum Earnings aren’t great but then again no one expected corporate profitability to be great The earnings naysayers have been relatively less vocal in their doom-and-gloom pronouncements lately But the fear of an impending earnings cliff has been in the back of market participants’ minds These results have likely eased many of those fears With quarterly results from about two-thirds of S&P 500 members already out through Friday February 9th here are the five key features these quarterly results have confirmed First the Q4 earnings and revenue growth pace represents an acceleration from what we have been seeing in recent quarters The absolute level of Q4 earnings and revenue growth isn’t much and the improving trend may not seem like a big deal to some of you But we nevertheless see this improving growth trend as significant and a sign of the things to come in the coming periods For the 338 S&P 500 members that have reported results through Friday February 9th total earnings and revenues are up +55% and +37% from the same period last year respectively Concerning the beats percentages 805% of the companies have beaten EPS estimates and 65% have beaten revenue estimates Second companies are making good progress on the margins front The year-over-year change in net margins turned positive in 2023 Q3 after staying in negative territory for six consecutive quarters This margins recovery is a key driver of earnings growth in the coming periods At the sector level Q4 net margins are above the year level for 9 of the 16 sectors with the biggest gains at Tech Consumer Discretionary Retail Industrial Products Utilities Finance and others On the negative side Q4 margins are below the year-earlier level for 7 of the 16 Zacks sectors with the biggest declines at the Medical Autos Energy and Transportation sectors Third the Tech sector is firmly back in the growth mode now and the trend is expected to continue going forward For the 645% of Tech companies in the S&P 500 index that have reported Q4 results already total earnings are up +215% on +64% higher revenues with 86% beating EPS estimates and 72% beating revenue estimates Looking at Q4 results for the sector as a whole combining the results that have come out with estimates for the still-to-come companies total Tech sector earnings are on track to be up +254% from the same period last year on +81% higher revenues The sector went through a period of post-Covid adjustment in 2022 and the first half of 2023 when it became a drag on the aggregate growth picture Please remember that Tech isn’t just any other sector as it’s the biggest earnings contributor to the S&P 500 index The sector is currently expected to bring in 285% of the index’s total earnings over the coming four-quarter period with the second and third biggest contributors in Finance and Medical at 177% and 125% respectively What this means is that the Tech sector’s growth profile has a significant impact on the aggregate picture both negative as well as positive The Tech sector dragged down the aggregate growth picture in 2022 and the first half of 2023 now appearing ready to resume its historical positive growth role Please note that the Tech sector is instrumental in keeping the aggregate growth picture in positive territory in Q4 Of the reported results the +55% earnings growth drops to a decline of -07% when Technology is excluded from the results Fourth related to the Tech sector’s strong showing is the dominance of the so-called Magnificent 7 companies – Apple Amazon Google parent Alphabet Microsoft Meta Nvidia and Tesla Each of the Mag 7 companies relies on technological innovation to dominate its respective space But strictly speaking not all of them are in the Tech sector as we at Zacks have Amazon as part of the Zacks Retail sector and Tesla as part of the Zacks Auto sector Nvidia will report its Q4 results on February 21st but the rest of the Mag 7 members have already reported results For Q4 as a whole for the group combining the actuals that have come out for the six group members with estimates for Nvidia total Mag 7 earnings are expected to be up +487% on +145% higher revenues The Mag 7 companies are expected to bring in 20% of all S&P 500 earnings in 2024 and currently account for 295% of the index’s total market capitalization Please note that S&P 500 earnings growth for Q4 would be in negative territory had it not been for the heavy lifting from Mag 7: -3% vs +54% Five the revisions trend has notably stabilized after appearing to turn substantially negative at the start of 2023 Q4 Estimates for 2024 Q1 and full-year 2024 are modestly coming down with negative revisions from some sectors mostly getting offset by positive revisions from others For a detailed look at the overall earnings picture

Wouldnt a nice gift be a Vision Pro? Another pondered But not a Vision Pro? The disparity between the gift and the products high price point starting at around $3500 further fueled the controversy With the Vision Pro already in high demand some anticipated that employees would receive the actual device as a token of appreciation for their hard work and dedication Instead Apple opted to offer employees a 25% discount on the Vision Pro should they choose to purchase one While this discount may alleviate some disappointment it still falls short of the expectations set by the companys reputation for lavish rewards and recognition Similarly HR Grapevine recently reported on a case in which beauty retail giant Sephora recently achieved a significant financial milestone by reaching $10billion in revenue in North America for the fiscal year 2023 however chose to thank staff for their hard work with cookies Following the unprecedented financial success Sephora reportedly distributed packages containing individually wrapped cookies adorned with the company logo accompanied by a note expressing appreciation for the hard work of its employees The company stated that it was “thrilled” that it reached $10billion in sales claiming that “multiple Sephora records were shattered” and it couldn’t be reached without “the dedication and efforts of all employees” However whilst the company’s intention may have been to say thank you many staff instead deemed the move to be underwhelming “Ten BILLIONand they give us stale cookies” wrote one unnamed staff member Both cases highlight the importance of meaningful recognition and rewards in fostering employee satisfaction and wellbeing and the likelihood that underwhelming recognition efforts will be called out publicly Employees in 2024 aren’t afraid to speak up when they feel that their organization isn’t truly appreciating their efforts and in the age of social media news around lacklustre employee recognition spreads like wildfire As the Vision Pro continues to capture the imagination of consumers and tech enthusiasts alike Apple may find itself revisiting its approach to recognizing the contributions of its employees in future product launches Ensuring that employees feel valued and appreciated remains essential for fostering a culture of excellence and driving exemplary culture This is the last preview available to you for 30 days To access more news features columns and opinions every day create a free myGrapevine account Your privacy matters to us and we will never collect personal information without your consent You can manage your cookie preferences for your devices at any time For more information please read our Privacy and Cookie Policy By clicking Accept All or continuing to use our site you consent to the use of all cookies Thank you for trusting us with your online experience If you would rather just accept Essential Only cookies the site performance will not be affected"

better value and the better product period While its obvious Zuckerberg would promote his companys product his decision to post a video about the differences between the Quest 3 and Vision Pro shows the increasing competition between Apple and Meta Both companies are trying to sell consumers on the benefit of mixed-reality headsets that overlay digital content over the real world or provide immersive virtual reality experiences Meta has taken a lower-cost approach while Apple has focused on sharper screens more powerful processors and higher-end materials Zuckerberg in the video posted Tuesday said he thinks the Quest headset is a lot more comfortable its immersive content library is deeper its field of view is wider its hand tracking is more accurate and its screen is brighter compared with the Vision Pro However he noted that Apples screen has a higher resolution and that its eye tracking is really nice It seems like there are a lot of people who just assumed that Vision Pro would be higher quality because its Apple and it costs $3000 more but honestly Im pretty surprised that Quest is so much better for the vast majority of things that people use these headsets for with that price differential Zuckerberg said Apple officially launched its Vision Pro in the US on Feb 2 The $3500 headset is the first new product category the company has released since the Apple Watch in 2015 At an event to celebrate the launch in New York Apple CEO Tim Cook told CNBCs Jim Cramer that the headset is tomorrows technology today Meta introduced its Quest 3 headset in September

“2nd Trillion-Dollar AI Trade” The US govt just unlocked an $8 trillion market to move in a new direction See how it could unleash 6000% potential upside Apple AB InBev and Johnson & Johnson may be the blue-chip stocks you have been looking to buy and hold to add that extra stability to your portfolio Advertisement Source: Shutterstock Blue-chip stocks refer to stocks of large well-established companies with a reputation for high-quality reliable investments They tend to be industry leaders in their sectors and have a large market capitalization in the billions of dollars This led us to create our list of blue-chip stocks to buy and hold for the long haul The precise definition of blue-chip stocks can be subjective though However blue-chip companies can offer general stability through consistent steady performance without witnessing dramatic fluctuations in their share prices They are overall better candidates to buy and hold for the long haulThis makes blue-chip stocks ideal for investment strategies seeking to balance portfolios and mitigate volatility It may be more pertinent to buy and hold now This is especially true as the Federal Reserve (Fed) estimates a 61% recession probability within the next 12 monthsWhether looking to diversify a portfolio strive for stability or simply have the appetite to avoid turbulence in light of the upcoming national elections the following three blue-chip stocks represent an opportunity for steady returns in the long haul They are well-suited as long-term blue-chip stocks to buy and hold: The world’s most profitable company Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) enjoys a history of sustained growth and expectations for continued expansion going forward Don’t just take our word for it This was said by renowned investor Warren Buffett It should be noted that he did modestly downsize his stake in the company recently While shares retreated somewhat on disappointing sales from the Chinese market Apple’s strong brand and financial position imply further potential Nonetheless Apple’s sales in China rebounded to more than $70 billion in 2021 and 2022 following covid Accounting for around 20% of AAPL’s sales China will remain critical for the company’s revenue and success At a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 286x below the technology sector average of 316 times The company boasts a market cap of 28 trillion and has beaten all analysts’ quarterly EPS expectations in 2023 Apple also offers a marginal dividend yield of 052% Brewers are known for resisting economic downturns This makes AB InBev (NYSE:BUD) an exciting choice for investors looking for long-term blue-chip stocks to buy and hold As the largest in the United States and globally AB InBev benefits from global consumer demand in the context of investment hedge even during economic turbulence The company involved themselves in a marketing controversy last year through its flagship Bud Light but has since normalized leaving an opportunity for further shareholder gains However potential March strikes may put the stock in a better position to consider buying should BUD fail to negotiate contract terms with Teamsters successfully At a P/E ratio of 203x below the industry average of 255 times AB InBev also offers a forward dividend of 13% Like AAPL the company has also beaten all quarterly analysts’ EPS estimates in 2023 Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is widely recognized as a leading global healthcare company Having recently spun off its consumer products division in 2023 into Kenvue (NYSE:KVUE) in a deal involving $36 billion JNJ can now focus its efforts on the healthcare sector Specifically it can channel its expertise and resources into medical devices diagnostics and pharmaceutical research and development Moreover JNJ’s product pipeline contains more than 90 additional drug candidates currently progressing through clinical trials In addition to numerous well-known medications JNJ’s diversification and financial strength support its 30x P/E ratio The company also offers shareholders a healthy dividend yield of 31% representing another opportunity for a long-term blue-chip stock to buy and hold​ On the date of

And how did it lead to the scam? Let’s take a closer look: Iran’s ban on iPhones According to Iran Times Supreme Leader Ali Khamenehi in September 2020 had citing the country’s finances demanded a ban on excessive imports of luxury products including a phone manufactured in the United States Iran on 20 February 2023 banned iPhone 14 imports for an ‘indefinite period’ according to AzerNewsaz Iran’s Ministry of Industry Mine and Trade in a letter to the Islamic Republic of Iran Customs Administration (IRICA) said “iPhone 14 and higher model mobile phones will no longer be registered in Iran and related instructions will be announced at the crossing points of the country” The letter said these models were removed from the list of permitted devices that can be brought into Iran by citizens and via mail According to Iran Times the government banned the iPhone to halt the exodus of money from Iran Iran had imported $23 billion worth of phones from 21 March 2022 to 20 January 2023 Of these iPhones made up around a third of cellphone imports According to Al Jazeera the ban was expanded this year to include the iPhone 15 and all its models But the ban didn’t even work IranWirecom quoted the country’s Association of Mobile Phone Importers in August 2023 as estimating that since the ban 120000 iPhone 14 units worth $150 million had been illegally imported The letter addressed to First Vice President Mohammad Mokhber stated that the iPhone 14 “does not possess any unique features such as satellite communication capabilities that would justify its inclusion in the list of prohibited imports” The association told the government not to depend on a ban to regulate the flow of iPhone 14s It said technological developments lets unsavoury persons bypass the ban The association concluded that the ban on iPhone 14 imports deprives the government from high tax revenues and causes significant economic harm to legitimate importers According to Al Jazeera iPhones remain ubiquitous at shops across the country The basic version of the iPhone 13 Pro is available for $2300 (Rs 190 lakh) at shops in Tehran Repacked and refurbished versions of the iPhone 13 Pro are available for $1150 (Rs 95000) Outside Tehran the phone is being sold for around $800 (Rs 66000) The scam Enter the Kourosh Company According to Al Jazeera the firm called itself Iran’s “largest phone repair company It promised consumers iPhones for around $360 (Rs 29000) or less It promised to deliver the phones ‘in weeks’ The company got people to fork over $35 million (Rs 2661347500 crore) in just a few months The Tasnim news agency identified 27-year-old Amirhossein Sharifian as the brains behind the scheme The company launched a huge advertising blitz backed by a number of high-profile celebrities including actors footballers and influencers to sell the scam to the public Among these figures are national football team goalkeeper Alireza Beyranvand and actor Akbar Abdi “Unfortunately some renowned and recognised figures advertised for this company during its operation whose charges will also be followed up on” Hossein Rahimi a senior police official was quoted as saying by Al Jazeera While Sharifian has reportedly fled to Turkey one person from the company has been arrested and two more are wanted The old adage is true – if an offer seems too good to resist it probably is With inputs from agencies Find us on YouTube is on YouTube Copyright @ 2024 Firstpost - All Rights Reserved"

full force this weekend Sorry the other one Saturday marks the beginning of Apple’s second year of streaming Major League Soccer matches a decade-long $25 billion deal that’s part of an ambitious effort to attract more fans and money to the 28-year-old league which has long struggled for relevancy in the shadows of other North American sports A centerpiece of that plan is “MLS Season Pass” a sleekly designed streaming package that ditches the fragmentation other sports suffer from and lets fans stream globally every game — without blackouts — in the Apple TV app The package costs $1499 per month or $99 for the season and slightly less ($1299 per month or $79 for the year) for existing Apple TV+ subscribers Besides every regular season game it also includes the playoffs and final plus the Leagues Cup and lower-level MLS Next Pro and MLS Next matches “We’re creating something new” Sacha Kljestan a former MLS player and now a broadcast personality told CNN “Something from nothing that I think 10 years from now people will look back and this might be a game changer in modern television media” Kljestan co-hosts “MLS 360” which airs at 7:30 pm ET on Saturdays when a majority of the weekly MLS slate is played Think of “360” as “NFL RedZone” for soccer junkies with lead anchor Kevin Egan analyst Andrew Wiebe and former soccer players Kaylyn Kyle and Bradley Wright-Phillips whipping viewers around as many as 10 games simultaneously happening showing highlights and providing analysis Similar to how NBC or CBS treats the NFL Apple streams pregame and postgame coverage programs expanded to an hour this year with the latter now beginning at a consistent time (12:30 am ET mostly following the finish of the Saturday games) Also new this season is a Spanish-language version of “360” airing at the same time as the English-language edition The glossy studio shows with sleek graphics and coverage changes to make games easier to find﻿ and watch especially compared to previous MLS coverage deals when games were shown on a hodgepodge of TV networks and local affiliates have worked “Once people tuned into the product they were watching longer than our linear versions in past years” Camilo Durana executive vice president of MLS’ Apple partnership properties and events told CNN “We know that consumers have responded well to the high-quality production and the care we’ve taken with Apple to produce something that looks the part feels premium and is produced in the best possible way” he added A small number of matches are still shown on broadcast networks like FOX in the US and TSN and French-language RDS in Canada with their own commentators Under the Apple deal games are no longer shown on local broadcast partners Apple is also helping the MLS expand its presence in other products it owns practically making soccer impossible to escape On Wednesday Apple released a new Sports app that shows live MLS scores and pushes people to watch them on “MLS Season Pass” on the Apple TV app (It was likely not a coincidence that it rolled out the same day that soccer superstar Lionel Messi made his first full-season debut for Inter Miami that streamed exclusively on Apple TV) MLS content will also be shown in Apple News Maps and Music apps plus the matches can be watched on the new $3499 Vision Pro headset The league also released team-branded Beats by Dre (also owned by Apple) headphones this year with player-curated playlists streaming on where else Apple Music The idea according to Durana are “more expansive integrations within Apple’s ecosystem of products and services to just make the experience better” thus satisfying existing fans and ideally attracting new ones to the MLS Of course all of this promotion is meaningless if no one is watching or paying Apple doesn’t release viewership or subscriber numbers Sports Business Journal recently reported that the package has “surpassed” two million subscribers however it’s unclear how many are actually paying for it since the service was made free to T-Mobile subscribers and MLS season ticket holders Durana also didn’t reveal any numbers but said the company saw a “massive and very strong wave of subscribers mid-year” in 2023 after Messi signed with Inter Miami That matches a third-party report from analytics firm Antenna showing that “MLS Season Pass” was getting 6000 new signups a day before Messi arrived but soared to 110000 signups a day after he signed Antenna said that the “Messi Effect” on a year-old streaming package was “unique and profound” Even if the actual viewership is low the $250 million yearly cost for Apple is a practically a “rounding error” for a company worth about $3 trillion It’s also a “good investment because it’s another sticky offering to pull people into its ecosystem” Santosh Rao partner and head of research for Manhattan Venture Partners told CNN Soccer’s global popularity and the young demographic MLS predominately attracts makes the “whole deal a success” even if its US ratings he admitted doesn’t reach the levels of other leagues like the NFL or NBA “There’s nothing like live sports It’s the best thing you can offer” Rao said Most stock quote data provided by BATS US market indices are shown in real time except for the S&P 500 which is refreshed every two minutes All times

GIL LURIA: Well the first thing it does is it changes perceptions about Apples ability to innovate We havent had a new product category in a while and this is a very big new innovation It will change how we do computing Spatial computing is very different than how we do it now how we interact with applications how we would view what were seeing where the battery is where the display is So its Apple taking us way out into the future For now at a price point that most folks cant afford but will give at least some people a perspective on where things are headed especially so developers can develop the new applications and tools that are more appropriate for spatial computing JARED BILKRE: Gil maybe Im just reading into this personally but I see the pictures with Tim Cook and the new headset on He doesnt look the happiest And you know I go back Jony Ive was really never into AR and VR Im not sure he would have endorsed this In fact he left Apple before this was really developed Im just wondering if theres something there If you think people inside Apple are really gung-ho about this GIL LURIA: Well again the point is this isnt what were going to have on our head in five years Nobody is going to have this heavy clunky device that has an external battery and weighs a pound and has multiple straps that needs to be adjusted Thats not what its going to look like in five years In five years its just going to be glasses Were just going to have glasses that we can see our surroundings we can see multiple screens and multiple applications at once and thats how were going to use this device Its not going to look like the big ski goggles that they are today JULIE HYMAN: Gil can we assume even as this spatial computing innovation is happening that like the iPhone is kind innovated out right? Its got like the-- are we going to see any more leaps of innovation in smartphones or with the existing technologies of pretty much as far as its going to go? GIL LURIA: Well I think theres a few more opportunities for innovation So phones can still get lighter thinner maybe transparent some other handset makers make them foldable But what would really look out for is Apple is going to introduce new generative AI capabilities most likely in the June WWDC event and they might tie it to the next iPhone cycle So they may make the iPhone 16 be the only handset that can run these types of applications And if thats the case well have a major upgrade cycle The last time we had a major upgrade cycle was the iPhone 12 that was the first phone that was capable of getting on a 5G network If they make a phone thats the first and only phone that can operate something that consumers want such as generative capabilities that may drive another upgrade cycle JARED BILKRE: Ive got to ask you about China because that has been a sore spot not only for Apple but for the entire exporting world for that matter What do you think the future is for Apple specifically in China? GIL LURIA: We have very little visibility the outlook is murky because theres so many factors that contribute to performance in China First and foremost the Chinese consumer the economy there is weak the markets weak the real estate markets weak the sources of wealth are dissipating for that high end Chinese consumer Then you have-- its the most competitive handset market with a local incumbent that is very price competitive but also has some rich features that theyre introducing And then finally you have the government deciding how protectionist they want to be Theres reports out of China that theyre not allowing government backed agencies for people that work in those types of agencies to have iPhones Possibly as a retaliation around our measures in limiting AI chips Possibly as part of a bigger political statement Either way those are things that are going to be very hard for Apple to predict Its going to continue to be in that market In fact they had the highest share in China last year still with all of this but its going to be very hard to predict whats going to happen to that going forward JULIE HYMAN: Gil you mentioned AI in passing right? And Tim Cook sort of teased that something is coming from the company on the AI front I mean Apple does tend to leak a little bit Maybe well get a little more insight into what it might be But I mean do you have any theories? And I guess three-part question Do you have any theories? When do you think well learn more? And what is that going to do for Apple? GIL LURIA: Well so its usually not Apple thats leaking its their-- they have such a broad supply chain that just-- that somebody somewhere a vendor of Apples is usually the person whos leaking it Apple actually tries really hard not to front run its product just so-- because theres so much speculation And thats what theyre doing here All we know for now is that there are uses of AI already When we use our text to-- and they autocomplete a text thats the use of AI You could expect that to expand from there But based on the resources they have and the attention theyre focused on and how important it is for their future I would expect some things that were not thinking about yet to come out later this year to make the experience better to help us summarize experiences pre-populate messages and possibly help more with translation either to language or to programming or to application maneuvering Theres a lot of things they can do And again they have so many resources so many smart people working in Cupertino that I would expect them to do something that will impress us JULIE HYMAN: Gil thanks so much Appreciate it GIL LURIA: Thank you Related Quotes"
532,"Apple’s Phil Schiller Warns of Privacy Risks with Third-Party App Marketplaces in EU","2/4/2024","https://www.mymobileindia.com/apple-third-party-app-marketplaces-eu-risks/","Apple Fellow Phil Schiller has raised concerns over the security and privacy implications for iPhone users in the EU as Apple prepares to comply with the EU Digital Markets Act by introducing third-party app marketplaces Starting in March 2024 with the iOS 174 update this legislative requirement will allow sideloading and alternative digital storefronts alongside the existing App Store in EU member states While this opens up new avenues for developers it also presents significant risks to end users The “walled garden” approach of Apple has traditionally safeguarded users against malicious software with the App Store’s rigorous review process rejecting nearly 17 million app submissions in 2022 alone due to privacy security and content standard failures The introduction of third-party storefronts however introduces a potential pathway for harmful apps to be installed on iPhones circumventing the stringent security measures Apple has in place In response to these regulatory changes Apple has been proactive in implementing security mechanisms to mitigate risks including the notarization of all apps which ensures they are secure and non-malicious before installation regardless of the originating app store Schiller highlighted Apple’s efforts in engineering over 600 new APIs to support developers in creating secure marketplaces and installing apps emphasizing user control throughout the process Additionally an information sheet will be provided to users prior to app installation offering basic details about the app and enhancing marketplace selection control Despite these measures Schiller acknowledges that Apple’s ability to protect users is not absolute especially concerning the content of apps from alternative storefronts Notarization focuses on security rather than content leaving the door open for apps that Apple would typically restrict due to objectionable content The onus will be on these third-party marketplaces to establish their own rules and limitations which may not necessarily align with Apple’s established standards aimed at protecting users and families from inappropriate content In an interview with Fast Company’s Michael Grothaus published today Apple’s former marketing chief and current App Store head Phil Schiller said there are privacy and security risks associated with these alternative app marketplaces: “These new regulations while they bring new options for developers also bring new risks There’s no getting around that So we’re doing everything we can to minimize those risks for everyone” Schiller told me in a recent discussion about the privacy and security impact of the European Commission’s Digital Markets Act Another risk is that the App Store’s strict rules surrounding objectionable content might not extend to alternative app marketplaces according to Schiller: “We have dealt with a lot of input from families from governments on things that we need to do to try to either not allow certain kinds of objectionable content on our App Store or give users control over that experience to decide what’s best for themselves—and we have rules around that” Schiller says “Those rules will not apply in another marketplace unless they choose to make rules of their own [with] whatever criteria they come up with Does that increase the risk of users and families running into objectionable content or other experiences? Yes it does” Schiller’s comments reiterate many of the risks that Apple outlined on its website: If not properly managed alternative distribution poses increased privacy safety and security risks for users and developers This includes risks from installing software from unknown developers that are not subject to the Apple Developer Program requirements installing software that compromises system integrity with malware or other malicious code the distribution of pirated software exposure to illicit objectionable and harmful content due to lower content and moderation standards and increased risks of scams fraud and abuse Apple has less ability to address these risks and to support and refund customers regarding these issues Even with safeguards many of these risks remain Due to the EU Digital Markets Act Apple will allow sideloading and third-party digital storefronts alongside the existing App Store in EU member states starting with the iOS 174 update in March 2024 Apple’s “walled garden” approach including a rigorous review process has protected users by rejecting nearly 17 million app submissions in 2022 for failing to meet privacy security and content standards App notarization is a security measure implemented by Apple to ensure all apps regardless of their source are secure and non-malicious before being installed on an iPhone as part of Apple’s effort to mitigate risks from third-party app marketplaces While Apple can secure apps through notarization it does not control the content of apps from third-party storefronts This means apps that Apple would typically restrict could be available through alternative marketplaces Apple is complying with the European Union’s Digital Markets Act by allowing third-party app downloads and offering developer consultations to navigate these changes effectively ensuring a smooth transition for app distribution and payments in the EU Developers can request 30-minute online or in-person consultations with Apple’s team to discuss changes impacting iOS Safari and the App Store in the EU including alternative distribution and payment methods Apple reported a revenue of $11958 billion in Fiscal Q1 2024 surpassing analyst expectations and indicating strong sales across iPhone Services and other product lines despite slight shortfalls in Mac and iPad revenues The EU accounts for approximately 7% of Apple’s global App Store revenue Despite the small percentage the recent regulatory changes pose new challenges and opportunities for Apple in the European market While Apple CEO Tim Cook acknowledges the challenges posed by the DMA compliance the company remains focused on preserving its ecosystem’s privacy security and usability The full impact on financial performance remains to be seen in future quarters Apple announced plans to allow third-party app stores in Europe including a “Core Technology Fee” for apps sold outside its App Store and a €1000000 letter of credit requirement for opening an app store Critics including Spotify’s CEO argue that Apple’s new policy imposes high financial burdens on developers especially smaller ones potentially stifling innovation and diversity in the app market Spotify CEO Daniel Ek criticized Apple’s policy in a blog post calling it “extortion” due to the combination of the per-install fee and restrictions on in-app payments The requirement of a €1M letter of credit and per-install fees pose significant financial challenges for smaller developers potentially excluding them from establishing their own app stores Apple’s approach to DMA compliance is expected to lead to legal challenges with accusations that the company is making it difficult and costly to leave its App Store Also Read: EU’s DMA Pushing Apple to Enable App Sideloading on iPhones Also Read: Apple Announces iOS Safari and App Store Changes in EU to Comply with DMA Also Read: Apple Faces Criticism Over New Third-Party App Store Policy in Europe Also Read: Apple Adapts to EU Digital Markets Act with Developer Consultations and Q1 Earnings Success My Mobile has always believed in well researched in-depth truthful and relevant content which has evolved with time and produced by the very best of well informed journalists It has always been our endeavour to provide tremendous value to both readers and advertisers with our relevance and reach Copyright © 2023 All Right Reserved My Mobile India"

Lets take a fresh look at both tech giants to find out Image source: Getty Images Apples stock declined 4% over the past three months as its critics lamented its sluggish iPhone sales and lack of near-term catalysts It still generated more than half of its revenue from the iPhone in fiscal 2023 (which ended last September) but its handset sales declined 2% during the year as the 5G upgrade cycle ended Chinas sluggish economy recovery and fierce currency headwinds exacerbated that pressure Apples Mac sales also continued to slip in a post-pandemic market as fewer consumers upgraded their laptops and desktops As a result Apples revenue dipped 3% and its earnings per share stayed nearly flat for the full year Analysts expect Apples revenue and earnings to grow 4% and 8% respectively in fiscal 2024 as it laps that slowdown and the macro environment improves The expansion of its services ecosystem which already hosts more than 1 billion paid subscriptions could also amplify that recovery Moreover the launch of its Vision Pro headset could gradually diversify its hardware business -- even if its $3500 price tag limits its early adoption to affluent tech enthusiasts Apples business remains broadly stable while its $162 billion in cash and marketable securities gives it plenty of room to expand through investments and acquisitions However the lack of big near-term catalysts -- along with its stretched-forward price-to-earnings ratio of 28 -- are limiting its gains as the bulls rush toward more exciting growth plays Meanwhile Microsofts stock rose 19% over the past three months as it impressed the market with the growth of its cloud business the expansion of its artificial intelligence (AI) ecosystem and its takeover of Activision Blizzard Microsoft owns Azure the worlds second-largest cloud infrastructure platform after Amazon Web Services (AWS) Azure notably grew at a much faster rate than AWS in its latest quarter and its year-over-year revenue growth actually accelerated as AWS revenue growth merely stabilized from its previous quarter Microsoft attributed that acceleration to the integration of OpenAIs AI tools into Azure and its other cloud services Microsoft is also the top investor in OpenAI the creator of ChatGPT making the Windows company one of the easiest ways to invest in the AI market Microsofts acquisition of Activision Blizzard should strengthen its Xbox business add more games to its Game Pass and Cloud Gaming libraries and ensure that it keeps pace with Sony and Nintendo in the console race Simply put the expansion of Microsofts cloud AI and gaming businesses are offsetting the slower growth of its PC-oriented businesses and made it a more exciting investment than Apple Microsofts revenue and adjusted EPS both grew 7% in fiscal 2023 (which ended last June) even as it faced tough currency headwinds and slower enterprise spending in this challenging macro environment Analysts expect its revenue and adjusted EPS to both grow 15% in fiscal 2024 At 35 times forward earnings Microsofts shares might seem a bit pricier than Apples Nevertheless its stronger growth and exposure to the AI market might easily justify that higher valuation Looking further ahead analysts expect Apples revenue and earnings to grow 6% and 8% respectively in fiscal 2025 They expect Microsofts revenue and earnings to both rise by another 15% in fiscal 2025 Investors should take those estimates with a grain of salt but Apple needs to prove it can expand beyond the iPhone -- while Microsoft could continue to dazzle investors with the growth of its cloud and AI businesses Therefore I believe Microsoft has a clear shot at outperforming Apple throughout 2025 and widening its lead as the worlds most valuable company John Mackey former CEO of Whole Foods Market an Amazon subsidiary is a member of The Motley Fools board of directors Leo Sun has positions in Amazon Apple and Nintendo The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Amazon Apple and Microsoft The Motley Fool recommends Nintendo The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy Invest better with The Motley Fool Get stock recommendations portfolio guidance and more from The Motley Fools premium services Making the world smarter happier and richer © 1995 - 2024 The Motley Fool All rights reserved Market data powered by Xignite and Polygonio"

555,"Just How Safe Is Apple Stocks Dividend?","1/27/2024","https://247wallst.com/investing/2024/01/27/just-how-safe-is-apple-stocks-dividend/","A key component of income investing is a portfolio that includes safe dividends those that are unlikely to shrink or disappear Recognizing when a dividend is stable and safe can be a challenge Yet certain metrics can offer clear signs for the investor looking to establish or shore up such a portfolio What do these metrics tell us about the quarterly dividend at Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL)? The most recent payout from Apple was $024 a share and the yield is now about 05% The next ex-dividend date is expected in early February The current yield is less than that of such competitors as Dell Technologies Inc (NYSE: DELL) HP Inc (NYSE: HPQ) International Business Machines Corp (NYSE: IBM) and Samsung Electronics It is also lower than the tech sector average of about 16% One clear sign of whether a dividend is stable and safe is if the company is a Dividend Aristocrat Those are companies in the S&P 500 that have not only paid a dividend consistently for 25 years but have increased their payouts every year as well Apple is not among the aristocrats as its payout has varied over the past decade from about $020 to $305 a share The company has increased the dividend by a penny per share for the past couple of years but it has a long way to go to become a Dividend Aristocrat (See the seven highest-yielding 2024 Dividend Kings to buy and hold forever) While being a Dividend Aristocrat would have been a good sign other financial metrics provide additional insight as well The dividend payout ratio indicates how much of a company’s earnings it pays out as a dividend It is a sign of how safe a company’s dividend is and how much room it has for future growth The higher the ratio the greater the risk Income investors often look for a dividend payout ratio of less than 60% Apple’s current dividend payout ratio is just 15% That is well below the industry average and the company’s mean dividend payout ratio was 24% over the past decade A look at free cash flow reveals whether the company has the funds required for its payout as well as for share repurchases or even paying down debt or making acquisitions Income investors prefer growing free cash flows In 2010 Apple had free cash flow of nearly $166 billion The figure should come in well above $100 billion for 2023 In between the figure has declined in some years but the overall trend is upward Return on invested capital is a measure of how well a company allocates its capital to profitable projects or investments Again the thing to look for is stability specifically a double-digit ROIC over many years At Apple the current ROIC is around 33% which is well above those of tech giants Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Amazoncom Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) Apple’s ROIC has been in the double digits for at least a decade Operating margin is a measure of the percentage of revenue a company keeps as operating profit Here too the preference is for a stable double-digit percentage increase The current figure is about 30% The margin has mostly been above 25% since 2010 Note that the current operating margin at Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: MSFT) is higher than Apple’s A look at sales growth offers a clue to the volatility or cyclical nature of the business Steady moderate growth say 3% to 7% is often considered ideal Revenue at Apple was about $652 billion in 2010 growing to $3832 billion last year Sales increased in most quarters in that interval The growth has not been as steady smartphone rival Samsung nor at Dell HP or IBM A company’s net debt-to-capital ratio also can signal whether a dividend may be at risk Because too much debt can put dividends at risk in hard times a lower ratio is considered better A debt-to-capital ratio above 06 usually means that a business has significantly more debt than equity The ratio at Apple has been less than that for most of the past few years Probably the most popular valuation metric is the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio This indicates whether a stock is expensive or cheap at its current market price compared to the broader market or to competitors Apple has a trailing PE ratio of nearly 32 which is above the industry average of 225 Note that the forward PE is less than 30 That also compares with a broad historical benchmark of 15 as well as the broader market’s current 24 or so Note that among the rest of the so-called Magnificent Seven tech stocks only Alphabet has a PE ratio lower than Apple (See which five blue chip dividend stocks make up 75% of Warren Buffett’s portfolio) And finally the number of shares outstanding is worth a look When companies buy back their shares that number shrinks But secondary offerings of stock and stock compensation increase that total Investors tend to prefer a declining total as that increases their stake over time At Apple the number of shares was 262 billion in 2012 and has declined every year to 158 billion last year The company bought back $776 billion worth of stock last year though that was down from $894 billion the year before Given these metrics it seems clear that Apple’s dividend is safe for now if not generous While the PE ratio is not a match for the broad benchmarks it is not out of line for a Magnificent Seven stock Some income investors no doubt wish for Apple’s dividend to be more generous which the tech giant clearly could afford At least Apple has a pattern of annually increasing the payout going back to before its stock split in 2020 The company could be a Dividend Aristocrat in time Sponsored: Want to Retire Early?

Share it with your friends or copy link Having not personally tested both devices I am not fully qualified to judge whether Mark Zuckerbergs video review accurately compares Apples Vision Pro to the Meta Quest 3 But having read and watched a gazillion reviews of both I can confirm that he makes some good points Hes not wrong that the Vision Pro is heavy and uncomfortable (Some people are returning theirs over this) And he gives it credit for having a brighter sharper screen Sure his conclusion that Metas Quest 3 is better is convenient but lets not overlook something incredible: Hes a decent gadget reviewer Weve been exposed to Zuckerbergs awkward posts for years now from meat smoking to surfing where he strives for human But theres a new chaotic element here — hes doing something as pedestrian and relatable as shit-talking a rival The impulse in the face of extreme adversity to Post Through It — I recognize that specific tendency all too well In an interview on the Morning Brew Daily podcast Zuckerberg explained why he posted the video painting a picture that might be disturbingly familiar to some of us: In my household its basically like my wife Priscilla screaming at me Mark come to sleep and Im like No! Theres someone wrong on the internet Ive got to do something about it! Its happened Mark Zuckerberg has entered his Posting Era (Andrew Boz Bosworth Metas CTO and a notorious poster on Metas internal message boards also gave his own review of the Vision Pro in his Instagram Stories Shockingly he also declared the Quest 3 to be superior) Zuckerbergs latest video isnt necessarily a homerun; some are comparing his rant to a famously wrong-sighted comment by Steve Ballmer when the ex-Microsoft chief poopooed the debut of the iPhone Apples Vision Pro might be the first time the two companies are directly competing but their bad blood goes way back Apple and Facebook have been beefing since Ping Ping! Remember Ping the social element added to iTunes back in 2010? Over the years Apple CEO Cook has taken some shots in the press about Metas handling of user privacy (fair) which reportedly made Zuckerberg so mad he ordered executives to use Android phones (lol but also fair) Then there was Apples Ask App Not to Track feature which was a significant blow to Metas ad business costing the company as much as $10 billion in 2022 (Meta has since recovered its composure: It just posted bonanza quarterly results and has a soaring stock price) And for a long time Meta has grumbled about the App Stores onerous cut of in-app purchases and anti-competitive policies Some of this back-and-forth is playing out on Metas own Threads where Meta executives and employees are highly active and a handful of rank-and-file employees have grown large audiences Not infrequently those employees are complaining about Apple It is reasonable that Meta employees have a unique vantage point to form opinions about other tech companies and tend to come to the same conclusion It happens in lots of workplaces — probably yours too The result is a sort of humid hothouse on Meta-owned Threads a soupy thick air full of just the level of friendly moisture to grow the fungus of Posters Brain Its tempting to compare Zuckerbergs new zest for posting with that other keyboard-happy tech CEO But Elon Musks X habit is more like the impulsive spewing of whats inside his mind — often coming with significant negative costs to him and his companies I dont attempt to think too hard about Mark Zuckerbergs inner life but I dont get the sense that what were seeing is a window into his soul This is a business strategy Instead what I see an inkling of in Zuckerbergs latest video is the belief that posting more can fix the problem or make things better (A core belief of a True Poster) Apple came out with a product that — whether or not its actually far superior — people were way way more hyped about Its nearly impossible to imagine Tim Cook making a video like this; he simply doesnt have that dog in him Meta faces big challenges — not just competition to its VR headset business but the ongoing existential problems that have long plagued it: shifting consumer habits away from public posting competition from TikTok lawsuits from states and cities over its products potentially addictive and harmful effects on teens lingering distrust by the public as a result of a decade of mistakes and bad decisions about the safety and integrity of the product The CEO posting a few Threads or videos where he comes across as a silly goofy guy wont fix that overnight But I can see the allure of trying I too know the vertiginous feeling of riding the high of a well-received tweet or post; how it temporarily emboldens you to want to post more and more Ive spent more of my waking hours than I should admit chasing that dopamine high For a long time Meta has been the No 1 dealer in these cheap thrills but the boss has largely avoided it What I see now is something I never thought might happen: Mark Zuckerberg is getting high on his own supply Advertisement"

Well Mr Greenblatts flavor of value investing is called Magic Formula investing This strategy is based on the two fundamental metrics of share price and stock valuation These are the Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) and the earnings yield For the uninitiated the ROCE divides a firms operating income by the sum of its working capital and net fixed assets The logic behind this computation is that the ROCE measures the return to investors over the costs of doing business as measured by buying and selling inventory and spending on assets The earnings yield of a stock is its earnings per share divided by the share price and it enables investors to understand the true post expenses tax and interest ability of their investment to make money In Magic Formula investing the ROCE and earnings yield of stocks are calculated first They are then ranked according to these metrics and the top shares are bought and held for the long term to benefit from a firms ability to capitalize on its assets and cash to turn a profit and return for investors So what are some magic formula stocks that can deliver magical returns?

And where should we invest now? This is why today we’re going to look at the best options for those looking to invest in Warren Buffett stocks And these three are at the top of the list Buffett began investing in Apple stock back in 2016 Over time has bought the tech stock again and again Since then the company has become the largest holding in Berkshire Hathaway stock making up over 40%! So why did Buffett sell off about 10 million shares for almost US$2 billion? In short to make up for other losses in other companies It was a good time to get some returns from Apple stock and take advantage of the losses Buffett still loves the stock stating “Apple is probably the best business I know in the world” Buffett continues to love Apple stock for its strong brand loyal customer base consistent profitability strong ecosystem and share buybacks The company has now cemented a long-term position at the top of the leaderboard in tech stocks And that could only expand as it finds new areas to invest in Apple stock seems to know how to convince its loyal base that they need its products every day And that looks likely to continue in the near and distant future Beyond Apple stock Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) is another stock that Warren Buffett loves While nowhere near Apple Buffett holds about 8% of the shares making it the largest shareholder And why does he like it so much? It’s proven time and again that it can weather any bad storm Take the financial crisis of 2008 Bank of America stock emerged as one of the best banking franchises in the United States Moreover it still holds the potential for long-term growth in the banking industry — especially when improved market conditions return That’s why lately Buffett has been increasing his positions in banks like Bank of America stock They provide value for future growth and that’s what Buffett likes to see Plus as the largest shareholder he gets to influence some decisions! As he’s said in the past “We believe Bank of America is very well-positioned for the future” Finally there are very few consumer products out there that weather any economic downturn with ease That includes The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) which Buffett has held since 1988 It now takes up 6% of the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio and it doesn’t look like it will decrease any time soon Buffett loves the stock for its iconic brand and global reach No matter where you are you can grab a Coke And no matter what you’re making it’s something you’ll likely always be able to purchase It continues to have a huge competitive advantage with a recession-resistant product Add in the fact that the company is a Dividend King with over 50 years of dividend increases and it’s hard to argue this as a Buffett favourite KO stock will continue to provide strong passive income thanks to its strong business model This is likely why he’s said in the past “If you are looking for a long-term investment this is one of the best because the world drinks a lot of soda” This article represents the opinion of the writer who may disagree with the “official” recommendation position of a Motley Fool premium service or advisor We’re Motley!

Zuckerberg has offered a few clues For one WhatsApp is aiming to be business-friendly According to the company a person running a business account can link multiple devices together enabling more employees to respond to customer messages from anywhere Meta also offers tools for brands such as Chevrolet and Samsung to reach customers including those that allow them to address queries without the need to engage live support as well as ways of placing orders on the app Such features seem to be of interest to businesses: WhatsApps daily business users jumped 80% in the US last year per data from Apptopia first reported by the Big Technology newsletter WhatsApp is also trying to be an app that everyone can use As internet users increasingly sour on social media the search for private spaces to interact with friends and family — like WhatsApp group chats — has only grown WhatsApp is trying to offer the perks of social media without the publicity of it all For users who may miss certain social media features – say the ability to follow people – WhatsApp introduced a Channels feature last year that allows anyone to follow their favorite influencers and get updates from a broadcast Think of it as an Instagram story update WhatsApp is trying to build a better groupchat experience too Though Apple offers a group chat feature on iMessage users are limited to adding up to 32 extra people On WhatsApp a group can have more than 1000 users Is this enough to pry people away from their blue bubbles? Zuckerberg sure hopes so In late 2022 the Meta chief acknowledged that while there is still some time before bets on the metaverse can prove successful business messaging is probably going to be the next major pillar Expect him to push that hard in the US Thanks for signing up for our daily insight on the African economy We bring you daily editor picks from the best Business Insider news content so you can stay updated on the latest topics and conversations on the African market leaders careers and lifestyle Also join us across all of our other channels - we love to be connected! © 2024 africabusinessinsidercom"
