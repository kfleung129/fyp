The graphic processor unit (GPU) manufacture notched $60.9 billion in revenue during its 2024 fiscal year, a 126% increase over the previous year. The lion\u2019s share came from Nvidia\u2019s data center business, which generated $47.5 billion during the fiscal year, more than tripling last year\u2019s total.  \u201cThe $1 trillion installed base of data center infrastructure is rapidly transitioning from general-purpose to accelerated computing,\u201d Nvidia CFO Colette Kress said during the fourth-quarter earnings call.  Driving demand is the rapidly maturing field of artificial intelligence (AI), which hit an inflection point in 2023, says Chirag Dekate, vice president and analyst with Gartner\u2019s Quantum Technologies, AI Infrastructures, and Supercomputing group. \u201cWhat ChatGPT and Google\u2019s Gemini did was to finally make what seemed to be esoteric with what seemed to be incredible. It made it indispensable.\u201d  The result has been a vast widening of AI\u2019s applicability. \u201cWe started the AI journey with hyperscale cloud providers and consumer internet companies,\u201d said Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang during the earnings call. \u201cNow every industry is on board, from automotive to healthcare to financial services, industrial to telecom, media and entertainment.\u201d Huang expects the world\u2019s installed data center base to double in the next five years, forging a market worth hundreds of billions of dollars.  However, the top cloud-computing providers have been busy developing their own accelerator processors designed for AI\u2019s computing requirements. Google has its Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), Amazon Web Services has its Inferentia accelerator processor, and Microsoft has the Maia accelerator chip, all currently available in their respective cloud environments.  Non-cloud companies, such as Meta and Tesla, are also partnering with chip manufacturers to develop custom AI accelerators or are developing them internally. \u201cI think the future is far more democratized and likely will have diverse options,\u201d says Dekate. \u201cGPUs would be part of the mix, but they will not be the only mix. Five years ago, that was not the case. Nvidia was everywhere. You\u2019re now seeing the market shift and evolve towards a multi-vendor ecosystem.\u201d  Data Economics, Policy & Regulation Banking Capital Raising & Corporate Finance "
