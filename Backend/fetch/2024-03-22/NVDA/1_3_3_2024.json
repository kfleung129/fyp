    "text": "The meteoric rise of Nvidia Corp. NVDA in the stock market is drawing parallels with the historic surge of Tesla Inc. TSLA, sparking concerns about the sustainability of the AI frenzy. What Happened: As Nvidia\u2019s stock continues to soar, some investors are drawing parallels with Tesla\u2019s rise to the top, as reported by Bloomberg on Sunday. In 2017, Tesla\u2019s stock skyrocketed as investors anticipated the global domination of electric vehicles, propelling the company to the top of the U.S. auto industry. However, Tesla\u2019s shares have since plummeted by over 50% from their 2021 peak, and other EV stocks that surged alongside it have also seen significant declines. This serves as a cautionary tale for investors betting on Nvidia\u2019s stock as a limitless AI future. \"If you really believe in this AI frenzy, you can visualize a future 10 years from now where AI is embedded in a lot of places, and you need these massive systems running chips that can only be delivered by Nvidia,\" said\u00a0Sameer Bhasin, principal at Value Point Capital. \"But just because the general macro wave is real, it doesn't mean that all of these ventures are going to turn out to be good investments. You will have to be able to separate the winners from the losers,\u201d cautioned Cole Wilcox, CEO of Longboard Asset Management.

Nvidia\u2019s remarkable growth is based on the belief that its exceptional sales growth is sustainable, much like the assumption that EVs would be rapidly and widely adopted, with Tesla leading the market. However, the reality has disrupted this narrative, with EV demand slowing down and more price-conscious consumers taking longer to adopt the new technology. Tesla\u2019s stock has dropped by 31% from its recent high in July, making it one of the biggest percentage decliners in the Nasdaq 100 Index this year. Why It Matters: Retail investors have been favoring Nvidia over Tesla, with the former\u2019s stock purchases exceeding $1 billion over ten days, while Tesla\u2019s retail stock purchases amounted to just under $500 million during the same period. In February, Tesla investor Ross Gerber expressed his belief that Nvidia is significantly \u201cundervalued\u201d after the AI giant\u2019s record quarter. Gerber commended Nvidia for returning a substantial amount of capital to its shareholders.
