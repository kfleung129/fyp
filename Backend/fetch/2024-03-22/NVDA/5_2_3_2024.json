    "text": "Nvidia is scheduled to announce its Q4 results on February 21. An improvement in revenues of 3% to 5%, equivalent to $500 million to $1 billion, is anticipated. This increase is expected to be reflected in both the reported Q4 and guided Q1 revenues. The growth is attributed to incremental supply gains, despite some restrictions in China and transition effects prior to the launch of the B100 accelerator. The B100 graphics processor is set for release in the second half of this year. While the projected growth is more modest compared to previous quarters, it is seen as a foundation for sustained growth in CY25 and beyond. BofA Securities maintains a buy rating on Nvidia and has increased its price objective from $700 to $800. Traders and investors use our platform.
