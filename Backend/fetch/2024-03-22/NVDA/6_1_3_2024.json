    "text": "BREAKING: Futures Steady; FedEx Soars, Apparel Giants Tumble     The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 300 points Wednesday morning ahead of minutes from the Federal Reserve's latest policy meeting. Meanwhile, stock market leaders Coinbase Global (COIN) and Nvidia (NVDA), along with Tesla stock, fell sharply in early morning trading. After the opening bell, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.8%, while the S&P 500 fell 0.75%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite declined 1% in morning action. Among U.S. exchange traded funds, the Nasdaq 100 tracker Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) was down 0.9%, while the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) fell 0.7%. Oil prices looked to rebound after a four-day losing streak, as West Texas Intermediate futures gained nearly 2% Wednesday morning. WTI futures moved above $71 a barrel. Magnificent Seven stocks Nvidia and Tesla (TSLA) lost 1.5% and 4%, respectively, Wednesday morning. Nvidia ended Tuesday's session down 2.7%, holding just above a double-bottom base's 476.09 entry. Nvidia, an IBD Leaderboard stock, also is now forming a flat base that has a 505.48 buy point. A test of the 50-day line seems likely after the recent weakness. Electric-vehicle giant Tesla edged lower Tuesday after the company's stronger-than-expected fourth-quarter deliveries. Tesla stock has a big double-bottom pattern with conventional buy point of 278.98. Early Wednesday, data from the China Passenger Car Association showed that Tesla sold 94,139 China-made electric vehicles in December, a 68% increase from a year earlier, according to Reuters. Meanwhile, Coinbase tumbled another 4.5% in morning trade Wednesday, threatening to extend a losing streak to three sessions.

Further, the Labor Department's Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) report showed job openings of 8.79 million in November, above estimates for 8.75 million and up from October's 8.733 million. Later on Wednesday, Fed minutes are expected at 2 p.m. The minutes are expected to provide insight into the Federal Reserve's thinking on future interest rate moves.
