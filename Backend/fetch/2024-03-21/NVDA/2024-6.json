Using data from humans will make robots the most productive they can be at these tasks, he said. Eventually, he predicted, factories will see a robot orchestrating a bunch of manufacturing robots that are building cars that also will be robotic. Nvidia unveiled Project GROOT at its conference in San Jose, California, this week. GROOT, short for Generalist Robot 00 Technology, is \"a general-purpose foundation model for humanoid robots,\" created to further the company's work in \"driving breakthroughs in robots and embodied AI,\" Nvidia said in a press release. Huang also touched on Nvidia's many partnerships in Big Tech and beyond, saying his company is \"a market maker, not a share taker.\" He asserted that Nvidia's technology will create jobs. \"This is going to create jobs, it's going to make companies more productive,\" he said. \"When companies are more productive, their earnings improve, or their revenues go up. When that happens, they hire more people.\" Click here to download\u00a0Jim Cramer's Guide to Investing\u00a0at no cost to help you build long-term wealth and invest smarter.
