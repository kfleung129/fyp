Nvidia Corp., the poster child for the AI craze that\u2019s up more than 80% year-to-date, is the fund\u2019s biggest holding. Multiples \u201care very reasonable right now,\u201d Wang said in an interview. \u201cWe will get a downturn eventually, but I think it\u2019s really hard to call the top here and I think it still feels a little early.\u201d Nvidia\u2019s stellar earnings results in the past couple of quarters helped trigger a fierce rally in AI-related stocks like its supplier Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and others like Micron Technology Inc. They\u2019re riding on optimism that an inflection point has arrived thanks to accelerated computing. But the speed and pace of the rally have caused skepticism and rekindled memories of the dot-com bubble in the late 1990s, when fund managers like Ryan Jacob rode the hot tech market to triple-digit annual returns. The Nasdaq Composite Index almost quadrupled from the end of 1996 through its peak in March 2000, before tumbling nearly 80% to a 2002 trough. To Wang, a crucial difference with the current rally as compared to the dot-com bubble is backing from real corporate profits, rather than pure valuation expansion. Nvidia, for example, is trading at about 35 times forward earnings, down from a peak around 70 in 2021. So he\u2019s taking advantage of the skepticism. \u201cHeading into the year, the reason why we bet so big on AI and Nvidia is because everyone was concerned about it,\u201d Wang said. \u201cThey have like tremendous free cash flow, they\u2019re well capitalized, they have real businesses.\u201d Nvidia\u2019s GPU Earlier this week, Nvidia\u2019s co-founder Jensen Huang answered critics with a new GPU, Blackwell, the next generation of its hardware that is multiple times faster at handling the models that underpin AI. Nvidia Expects to Win Outsized Chunk of Data Center Spending Wang isn\u2019t bullish on everything. He sold holdings in Chinese companies and invested them in US names this year. His fund exited China\u2019s biggest stocks including Baidu Inc. and Alibaba Group Holdings Ltd. \u2014 which have been boosting spending on their own large language models. Now he holds a small number of Chinese companies. He cited opportunity cost as a key reason. \u201cThere\u2019s a ton of innovation in the US where companies are seeing significant AI traction and earnings acceleration,\u201d Wang said. \u201cThat\u2019s where I\u2019m finding the most opportunities.\u201d Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek Elon Musk\u2019s Don Lemon Implosion Selling Shohei Ohtani: Can Baseball\u2019s Biggest Talent Transform the Sport?
