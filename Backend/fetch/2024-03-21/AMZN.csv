4,"Can This Beaten-Down Stock Skyrocket More Than the Magnificent Seven Over the Next 3 Years?","1 hour ago","https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/stocks/AMZN-Q/pressreleases/24947705/can-this-beaten-down-stock-skyrocket-more-than-the-magnificent-seven-over-the-next-3-years/","The Magnificent Seven refers to seven of the largest publicly traded tech companies in the world: Nvidia Meta Platforms Apple Amazon Microsoft Alphabet and Tesla For what its worth this article is predicated on my belief that most of these companies are overvalued right now and returns for the next three years consequently look modest to me Against this backdrop I believe Roku(NASDAQ: ROKU) has a much higher chance of skyrocketing over the next three years Its market-beating potential isnt a guaranteed outcome But there are several reasons to believe this stock is a coiled spring ready to be released Here are three of them If the Magnificent Seven is expensive as a whole Roku stock is downright cheap This is the first reason to be optimistic about its potential over the next three years Roku stock is down nearly 90% from its all-time high in 2021 Since its high the companys price-to-sales (P/S) valuation has dropped from almost 30 to where it trades now at a P/S ratio of 26 ROKU PS Ratio data by YCharts This represents about a 90% drop in the valuation of Roku stock -- in other words the drop in stock price is 100% valuation related And this is a good thing for investors who buy shares today A cheaper stock can be less risky than an expensive one provided the business creates shareholder value in the future Roku can create shareholder value with profitable growth which brings me to my next reason why this stock can perform well over the next three years Many skeptics question Rokus competitive advantage for providing a connected-TV operating system and hardware And its a fair question Some Roku shareholders might point to the neutrality of the platform compared to companies such as Amazon which provides similar products and services but also has its own streaming service To me this argument for Rokus competitive advantage isnt satisfying Therefore its fair to worry about competition when it comes to Roku That said competition hasnt been a problem so far and this is an important point The company ended 2023 with 80 million active accounts up 14% year over year making it the largest connected-TV company Rokus 80 million active accounts is significant for its growth potential for two reasons First its still attracting new users at a compelling rate which bodes well for its future revenue potential Second theres a strong case that its current accounts are undermonetized Roku generates revenue by displaying ads Active accounts are up and streaming hours are up too But its average revenue per user dropped 4% year over year in the most recent quarter reflecting a weak advertising market Im not sure when it will happen but I expect a full advertising rebound within the next three years Rokus revenue could go up by gaining new accounts and by increased advertising demand which would lead to higher ad rates These two sources of top-line growth could consequently lead to explosive revenue growth at some point in the near future Roku had nearly an $800 million operating loss in 2023 -- when discussing shareholder-value creation this is a problem That said the company has demonstrated profitability in the past so its possible And the profit margin was actually quite good for a brief time ROKU Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts According to management Rokus current losses are intentional -- its aggressively lowered its hardware prices and is spending money to gain market share One might disagree with the premise or the approach But if true this suggests that the companys losses are temporary and at some point profits will improve When it comes to Roku stock skyrocketing over the next three years I feel very comfortable making two statements: The stock is cheap now and its revenue will likely soar in coming years That forms the basis for my conviction that it could outperform the Magnificent Seven The third issue regarding Rokus profits is more of a wild card but nonetheless important Part of the reason the stock is cheap is the market doesnt believe the company has what it takes to sustainably generate positive cash flow If Roku bucks the bearish narrative and turns the corner on profits expect the market to finally give it more credit On the other hand if in three years Roku is still racking up losses like it is today Id expect Roku stock to be a market laggard The company cant operate indefinitely with losses this large Personally I believe Roku has what it takes and believe its prospects will get better with scale But it does still have a lot to prove Should you invest $1000 in Roku right now? Before you buy stock in Roku consider this: The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Roku wasn’t one of them The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years Stock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success including guidance on building a portfolio regular updates from analysts and two new stock picks each month The Stock Advisor service has more than tripled the return of S&P 500 since 2002* See the 10 stocks *Stock Advisor returns as of March 20 2024 John Mackey former CEO of Whole Foods Market an Amazon subsidiary is a member of The Motley Fool’s board of directors Randi Zuckerberg a former director of market development and spokeswoman for Facebook and sister to Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg is a member of The Motley Fools board of directors Suzanne Frey an executive at Alphabet is a member of The Motley Fool’s board of directors Jon Quast has positions in Roku The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Alphabet Amazon Apple Meta Platforms Microsoft Nvidia Roku and Tesla The Motley Fool recommends the following options: long January 2026 $395 calls on Microsoft and short January 2026 $405 calls on Microsoft The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy Paid Post: Content produced by Motley Fool The Globe and Mail was not involved and material was not reviewed prior to publication How much is Amazoncom Inc stock worth?

5,"3 Billionaires Are Selling Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Nvidia and Buying These 10 AI Stocks Instead","1 hour ago","https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/stocks/AMZN-Q/pressreleases/24947702/3-billionaires-are-selling-artificial-intelligence-ai-stock-nvidia-and-buying-these-10-ai-stocks-instead/","For three decades investors have been privy to no shortage of next-big-thing investment trends Although nothing has been as transformative as the advent of the internet innovations and trends that have included genome decoding businesses-to-business commerce 3D printing blockchain technology and the metaverse have captivated the attention of professional and everyday investors alike At the moment nothing is piquing the interest of investors quite like the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution With machine learning software and systems have the ability to evolve over time and become more proficient at their task(s) Its what gives AI such broad-scale appeal in virtually every sector and industry Its also whats made semiconductor stock Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) the hottest thing since sliced bread Image source: Getty Images Although Nvidias graphics processing units (GPUs) have been popular with the personal-computing gaming community for well over a decade and its GPUs have gained traction with cryptocurrency miners during major crypto bull markets its high-compute data centers where the companys infrastructure has shone brightest Nvidias A100 and H100 GPUs are nothing short of dominant in AI-accelerated data centers Analysts at Citigroup opined last year that Nvidia could control upwards of a 90% share of GPUs deployed by enterprises in high-compute data centers in 2024 Whats really helped Nvidia is the scarcity of its top-notch GPUs Since demand has swamped supply its been able to meaningfully increase the price of the GPUs it has available which led to its sales more than doubling in fiscal 2024 (Nvidias fiscal year ended in late January) But not everyone is on board with the Nvidia growth story Based on the latest round of Form 13F filings from the Securities and Exchange Commission eight billionaire investors reduced their respective funds stakes in this Wall Street darling In particular three billionaire money managers cut their funds stake by more than 1 million shares including: While some of this selling could be nothing more than benign profit-taking Nvidia does have a growing list of headwinds to contend with this year In addition to increasing external competition the company is expected to contend with mounting internal AI-GPU competition from its top customers the potential for margin cannibalization and ongoing export restrictions to China Whats perhaps even more interesting is examining the collective 10 artificial intelligence stocks these three billionaires were buying as they were selling shares of Nvidia Image source: Getty Images No billionaire money manager dumped more shares of Nvidia during the fourth quarter than Millenniums Israel Englander While he and his team were busy paring down their stake in Wall Streets top-performing megacap stock they were mashing the buy button for a trio of Magnificent Seven components including: The why? behind these buys is simple: Theyre respective industry leaders Alphabets Google has accounted for more than 90% of global monthly internet search share dating back nearly nine years Meanwhile Amazons e-commerce marketplace is far-and-away the worlds leading online retail site while Amazon Web Services (AWS) holds the highest share of cloud infrastructure service spend Lastly Apples iPhone controls more than half of the domestic smartphone market share But these Magnificent Seven components are also counting on AI to fuel their future growth Alphabet and Amazon are some of Nvidias top customers that are currently developing their own AI chips Both companies are incorporating generative AI solutions into their respective cloud infrastructure service platforms to help businesses build applications and tailor their message(s) to consumers Apple is also developing AI infrastructure of its own with the companys processors capable of running generative AI on MacBook For the moment Apples AI ties are primarily its integration of solutions such as predictive text on the iPhone Its pretty clear that Israel Englander sees considerably more upside in Nvidias peers within the Magnificent Seven The second-biggest billionaire seller of Nvidia stock during the fourth quarter was Susquehannas Jeff Yass While Yass and his investment aides slashed their funds Nvidia stake by 27% they were purchasing a trio of time-tested businesses with artificial intelligence ties that should be able to withstand a potential bursting of the AI bubble including: As noted the key point about these AI stocks is that if the AI bubble were to burst their core operations would presumably prevent them from getting caught up in any major downdraft For example Alibaba is Chinas No 1 e-commerce platform with Taobao and Tmall collectively accounting for a nearly 51% share of online retail sales Alibaba Cloud is also No 1 in market share in China (as of March 2023) and should continue to thrive given that enterprise cloud-service spending is still in its very early stages Tesla is North Americas largest electric-vehicle (EV) manufacturer and the only pure-play EV maker thats been generating a recurring profit Though it incorporates AI solutions into its self-driving technology the companys success is ultimately determined by its ability to sell or lease EVs If history were to repeat itself and the AI bubble were to burst Teslas operating results would ultimately dictate where its share price heads over the long run Meanwhile Microsoft has its cash-cow legacy segments to fall back on such as Windows and Office as well as its high-growth initiatives which include cloud infrastructure service platform Azure -- the worldwide No 2 cloud infrastructure service provider by spend behind only AWS Although Microsoft is betting big on AI arguably more so than Alibaba or Tesla it would likely be just fine if AI expectations are tempered at some point in the not-too-distant future The final billionaire that was an aggressive seller of Nvidia stock during the December-ended quarter was Steven Cohen at Point72 Asset Management While Cohen and his team were busy paring down Point72s stake in AI infrastructure kingpin Nvidia by 66% they were buying four ancillary beneficiaries of the AI movement including: Similar to what Jeff Yass did at Susquehanna Point72s investment team looks to be de-risking the fund by focusing on businesses that can benefit from AI but have less direct exposure if and when the bubble bursts Whereas total sales for Oracles recently reported quarter (ended Feb 29 2024) were up just 7% infrastructure-as-a-service sales catapulted 49% from the prior-year period While Oracle can easily lean on its legacy bread-and-butter segments if AI experiences a demand reset its well-positioned to be a long-term winner in AI infrastructure Western Digital is a potentially sneaky play on AI-driven storage Just as Western Digital experienced a surge in demand during the initial wave of enterprise cloud-service spending the growing storage demand needs in AI-accelerated data centers should be music to the ears of management It could pave a path for the companys high-transfer-rate NAND flash memory solutions to become standard in data centers To keep with the theme Dell Technologies has its core computing segments it can lean on if an AI bubble were to materialize Nevertheless its witnessed exceptionally strong demand for customizable rack servers used by businesses operating AI-accelerated data centers Though this makes up a small percentage of Dells business at the moment it positions the company to sustainably benefit over the long run as AI solutions proliferate Cohen and his team also piled into robotic-assisted surgical systems developer Intuitive Surgical This is a company thats utilizing AI to help surgeons study their own procedural data to improve patient outcomes Ultimately the company should enjoy sustained double-digit sales growth as the da Vinci surgical system gobbles up share in a variety of soft-tissue surgical indications No company comes remotely close to the installed base of assisted-surgical systems that Intuitive Surgical has put in place

The answer is that sometimes deals fall through And when that happens that fallout can be very very ugly Mergers fall apart all the time and in every industry Take a look at the price chart for technology stock iRobot below Notice the big price jump at the beginning of the period when Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) agreed to buy the robot maker And then the stock started to trend lower before dropping drastically toward the end when the deal was called off The companies strongly hinted that the problem was getting regulatory approval a fact that weighed on iRobots stock almost from the very start IRBT data by YCharts As if thats not bad enough the very same day that the deal was called off iRobot announced a business overhaul The list of moves included cost-saving initiatives reduced research and development spending and staff cuts among other things Simply put iRobot appears to have been a struggling company that really needed Amazon to buy it or it was going to come under increasing financial strain If you bought this stock thinking that the Amazon deal was in the bag you would have found your bag had a giant hole in it The deal between airlineJetblue(NASDAQ: JBLU) and Spirit Airlines was similar in that Spirit was a struggling company being bought by a stronger one Spirit shares plunged when that deal was scuttled largely because regulators appeared unlikely to approve it Just recently meanwhile shares of US Steel fell sharply over concerns that Japanese steel giant Nippon Steel wont receive the regulatory approvals needed to buy the iconic American steelmaker This is just a quick list of recent deals that have gone or could go wrong As each of the examples above shows it simply isnt as easy as it looks to do merger arbitrage You have to make an assessment of the chances that the deals you invest in will actually be completed as planned Very often that is what transpires but calling one deal wrong could leave you with huge losses The problems above were all related to regulatory issues but financing and adverse business or industry developments can also lead to broken merger and acquisition agreements To be fair merger arbitrage specialists do more than just buy the stock of the company being acquired The process can involve shorting shares buying shares and even options trades The added transactions which materially increase complexity are mostly meant to protect against the risk of a failed deal If you like the idea of merger arbitrage you should check out a specialist like Merger Fund (MERFX) which allows you to invest in a diversified portfolio of merger arbitrage opportunities Small investors however probably shouldnt try this approach on a one-off basis as the risk/reward balance isnt skewed in your favor nearly as much as you may think Should you invest $1000 in iRobot right now?

8,"Meet Wall Streets Newest Stock-Split Stock Along With the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Likeliest to Follow in Its","2 hours ago","https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/stocks/AMZN/pressreleases/24946754/meet-wall-streets-newest-stock-split-stock-along-with-the-artificial-intelligence-ai-stock-likeliest-to-follow-in-its-footsteps/","Volatility is a given when putting your money to work on Wall Street Since this decade began all three major stock indexes have traded off bear and bull markets in successive years While most investors are probably hoping for an end to this pattern in 2024 it nevertheless speaks to the unpredictable nature of stocks over the short term Historically when volatility and uncertainty crop up professional and retail investors have a tendency to seek out companies that have consistently outperformed in virtually any economic climate One perfect example of this is investors flocking to the FAANG stocks for more than a decade But in recent years its stocks enacting splits that have been the cream of the crop Image source: Getty Images A stock split is a purely cosmetic event that allows a publicly traded company to alter its share price and outstanding share count Its cosmetic in the sense that a stock split doesnt change a companys market cap or its operating performance A forward-stock split can make shares more nominally affordable for retail investors who dont have access to fractional-share purchases with their broker Conversely reverse-stock splits are designed to increase a companys share price to ensure continued listing on a major stock exchange With few exceptions investors tend to focus on high-flying businesses conducting forward-stock splits Companies that enact forward splits are usually highly profitable and on the leading edge of the innovative curve within their respective industries Since the midpoint of 2021 just shy of a dozen high-profile companies have completed forward-stock splits including Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) and Walmart(NYSE: WMT) Amazon and Tesla conducted forward splits of 20-for-1 and 3-for-1 in 2022 respectively while Walmarts 3-for-1 forward-stock split went into effect last month AMZN data by YCharts The reason these businesses have outperformed is because of their well-defined competitive advantages: On Tuesday March 19 another top-notch company announced that it would joining this exclusive group of stock-split stocks Image source: Chipotle Mexican Grill Following the closing bell on March 19 the board of directors of fast-casual restaurant chainChipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG) announced a 50-for-1 stock split which is one of the largest forward splits in the history of the New York Stock Exchange Assuming the split is given the green light by shareholders at the companys annual meeting in June Chipotle will begin trading at a post-split price on June 26 2024 Chipotle went public in January 2006 at an initial offering price of $22 per share but has never split its stock Shares of the company neared the $3000 mark shortly after the announcement A 50-for-1 stock split would reduce Chipotles share price to just shy of $60 per share based on where its trading at the time of this writing Said Chipotles chief financial and administrative officer Jack Hartung This is the first stock split in Chipotles 30-year history and we believe this will make our stock more accessible to employees as well as a broader range of investors This split comes at a time when our stock is experiencing an all-time high driven by record revenues profits and growth Interestingly Chipotles desire to make shares more nominally affordable for its employees echoes what Walmart said when in late January when it announced its 3-for-1 stock split Chipotles continued outperformance which led to this monumental stock split can be summed up by three catalysts: food quality its menu and innovation With regard to the former Chipotle has strived to use locally sourced vegetables and responsibly raised meats Just as grocery stores benefited from the organic food push two decades ago Chipotle is enjoying exceptional pricing power and increased demand because of its use of fresh ingredients Secondly Chipotle tends to keep its menu relatively small A small menu makes food preparation easier on its staff which can expedite service times A limited menu can also lead to more excitement when new food items are introduced Lastly innovation has played an important role in the outperformance of Chipotles stock A perfect example is the introduction of Chipotlanes which are drive-thru lanes specifically designed for mobile orders Management has done a phenomenal job of improving the operating efficiency of its stores over time With Walmart completing its split in late February and Chipotle Mexican Grill on track to conduct its first-ever split in late June its just a matter of time before another high-quality company joins this exclusive club of stock-split stocks Given the buzz surrounding artificial intelligence (AI) at the moment the likeliest candidate to follow in Chipotles footsteps is semiconductor company Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO) Did you think I was going to say Nvidia? Broadcom stock ended the trading session on March 19 at a whopping $1238 per share Thats up more than 1800% over the trialing decade Although Broadcom conducted three stock splits prior to be acquired by Avago in early 2016 (Avago chose to keep the Broadcom name) Avago had never announced any stock splits AI is a megatrend the likes of which we havent seen since the advent of the internet Though estimates are all over the place researchers at PwC released a report last year that suggested AI could add $157 trillion to global gross domestic product by 2030 Thats music to the ears of Broadcom Broadcoms operating performance is liable to be fueled by its Jericho3-AI chip which the company introduced last spring Jericho3 has the ability to connect up to 32000 graphics processing units at once in AI-accelerated data centers In other words Broadcom boasts the critical infrastructure thatll be needed to support generative AI solutions and large language model training In addition to its undeniable AI ties Broadcoms highly profitable foundation is its wireless chip segment Its a leading provider of 5G wireless chips used in next-generation smartphones A steady stream of consumers upgrading their wireless devices to take advantage of faster download speeds has led to a healthy backlog of orders for Broadcom Although Avagos management team has never pulled the trigger on a stock split a share price north of $1200 may be the catalyst needed to make the companys stock more nominally affordable for everyday investors Should you invest $1000 in Chipotle Mexican Grill right now?
