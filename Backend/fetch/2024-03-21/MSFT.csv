4,"3 Billionaires Are Selling Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Nvidia and Buying These 10 AI Stocks Instead","54 minutes

three decades investors have been privy to no shortage of next-big-thing investment trends Although nothing has been as transformative as the advent of the internet innovations and trends that have included genome decoding businesses-to-business commerce 3D printing blockchain technology and the metaverse have captivated the attention of professional and everyday investors alike At the moment nothing is piquing the interest of investors quite like the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution With machine learning software and systems have the ability to evolve over time and become more proficient at their task(s) Its what gives AI such broad-scale appeal in virtually every sector and industry Its also whats made semiconductor stock Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) the hottest thing since sliced bread Image source: Getty Images Although Nvidias graphics processing units (GPUs) have been popular with the personal-computing gaming community for well over a decade and its GPUs have gained traction with cryptocurrency miners during major crypto bull markets its high-compute data centers where the companys infrastructure has shone brightest Nvidias A100 and H100 GPUs are nothing short of dominant in AI-accelerated data centers Analysts at Citigroup opined last year that Nvidia could control upwards of a 90% share of GPUs deployed by enterprises in high-compute data centers in 2024 Whats really helped Nvidia is the scarcity of its top-notch GPUs Since demand has swamped supply its been able to meaningfully increase the price of the GPUs it has available which led to its sales more than doubling in fiscal 2024 (Nvidias fiscal year ended in late January) But not everyone is on board with the Nvidia growth story Based on the latest round of Form 13F filings from the Securities and Exchange Commission eight billionaire investors reduced their respective funds stakes in this Wall Street darling In particular three billionaire money managers cut their funds stake by more than 1 million shares including: While some of this selling could be nothing more than benign profit-taking Nvidia does have a growing list of headwinds to contend with this year In addition to increasing external competition the company is expected to contend with mounting internal AI-GPU competition from its top customers the potential for margin cannibalization and ongoing export restrictions to China Whats perhaps even more interesting is examining the collective 10 artificial intelligence stocks these three billionaires were buying as they were selling shares of Nvidia Image source: Getty Images No billionaire money manager dumped more shares of Nvidia during the fourth quarter than Millenniums Israel Englander While he and his team were busy paring down their stake in Wall Streets top-performing megacap stock they were mashing the buy button for a trio of Magnificent Seven components including: The why? behind these buys is simple: Theyre respective industry leaders Alphabets Google has accounted for more than 90% of global monthly internet search share dating back nearly nine years Meanwhile Amazons e-commerce marketplace is far-and-away the worlds leading online retail site while Amazon Web Services (AWS) holds the highest share of cloud infrastructure service spend Lastly Apples iPhone controls more than half of the domestic smartphone market share But these Magnificent Seven components are also counting on AI to fuel their future growth Alphabet and Amazon are some of Nvidias top customers that are currently developing their own AI chips Both companies are incorporating generative AI solutions into their respective cloud infrastructure service platforms to help businesses build applications and tailor their message(s) to consumers Apple is also developing AI infrastructure of its own with the companys processors capable of running generative AI on MacBook For the moment Apples AI ties are primarily its integration of solutions such as predictive text on the iPhone Its pretty clear that Israel Englander sees considerably more upside in Nvidias peers within the Magnificent Seven The second-biggest billionaire seller of Nvidia stock during the fourth quarter was Susquehannas Jeff Yass While Yass and his investment aides slashed their funds Nvidia stake by 27% they were purchasing a trio of time-tested businesses with artificial intelligence ties that should be able to withstand a potential bursting of the AI bubble including: As noted the key point about these AI stocks is that if the AI bubble were to burst their core operations would presumably prevent them from getting caught up in any major downdraft For example Alibaba is Chinas No 1 e-commerce platform with Taobao and Tmall collectively accounting for a nearly 51% share of online retail sales Alibaba Cloud is also No 1 in market share in China (as of March 2023) and should continue to thrive given that enterprise cloud-service spending is still in its very early stages Tesla is North Americas largest electric-vehicle (EV) manufacturer and the only pure-play EV maker thats been generating a recurring profit Though it incorporates AI solutions into its self-driving technology the companys success is ultimately determined by its ability to sell or lease EVs If history were to repeat itself and the AI bubble were to burst Teslas operating results would ultimately dictate where its share price heads over the long run Meanwhile Microsoft has its cash-cow legacy segments to fall back on such as Windows and Office as well as its high-growth initiatives which include cloud infrastructure service platform Azure -- the worldwide No 2 cloud infrastructure service provider by spend behind only AWS Although Microsoft is betting big on AI arguably more so than Alibaba or Tesla it would likely be just fine if AI expectations are tempered at some point in the not-too-distant future The final billionaire that was an aggressive seller of Nvidia stock during the December-ended quarter was Steven Cohen at Point72 Asset Management While Cohen and his team were busy paring down Point72s stake in AI infrastructure kingpin Nvidia by 66% they were buying four ancillary beneficiaries of the AI movement including: Similar to what Jeff Yass did at Susquehanna Point72s investment team looks to be de-risking the fund by focusing on businesses that can benefit from AI but have less direct exposure if and when the bubble bursts Whereas total sales for Oracles recently reported quarter (ended Feb 29 2024) were up just 7% infrastructure-as-a-service sales catapulted 49% from the prior-year period While Oracle can easily lean on its legacy bread-and-butter segments if AI experiences a demand reset its well-positioned to be a long-term winner in AI infrastructure Western Digital is a potentially sneaky play on AI-driven storage Just as Western Digital experienced a surge in demand during the initial wave of enterprise cloud-service spending the growing storage demand needs in AI-accelerated data centers should be music to the ears of management It could pave a path for the companys high-transfer-rate NAND flash memory solutions to become standard in data centers To keep with the theme Dell Technologies has its core computing segments it can lean on if an AI bubble were to materialize Nevertheless its witnessed exceptionally strong demand for customizable rack servers used by businesses operating AI-accelerated data centers Though this makes up a small percentage of Dells business at the moment it positions the company to sustainably benefit over the long run as AI solutions proliferate Cohen and his team also piled into robotic-assisted surgical systems developer Intuitive Surgical This is a company thats utilizing AI to help surgeons study their own procedural data to improve patient outcomes Ultimately the company should enjoy sustained double-digit sales growth as the da Vinci surgical system gobbles up share in a variety of soft-tissue surgical indications No company comes remotely close to the installed base of assisted-surgical systems that Intuitive Surgical has put in place

6,"Can This Beaten-Down Stock Skyrocket More Than the Magnificent Seven Over the Next 3 Years?","1 hour ago","https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/stocks/MSFT/pressreleases/24947705/can-this-beaten-down-stock-skyrocket-more-than-the-magnificent-seven-over-the-next-3-years/","The Magnificent Seven refers to seven of the largest publicly traded tech companies in the world: Nvidia Meta Platforms Apple Amazon Microsoft Alphabet and Tesla For what its worth this article is predicated on my belief that most of these companies are overvalued right now and returns for the next three years consequently look modest to me Against this backdrop I believe Roku(NASDAQ: ROKU) has a much higher chance of skyrocketing over the next three years Its market-beating potential isnt a guaranteed outcome But there are several reasons to believe this stock is a coiled spring ready to be released Here are three of them If the Magnificent Seven is expensive as a whole Roku stock is downright cheap This is the first reason to be optimistic about its potential over the next three years Roku stock is down nearly 90% from its all-time high in 2021 Since its high the companys price-to-sales (P/S) valuation has dropped from almost 30 to where it trades now at a P/S ratio of 26 ROKU PS Ratio data by YCharts This represents about a 90% drop in the valuation of Roku stock -- in other words the drop in stock price is 100% valuation related And this is a good thing for investors who buy shares today A cheaper stock can be less risky than an expensive one provided the business creates shareholder value in the future Roku can create shareholder value with profitable growth which brings me to my next reason why this stock can perform well over the next three years Many skeptics question Rokus competitive advantage for providing a connected-TV operating system and hardware And its a fair question Some Roku shareholders might point to the neutrality of the platform compared to companies such as Amazon which provides similar products and services but also has its own streaming service To me this argument for Rokus competitive advantage isnt satisfying Therefore its fair to worry about competition when it comes to Roku That said competition hasnt been a problem so far and this is an important point The company ended 2023 with 80 million active accounts up 14% year over year making it the largest connected-TV company Rokus 80 million active accounts is significant for its growth potential for two reasons First its still attracting new users at a compelling rate which bodes well for its future revenue potential Second theres a strong case that its current accounts are undermonetized Roku generates revenue by displaying ads Active accounts are up and streaming hours are up too But its average revenue per user dropped 4% year over year in the most recent quarter reflecting a weak advertising market Im not sure when it will happen but I expect a full advertising rebound within the next three years Rokus revenue could go up by gaining new accounts and by increased advertising demand which would lead to higher ad rates These two sources of top-line growth could consequently lead to explosive revenue growth at some point in the near future Roku had nearly an $800 million operating loss in 2023 -- when discussing shareholder-value creation this is a problem That said the company has demonstrated profitability in the past so its possible And the profit margin was actually quite good for a brief time ROKU Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts According to management Rokus current losses are intentional -- its aggressively lowered its hardware prices and is spending money to gain market share One might disagree with the premise or the approach But if true this suggests that the companys losses are temporary and at some point profits will improve When it comes to Roku stock skyrocketing over the next three years I feel very comfortable making two statements: The stock is cheap now and its revenue will likely soar in coming years That forms the basis for my conviction that it could outperform the Magnificent Seven The third issue regarding Rokus profits is more of a wild card but nonetheless important Part of the reason the stock is cheap is the market doesnt believe the company has what it takes to sustainably generate positive cash flow If Roku bucks the bearish narrative and turns the corner on profits expect the market to finally give it more credit On the other hand if in three years Roku is still racking up losses like it is today Id expect Roku stock to be a market laggard The company cant operate indefinitely with losses this large Personally I believe Roku has what it takes and believe its prospects will get better with scale But it does still have a lot to prove Should you invest $1000 in Roku right now?
