0,Isnt Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Stock Overvalued? Not Quite,6 hours ago,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/isn-t-nvidia-nasdaq-nvda-032248694.html,Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been one of the best-performing stocks globally over the past 18 months The chip manufacturer’s shares are up nearly 7x over the period This extraordinary growth can certainly turn some investors off making them believe it’s overvalued However it’s worth remembering that momentum can actually be one of the best indicators of forward stock performance especially if the company has a track record of beating expectations Personally I remain bullish on NVDA stock not just because of momentum but because the company is so central to the AI revolution which has only just begun Nvidia as a company is at the very heart of the AI revolution due to its graphics processing units (GPUs) which possess the capabilities required for huge AI and large language models The units were originally built for the gaming sector but GPUs are also perfect for AI’s massive data processing needs Unlike central processing units (CPUs) that handle tasks one by one GPUs excel at parallel processing allowing them to take on multiple tasks simultaneously Without this technology the step forward we’ve seen in AI which includes developments in facial recognition technology and self-driving cars wouldn’t be possible Nvidia’s dominance stems from the architecture of its GPU Unlike CPUs with a few cores Nvidia packs a massive number of cores onto a single chip In turn this allows for high processing power within a smaller space and this is hugely important for efficient AI processing Moreover Nvidia has focused on high-bandwidth memory which allows these cores to access data rapidly further accelerating AI computations As such Nvidia has earned a significant edge in the AI hardware race However in the AI world it’s not just about hardware Nvidia’s CUDA software provides direct access to the GPU’s virtual instructions This software ecosystem empowers developers to build and refine AI projects and has made Nvidia a one-stop shop for all things AI Nvidia stock is expensive in that it’s becoming less affordable for many investors Trading around $900 a share some investors may struggle to purchase a single Nvidia share as part of a diverse portfolio of holdings However from a valuation perspective I don’t think Nvidia stock is expensive or overpriced In fact it may still represent good value Nvidia currently trades at 354x forward earnings making it more expensive than the S&P 500 (SPX) but it’s by no means too expensive for the tech sector Moreover the company is expected to continue delivering stellar growth throughout the medium term In fact Nvidia’s earnings are forecasted to grow by 3478% annually throughout the medium term This means that Nvidia’s all-important PEG ratio is 102 While 10 may be considered the benchmark for fair value I still think this represents good value noting long-term trends in the AI industry and the market’s bullishness on US tech In turn this means that Nvidia is trading at 2977x earnings for 2026 2526x earnings for 2027 and 2149x earnings for 2028 Moreover it’s worth recognizing that Nvidia just keeps on beating analysts’ most bullish forecasts That’s always a good sign and maybe it could continue to beat expectations going forward Due to its enabling position in the AI revolution and its attractive valuation metrics Nvidia stock earns a Strong Buy from analysts Currently Nvidia has 39 Buys two Hold ratings and zero Sell ratings The average Nvidia stock target price is $91374 inferring 11% upside potential The highest share price target is $1200 and the lowest share price target is $60840 Nvidia has been central to the AI revolution but there are two important things to consider moving forward: Nvidia’s competitive advantage in the all-important generative AI market and the fact that the AI revolution has only just begun Over the past 18 months Nvidia has found itself with a formidable moat which it has successfully built upon Other companies including Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) have eyes on Nvidia’s crown but it’s not clear how they will catch up The Santa Clara-based firm’s new H200 chipset is the must-have for generative AI and large language models The H200 is thought to be between 14 and 19 times faster than the H100 when it comes to large language model inference That’s an impressive jump in just one year Moreover the market is growing and has the potential to grow much faster SoftBank’s (OTC:SFTBY) Masayoshi Son is considering a $100 billion venture in the AI chip space and OpenAI’s Sam Altman is reportedly looking for $7 trillion for a string of AI chip factories that would respond to burgeoning demand and restructure the world’s semiconductor sector Given the near-term momentum in the sector the fact that demand for GPUs still outstrips supply and the fact that we really are just at the start of the AI revolution I remain bullish on Nvidia Disclosure Related Quotes

2,Tech Fund Beating 99% of Peers Says AI Rally Is Just Starting,6 hours ago,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tech-fund-beating-99-peers-030839409.html,(Bloomberg) -- The artificial-intelligence stock rally is far from over according to the manager of one of the best-performing tech funds this year Most Read from Bloomberg Baltimore Wants to Sell Hundreds of Vacant Homes for $1 Each Sam Bankman-Fried Says 50-Year Sentence Only Suitable for a ‘Super Villain’ Justice Department to Sue Apple for Antitrust Violations as Soon as Thursday Trump Rules Out Vivek Ramaswamy as Running Mate as He Eyes New Team Fed Signals Three Rate Cuts Are Still Likely Despite Inflation Uptick Tony Wang whose $9 billion T Rowe Price Science & Technology Fund beat 99% of peers last year too says the AI sector isn’t in a bubble Nvidia Corp the poster child for the AI craze that’s up more than 80% year-to-date is the fund’s biggest holding Multiples “are very reasonable right now” Wang said in an interview “We will get a downturn eventually but I think it’s really hard to call the top here and I think it still feels a little early” Nvidia’s stellar earnings results in the past couple of quarters helped trigger a fierce rally in AI-related stocks like its supplier Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co and others like Micron Technology Inc They’re riding on optimism that an inflection point has arrived thanks to accelerated computing But the speed and pace of the rally have caused skepticism and rekindled memories of the dot-com bubble in the late 1990s when fund managers like Ryan Jacob rode the hot tech market to triple-digit annual returns The Nasdaq Composite Index almost quadrupled from the end of 1996 through its peak in March 2000 before tumbling nearly 80% to a 2002 trough To Wang a crucial difference with the current rally as compared to the dot-com bubble is backing from real corporate profits rather than pure valuation expansion Nvidia for example is trading at about 35 times forward earnings down from a peak around 70 in 2021 So he’s taking advantage of the skepticism “Heading into the year the reason why we bet so big on AI and Nvidia is because everyone was concerned about it” Wang said “They have like tremendous free cash flow they’re well capitalized they have real businesses” Nvidia’s GPU Earlier this week Nvidia’s co-founder Jensen Huang answered critics with a new GPU Blackwell the next generation of its hardware that is multiple times faster at handling the models that underpin AI Nvidia Expects to Win Outsized Chunk of Data Center Spending Wang isn’t bullish on everything He sold holdings in Chinese companies and invested them in US names this year His fund exited China’s biggest stocks including Baidu Inc and Alibaba Group Holdings Ltd — which have been boosting spending on their own large language models Now he holds a small number of Chinese companies He cited opportunity cost as a key reason “There’s a ton of innovation in the US where companies are seeing significant AI traction and earnings acceleration” Wang said “That’s where I’m finding the most opportunities” Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek Elon Musk’s Don Lemon Implosion Selling Shohei Ohtani: Can Baseball’s Biggest Talent Transform the Sport?

3,CIOs share how they are harnessing gen AIs potential at Nvidia GTC,9 hours ago,https://venturebeat.com/ai/cios-share-how-they-are-harnessing-gen-ais-potential-at-nvidia-gtc/,Join leaders in Boston on March 27 for an exclusive night of networking insights and conversation Request an invite here Generative AI use cases are progressing quickly from pilots to production delivering measurable reliable results at scale across enterprises today From detecting anomalies in security logs to improving developer productivity through automation of code migrations CIOs and IT leaders shared how they’re harnessing gen AI’s potential across a broad base of use cases to achieve productivity gains CIOs from Nvidia SentinelOne and ServiceNow participated in yesterday’s panel Driving Enterprise Transformation: CIO Insights on Harnessing Generative AI’s Potential at Nvidia’s 2024 GTC Event The panel was moderated by Rama Akkiraju vice president of enterprise AI and automation at Nvidia The panel included Sabry Tozin vice president of engineering at LinkedIn Sonu Nayyar senior vice president and CIO at Nvidia Sandy Venugopal CIO from SentinelOne and Chris Bedi chief digital information officer from ServiceNow The panel’s insistence that gen AI delivers measurable results resonated across their answers to several questions during the session The AI Impact Tour – Atlanta Gen AI use cases must deliver measurable value and help streamline processes at scale if they’re going to survive the pilot phase and move into production Tozin explained how gen AI is enhancing engineer productivity by automating certain tasks “We’re making a huge dent in developer productivity by automating a lot of that work What this does it actually allows engineers to get back to building new things adding things that actually provide value to the enterprise as opposed to just working on things that are repetitive or that would be considered sort of maintenance” ServiceNow embedding domain-specific language models into workflows to reduce back-office workload by 14% is another example shared by Bedi “We deploy gen AI so that when an employee asks for something in natural language gen AI understands the intent Ninty-nine percent of the time they’re getting a gen AI response But what we saw on the backend is a 14% reduction in the work that’s coming to those back office departments and that’s in about five months” Bedi said Bedi said “I measure the heck out of everything… And to Sabry’s point this stuff sells itself When we actually did the math on all those individual measures and add them up it’s about $10 million of annualized benefit and that’s in 120 days And gen AI for us is doing the work of the equivalent of 50 people and we’re just getting started with this tech” ServiceNow’s significant cost savings and productivity gains also demonstrate how CIOs are looking at gen AI in terms of its equivalent human resource contribution and capacity Tozin’s insights into how and where gen AI is contributing to LinkedIn show how his engineering teams see it as a technology that can offload routine tasks and free up engineering to pursue more challenging complex work Each of the panelists alluded to how important it is to also focus on the ROI of any gen AI initiative comparing the costs of adopting gen AI to the productivity gains and any potential operational efficiencies they can achieve Dealing with change management including navigating organizational and technical challenges is a universal challenge which makes measuring results even more important Nvidia and SentinelOne’s CIOs told the audience about gen AI’s role in their company’s new product development efforts and environments They also spoke about how it’s role in delivering products is growing Nayyar says that Nvidia has chosen to take the initiative in pursuing gen AI use cases across the company “As Jensen mentioned yesterday we’ve got a bunch of stuff already in production We have ChipNeMo for developer productivity we’re building additional developer tools such as code critic to just enhance aid in code development and so on across the company We’ve got entire groups working on this It’s part of our strategic initiatives I can go on and on but we have a ton of use cases that we’ve already deployed” Venugopal from SentinelOne says gen AI is playing a critical role in their cyber security provider’s product strategy and new product development processes “There’s been a lot of investments on our product to really utilize the capabilities around look at anomalies in all of the data you have around security logs access logs where do you find those weird things happening or potential threats and how can you generate the right prompts or next actions for your security operations center (SOC) analysts to take? So we’ve actually been customer zero of that product and that’s been a huge investment in validation work that we’ve done on the enterprise side” All CIOs on the panel acknowledged that the organizational and technical challenges need to be dealt with head-on and early in the process Nayyar underscores how important it is to create a culture that values experimentation and risk-taking with the goal being a safe environment for innovation All CIOs either mentioned data security and governance specifically or alluded to it as a core strength any organization needs to work on if they’re going to succeed with gen AI Here’s the best advice the CIOs gave during the panel today: See and use generative AI as a learning tool Tozin stressed the need for gen AI to be considered just as important as a learning tool and a platform to improve skills as it is a task engine He says a useful exercise is to ask AI to teach concepts back to you and your team that you may already know to sharpen your understanding Show curiosity and fascination with gen AI to reduce the anxiety of it for the company Venugopal recommends that CIOs and leaders stay continually curious about gen AI’s rapid advancements and being a student of how it can help teams Jump in and prioritize use cases early and be willing to flex and adapt ServiceNow’s Bedi believes business leaders need to experiment and start using gen AI for specific use cases and personas to see how well the technology fits organizational needs He stressed the fact that knowing the overlap of gen AI use cases and personas early helps move use cases from pilot to production VB Daily Stay in the know!

9,Why FOMO Is Fueling Nvidia Stock,12 hours ago,https://www.vanityfair.com/news/nvidia-stock-ai-fomo,To revisit this article visit My Profile then View saved stories By Nick Bilton In mid-October 2022 Nvidia the AI chipmaker was worth around $280 billion Less than a year and a half later the company is worth $22 trillion Yes that’s an eight-times increase—from a relatively sane number with a b (billion) to a truly insane number with a t (trillion)—in just 17 months That growth is because of the frothy excitement or perhaps frothy insanity around AI in Silicon Valley In fact Nvidia might be one of the most talked-about stocks in recent history It’s constantly mentioned on CNBC and debated on social media and it’s part of the buy-buy-buy circuit for almost every tech and Wall Street analyst investor or armchair stock dabbler I chat with And while there is a legitimate reason to discuss the value of the company that is making AI chips for virtually every major tech firm including Amazon Alphabet Meta Microsoft and OpenAI the endless discussion of Nvidia’s valuation and stock price is being driven by one distinct thing: FOMO This fear of missing out on another tech boom has not only engulfed Nvidia but also spread across the entire sector—particularly with AI Bitcoin and all things crypto as well as the makers of GLP-1 drugs being used for weight loss (think Ozempic) These surges are emblematic of a broader trend in which both seasoned and novice investors pour money into what they perceive as the next big thing but risk causing the collapse of these potential next big things by doing so Similarly other AI-related tech stocks like C3ai and Palantir are experiencing valuations that are incredibly high Fueling the insanity of these tech stocks is none other than social media with everyone sharing screenshots of their “hot” stock take and how much money they’ve made This frenzied investment landscape is leading to a greater concern among lots of investors that they have missed out on significant moneymaking opportunities which ironically is the same sentiment that is fueling this ongoing cycle of irrational exuberance where we start to reach that thin line between opportunity and volatility Depending on whom you ask we’re either just at the beginning or coming to the end of the cycle One investor who has been talking to me about his Nvidia investment for the past year as if it were his favorite child thinks this is just the start “AI is shaping up to be an investor’s dream come true It’s all about huge promises and the potential for staggering profits that seem limitless” he told me “We’re really just at the beginning and there’s a sense that the next few years could generate wealth for generations It’s like trying to catch lightning in a bottle to find that one standout stock” Another institutional investor sees it differently telling me this is no different from tulip mania the housing crisis or the dot-com collapse “It’s a bubble It’s a bubble It’s a bubble” the institutional investor said “The question which is the question with all bubbles is: Does a stock like Nvidia collapse at $1000 a share or at $25000 a share? It’ll definitely fall; it’s simply not sustainable But timing is the key here to winning big or losing everything” Suppose the housing crisis had Bear Stearns as its poster child which collapsed when the mortgage-backed securities market imploded Then the dot-com bubble had petscom as its symbol of excess and failure as it went from an IPO worth hundreds of millions of dollars to bankruptcy almost overnight Today’s poster child is clearly going to be Nvidia Many wonder if Nvidia’s staggering $22 trillion valuation reflects its underlying value or represents an overly bloated figure disconnected from the company’s financial health Only time will tell if the company can justify growing even more if its financial metrics justify such a colossal market cap or if we are witnessing a speculative bubble inflated by the frenzy around artificial intelligence While it’s impossible to predict where we are in the mountainous financial landscape of peaks and dips it’s clear that there is a frenetic level of FOMO-ism around AI On Monday evening Nvidia took over a convention center in San Jose The company’s leather-jacket-wearing CEO Jensen Huang unveiled the latest AI chips to throngs of adoring fans One person I spoke to at the event likened it to seeing a rock star’s concert in the 1980s Another analyst dubbed it the “AI Woodstock” And on social media frantic investors programmers and Nvidia fans (yes they’re a thing) posted photos of a computer chip called Blackwell as if they had captured the moment Michael Jackson did the moonwalk for the first time But it’s not just Nvidia that has been taken by extreme FOMO Even crypto has made a vertiginous comeback driving the weirdest asset on earth to new heights Though Bitcoin fell to around $16000 last November and didn’t seem like it would ever make a comeback mainstream retail investors are again increasingly flocking to Bitcoin and its associated ETFs Buyers have started scooping up more of this nebulous digital thing with no physical value or mainstream use case As such the market has driven Bitcoin to break records with the cryptocurrency surpassing $70000 a coin earlier this month Memecoins and shitcoins and even NFTs are making a comeback A venture capitalist told me the problem is that there is just too much money flowing into tech and as a result everything is rising—and not necessarily in a good way “Too much water and you get malarial mosquitoes; too much cash and you get shitcoins” the VC aptly noted You can look further than tech companies to see other markets’ valuations also soaring because of FOMO For example several of the Big Pharma companies producing GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic and Mounjaro have also seen their market caps skyrocket with stocks like Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk more than doubling or nearly doubling over the past year So how does this all end? The institutional investor thinks badly “We have two Americas right now We have the America where people have money in the markets and they are chasing three exciting narratives—GLPs AI and crypto—in the face of irrationality in the markets And the FOMO is getting out of control” he said “Then you have another America who despite what the Consumer Price Index claims can’t afford their rent can’t afford food and can’t afford to take their kids to Disneyland or even to the movies If this divide continues the American experiment and capitalism itself are at risk” Once again we’re at a crossroads similar to what was faced in 1636 (tulips) 1999 (dot-com) and 2008 (housing) with speculation and innovation indistinguishably intertwined As more companies grow to trillion-dollar valuations or companies like Nvidia grow to be worth another trillion and another and another it’s become increasingly clear that the current euphoria surrounding companies like Nvidia—and by extension the broader tech crypto and pharma markets—is a double-edged sword For some there have been unprecedented opportunities for wealth creation But the FOMO investors are only adding pressure to pressure points already set to burst and if this bubble collapses—or should I say when it collapses—it could bring more than just Nvidia down with it The Dream House That Became a Nightmare on Hollywood Boulevard Lorraine Nicholson’s Childhood at the Playboy Mansion How a Murder Spree Collided With Hollywood’s Punk Revolution Inside Trump’s Pants-Pissingly Terrifying Plans for a Second Term Who Were the Swans?
