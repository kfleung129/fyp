Investors didn\u2019t like that news, and made nearly $8 billion in market cap for the luxury brand\u2019s owner Kering disappear yesterday. The U.S. wants to know whether Ether is a security or not. To find out, the Securities and Exchange Commission reportedly subpoenaed three companies as part of a probe of the Ethereum Foundation. Meanwhile, the price of Bitcoin is all over the place. Mercedes and Chrysler are recalling more than 150,000 cars because of safety issues. Together, the two automakers have recalled nearly 950,000 vehicles in the U.S. this year (so far). Amazon kicked off what it\u2019s calling a \u201cBig Spring Sale.\u201d Bank of America projected that the six-day event could generate billions of dollars in revenue for the company. Today\u2019s the day \u2014 Reddit shares are expected to hit the market at $34 a pop, with the goal of raising $748 million. But is the stock a buy? The answer is complicated. \ud83e\udd0f Reddit isn\u2019t profitable, and hasn\u2019t been since it was founded in 2005. But its losses are shrinking, slimming by \u200b\u200b43% between 2022 and 2023. \ud83e\udee8 Demand for Reddit\u2019s stock far exceeds supply. Still, some experts say to wait and see how the stock performs, especially after its first quarter earnings. \ud83e\udd2a Reddit could get memed by its own users. There has already been talk on WallStreetBets about short-selling Reddit stock on its first day of trading. \ud83e\udd16 Reddit\u2019s AI agreement with Google could be short-sighted. While it\u2019ll initially generate revenue, the actual site could lose luster if its information becomes readily available through AI. Here\u2019s what else to consider before buying, as well as five defining moments for Reddit, how much its CEO is paid, and pretty much everything else you need to know before its IPO. More American millionaires are becoming expats, even as the U.S. remains the place to be for millionaires hailing from other places. The grass, as they say, is always greener. Last year, a record number of American clients at Henley & Partners \u2014 a firm that specializes in helping uber-rich clients invest their way into gaining residence and citizenship elsewhere \u2014 were making inquiries. As in, 504% more compared to 2019. That\u2019s a lot of rich people trying to jump the Good Ship America. \u201cMotivations range from mitigating political risk, opening up business opportunities abroad, seeking lower taxes, and enhancing global mobility,\u201d Mehdi Kadiri, managing partner and head of North America at Henley & Partners, wrote in a blog post. Bruce Gil has more, as well as where millionaires in the U.S. tend to drop an anchor (when they do stay, at least). It\u2019s been a good spring for Nvidia. But it\u2019s also been a good spring to be anywhere near Nvidia. Just ask the various companies Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang mentioned working with from the stage at the \u201cWoodstock of AI.\u201d Or ask Samsung, which is only reportedly working with Nvidia. It\u2019s a little Taylor Swift-like \u2014 even being in Huang\u2019s leather jacket-clad orbit is good for business right now. Which is a lot like Goldman Sachs analysts described in their note about phases to look out for when investing in AI. It won\u2019t all be about Nvidia; there are a lot of other companies already feeling the effects. \ud83d\ude98 Ohio thinks an app could replace driving instructors \u26a0\ufe0f Mercedes and Chrysler are recalling more than 150,000 vehicles over safety issues \ud83c\udf2f Chipotle is doing a 50-for-1 stock split. Here\u2019s what that means \ud83d\udcb0 Boeing\u2019s brutal start to 2024 will cost it a ton of cash, executive warns \ud83d\udcb8 Amazon co-founder MacKenzie Scott doubles her charitable donations after Elon Musk\u2019s criticism \ud83d\udc8e The stock of the world\u2019s largest diamond jeweler is tanking because people aren\u2019t getting engaged KFC tried out the Chizza. Their pizza/chicken combo is not the only weird thing they\u2019ve put on their menu over the years. Chick-fil-A is also trying out pizza. Down is up and up is down and nothing makes sense anymore. The solar eclipse isn\u2019t the only space event happening April 8. The devil\u2019s comet is scheduled to make an accompanying appearance. Super diamonds are something we definitely won\u2019t use for engagements but are likely up in space. It may also be possible to grow them in a lab one day. Tail lights of the future could be QR-type codes for autonomous vehicles to read. If you think the future of tail lights sounds interesting, wait until you hear about the past.
