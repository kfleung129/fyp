Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter which explores what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world Tim Cook is making a high-profile visit to China that coincides with Apple opening a huge new store in Shanghai — its second biggest in the world It’s all part of a push by the company to reverse a decline in iPhone sales in its most important international market The new $116 million outlet — located in Shanghai’s central district of Jing’an which is named after a historic temple — is the biggest in China and the second only to Apple’s flagship store on New York’s Fifth Avenue Chinese state media reported “Nonghao Shanghai!” Apple CEO Cook said in a Weibo post on Wednesday which means “hello” in Shanghainese “I’m always so happy to be back in this remarkable city” Cook said he had spent the morning enjoying a traditional breakfast of what appeared to be soup dumplings and soy milk and taking selfies along the city’s famous Bund waterfront with local actor Zheng Kai In Shanghai mainland China’s financial hub Apple now has eight stores the largest number of any city in the country There are currently 47 Apple stores in 24 cities across mainland China The new addition comes as Apple (AAPL) tries to fend off competitors and revive sales in a rocky market with growing headwinds ranging from an economic slowdown to geopolitical tensions and rising nationalist sentiment Related article Apple iPhones sales fall 24% in China amid competition and headwinds In 2023 Apple grabbed the top spot in China’s smartphone market for the first time ever with a record 173% market share according to IDC Research But during the first six weeks of 2024 iPhone sales in the country slumped 24% from a year ago according to a separate report by Counterpoint Research from earlier this month Apple’s market share slid behind that of Vivo Huawei and Honor in that period it added while rival Huawei’s sales soared 64% Cook’s visit his third to the country in a year underscores China’s significance to Apple as its biggest overseas market and a critical part of its manufacturing supply chain “China remains a critical market for Apple particularly in the premium segment above $800 where it holds a dominant position” said Ivan Lam senior analyst from Counterpoint “With Huawei’s resurgence and other Chinese [phone makers] gaining traction in offline sales Apple is proactively strengthening its offline presence leveraging flagship stores as a key tool to promote high-end smartphones” he said Earlier this month Apple announced it would expand its research center in Shanghai to support all of its product lines and unveiled plans to open a new applied research lab in Shenzhen later this year “China is the heart and lungs of Apple’s growth strategy as Cupertino doubles down on its China strategy with these moves” said Daniel Ives managing director and senior equity analyst at Wedbush Securities On Wednesday Cook hosted an information sharing session along with three of Apple’s suppliers — BYD Lens Technology and Everwin Precision Technology — at its Shanghai office according to state media reports “There’s no supply chain in the world more critical to Apple than that of China” Cook told a group of reporters Related article Here’s what you need to know about BYD the Chinese EV giant that just overtook Tesla He met with Wang Chuanfu founder and chairman of BYD the world’s largest electrical vehicle maker at the session according to a video he posted on his Weibo account Cook praised Chinese suppliers as having “the most advanced manufacturing in the world” according to China Daily The Apple CEO also visited a film production studio talked with mobile game developers and took photos with a crowd of shoppers and staff according to his social media posts “Cook is not taking a step back from China It’s the opposite as competition from Huawei ramps up domestically” Ives said Apple still has many fans in the country More than a hundred of them waited in line overnight to be among the first to enter the new store or to get a photo with Cook according to videos and state media reports circulated on Weibo Others told CNN they were planning to go “I’ll go and kinda ‘worship’ the store” said Dolores a movie producer in Beijing She has been using the iPhone iPad and MacBook for years “I’ve already grown used to its design and the system” she said calling the products “sleek and beautiful” Wei a Beijing resident also said he would visit “I’ve heard that it’s quite big” he said “I just want to have a look” Both said they would stay loyal to the brand despite rising calls on the Chinese internet for consumers to switch to homegrown brands to show their patriotism “Some Chinese brands like Huawei are also doing well with their products But [I won’t switch] It should be about mutual achievement [for Apple and Chinese brands] rather than hostility” Dolores said “For international products if you like a brand there should be no geopolitical divisions” Wei said “Just look at the products” Most stock quote data

ago","https://www.tomsguide.com/ai/i-cover-ai-for-a-living-and-heres-why-i-think-apple-is-the-company-to-watch-in-this-space","When you purchase through links on our site we may earn an affiliate commission Here’s how it works Lots of money huge research division billions of AI ready devices While it might feel like the world of artificial intelligence sprung up out of nowhere in the past 18 months it’s a technology almost as old as the computer industry itself Even generative AI the type that powers ChatGPT MidJourney and Sora has its earliest roots in the 1950s but what changed in the past few years is scale AI has gone from being the domain of research and high tech to being in everything we touch — including our cellphones This is a result of advances in computing power access to data and new technologies like the foundation models powering chatbots image generators and similar modern wonders Rather than missing out on this new industrial revolution as Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang calls it it feels more like Apple is the AI dark horse well positioned to seize the opportunity and emerge as a leader in the field Apple has a large and very active team of researchers working on various AI projects it is reportedly putting more than $1 billion a year into AI research and it is buying AI startups faster than anyone else It also uses machine learning techniques throughout the business and the technology is embedded throughout its products Every modern Apple device includes a neural engine as part of the onboard Apple Silicon chip easily capable of running some small to mid size language models and its researchers have developed techniques to make that even more efficient While Apple may have been late to the AI hype game they’ve been heavily invested and involved in researching — and more importantly deploying — machine learning in software and hardware for years From weather to health through camera capabilities and even transcription many of these processes rely on Apple developed or acquired AI and often run locally with no need to send sensitive data to the cloud Yes Siri is terrible in comparison to other modern AI assistants but it’s also not as terrible as many claim For a script-based AI assistant it can be powerful if used with shortcuts or other external functions Its also tipped for a big upgrade Siri also has a handicap not found in other tools It is running a lot of functionality especially in relation personal data completely on device whereas its peers like Google Assistant and Alexa rely on sending data out to the cloud for processing This is part of Apples strict privacy and security policies that require personal data is kept secure While the company does utilize the cloud it processes information locally first This requirement means it isnt going through the most powerful GPUs sitting in a data center but through a tiny chip inside your phone However Siri is just the face of Apple’s AI It is the most obvious and not even close to the cleverest For example the ability to copy text in an image click a link in a screenshot or even transcribe your words — all AI We don’t know for certain Apple is actually planning to use Google AI or even whether it is Apple that made the first approach After all Google pays Apple a lot of money to make it the default search engine maybe its hoping for a similar deal for Gemini making it a default AI offering in iWork or Messages The talks are rumored and even if they are happening we have no way of knowing what they are about until Apple makes an announcement Solving the Siri issue is not an insurmountable problem for such a large company to overcome One solution at least short term could be to license models from other companies like Google or OpenAI while it builds its own — like Ferret or MM1 My instinct tells me that the rumored deal with Google is little more than a developer play Apple has an extensive library of developer tools and resources and making Gemini Nano available on the iPhone natively would be a clever move It’s a powerful and small language model that developers can build to for Android already By licensing it for iPhone Apple makes it easier for a developer to write once for iPhone and Android and use the same model to power the system Apple is a very large company with some incredible researchers a lot of money to acquire other companies and more than a billion devices of varying size and capability in the hands of people worldwide Most of these devices have the capability of running AI models to some degree Apple’s researchers have been busy publishing a range of papers on ways to make large AI models work on smaller devices with less powerful processors and less memory They have also worked on frameworks like MLX that make running open AI models on Apple hardware trivial and more efficient While it is being very public about its research Apple remains as tight lipped as ever about its products The team have also created new models of their own including the early open source Ferret offering insight into multimodality at the same time the big players were also releasing multimodal models Recently they revealed MM1 a family of models trained on synthetic data and with a surprisingly good response rate from a single prompt — just what you need to power a consumer focused easy to use Siri 20 The company has also been testing a GPT-style chatbot internally built on widely used open architecture and while it is being very public about its research Apple remains as tight lipped as ever about its products That is why I call them the dark horse in the AI race Bring on WWDC 2024!

No problem The stock still seems inexpensive trading at 136 times trailing earnings while its five-year average P/E is 147 There are a few reasons why forward-looking investors will want to gas up on Chevron stock now For one management is taking a judicious approach to the payout Over the past three years Chevrons payout ratio has averaged a conservative 498% Chevron is also developing assets in the Gulf of Mexico and the Permian where it expects production to grow 10% in 2024 compared to 2023 While the price of oil has ebbed from when West Texas Intermediate the North American oil benchmark was trading over $100 per barrel in 2022 it has been rising lately which may give Chevron stock a boost Even if it doesnt though Chevron stock is a smart way to generate strong passive income -- a strategy of which the Oracle of Omaha is well aware Daniel Foelber (Coca-Cola): Coke will generally underperform in a growth-led bull market and outperform during a bear market Heres how the stock stacks up to the S&P 500 since 2020 Company/Index 2024 (YTD as of March 15) 2023 2022 2021 2020 Coca-Cola 16% (74%) 74% 8% (09%) S&P 500 73% 242% (194%) 269% 163% Data source: YCharts Granted these returns dont factor in dividends But still Coke has underperformed the market which is expected because the market has done so well over the period However when growth stocks collapsed in 2022 and the market had a terrible year Coke came through big time and outperformed the index by 26 percentage points The best way to invest in Coke isnt to try to beat the market but to collect a steady stream of passive income from a reliable company With limited ways to expand the business beyond strategic mergers and acquisitions -- which Coke has done an excellent job of over the last few years -- its pretty much impossible for the company to keep pace with a growth-fueled market However there are signs that Coke is becoming a higher-quality company Its price raises were a massive success as the company navigated supply chain constraints and offset inflationary effects Its operating margin is over 283% which is impressively high For context Apples operating margin is 308% The main reason why Berkshire has held Coke for over 30 years is because of the companys growing dividend and buybacks which reward shareholders without the need to sell stock With a yield of 32% and a price-to-earnings ratio of 242 Coke isnt that expensive and it yields more than double the S&P 500 Coke is a perfect fit for investors who are focused on capital preservation instead of capital appreciation are looking to supplement income in retirement or are risk-averse Expect Coke to continue underperforming a growth-led market but to outperform if the narrative flips Should you invest $1000 in Apple right now?

8,"3 Billionaires Are Selling Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Nvidia and Buying These 10 AI Stocks Instead","1 hour ago","https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/stocks/AAPL-Q/pressreleases/24947702/3-billionaires-are-selling-artificial-intelligence-ai-stock-nvidia-and-buying-these-10-ai-stocks-instead/","For three decades investors have been privy to no shortage of next-big-thing investment trends Although nothing has been as transformative as the advent of the internet innovations and trends that have included genome decoding businesses-to-business commerce 3D printing blockchain technology and the metaverse have captivated the attention of professional and everyday investors alike At the moment nothing is piquing the interest of investors quite like the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution With machine learning software and systems have the ability to evolve over time and become more proficient at their task(s) Its what gives AI such broad-scale appeal in virtually every sector and industry Its also whats made semiconductor stock Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) the hottest thing since sliced bread Image source: Getty Images Although Nvidias graphics processing units (GPUs) have been popular with the personal-computing gaming community for well over a decade and its GPUs have gained traction with cryptocurrency miners during major crypto bull markets its high-compute data centers where the companys infrastructure has shone brightest Nvidias A100 and H100 GPUs are nothing short of dominant in AI-accelerated data centers Analysts at Citigroup opined last year that Nvidia could control upwards of a 90% share of GPUs deployed by enterprises in high-compute data centers in 2024 Whats really helped Nvidia is the scarcity of its top-notch GPUs Since demand has swamped supply its been able to meaningfully increase the price of the GPUs it has available which led to its sales more than doubling in fiscal 2024 (Nvidias fiscal year ended in late January) But not everyone is on board with the Nvidia growth story Based on the latest round of Form 13F filings from the Securities and Exchange Commission eight billionaire investors reduced their respective funds stakes in this Wall Street darling In particular three billionaire money managers cut their funds stake by more than 1 million shares including: While some of this selling could be nothing more than benign profit-taking Nvidia does have a growing list of headwinds to contend with this year In addition to increasing external competition the company is expected to contend with mounting internal AI-GPU competition from its top customers the potential for margin cannibalization and ongoing export restrictions to China Whats perhaps even more interesting is examining the collective 10 artificial intelligence stocks these three billionaires were buying as they were selling shares of Nvidia Image source: Getty Images No billionaire money manager dumped more shares of Nvidia during the fourth quarter than Millenniums Israel Englander While he and his team were busy paring down their stake in Wall Streets top-performing megacap stock they were mashing the buy button for a trio of Magnificent Seven components including: The why? behind these buys is simple: Theyre respective industry leaders Alphabets Google has accounted for more than 90% of global monthly internet search share dating back nearly nine years Meanwhile Amazons e-commerce marketplace is far-and-away the worlds leading online retail site while Amazon Web Services (AWS) holds the highest share of cloud infrastructure service spend Lastly Apples iPhone controls more than half of the domestic smartphone market share But these Magnificent Seven components are also counting on AI to fuel their future growth Alphabet and Amazon are some of Nvidias top customers that are currently developing their own AI chips Both companies are incorporating generative AI solutions into their respective cloud infrastructure service platforms to help businesses build applications and tailor their message(s) to consumers Apple is also developing AI infrastructure of its own with the companys processors capable of running generative AI on MacBook For the moment Apples AI ties are primarily its integration of solutions such as predictive text on the iPhone Its pretty clear that Israel Englander sees considerably more upside in Nvidias peers within the Magnificent Seven The second-biggest billionaire seller of Nvidia stock during the fourth quarter was Susquehannas Jeff Yass While Yass and his investment aides slashed their funds Nvidia stake by 27% they were purchasing a trio of time-tested businesses with artificial intelligence ties that should be able to withstand a potential bursting of the AI bubble including: As noted the key point about these AI stocks is that if the AI bubble were to burst their core operations would presumably prevent them from getting caught up in any major downdraft For example Alibaba is Chinas No 1 e-commerce platform with Taobao and Tmall collectively accounting for a nearly 51% share of online retail sales Alibaba Cloud is also No 1 in market share in China (as of March 2023) and should continue to thrive given that enterprise cloud-service spending is still in its very early stages Tesla is North Americas largest electric-vehicle (EV) manufacturer and the only pure-play EV maker thats been generating a recurring profit Though it incorporates AI solutions into its self-driving technology the companys success is ultimately determined by its ability to sell or lease EVs If history were to repeat itself and the AI bubble were to burst Teslas operating results would ultimately dictate where its share price heads over the long run Meanwhile Microsoft has its cash-cow legacy segments to fall back on such as Windows and Office as well as its high-growth initiatives which include cloud infrastructure service platform Azure -- the worldwide No 2 cloud infrastructure service provider by spend behind only AWS Although Microsoft is betting big on AI arguably more so than Alibaba or Tesla it would likely be just fine if AI expectations are tempered at some point in the not-too-distant future The final billionaire that was an aggressive seller of Nvidia stock during the December-ended quarter was Steven Cohen at Point72 Asset Management While Cohen and his team were busy paring down Point72s stake in AI infrastructure kingpin Nvidia by 66% they were buying four ancillary beneficiaries of the AI movement including: Similar to what Jeff Yass did at Susquehanna Point72s investment team looks to be de-risking the fund by focusing on businesses that can benefit from AI but have less direct exposure if and when the bubble bursts Whereas total sales for Oracles recently reported quarter (ended Feb 29 2024) were up just 7% infrastructure-as-a-service sales catapulted 49% from the prior-year period While Oracle can easily lean on its legacy bread-and-butter segments if AI experiences a demand reset its well-positioned to be a long-term winner in AI infrastructure Western Digital is a potentially sneaky play on AI-driven storage Just as Western Digital experienced a surge in demand during the initial wave of enterprise cloud-service spending the growing storage demand needs in AI-accelerated data centers should be music to the ears of management It could pave a path for the companys high-transfer-rate NAND flash memory solutions to become standard in data centers To keep with the theme Dell Technologies has its core computing segments it can lean on if an AI bubble were to materialize Nevertheless its witnessed exceptionally strong demand for customizable rack servers used by businesses operating AI-accelerated data centers Though this makes up a small percentage of Dells business at the moment it positions the company to sustainably benefit over the long run as AI solutions proliferate Cohen and his team also piled into robotic-assisted surgical systems developer Intuitive Surgical This is a company thats utilizing AI to help surgeons study their own procedural data to improve patient outcomes Ultimately the company should enjoy sustained double-digit sales growth as the da Vinci surgical system gobbles up share in a variety of soft-tissue surgical indications No company comes remotely close to the installed base of assisted-surgical systems that Intuitive Surgical has put in place
