Tim Cook\u00a0is making a high-profile visit to China that coincides\u00a0with Apple opening a huge new store in Shanghai \u2014 its second biggest in the world.\u00a0It\u2019s all part of a push\u00a0by the company to reverse a decline in iPhone sales in its most important international market. The new $11.6 million outlet \u2014 located in Shanghai\u2019s central district of Jing\u2019an, which is named after a historic temple \u2014 is the biggest in China and the second only to Apple\u2019s flagship store on New York\u2019s Fifth Avenue, Chinese state media reported. \u201cNonghao Shanghai!\u201d Apple CEO Cook said in a Weibo post on Wednesday, which means \u201chello\u201d in Shanghainese.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m always so happy to be back in this remarkable city.\u201d Cook said he had spent the morning enjoying a traditional breakfast of what appeared to be soup dumplings and soy milk and taking selfies along the city\u2019s famous Bund waterfront with local actor Zheng Kai. In Shanghai, mainland China\u2019s financial hub, Apple now has eight stores, the largest number of any city in the country. There are currently 47 Apple stores in 24 cities across mainland China. The new addition comes as Apple (AAPL) tries to fend off competitors and revive sales in a rocky market with growing headwinds, ranging from an economic slowdown to geopolitical tensions and rising nationalist sentiment.

But during the first six weeks of 2024, iPhone sales in the country slumped 24% from a year ago, according to a separate report by Counterpoint Research from earlier this month. Apple\u2019s market share slid behind that of Vivo, Huawei, and Honor in that period, it added, while rival Huawei\u2019s sales soared 64%. Cook\u2019s visit, his third to the country in a year, underscores China\u2019s significance to Apple as its biggest overseas market and a critical part of its manufacturing supply chain. \u201cChina remains a critical market for Apple, particularly in the premium segment above $800, where it holds a dominant position,\u201d said Ivan Lam, senior analyst from Counterpoint. \u201cWith Huawei\u2019s resurgence and other Chinese [phone makers] gaining traction in offline sales, Apple is proactively strengthening its offline presence, leveraging flagship stores as a key tool to promote high-end smartphones,\u201d he said. Earlier this month, Apple announced it would expand its research center in Shanghai to support all of its product lines and unveiled plans to open a new applied research lab in Shenzhen later this year. \u201cChina is the heart and lungs of Apple\u2019s growth strategy as Cupertino doubles down on its China strategy with these moves,\u201d said Daniel Ives, managing director and senior equity analyst at Wedbush Securities. On Wednesday, Cook hosted an information sharing session along with three of Apple\u2019s suppliers \u2014 BYD, Lens Technology and Everwin Precision Technology \u2014 at its Shanghai office, according to state media reports. \u201cThere\u2019s no supply chain in the world more critical to Apple than that of China,\u201d Cook told a group of reporters.

Cook praised Chinese suppliers as having \u201cthe most advanced manufacturing in the world,\u201d according to China Daily. The Apple CEO also visited a film production studio, talked with mobile game developers and took photos with a crowd of shoppers and staff, according to his social media posts. \u201cCook is not taking a step back from China. It\u2019s the opposite as competition from Huawei ramps up domestically,\u201d Ives said. Apple still has many fans in the country. More than a hundred of them waited in line overnight to be among the first to enter the new store or to get a photo with Cook, according to videos and state media reports circulated on Weibo. Others told CNN they were planning to go. \u201cI\u2019ll go and kinda \u2018worship\u2019 the store,\u201d said Dolores, a movie producer in Beijing. She has been using the iPhone, iPad and MacBook for years. \u201cI\u2019ve already grown used to its design and the system,\u201d she said, calling the products \u201csleek and beautiful.\u201d Wei, a Beijing resident, also said he would visit. \u201cI\u2019ve heard that it\u2019s quite big,\u201d he said. \u201cI just want to have a look.\u201d Both said they would stay loyal to the brand, despite rising calls on the Chinese internet for consumers to switch to homegrown brands to show their patriotism. \u201cSome Chinese brands like Huawei are also doing well with their products. But [I won\u2019t switch.] It should be about mutual achievement [for Apple and Chinese brands], rather than hostility,\u201d Dolores said. \u201cFor international products, if you like a brand, there should be no geopolitical divisions,\u201d Wei said. \u201cJust look at the products.\u201d Most stock quote data provided by BATS.
