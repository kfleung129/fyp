    "text": "Open cloud network technologies, until now only tentatively adopted by telcos in Latin America, could expand in the next few years. \u201cWe're already growing with unusual figures in the Latin American market, adding new countries and operators,\u201d Jos\u00e9 Miguel Guzm\u00e1n, cloud telco solutions architect at US-based cloud firm Whitestack, told BNamericas. Guzm\u00e1n expects that \u201ca couple of large operators\u201d in Latin America will begin the transition to open technologies this year. Whitestack is one of the providers for Telef\u00f3nica's telco cloud, the first telecommunications group in the region to implement this open cloud-based model. In addition to Whitestack, the Spanish operator also works with \u201ca dozen\u201d manufacturers that have decided to adopt a cloud-native deployment model, Guzm\u00e1n said. Telef\u00f3nica began the migration three years ago in \u201cpractically all the countries where they operate [in Latin America]: Mexico, Colombia, Chile, Argentina, Uruguay and Peru,\u201d he added. Some of the operator's services are already being offered through open technologies. According to Guzm\u00e1n, the change towards more efficient technologies allowed the financial situation of the Madrid-based company to improve. \u201cIn a short time, Telef\u00f3nica has gone from a scenario in which they were very bad and today they're generating a level of profit comparable to European operations,\u201d said Guzm\u00e1n. While there is expected to be greater adoption among large operators, mid-sized telcos are also embarking on the transition to open technologies. Whitestack's first open technologies project in telecommunications was for Mundo in Chile. Announced in 2020, it saw the increase of network capacity through open disaggregated networking technologies from IP Infusion and Whitestack. Guzm\u00e1n says the operator's success in terms of broadband service speed is directly associated with the engineering decisions that have been made in the past. \u201cOpen technology meant lower costs and better performance,\u201d he added. PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS In mid-2023, AMD, Whitestack and Dell Technologies announced a telco cloud certification center in Chile. The initiative allows engineers and operators' specialists to develop, test and execute services and applications. One of the advantages of migrating to open environments is the possibility of implementing technologies on conventional X86 servers. AMD offers an improvement in performance, reducing the cost per processor and the existing infrastructure. This is important for the reduction of energy consumption, as well as for the limitations that operators now have when allocating capex. \u201cIt\u2019s an industry that is facing an adverse scenario around the world, ARPU is going down but costs aren't. Internet traffic is increasing, but not income,\u201d said Guzm\u00e1n. In the case of energy consumption, it is not only about reducing electricity bills, but also about making buildings more efficient by putting greater processing capacity in less space. \u201cIn Buenos Aires, Montevideo or Santiago there are places that come from the old telephone exchanges and that's where they [the operators] are developing the network today. And they have limited capacity, they need to preserve space and energy,\u201d Juan Moscoso, regional datacenter and cloud leader for AMD's Spanish-speaking South America region, told BNamericas. \"Telco's find it very difficult [to make investments in technology] because they either don't have adequate air conditioning or they don't have additional power capabilities, or they don't have physical rack space,\" he said. \"We're managing to be much more sustainable,\" added Moscoso, who claims to be able to achieve better yields with less infrastructure and at a lower cost. In tests conducted with cloud architecture, virtual machines and Dell servers with AMD, the performance of traditional servers was multiplied by 10. \u201cNormally a network function generates 30-40Gbs on a server, we [with AMD] are achieving 360Gbs,\u201d said Guzm\u00e1n. According to Moscoso, AMD is achieving between 3.0 and 3.7 times the performance of the competition. At the time of the announcement of the new telco cloud laboratory in Chile, Dell said it had been able to demonstrate that the total cost of ownership fell by 30% and capex by 23% with the new generation of Dell PowerEdge servers. Likewise, reductions in energy consumption, space and infrastructure allow for projected opex savings of almost 37%. Currently a network functions manufacturer is using the laboratory to test its technology.
