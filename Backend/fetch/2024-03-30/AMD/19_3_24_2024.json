The AMD Radeon 760M is an integrated GPU in the Ryzen 7040 series for laptops (Phoenix, e.g. Ryzen 5 7640HS). The iGPU is based on the new RDNA3 architecture and has 8 of the 12 CUs (= 512 shaders) clocked at up to 2.8 GHz (depending on the CPU model). As the predecessor Radeon 660M, the 760M supports hardware raytracing, although the performance is too slow to use it in current games. \nThanks to the new architecture and higher clock speeds, the Radeon 760M should be clearly faster then the old\u00a0Radeon 660M. \nThanks to the modern 4nm process and clever power-saving features, the power consumption is comparatively low (according to AMD). The whole chip of the first two models can be configured between 15 - 54 Watt TDP. The AMD Radeon 760M is an integrated GPU in the Ryzen 7040 series for laptops (Phoenix, e.g. Ryzen 5 7640HS).
