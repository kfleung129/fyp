    "text": "American microchip manufacturer AMD announces plans to actively promote personal computers with artificial intelligence functions on the market. The company expects thus to strengthen its competitive position in the fight against NVIDIA and Intel. According to AMD president Victor Peng, the company plans to actively expand into the segment of personal computers with AI functions. He added that the market for computers with artificial intelligence will continue to expand, and the firm expects sales of such devices to grow in the second half of the year. With the recent release of its new Ryzen processors, AMD is now \"very well positioned in both artificial intelligence and other business areas,\" according to Peng. The company intends to capitalise on the strong demand for AI technology to grow its market share. According to a Canalys study, sales of AI-enabled PCs could account for 60 per cent of the total PC market by 2027. That is, AMD is betting on a promising segment, where the main competition with other microchip manufacturers will be deployed in the coming years. Source: CNBC "
