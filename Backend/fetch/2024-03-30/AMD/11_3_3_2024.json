On-board graphics are not up to snuff for achieving optimal results, especially for modern games, especially if you want to push past 1080P. However, high-end GPUs can be expensive, often costing over $500, making them unaffordable for many who want to enjoy a game or edit video. Fortunately, even mid-range and low-end GPUs are improving, and we are here to present the Best Mid-Range GPU 2024 so you can make an informed decision with your hard-earned money. AMD and NVIDIA have some competition this year for Best Mid-Range GPU 2024 with the recent release of Intel Arc, combined with all brands finding new ways to make even affordable graphics something worth owning. With the use of upscaling, even a sub-$400 can deliver fantastic results at 1440P, and with all new cards supporting AV1 for video encoding, mid-range video cards no longer need to feel like you are cut off at the knees when you look to do serious gaming or work. If you want to upgrade your gaming PC but money is tight, here are our winners for the Best Mid-Range GPU 2024. Writer: Brendan Frye NVIDIA\u2019s GeForce RTX 40 series graphics cards have made quite a splash since their launch last fall, delivering exceptional performance powered by the company\u2019s new Ada Lovelace architecture. While the flagship RTX 4090 and 4080 models grabbed most of the headlines, NVIDIA also released the more mainstream\u00a0RTX 4060 Ti\u00a0in two memory configurations: 8 GB and a new 16 GB variant. I\u2019ve had the chance to thoroughly test out the 16 GB model, which packs the same GPU as the 8 GB but with double the video memory, and this mixes things up more than you may expect. Ultimately, it feels like the ASUS ProArt GeForce RTX 4060 Ti 16 GB GPU was created to plug a product gap rather than deliver good value. Unless you absolutely need 16 GB VRAM, better options exist, both new and last-generation. The 4060 Ti 16 GB is only for niche buyers who prioritize capacity over all else. For everyone else, keep looking at more balanced price/performance choices. The ASUS ProArt GeForce RTX 4060 Ti 16 GB caters to niche needs, leaving most users better served by more balanced alternatives. Writer: Brendan Frye It took some time, but finally, NVIDIA unveiled a GPU laser-focused on the mid-range market, the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 Ti 8 GB Founders Edition GPU. This latest addition to the Ada-based GPU lineup provides a tantalizing high-performance, mid-range graphics card option based on the new Ada architecture. As the successor to the beloved Ampere-based RTX 3060 Ti, the RTX 4060 Ti promises improved gaming performance and enhanced features. With a $399 MSRP, this new GPU has the potential to be a popular choice among gamers seeking a powerful yet affordable upgrade, although it\u2019s not without issues. Despite its limitations, the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 Ti 8GB Founders Edition remains a solid choice for gamers who did not invest in the RTX 30 or RX 6000-series cards. With new features like DLSS 3 and all the improvements in efficiency, the RTX 4060 Ti is a solid performer and one that will make any mid-range enthusiast gamer very happy. While I hope the card sees a slight price drop as more offerings enter the market, for people looking to get the best from 1080P and 1440P gaming and are in need of an upgrade, few cards can beat out what the RTX 4060 TI brings to the table. The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 Ti 8 GB GPU is a solid mid-range contender with impressive efficiency, DLSS 3 support, and good performance, but for those with an RTX 3060, it may not be a big enough jump for the $399 price of entry. Writer: Matt Keith AMD is Pushing hard to be the top choice for GPUs this season. The newly released RX 7700 XT (and its companion, the\u00a0RX 7800 XT) are hot off the press and ready to take on NVIDIA\u2019s RTX 4060Ti and 4070, respectively. Packed with the latest AMD technology, the Radeon RX 7700 XT is prepared to go toe to toe with the competition and offers a powerhouse for 1440p gamers and enthusiasts alike. The Radeon RX 7700 XT is an incredible mid-range card and holds its own against the competition. It offers a host of features and customization and has no problem producing a quality 1440p gaming experience. While ray tracing support is still a bit behind NVIDIA, the ability to adjust settings on the card helps close that gap and the intentional support for content creators both with the new AMD RDNA 3 Media Engine as well as Adrenalin\u2019s built-in content creation suite help offset any shortcomings. Priced at $449.99, the Radeon RX 7700 XT is a card worth considering. Writer: Brendan Frye Things are heating up for gamers, and the graphics card race is getting more competitive, especially with the release of the new Radeon RX 7600. In the competitive world of graphics processing, AMD\u2019s Radeon range has made considerable progress over the past few years, carving out a significant niche in a market dominated by NVIDIA. After a period of relative silence following the release of the\u00a0RX 7900 XTX\u00a0and\u00a0RX 7900 XT, AMD has emerged to shake up the mid-range GPU market once again with its latest release, the $269 AMD Radeon RX 7600. With this new GPU, AMD has expanded the potential of the RX 7000 series to meet a wide range of needs, from enthusiasts to professionals. The Radeon RX 7600 sits comfortably in the mid-range, aiming to deliver superior performance at a reasonable price. It\u2019s a bold attempt to bridge the gap between high-end power and mainstream accessibility, and if our testing is anything to go by, it is working. AMD\u2019s Radeon RX 7600 brings impressive 1080p performance & respectable 1440p gaming to a competitively priced, mid-range GPU. Writer: Brendan Frye Intel is here to shake up the graphics card market with Arc and its mid-range entry, the Intel Arc A750 Limited Edition GPU. While both AMD and NVIDIA have been pushing out flagship GPUs that dominate the high-end, Intel has been taking things slow, releasing cards that deliver on performance while still being affordable. It may not be going head-to-head with the latest 40-series, but it doesn\u2019t have to, as the Intel Arc A750 GPU aims to capture the 1080P market while still delivering the latest features gamers crave. Intel has built an impressive GPU offering with the Arc A750. There is still work to be done to deliver the full potential of the GPU, especially in older games, but even here, Intel is moving fast and have already narrowed the performance hit for\u00a0DirectX 11 games\u00a0with their latest driver suite. For older systems lacking Resize BAR support, Arc simply is not an option, but for a modern build on either Intel or AMD, there is a lot to like with the A750, and at the current price, it is a hard card to pass up. With an aggressive price and impressive benchmarks, provided they have a modern system, the Intel Arc A750 Limited Edition is a fantastic GPU for the mid-range PC gamer looking for an upgrade.
