Published: March 5, 2024 8:50 AM / By: Joseph Allen Nixxes and developer Guerrilla Games have announced the\u00a0Horizon Forbidden West\u00a0PC requirements you're going to need to fulfil if you want to run the game on your machine. In a PlayStation Blog post\u00a0revealing the specs, the two studios say they've worked to create a range of presets in order to ensure that you'll be able to run the game \"on a wide variety of PC hardware\". Hopefully, this should mean that you'll be able to enjoy the delights of\u00a0Horizon Forbidden West Complete Edition\u00a0on PC, even if your computer is a few years old by now. Here's the full\u00a0Horizon Forbidden West\u00a0PC spec sheet. There are four presets, and they'll all require at least 16GB of RAM, as well as 150GB of SSD space and Windows 10 or above as your operating system. Naturally, you'll also find lots of options within\u00a0Horizon Forbidden West's graphics menus that allow you to tweak individual settings like level of detail, shadow quality, and more. It looks like if your machine is somewhere between the aforementioned presets, you should still be able to find something that works for you. Horizon Forbidden West Complete Edition\u00a0arrives on PC on March 21st. It'll pack in both the base game and its\u00a0Burning Shores\u00a0expansion.
