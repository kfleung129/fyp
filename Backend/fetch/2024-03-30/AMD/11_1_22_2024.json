    "text": "ASRock is updating the DeskMeet series with the DeskMeet X600. For context, over a year has passed since the new model was spotted at the Eurasian Economic Commission (EEC) alongside the also new DeskMini X600. In short, the DeskMeet X600 serves as an AMD counterpart to the DeskMeet B660 that ASRock sells with an LGA1700 motherboard. Specifically, the DeskMeet X600 relies upon an X600 ITX motherboard with a Ryzen 7 7700 APU. Thus, the mini-PC will have eight Zen 4 cores at its disposal with 3.8 GHz base and 5.3 GHz boost clock speeds. Additionally, the Raphael series processor has a 65 W TDP, 32 MB L3 cache and an iGPU similar to the Radeon 610M found in various Athlon and Ryzen APUs. Moreover, ASRock equips the DeskMeet X600 with DDR5 7200 MT/s RAM (4x SO-DIMM), a 2 TB SSD (PCIe 5.0) and a 500 W power supply (PSU), all within an 8-litre housing that measures 168 x 219.3 x 218.3 mm. On top of that, the mini-PC features numerous I/O, including five front-mounted USB ports of various standards. While ASRock has not disclosed pricing or availability yet, it has confirmed that the DeskMeet X600 will also support PCIe 4.0 graphics cards.
