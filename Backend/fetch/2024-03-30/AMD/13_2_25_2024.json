If you want to skip our overview of Fisher, his investment firm, and the broader U.S. stock market and macroeconomic environment, then you can take a look at Ken Fisher Portfolio: 5 Biggest Positions. Ken Fisher is one of the richest people in the world courtesy of his hedge fund Fisher Asset Management. The fund had $203 billion in investments spread across its portfolio according to filings with the SEC. Fisher set up his hedge fund nearly five decades ago in 1979 and served as its CEO until 2016 before relinquishing the role. Right now, he's the Executive Chairman of Fisher Investments and holds the title of co-chief investment officer along with Jeff Silk. A $203 billion investment portfolio is no small achievement, even if the highly risky nature of the hedge fund industry sees the biggest players such as Ken Griffin's Citadel and Seth Klarman's Baupost often take leverage to fund their bets and double their returns. Investment portfolios of this size mean that not only do Fisher Investment's clients have to trust the firm, but also that the hedge fund has to demonstrate that it is able to outperform either the market or the economy or at least serve as a buffer against sharp capital depreciation during times of economic turmoil. The start of the year is the tone setting mood for stock markets, and for Fisher Investments, the year did not miss out on a beat after the firm had to jump in to release an unusual press release. This press release countered a report by the Wall Street Journal that had stated that Ken Fisher's firm, over which he holds 100% control through a trust that he shares with his wife, was being sold to the Boston, Massachusetts based private equity firm Advent International. The WSJ was not the only publication that cited anonymous sources for its report, as Bloomberg also published a similar piece which outlined that Advent had had talks to\u00a0 \"acquire billionaire Ken Fisher's eponymous Fisher Investments, according to a person with knowledge of the matter\" but also went on to quote Fisher Investment's response that bluntly denied any such speculation. In fact Fisher's firm, which is quite widely covered in the press and is known for its founder's ability to generate buzz, was quite hard hitting its response. Its press release bluntly stated: Fisher Investments is not being bought by Advent International, or anyone else\u2014plain and simple. The story also had numerous other inaccuracies. Had The Wall Street Journal's reporters bothered to verify the facts, we would have corrected their reporting. Instead, The Wall Street Journal printed the rumors first and followed up with us last. The WSJ's coverage had speculated that not only was Advent having 'talks' to acquire Fisher Investments, but that the hedge fund might see other partners emerge for a deal. Reading Fisher's press release, while it did deny that a transaction was not officially underway, the text nevertheless missed out on sharing any details of potential 'talks' - leading to the assumption that since there were no talks for a potential sale, there was no need to deny them in the press release. Moving forward to other news in 2024, the year has started off by providing investors with the latest data set to read the tea leaves and see where the Federal Reserve's current interest rate hiking cycle will be at the year's close. This data set is the retail sales for January which showed an 0.8% annual drop that came as part of a release that saw the Commerce Department also revise down the data for December. On the surface, this data paints a softer picture of the economy that shows that as consumers face the pinch of high interest rates, they are starting to cut down their spending. However, economists also preached caution after the release, as they speculated that while it is possible that a spending, and by extension economic, slump had led to the sales falling, the contribution of cold temperatures across the U.S. could not be completely ignored in the aftermath of the release. However, and as has been the case for more than a year now, the optimistic data set was followed by the exact opposite just a day later. On Friday, data from the Labor Department revealed that import prices jumped by 0.8% in January, which was the high reading since the first quarter of 2022. In short, nearly a two year old record of an inflationary indicator was broken, and perhaps unsurprisingly, when paired by the producer price index (PPI)'s 0.3% jump in January, futures linked to the S&P 500 and other indexes dropped. With the fourth quarter hedge fund filing season well on its way, we decided to see which stocks Fisher Investments is piling into as the year gets off to a roaring start. Some notable names are Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN).
