    "text": "Published 2024-03-22 18:21 by Hilbert Hagedoorn The Ryzen 7 8700F is anticipated to feature an 8-core and 16-thread configuration, mirroring the 8700G model but without the integrated graphics. On the other hand, the Ryzen 5 8400F's specifications are less certain, positioned between the 8500G and 8300G models, which have notably different configurations. Speculations suggest the 8400F could have a 6-core and 12-thread setup, possibly combining 2 Zen4 and 4 Zen4c cores.   Details regarding the Ryzen 8000F series were limited during the presentation, with the spotlight briefly on these processors in a slide shared by Twitter user HXL. This has led to industry speculation on the exact specifications and configurations of these new models. Previously, AMD had launched the Ryzen 5 7500F, a similar \"F\" series processor without integrated graphics, initially exclusive to the Chinese market before becoming available in other regions. This precedent suggests a possible pattern for the 8700F and 8400F processors, starting with a focus on the Chinese market before potentially expanding availability.
