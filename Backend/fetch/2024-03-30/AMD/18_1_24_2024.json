    "text": "AMD's new Ryzen 8000G APUs are making their way to the Geekbench, which means reviewers are already testing them out. The two Zen4 processors that popped up on the website are the Ryzen 7 8700G and Ryzen 5 8600G. It's only the Ryzen 5 8500G from the DIY range that hasn't made an entry into the benchmarking platform yet. Nonetheless, according to the Geekbench listings, the Ryzen 7 8700G got 2720 points in the single-core test, and on the multi-core test, the APU achieved 14326. In comparison, the predecessor, the Ryzen 7 5700G, gets 1981 and 8737, respectively. So, there's a noticeable performance jump for the new top-end Ryzen 8000G APU. The story is pretty much the same for the Ryzen 5 8600G. This Ryzen 8000G processor gets 2474 in the single-core test and 11453 in the multi-core test. To compare, the predecessor, which is the Ryzen 5 5600G, achieves 1917 and 7662, respectively. AMD has previously revealed that the Ryzen 7 8700G has the highest clock speed among all the desktop APUs it has ever released. Its turbo clock is at 5.1 GHz, which has been translated fairly in the early Geekbench score. The Ryzen 5 8600G sits pretty close, though. Its turbo frequency is at 5.0 GHz. However, it's worth noting that the chip has two fewer Zen4 cores than the 8700G, which, again, reflects on the scores. Another thing that's worth mentioning is that the Ryzen 7 8700G was tested on Geekbench 6.2, while the Ryzen 5 8600G was tested at version 6.0. So, the performance isn't directly comparable. The good news is that more listings should pop up soon as the Ryzen 8000G is very close to launch.
