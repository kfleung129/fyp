We think that the Intel Core i7-14700K is the best overall chipset with the AMD Ryzen 7 7700X being a viable AMD alternative. Let\u2019s get into all the details as to why we\u2019ve made these choices and how much you can expect to spend. Cores 20 (8P + 12E) Threads 28 Base clock 3.4 GHz (P) ; 2.5 GHz (E) Boost clock 5.6 GHz (P) ; 4.3 GHz (E) Socket LGA 1700 The Intel Core i7-14700K takes the top spot for the best overall CPU for Helldivers 2. It\u2019s not quite the most powerful processor in the Raptor Lake refresh line-up, however, it offers incredible price-to-performance for anyone investing in LGA 1700 or upgrading from an older Alder Lake model. This chipset features a staggering 20 cores and 28 threads with a boost clock of up to 5.6 GHz which should be more than enough to handle Helldivers 2 at full throttle. It\u2019s a particularly impressive processor given the fact that you can find it routinely around the $400 which offers exceptional value for money. That\u2019s especially when factoring in that its predecessor, the 13700K clocked in with 16 cores and 20 threads with a lower boost clock of just 5.4 GHz. It may not seem like a massive jump, but as the last hurrah for the Raptor Lake as the third generation chipset on the current socket. Cores 8 Threads 16 Base clock 4.5 GHz Boost clock 5.4 GHz Socket AM5 If you would rather prefer a processor from Team Red then we\u2019ve got you covered, too. We think that the AMD Ryzen 7 7700X is among the best AMD CPUs you can slot into your machine for Helldivers 2. That\u2019s because it\u2019s competitively priced under the $400 mark and offers powerful performance with its 8 cores and 16 threads available to you. It should be more than enough for the new third person shooter in all target resolutions. What\u2019s particularly impressive about the AMD Ryzen 7 7700X is the fast base clock speed of 4.5 GHz out of the box which can be pushed up to 5.4 GHz with overclocking. What\u2019s more, there\u2019s 80MB of L3 cache onboard which should make running the game a breeze. Considering that Helldivers 2 can comfortably run on considerably weaker chipsets, we don\u2019t see a need to splash the cash on the bleeding edge when this mid-range offering can more than keep up. Cores 8 Threads 16 Base clock 3.0 GHz Boost clock 4.1 GHz Socket AM4 There\u2019s no reason why you necessarily have to burn too deep a hole in your pocket and that\u2019s where the AMD Ryzen 7 5700X3D comes in. The second chipset to offer the company\u2019s 3D V-cache, there\u2019s a total of 100MB L3 cache to use in the game, coupled with a relatively low TDP, and support for older DDR4 RAM, too. If you\u2019re building a PC on a budget, then this chipset should serve well for under the $250 mark. It\u2019s equipped with 8 cores and 16 threads with a maximum boost clock of 4.1 GHz. While not the most powerful, it should still have enough horsepower to be able to play Helldivers 2 in 1080p and 1440p without any obvious bottleneck. Just be sure to invest in either an air cooler or an AIO so you can keep this chipset nice and cool when under stress. We\u2019re here to answer any burning questions you have around the best CPU for Helldivers 2. Yes, Helldivers 2 will be releasing on day one alongside its PS5 console release.
