    "text": " Level up your portfolio Advertisement Source: Barone Firenze/Shutterstock.com While the concept of virtual reality may immediately harken images of video games, the reality is that the utility underlying strong buy VR stocks goes well beyond entertainment. Don\u2019t get me wrong \u2013 there\u2019s nothing wrong with gaming-centric VR applications, which represents a booming industry. However, it would be a disservice not to mention the technology\u2019s myriad other uses. First, strong buy VR stocks offer a potential paradigm shift in training and learning. Through engaging and interactive training simulations for various industries \u2013 including medicine, aviation and defense \u2013 operators-in-training can learn valuable skills and safe practices in a controlled, risk-free environment. Stated differently, it\u2019s better to make mistakes in the virtual world and learn from them before entering the real one. Second, VR offers accessibility and connection solutions. Mainly, virtual representations can help break down barriers, enabling people from all over to interact. In addition, those who may suffer from mobility-related challenges can benefit from VR\u2019s enhanced experiences. As well, they offer therapeutic applications, such as pain and fear management. With so many exciting avenues available, you should do yourself a favor and investigate these strong buy VR stocks. With the company changing its name from Facebook to Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), it had little choice but to be one of the strong buy VR stocks. After all, CEO Mark Zuckerberg stated that the identity evolution materialized to reflect growth opportunities in the metaverse. Essentially, the metaverse is a VR space in which users can interact with computer-generated environments and other users. Organically, then, the company invested heavily in its VR headset unit, which became the Quest series of products. As Meta\u2019s website states, Quest enables real connections through virtual hangouts. As well, with the Meta Quest Pro \u2013 which retails for $999.99 \u2013 Meta\u2019s premium VR headset facilitates myriad uses in terms of professional collaboration and creativity. Further, it doesn\u2019t hurt that META has been absolutely flying. Since the beginning of this year, shares gained almost 36% of equity value. That was helped in large part by the company\u2019s recent announcement of a dividend. If that wasn\u2019t enough, META enjoys a strong buy consensus analyst rating with a $522 price target. A company that continues to dominate the broader tech ecosystem, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) doesn\u2019t really need much coaxing. I mean, really, the company sells itself. Since the beginning of the year, MSFT gained almost 12% of market value. Over the trailing year, it popped up a bit more than 57%. Given that its Windows operating system commands 73% of global PC market share, it\u2019s practically relevant on a permanent basis. But that doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t grow any more \u2013 clearly, that\u2019s not the case. Sure enough, the company ranks among the strong buy VR stocks. As a powerhouse in the field of professional and gaming computing applications, Microsoft\u2019s VR unit sees significant demand. As well, the U.S. Army uses the company\u2019s HoloLens technology in high-tech headsets for soldiers. Thus, the tech isn\u2019t just about training but also about protecting servicemembers. Further, with its mixed reality solutions, Microsoft may help advance healthcare. With so many relevancies, it\u2019s no wonder that analysts peg MSFT a consensus strong buy with a $469.45 price target. To be sure, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is not a direct player within the realm of strong buy VR stocks. Instead, the company is a semiconductor firm, garnering fame for its advanced graphics processing units (GPUs). Obviously, Advanced Micro competes with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) in the space. And yeah, you can go with NVDA. But with it skyrocketing again, some concerns of bag-holding exist. On the flipside, while AMD is no slouch, it\u2019s comparatively much more palatable. Not only that, with VR systems rising sharply regarding their capabilities, they simply require more bandwidth. Logically, it takes incredibly computing power to run a VR system due to the immersive digital environment. Moreover, GPUs help in the latency department. There\u2019s nothing more frustrating \u2013 and nauseating \u2013 for your movements to not correspond precisely with their digital representation. And then, you can factor in all the other businesses \u2013 such as blockchain mining \u2013 where AMD is relevant and you have an excellent case for strong buy VR stocks. Analysts mostly agree, with the average price target shooting to $194.16.
