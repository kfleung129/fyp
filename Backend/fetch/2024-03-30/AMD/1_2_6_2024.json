    "text": "Unlike the main Ryzen line which has a sweet spot for memory, AMD\u2019s APUs tend to love fast memory and show some pretty sizeable gains from reaching higher speeds. Something else that loves fast speeds, is overclockers who have managed to push DDR5-10600 MT/s on AMD\u2019s latest Ryzen 8700G APU. As reported by wccftech, overclocker Soonho Jeong, better known as ASUS\u2019s in house OC expert \u2018SafeDisk\u2018 has managed to achieve DDR5 speeds of 10,600MT/s using a ROG Crosshair X670E GENE motherboard and a pair of G.SKILL Trident Z5 memory sticks. This memory was pushed to DDR5 speeds of 10600 MT/s with the stock 1.45V alongside timings of 50-62-62-127-127. Something worth mentioning is that there is supposedly an issue with the latest AGESA BIOS firmware which shows a higher DDR5 memory clock than what is actually running on the memory. To prove this an oscilloscope was used to show that the achieved memory frequency is accurate. Quite the impressive feat for SafeDisk and AMD, if you wish to see the validation of the 10,600MT/s record visit the link here.
