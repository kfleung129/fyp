    "text": "Newegg lowers the price for the 8-core Zen4 CPU with 3D V-Cache.  AMD\u2019s top gaming CPU for the AM5 platform, the Ryzen 7 7800X3D, is back at its lowest price of $349. This price drop, unseen for a few weeks, was last reported around October and briefly in December. The Ryzen 7 7800X3D, an 8-core Zen4 processor with 3D V-Cache, boasts a larger L3 cache compared to the non-X3D version. This translates to major improvements in gaming performance. Additionally, the larger cache allows users to opt for lower frequency DDR5 memory, ultimately reducing the overall system cost. Newegg is currently offering a $349 deal after applying a $20 off coupon. Although this promotion has just started and hasn\u2019t been reflected by other retailers yet.\u00a0 Worth adding that there\u2019s currently no game bundle for Ryzen CPUs, so don\u2019t expect any Star Wars Jedi Survivor codes this time.
