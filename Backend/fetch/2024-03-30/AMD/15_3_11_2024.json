Rick Bergman, former executive vice president at semiconductor giant AMD, joined Seattle-area mobile connectivity company Kymeta as its new CEO, effective April 1. Bergman left AMD in September after four years at the Santa Clara, Calif.-based company. He was previously CEO of Synaptics, a hardware and software giant also based in Silicon Valley. Kymeta\u2019s current co-CEOs Doug Hutcheson and Walter Berger are retiring effective March 31. Kymeta, which was\u00a0founded in 2012 with backing from Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, makes use of an innovative type of technology called metamaterials to build antennas that can be steered by software, without moving parts. Its hybrid cellular-satellite terminals can facilitate communications in hard-to-reach areas \u2014 an application that\u2019s been of particular interest to defense customers. The company raised $84 million in 2022; total funding to date is nearly $400 million. Kymeta also announced that former Boeing exec Nicole Piasecki will be its chair of the board, a role Hutcheson previously held.
