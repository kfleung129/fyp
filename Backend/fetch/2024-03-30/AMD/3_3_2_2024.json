    "text": "Here are some of the best gaming CPUs that can be bought without breaking the bank. In recent years, gamers have focused their attention more on saving up funds for the latest graphics cards rather than purchasing powerhouse CPUs. With the ability to transform a meager system into a full-fledged gaming champion with a simple GPU swap, this change in priorities is understandable. Even so, processors remain the brains of any PC and CPU-intensive titles like Call of Duty: Modern Warfare still demand adequate Intel or AMD chips. For gamers with limited funds, considering the exorbitant cost of graphics cards, finding the best budget CPU for gaming becomes an even more difficult task requiring research and deciding on various price-to-performance implications of certain decisions going into 2024. While modern CPUs are significantly faster in terms of clock speeds and core counts, that is not the only thing that drives their performance while gaming. Gaming on a budget CPU requires looking at various facets of what truly makes a CPU great for gaming while making a price-conscious choice: Using some of the above considerations, the team at Game Rant has selected the best budget CPUs to maximize the performance of any gaming rig: Raptor Lake Reflex The\u00a0Intel Core i5 14600KF 14-Core, 20-Thread CPU is a powerful mid-range CPU that replaces the last generation Intel Core i5 13600KF with higher clocks on both its performance and efficiency cores.Like all its siblings, it does offer better performance out-of-the-box versus its predecessors but replaces them at the same price points they sold last year. Unlike the Intel Core i5 14600K, this model trades at a small discount thanks to it skipping out on integrated graphics. The Intel Core i5 14600KF is arguably the best value-for-money processor for gaming currently as it skips an iGPU to clock in just under a $300 MSRP for a 14-core, 20-thread behemoth that also offers a higher boost clock speed than the older Intel Core i5 13600K CPU. It conclusively beats AMD's Zen 4-based unlocked Ryzen 5 7600X and Ryzen 7 7700X CPUs that trade in the $200-300 price range in multiple gaming and productivity benchmarks even as it flexes its productivity prowess going into 2024, building on the value of its predecessor. While it does offer significantly better performance than its last generation counterpart as well as AMD's alternatives in the same price range, it does have demanding thermal cooling requirements even as it doesn't come with a stock cooler. While that is not an issue for most gamers, many of whom go for high-end AIOs or air coolers for Intel's unlocked CPU lineup, it should be considered as an added expense for system builders when factoring in a large upgrade or a brand-new PC in 2024. Note: The Intel Core i5 14600KF ships with A Free Ghostrunner 2 Game Bundle ($40 value) at multiple retailers thanks to an ongoing promotion. Zen 4 Hexacore Play Gamers interested in upgrading to a newer CPU from Team Red will find the AMD Ryzen 5 7600X to be of spectacular value thanks to its high single-core performance, efficient hexacore architecture, and compatibility with newer technology such as PCI-E 5.0 and DDR5 memory. It also abandons AMD's AM4 design, going for a pin-less processor offering by moving them to the motherboard instead. The AMD Ryzen 5 7600X is a 6-core 12-thread CPU powered by AMD's Zen 4 cores that offer considerably better power efficiency and higher clocks than their predecessors. This allows AMD's offering to be cost-effective while delivering significantly better gaming performance than earlier chips. In terms of performance, it replaces AMD's Ryzen 7 5800X3D as an upgrade candidate and makes a strong case as the best budget AMD CPU for gaming. This is partially due to it being the gateway for better CPU upgrades down the line, such as the Ryzen 7 7800X3D and its successors. AMD's penchant for staying longer on a socket than its competition means that an upgrade to AM5 or the 7600X should unlock savings on motherboard upgrades for most users. At the same time, the Ryzen 5 7600X does cap out at 6 cores. While these are significantly better for gaming than most of the competition, they somewhat limit productivity-related workloads thanks to the limited amount of power under the hood. That being said, if an efficient, fast CPU that doesn't cost an arm and a leg is the target, then the AMD Ryzen 5 7600X delivers wholeheartedly. The 7600X offers better performance in most games versus some of its similarly priced intel counterparts, making it an excellent alternative for gamers looking for a cheaper, leaner, and more efficient CPU for their gaming needs. However, while aiming to benefit from the longevity of the AM5 socket in 2024 and beyond, it has recently seen a large price uptick versus when it traded at sub-$200 price tags during the holiday season last year, which could make it a less desirable option. Last-Gen's Last Hurrah The AMD Ryzen 5 5600X is a mid-range CPU, excellent for gaming setups. This is the fastest six-core AM4-based processor from AMD and features 12 processing threads. According to the company, the processor can deliver 100-plus FPS performance in the world's most popular games. The processor supports DDR4 memory with a sweet spot of 3600MHz.It offers 4.6 GHz boost clock speeds out of the box with overclocking potential in tow, coupled with 35 MB of cache. This model comes bundled with a quiet and capable AMD Wraith Stealth cooler. The AMD Ryzen 5 5600X is a decent mid-range hexacore CPU, offering 12 threads across its 6 cores in an unlocked package. It comes with an adequate thermal solution out of the box, a rarity for an unlocked CPU that provides adequate cooling unless users plan to overclock the CPU. As a middle-of-the-road option in AMD's AM4 inventory, the 5600X will remain relevant longer than most processors even as it remains a popular choice in multiple PC markets due to its value proposition, easy availability, and a bundled stock cooler on an unlocked CPU. That is likely even after the 7600X's launch with significant performance gains simply due to the sheer number of AM4-based PCs out there looking for a cost-effective upgrade. For system builders who decide against a pre-built budget PC for a DIY experience, there are also a substantial number of affordable AM4 motherboards to pair with this processor. At the same time, the AMD's 5600X's age does show when it gets compared to newer Intel CPUs. Somewhat disappointing single-core performance does tend to show in multiple esports titles where Intel's slightly cheaper Core i3-based quad-core solutions have an advantage. Regardless, the 5600X remains a sensible overall alternative for most games, clocking in the right amount of cores, clock speeds, and IPC counts which sees it heavily feature in both, hardware recommendations and prebuilt PCs well into 2024. Intel Core i5-14400F is a revised edition of the i5 13400F that brings higher clock speeds for the same price. The Raptor Lake Refresh architecture helps it improve in overall performance while retaining its power efficiency. The i5 14400F brings 6 performance and 4 efficient cores, resulting in a total of 16 threads. For some, Intel's Raptor Lake Refresh may seem like just a clone of the previous-generation CPU and even though it is somewhat correct with respect to most of its specs, the i5 14400F is actually at the same price tag as its predecessor, making it a better choice overall. The i5 14400F uses a hybrid architecture to combine 6 performance and 4 efficient cores for managing all types of workloads quite effectively without being too power-hungry. The i5 14400F provides a 200MHz boost to the efficient core turbo speed and a 100MHz boost in the performance core turbo to provide a slight uplift in gaming and CPU-oriented tasks. The rest of the specs are identical, including the power consumption. It is a good competitor to the Ryzen 7600 in gaming but has a noticeable advantage in CPU-intensive loads where more cores/threads matter. On paper, it might seem like just another locked i5 chip, but in reality, this processor allows users to cut down on the cost significantly on the motherboard and the CPU cooler. As the 14400F is a locked chip, users can simply throw it on a locked H610 chipset with the stock cooler and can still achieve the same performance as on higher-end Z790 chipset motherboards. However, if users want to decrease the overall expense even further, then they can consider the next option. The AMD Ryzen 5 5500 is a 6 core 12 thread processor that is an entry level 5000 series AMD Ryzen-based processor, featuring Zen 3 cores, but a relatively crippled PCI-E 3.0 interface at the processor level. This makes it an appealing choice over the 5600/5600X based on price alone. There are very few options for 100 bucks when the search is for a hexa-core CPU from one of the latest generations. Even though AMD hasn't released a hundred-dollar CPU in the Zen 4 lineup, the Zen 3-based Ryzen 5 5500 is an excellent budget processor that does pretty well in gaming with its capable 6-core/12-thread configuration. It was launched in the second batch of Zen 3-based CPUs released in 2022 and has similarities to the Ryzen 5600X. The bigger differences here are the cut-down L3 cache size and the lower clock speeds. 16MB of L3 cache does affect its gaming performance, but overall, the price-to-performance ratio is better than what users can achieve with the 5600X. It is also overclockable and comes with an AMD Wraith Stealth cooler to ensure users can build a potent gaming system for under $500. As the CPU is compatible with the AM4 platform, it further helps in choosing a cheaper motherboard due to a plethora of available options with different chipsets. Hence, even if users want to cut the cost even further, an A520 chipset won't be too bad. Still, it's recommended to get a B450/B550 chipset board in order to have better component compatibility and easier upgrade path. Intel Core i3-14100F is a refreshed version of the i3 13100F, now with higher clock speeds that go beyond 4.5GHz. Based on the Raptor Lake Refresh architecture, the CPU brings 4 performance cores and a total of 8 threads to get started with any small or medium-scale application. With its capable single-core performance, it is able to outperform almost every entry-level processor in gaming while remaining efficient. The Core i3 14100F repeats the story of the Core i5 14400F. It replaces the i3 13100F from the 13th-generation Raptor Lake lineup without much change in the specs except for the core clocks. However, this time the boost clock speed is 200MHz higher while the base clock is 100MHz more. It doesn't have much of an effect on gaming but does have a positive effect overall on both gaming and productivity for the same price tag as the i3 13100F. It doesn't have any efficient cores, which also limits its multitasking and other CPU-specific capabilities, but thankfully, hyperthreading is available to distribute the load for faster operation. Users looking to build an affordable gaming system without introducing CPU bottlenecks can have the 14100F combined with something like an RTX 4060 Ti to max out games at 1080p resolution. Furthermore, the cost can be significantly reduced by using a locked chipset motherboard and the same stock cooler that it comes with. AMD Ryzen 5 8500G falls in the Zen 4 lineup and is based on TSCM's 4nm process node. It is one of the budget offerings for the AM5 platform that brings a powerful integrated graphics processing unit to push the performance higher in graphical-intensive programs and gaming. Featuring 6 cores and 12 threads with clock speeds going as high as 5.0GHz, it is a successful replacement for the older gen APUs. AMD's Zen 4-based APU lineup was long-awaited, but here we are, with multiple APUs using the latest Zen 4 architecture compatible with the AM5 platform. While most APUs are significantly costlier than the Zen 3-based Ryzen 5000 APUs, the Ryzen 5 8500G can fit in most users' pockets. For a sub $200 price, the 8500G offers 6 cores and 12 threads with the base clock at 3.5GHz and a max boost clock of up to 5.0GHz. This is significantly better than the Ryzen 5600G and 5700G, which failed to reach 5.0GHz. Moreover, now the 8500G has got 6MB of L2 cache, which is 2X more than the 5600G and 1.5X more than 5700G. Considering that the chip has got all these significant uplifts in the specifications, it beats both the predecessors quite convincingly in gaming whether users are playing on the iGPU or a discrete graphics card. Compared to the 5600G, users can expect around 30% higher performance with the iGPU as the 8500G uses the latest Radeon 740M graphics with 4 cores clocked at 2800MHz. The APU also beats the 5700G even though the latter has double the GPU core count and more cores/threads. The 8500G opens up the path for better upgradeability, as not only do users get to use the latest AM5 platform, but they can also add a more powerful discrete GPU in the future to increase their system's gaming potential. There may only be two main players in the CPU arena, but each produces enough processors to cause some confusion when building a PC. Especially when on a limited budget, it's problematic to decide whether to invest more in a CPU or other vital gaming components like a graphics card. To speed up the process, remember to consider these characteristics which vary dramatically among processors. Clock speed isn't the only spec that determines how capable a CPU is, but it's important regardless. The AMD Ryzen 5 7600X has one of the highest base clock speeds out of the budget contenders at 4.7 GHz. Its six-core configuration is nothing to scoff at, but it especially excels at the single-core performance that many games demand. On the other hand, the Intel Core i5 14400F CPU is a perfect processor for power users looking to game from time to time. The 13th-generation processor thrives not only in games but also in intensive productivity tasks thanks to its total of 14 cores handling 20 threads in a 12+8 config. Most of the processors in this guide are overclockable, meaning that their base clock speeds can be pushed beyond their stock values. Intel CPUs with a K in their labels (like the Core i5 14600KF) are easily boosted and are even encouraged to do so by the manufacturer with suggested safeguards. However, buyers of the rebadged Intel Core i3-14100F will find that its core multiplier is locked, severely limiting its overclocking potential. Gamers need to also be aware of the thermal requirements of overclocked CPUs and should consider adequate air coolers or even budget AIO liquid coolers in some instances. Finding the best budget CPU for gaming won't matter without the right components to support it. The AMD Ryzen 5 5600X calls for slightly older motherboards using the AM4 socket and DDR4 memory. More recent AMD CPUs like the Ryzen 7600X or 8500G demand AM5 motherboards and even faster DDR5 RAM. In some cases, motherboards may need a BIOS update to support the newest hardware, such as AMD's Ryzen 7000 series' X3D refresh as well as Intel's 13th and 14th generation CPUs. Relying on a CPU with an integrated graphics chip often causes some debate, especially when assembling a budget gaming PC. In most circumstances, gamers are better off purchasing a budget discrete graphics card they can afford. Still, one reason why the AMD Ryzen 5 7600X earned a recommendation in this guide is that its onboard Radeon graphics controller is surprisingly capable of pumping out decent frame rates in some esports titles without a dedicated GPU in play. Whichever budget gaming CPU in this guide that a buyer ultimately decides on, it can help an affordable gaming rig punch its weight without bottlenecks in play for its price range irrespective of the choice. Buying a new CPU is not an isolated purchase; it must be paired to a supporting motherboard, and therefore a CPU socket. While the CPU is the brains of the operation, users might want to consider whether the tech it directly supports can handle future upgrades and performance gain potential. Ideally, users want a CPU that supports DDR5 memory natively while also offering PCI-E 5.0 support for GPUs and SSDs. This allows a degree of future-proofing that enables other PC gaming upgrades to deliver the maximum performance gains they potentially bring to the table. This is also why Game Rant's budget gaming CPU guide features a significantly higher number of DDR5 and PCI-E 5.0 compatible CPUs, allowing for easier motherboard, memory, and GPU upgrades versus CPUs on more legacy chipsets (like the AMD AM4) such as the Ryzen 5 5600X, which will see its upgrade potential capped to the Ryzen 7 5800X3D, at best, in the coming months. The AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D, leveraging its larger L3 cache and newer Zen 4 cores, is currently one of the fastest AMD processors that's also relatively affordable. Yes and no. While the iGPU generally is disregarded by gamers, it is a handy alternative for some when trading up GPUs, allowing them to sell their older GPU before upgrading to a newer one. It is equally valuable for diagnosing PC issues at times, allowing users to eliminate the discrete GPU as a cause of any errors by allowing an alternate display option.
