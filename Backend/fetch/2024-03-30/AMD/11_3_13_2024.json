    "text": "Lisa Su has led Advanced Micro Devices as its Chief Executive Officer for a decade to much success. AMD\u2019s revenues were $5.5 billion in 2014 and $22 billion last year. Among its other accomplishments, today, an AMD CPU powers the world\u2019s fastest supercomputer, Frontier, at Oak Ridge National Labs. Although the company\u2019s headquarters are based in California, Su lives in Austin and runs AMD from its sprawling campus on the Southside. On Monday, she joined Ryan Patel on stage as the keynote speaker at South by Southwest. She talked about AMD\u2019s role in technology innovation, its commitment to partnerships and open collaboration, and its vision for the future of Artificial Intelligence and computing. To start, Su recounted her time as a student at MIT and her love of semiconductors from the beginning of college. \u201cYes, that\u2019s true; I was a nerd at heart,\u201d Su said. In one of her first jobs in college, she worked in a semiconductor lab, making tiny chips the size of a dime or quarter. \u201cI was just amazed at everything you could do with them,\u201d she said. \u201cI was in semiconductors when it wasn\u2019t sexy, and I would say I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s sexy now, but it\u2019s sexier.\u201d AMD\u2019s chips and technology are used in Hollywood to make films. In a surprise appearance, director David Conley appeared on stage to discuss AMD\u2019s technology in filmmaking. The night before, he was at the Academy Awards, where his film War Is Over! Inspired by the Music of John & Yoko, won best animated short film. \u201cIt\u2019s so great to be working with the best in the industry, and that\u2019s what we enjoy,\u201d Su said. She said making feature films requires special effects that require tremendous computing power, and AMD chips are used in the process. Films like Avatar 2 used AMD chips. Conley said he wanted to highlight the work that AMD is doing to help filmmakers create images that are more fantastic than they could have even thought about 30 years ago. \u201cThese images are possible because we have a partnership with a company like AMD that gives us the leverage and the insights. They work with our teams, and we work with their teams to help optimize everything,\u201d Conley said. Conley said using AI in the entertainment industry is still a sensitive subject. Many people misunderstand it. \u201cI also want to make sure that artists understand that AI is a tool and that this is not about replacing artists,\u201d Conley said. He said the future of films is more active entertainment with the intersection of games because gaming visual effects and movie-making are all the same. \u201cI want to jump from video games to movies,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to go from active entertainment to passive entertainment, and I want to go into real-time entertainment, and that is where films are going to be in three to five years, and we\u2019re not going to be able to do that with the help of companies like AMD where we get real-time processing and real-time rendering and a lot of AI.\u201d AMD also partners with Adobe to optimize hardware and software for content creators. Generative AI can bring the whole content creation process to the next level, Su said. It gives creators more products so they can do more at a higher quality in less time. Su said AI is the most critical technology that has come on the scene over at least the last 50 years. AI, and generative AI, has become the most important thing, and there\u2019s a good reason for that, frankly, she said. ChatGPT came on board 14 months ago, and it just captured everyone\u2019s imagination, she said. \u201cAI has always existed, but the ability to make AI so simple that you can just say, hey, you know, I want to know what I should do in Austin, TX, this weekend, for example, having that possibility only comes with a tremendous amount of computing power,\u201d Su said. Su showed one of AMD\u2019s latest generation processors, a generative AI chip called MI 300, which has 153 billion transistors. AI PCs aim to ensure that everyone has their own AI capability and doesn\u2019t have to go to the cloud. But they can operate off their data. You can ask it questions, and it\u2019ll answer for you faster in a private manner because maybe you don\u2019t want your data going everywhere, Su said. \u201cIt\u2019s just the beginning of what I think is the ability to make us much more productive,\u201d Su said. AMD also partners with Microsoft, leading the way with Copilot, which runs Azure in the cloud. AMD is also partners with HP and Lenovo. \u201cOur goal is to make this super easy for all of you guys to use, and that\u2019s the promise of AI PCs,\u201d Su said. \u201cOne of the things about AI that I\u2019d like to say is that people are worried that AI is going to replace people\u2019s jobs and stuff like that,\u201d Su said. That\u2019s not the way I think about it. Companies that learn how to leverage AI will win over companies that are not leveraging AI.\u201d Su said AMD wants to be at the forefront of using AI in every aspect of its business. \u201cWe\u2019re using it to design chips,\u201d she said. Su said AMD is using AI to design faster chips and make them more reliable. It is also using AI to build better software. Su told AMD\u2019s engineering team to increase the number of products the company can produce annually using AI. AMD also uses AI in HR, finance, and customer service. This is a way of moving up the food chain because we\u2019re allowing our team to have AI do some of the less fun things so that we can add higher value for our employees. Su said everyone needs an AI strategy. It\u2019s OK if it\u2019s not perfect because everyone is learning. \u201cI\u2019m learning new things about what technology can do and how we need to shape our entire ecosystem, our work, and our next-generation products as well, so that\u2019s what makes it fun,\u201d Su said. Su uses Microsoft Copilot to summarize meetings and track action items, but she doesn\u2019t use it to write her emails. She said she\u2019s still experimenting with the software. Su said AI is moving incredibly fast, and AMD\u2019s approach is to have an open ecosystem and support open source. \u201cWe believe that no company has the answer to everything,\u201d she said.
