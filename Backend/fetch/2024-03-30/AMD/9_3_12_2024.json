    "text": "Ubisoft Massive has released two updates for Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora this month, introducing several improvements to combat and exploration in the open world game while also fixing artifacts that appeared when using AMD FSR 3 on PC. Here's an overview shared by the development team: There are also new motion blur settings to control the effect's intensity, and the PC benchmark is now more accurate. The game launched in December, earning a 7.5 score in Wccftech's review where Nathan Birch criticized the combat: Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora pulls you in with its dazzling world, then pushes you away its frustrating combat. After a play session I 80 percent enjoyed, I\u2019d leave with a sour taste in my mouth after repeatedly banging my head against some maddening RDA outpost. If you can handle this push and pull, there is plenty to enjoy here. Frontiers of Pandora\u2019s main campaign will take you around 20 hours, more if you\u2019re easily distracted, and 100 percenting the game is at least a 40-hour effort. Whether you\u2019ll actually want to explore until your face is blue is up to you.
