The event materials expressly mention \u2018AI in personal computers,\u2019 thus we should expect CPU and GPU announcements. \u201cAMD is powering the end-to-end infrastructure that will define the AI era,\u201d according to the event description. \u201cFrom cloud installation to enterprise cluster, AI-enabled intelligent embedded devices and PCs.\u201d The event will take place before NVIDIA\u2018s big GeForce RTX 40 Series SUPER announcement, so it will be fascinating to see whether AMD has something Radeon to offer. There are serious rumors that a new AMD Radeon RX 7600 XT with 16GB of VRAM will be released in late January and that RDNA 3 will include AI hardware \u2013 the new GPU might be introduced during this presentation. However, because the presentation is centered on AI hardware, the emphasis will most likely be on AMD\u2019s newest Ryzen 8000 \u201cHawk Point\u201d CPUs powering the next era of AI-powered PCs rather than anything solely PC gaming. The Ryzen 8000 series incorporates dedicated AI hardware, such as a Neural Processing Unit (NPU), which improves AI performance and workloads dramatically. With AI becoming incorporated into operating systems, search engines, and productivity applications, we anticipate AMD\u2019s CES presentation to emphasize this aspect of its new Ryzen series. It might be a PC-focused answer to Intel\u2019s recent release of AI-powered \u2018Meteor Lake\u2019 Core Ultra CPUs. AMD will also be exhibiting AMD Ryzen Z1 Series Processors for Handheld PC Gaming, as well as AMD Ryzen and Radeon gaming desktops and laptops, at CES 2023.
