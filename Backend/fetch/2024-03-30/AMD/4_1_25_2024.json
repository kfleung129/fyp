    "text": "The AMD Radeon RX 6700 XT and RX 6750 XT are some fantastic graphics cards for playing Palworld. The survival video game isn't very demanding and follows a low-poly art style, which means players with older and more modest hardware can get high framerates without major issues. Although the last-gen cards are quite capable, a few tweaks are necessary to maintain high framerates throughout every scenario in the title. Manually adjusting the settings can be a bit cumbersome, so we have compiled this cheat sheet of the best combinations for the 6700 XT and 6750 XT while playing Palworld. Note: Some aspects of this article are subjective and solely reflect the opinions of the writer The AMD Radeon RX 6700 XT GPU was launched for 1440p gaming, and you can easily stick to this resolution in Palworld, given how well-optimized and forgiving on hardware the game is. You can still get high framerates in the title with these settings applied. Unfortunately, Palworld only supports Nvidia DLSS. AMD players will miss out on upscaling technologies, which means they'll have to rely solely on visual quality compromises to hit the target framerates. Below is a list of the best settings combinations for the RX 6700 XT video card: Graphics DLSS Camera Also, check out the best Palworld settings for the RTX 3060 and 3060 Ti. The AMD Radeon RX 6750 XT isn't vastly more capable than the original video card. It shares a similar specs sheet and delivers slightly better performance thanks to its higher operating clock speeds. This means Palworld doesn't run remarkably better on this card as compared to the RX 6700 XT. We recommend a similar mix of High and Epic settings for this graphics card at 1440p for the best experience. Below is a comprehensive list of the detailed settings combinations: Graphics DLSS Camera Overall, the RX 6700 XT and 6750 XT are capable enough to run the latest video games. With the above tweaks applied, they can easily run not-so-demanding titles like Palworld at 1440p resolutions. Quick Links   "
