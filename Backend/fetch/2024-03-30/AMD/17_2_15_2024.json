    "text": " With ROCm 6.0, AMD has expanded their AI development tools with expanded software support and GPU support. Now, ROCm supports AMD\u2019s Radeon RX 7900 XTX, RX 7900 XT, and RX 7900 GRE, as well as AMD\u2019s Radeon Pro W7900 and Pro W7800 GPUs. With this expanded hardware support, AMD are giving AI researchers and engineers the ability to use a broader selection of Radeon hardware. With support for Radeon desktop GPUs, AMD are offering this support at very affordable pricing levels. Sadly, AMD\u2019s ROCm platform does not support AMD\u2019s Radeon RX 7800 XT or RX 7700 XT, though this may change with future versions of ROCm. Building on our previously announced support of the AMD Radeon\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 RX 7900 XT, XTX and Radeon PRO W7900 GPUs with AMD ROCm 5.7 and PyTorch, we are now expanding our client-based ML Development offering, both from the hardware and software side with AMD ROCm 6.0. Firstly, AI researchers and ML engineers\u00c2\u00a0can now also develop on\u00c2\u00a0Radeon PRO W7800\u00c2\u00a0and on\u00c2\u00a0Radeon RX 7900 GRE\u00c2\u00a0GPUs. With support for such a broad product portfolio, AMD is helping the AI community to get access to desktop graphics cards at even more price points and at different performance levels. Furthermore, we are\u00c2\u00a0complementing our solution stack with support for ONNX Runtime. ONNX, short for Open Neural Network Exchange, is an intermediary Machine Learning framework used to convert AI models between different ML frameworks. As a result, users can now perform inference on a wider range of source data on local AMD hardware. This also adds INT8 via MIGraphX \u00e2\u20ac\u201c AMD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own graph inference engine \u2013 to the available data types (including FP32 and FP16). With AMD ROCm 6.0, we are continuing our support for\u00c2\u00a0the PyTorch framework\u00c2\u00a0bringing mixed precision with FP32/FP16 to Machine Learning training workflows. These are exciting times for anyone deciding to start working on AI. ROCm for AMD Radeon desktop GPUs is a great solution for AI engineers, ML researchers and enthusiasts alike and no longer remains exclusive to those with large budgets. AMD is determined to keep broadening hardware support and adding more capabilities to our Machine Learning Development solution stack over time.  On the software side, ROCm 6.0 features support for the ONNX runtime. ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange) is an open standard for machine learning algorithms and software tools that allows developers to easily convert AI models to new frameworks. This support allows AI researchers and developers to to utilise a wider range of source data.  With ROCm 6.0, AMD is allowing AI developers to work with more affordable graphics cards and with a wider range of data sources. This is great news for both developers and AMD themselves. Developers now have stronger AI development tools from AMD. AMD now has more selling points for their Navi 31 based Radeon graphics cards. That\u2019s a win-win. In the future, we would like to see AMD\u2019s RX 7800 XT support ROCm. This would further expand the Radeon GPU options that developers have. If AMD\u2019s 16GB RX 7900 GRE can support ROCm, there is no reason why AMD\u2019s 16GB RX 7800 XT shouldn\u2019t. Perhaps we will see this with ROCm 6.x. You can join the discussion on AMD\u2019s expanded ROCm support for Radeon GPUs on the OC3D Forums.
