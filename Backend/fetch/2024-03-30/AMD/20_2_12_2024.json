Read more While portable gaming systems come with a built-in gamepad, some controllers are designed to connect to a computer via a USB connection. And this is where our readers reported their PC is not detecting the controller. Usually, the controller is not working on PC due to driver issues and many had problems with the vJoy driver. Bluetooth drivers are also to blame sometimes, and if you tried to use the gamepad inside a Steam game, you will need to tweak the controller settings as we have done below. 1. Right-click the\u00a0Start\u00a0icon, then select\u00a0Device Manager. 2. Click on the\u00a0Human Interface Devices\u00a0section. 3. Right-click on Vjoy. 4. Select Uninstall device. The USB Controller not recognized in Windows 10 issue will be solved. 5. Check whether the issue persists. vJoy is a device driver that can be used to bridge the gap between any device that is not a joystick and an application that needs a joystick to function properly. However, sometimes it can cause more issues, such as the PC not detecting the Xbox controller. Therefore, uninstalling vJoy should fix the issue. Disabling the device can also help you fix other controller issues, like Controller acting as a mouse on your Windows 11 computer. Downloading and installing\u00a0drivers manually is a process that carries the risk of getting the wrong driver installed, which may lead to serious malfunctions. If you want to avoid this kind of risk, you can use a dedicated driver updater to obtain the latest driver versions for your device automatically. \u21d2 Get IObit Driver Booster Although the gamepad has nothing to do with the Bluetooth driver, some users reported this solution as effective.
