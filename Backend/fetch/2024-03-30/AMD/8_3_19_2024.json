    "text": "Here is a selection of the best deals currently available on graphics cards and processors, including products from AMD, Intel, and Nvidia. Those building their own gaming computers, or updating a pre-built one to provide more performance, are undoubtedly familiar with two of the most important components. The processor, also known as the central processing unit or CPU, and the graphics card or graphics processing unit (GPU), are of the utmost importance when considering a gaming computer build. The former does general calculations and makes sure the computer is running smoothly, and the latter does graphics processing, which makes it so important in graphics-intensive games. There are a lot of options, though, on all sides of the competing platforms. Intel and AMD compete against each other on the CPU side of things while Nvidia and AMD battle for the best gaming GPUs. However, this article doesn't discriminate and has a collection of some of the best deals on all of the above at different price points, no matter the user preference or system requirements. RELATED: Best Monitor Deals in October 2023 For entry-level gaming setups, Intel's Core i3 is a great solution. This processor features a 4-core, 8-thread setup, which is enhanced with built-in graphics, which technically allows usage without a dedicated GPU. Except for limited gaming, a GPU is recommended, though. For those who are looking for more CPU power, the Intel Core i7-12700KF offers a great deal for a mid-to-high-tier gaming setup. This is a great companion for a capable graphics card, while not as expensive as current generation offerings. It is also great at multitasking with 12 cores and 20 threads. On the AMD side, there's the powerful Ryzen 5800X, which features great multitasking with 8 cores and 16 threads. It also excels in content creation tasks, where multithreading is important. The CPU promises solid 100 fps+ performance on popular games. This CPU is designed for powerful desktop PCs with dedicated GPUs. The AMD Ryzen 9 5900X CPU can be an excellent option for those looking for an AMD CPU with a bit more power. It's even faster than the 5800X and great for setups that look for higher resolution or frame rates with a dedicated GPU. With 12 cores and 24 threads, it has excellent all-around performance. Now it is available on Amazon at a steep discount, under $100 more than the 5800X. Amazon's current CPU deals have great options for a wide range of needs, from entry-level gamers to power users seeking top-tier performance. Starting with the Intel Core i3-12100, priced at $100, it's an ideal choice for those setting up an entry-level gaming PC. It offers 4 cores and 8 threads along with integrated graphics for basic tasks and light gaming. For users needing way more horsepower in the Intel ecosystem, the Intel Core i7-12700KF is one of the more popular options around and steps up the game with 12 cores and 20 threads for $209, making it perfect for more demanding gaming and content creation. On the AMD front, the Ryzen 7 5800X and Ryzen 9 5900X are compelling options for both gamers and creators. The Ryzen 7 5800X offers 8 cores and 16 threads with solid gaming performance. For those pushing the limits of performance, the Ryzen 9 series CPU is a great pairing with high-end GPUs. Now discounted to $291, it's an upgrade in most respects with 12 cores and 24 threads. Both require a dedicated GPU, preferably a decent one, so they are not meant for entry-level setups. As one of the best deals in affordable gaming GPUs, the SHOWKINGS Radeon RX 580 with 8 gigabytes of memory is now selling at $106.99 with an additional $10 of savings with a coupon at the checkout. The remaining under $100 is amazing for a decent entry-level graphics card. Those looking for a major step up in performance in Radeon GPUs, should consider the XFX Speedster QICK319 Radeon RX 6750XT CORE. This graphics card is a competitive GPU for a mid-range gaming PC with 12 gigabytes of video memory and three DisplayPort outputs for multi-display setups. Entering the latest-generation Nvidia GPUs that not only deliver more performance but better graphics technologies, as well. This GPU features 8 GB of video memory but, more importantly, the most recent version of Nvidia's ray-tracing and DLSS technologies, providing amazing lighting in games and improved performance with AI. This GPU pairs excellently with mid-tier CPUs like Intel Core i5s and Ryzen 5s. For those looking to improve their setup from a mid-tier PC to a higher-tier gaming beast, the Asus ROG Strix GeForce RTX 4070 OC might be their best bet. With additional video memory, at 12 gigabytes, this GPU is much better future-proofed, allowing higher resolution graphics with better framerates with upcoming titles. In the realm of GPU deals, Amazon presents good options from both AMD and Nvidia with a wide price range from under $100 upwards. The SHOWKINGS Radeon RX 580 8GB is perhaps the most optimal choice on Amazon for budget-conscious gamers. It offers solid performance for less than $100, after an additional $10 coupon. This value is hard to beat on any price point. For a major leap in performance, though, the XFX Speedster QICK319 Radeon RX 6750XT CORE is excellent value, too. It features 12 GB of video memory and superior capabilities in every respect, perfect for mid-range PCs. Opposed to previous AMD GPUs, the PNY GeForce RTX 4060 Ti 8GB is a top-tier choice for those looking for the latest generation Nvidia offerings. For just $40 more than the RX 6750XT, this GPU features Nvidia's enhanced ray-tracing and DLSS technologies. Not only does it provide better performance, it has AI-driven performance improvements. Last but definitely not least, the Asus ROG Strix GeForce RTX 4070 OC is the most powerful GPU on the list. It offers 12 GB of video memory, ensuring future-proof gaming, plus the ability to overclock for even better performance.         Q: Are all GPUs compatible with all CPUs Typically, AMD CPUs support all graphics cards, whether it is from AMD or Nvidia. Also, all CPUs, whether from Intel or AMD, also support both AMD and Nvidia graphics cards. However, features such as AMD Smart Access Memory might enhance the experience on a dual AMD setup. Q: What is RTX or ray tracing? RTX is Nvidia's branding for a line of products with hardware support for a feature called ray-tracing. While the lighting effect can be used with non-RTX graphics cards, the RTX cards are generally better suited for it and offer better performance. Q: What do cores and GHz mean in processors? Cores refer to separate units within the processor that are working together to calculate results. Usually the higher the core count, and the thread count, the better the multitasking performance. GHz or gigahertz refers to the clock speed of the processor. This usually gives a general idea of how good the performance of the processor is, although it shouldn't be taken as gospel or the only factor.
