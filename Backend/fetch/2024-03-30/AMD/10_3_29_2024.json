    "text": " Next-generation AMD Ryzen CPUs have been found in shipping manifests. These AMD Zen 5 \u201cGranite Ridge\u201d CPUs appear to be engineering samples, prototypes for the company\u2019s next-generation Ryzen CPU lineup. 6-core and 8-core Zen 5 \u201cGranite Ridge\u201d CPUs have been spotted. These CPUs have TDPs of 105W and 170W respectively. This 8-core model has a much higher TDP than AMD\u2019s existing Zen 4 105W Ryzen 7 7700X processor. This suggests that AMD Zen 5 CPUs will be more power hungry than their predecessors.  (Image from @momomo_us) Recent rumours have suggested that AMD\u2019s Zen 5 Ryzen processors will deliver a significant performance boost over their Zen 4 predecessors. One leaked benchmark showcased an alleged 40% performance improvement.  (Image from @momomo_us) With Zen 5, AMD has stated that they are building a \u201cnew grounds up microarchitecture\u201d. This suggests that AMD\u2019s Zen 5 CPU cores will feature a large number of design changes over Zen 4. In theory, this creates many avenues for performance gains with Zen 5. With Zen 5, AMD are reportedly maintaining the same core counts as their existing Zen 4 processors. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s means that AMD\u2019s probably planning to release a 16 core Zen 5 Ryzen flagship on their AM5 platform. To achieve significant performance gains with their new architecture, AMD will not be relying on CPU higher core counts. AMD needs to deliver more per-core CPU performance with their next-generation CPU architecture. Only increased CPU clock speeds or IPC gains can achieve this. With Zen 5, AMD\u2019s reportedly achieve no major clock speed gains with their new architecture. That leaves IPC gains as Zen 5\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only performance-boosting aspect. You can join the discussion on AMD\u2019s Zen 5 \u201cGranite Ridge\u201d CPUs on the OC3D Forums.
