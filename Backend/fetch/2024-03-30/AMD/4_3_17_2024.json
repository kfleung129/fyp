    "text": "Germany's climate change targets for 2030 appeared to be out of reach. However, data from the Federal Environment Agency (UBA) shows that in 2023, greenhouse gas emissions fell by 76 million tonnes, or one tonne of C02 per person, compared to 2022. This is the sharpest decline since 1990. The 10.1% reduction is mainly due to the energy and industry sectors, which are increasingly relying on renewable energy sources, as well as lower energy demand from businesses and consumers. However, the buildings and transport sectors fell far short of their climate targets. The transport sector, for example, exceeded the sectoral budget by 13 million tonnes, exacerbated by the growth in car use, low-cost air travel and systematic problems with the railways. In the energy sector, reduced use of fossil fuels for electricity and heat led to a 20.1% reduction in emissions. In industry, mainly due to the decreased use of natural gas and hard coal, there was a decrease of about 7.7%. Commenting on the figures, UBA President Dirk Messner said: Many feared a renaissance of coal and other fossil fuels with the outbreak of the war against Ukraine. This has not happened, as we now know. The very successful development of renewable energy is largely responsible for this. It is an important step that will be of benefit to climate protection in the years to come. But we are not doing as well in all areas as we should. A major problem remains in transport in particular. We urgently need to do more, for example by expanding electric mobility and reducing company car privileges and other climate-damaging subsidies.
