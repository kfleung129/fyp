    "text": "Right in the middle of AMD\u2019s Chinese presentation, where we caught a glimpse of the Ryzen 8700F and 8400F, we were treated to yet another little surprise: the Ryzen 5000XT. Proof once again that AMD wants to keep the AM4 socket alive, or the need to clear out stock? Is this a range just for the Chinese market? For the moment, it\u2019s much harder to say than with the Ryzen 8700F and 8400F. For those who remember, we\u2019ve already heard about these Ryzen 5000XTs in the spring of 2021, when we were talking about a simple refresh of the 5000 range. So there\u2019s no reason why things should be any different. We should have the same recipe as that adopted by the Reds in 2020 with its Ryzen 3000 range, where its Ryzen 9 3900XT and Ryzen 7 3800XT were simply overclocked versions benefiting from a more refined etching process to deliver higher frequencies. These Ryzen 5000XT processors will continue to feature Zen 3 architecture and 7nm etching from TSMC. Configurations in terms of number of cores, L3 cache or TDP limits will remain totally identical, barring any major surprises. Although AMD\u2019s Ryzen 5000X3D continues to keep its AM4 socket alive, the arrival of these 5000XTs is hard to envisage on the market as a whole. Several product ranges, such as processors, have been embargoed on the Russian market. As a result, a large volume of references has been \u201crecycled\u201d to other countries, such as China. This is how we should read the presentation of this new \u201crange\u201d over the last few days. -> Discover TSMC\u2019s history on our Wiki  "
