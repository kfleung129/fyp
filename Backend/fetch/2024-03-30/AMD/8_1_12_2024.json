    "text": "With DLSS 3.0 Frame Generation, Nvidia has been offering the option of having every second individual frame processed by AI since October 2022 in order to ideally achieve frame rates that are twice as high (in best case scenarios). The catch: In order to utilize DLSS 3.0 Frame Generation, not only is a compatible GeForce RTX 4000 graphics card required, but the technology also only works in selected games that explicitly support the feature. With FSR 3 Frame Generation, AMD also offers an alternative that also only works in selected games. This will change with a driver update from January 24, as AMD Fluid Motion Frames (AFMF) can be activated directly in AMD Software: Adrenalin Edition and then used in any game based on DirectX 11 or DirectX 12, i.e. almost any game from recent years. At launch, this feature will be available on all AMD Radeon RX 6000 and Radeon RX 7000 graphics cards as well as on iGPUs of the Radeon 700M series, so that gaming handhelds will also benefit from AFMF. Fluid Motion Frame Generation can be combined with Radeon Super Resolution (RSR) to achieve a performance boost similar to FidelityFX Super Resolution 3.0. As the AMD video (embedded below) shows, this effectively more than triples the frame rate of games. However, Frame Generation can lead to a slightly longer input latency, so AMD recommends only using this feature if a game achieves a frame rate of at least 60 fps without AFMF.
