    "text": "The open source AMD RADV Vulkan driver is set to get some nice looking performance improvements for Ray-Tracing, which should release along with Mesa 24.0. As mentioned in a Merge Request\u00a0titled \"Convert 1D ray launches to 2D\" that has been accepted into Mesa developer\u00a0Friedrich Vock mentioned \"Because we use unaligned dispatches, 1D launches only use 8 threads per\nwave. Converting to 2D and fixing up launch IDs in the prolog significantly increases occupancy.\" that gave a \"~30% uplift in Ghostwire Tokyo\". Impressive and then you look into the comments and others are noting more performance improvements in other games too with\u00a0Adriano Martins mentioning these on an AMD RX 6700 XT: Further to that in another comment\u00a0Adam Niederer also showed off improvements on their AMD\u00a07900 XT at 2560x1440: The MR was open since November 2023, with it being accepted and merged January 5th, 2024. So it should be available in Mesa 24.0 which is due to release January 31st, 2024. Although that depends how the Release Candidates go with the first RC for Mesa 24.0 due January 10th, 2024.
