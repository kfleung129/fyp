We'll start with a brief overview of our picks of the best cheap graphics cards. Scroll down or click on the links to read more about each option. best overall  We found the AMD Radeon RX 7600 to be a fantastic budget graphics card offering plenty of punch for its price. It brings the latest AMD tech to the budget market in a killer 1080p card that'll also have a solid go at 1440p.\nRead more below best NVIDIA  The RTX 4060 has arrived and neatly takes up the mantle as the best budget GPU from Team Green. It's got all the latest Nvidia bells and whistles, excellent performance and is incredibly power efficient.\nRead more below best Intel  Intel's foray into the graphics card market has been concentrated on budget to mid-range cards \u2013 and it's provided great results. The Arc A750 offers excellent performance for the most wallet-friendly price on our list.\nRead more below  Our expert review: Our top pick as the best budget graphics card overall is the highly rated AMD Radeon RX 7600. It may only have 8GB of VRAM, but we found that it deploys this brilliantly, offering superb 1080p performance while also having a fair crack at 1440p. It's compact so it's perfect for smaller PCs, and it runs nice and quietly. Our sister site Techradar described this GPU as a major gift for gamers on a budget in its review, and we have to agree. \u00a0At around the $250-$275 mark, it's the cheapest in the current generation of cards offered by the two biggest players, AMD and Nvidia. It's terrific value, and great for first-time builds or lean rigs more broadly. It's important to note that it's aimed at mainstream 1080p gamers, and it does start to run out of steam at 1440p with high settings in demanding games. It's also a little power thirsty and doesn't offer so much in the way of high-performance ray-tracing action, but at this price point, ray-tracing is unlikely to be a high priority. As for the competition, it can give Nvidia's brilliant RTX 3060 Ti a good fight, while providing a great balance of price and performance.\u00a0And you can always drop image quality a little or enable FSR to make 1440p performance more viable.  Our expert review: Nvidia's RTX 4060 GPU is the best budget graphics card you can get from Team Green \u2013 basically by default, as it's the cheapest of the current range, at less than $300 / \u00a3300, but it offers a bunch more than baseline, entry-level performance. We found that it provides exceptional performance at 1080p resolutions and can have a fair go at 1440p if you're willing to make some sacrifices. Its 8GB of GDDR6 VRAM and 3,072 CUDA cores give it a fair punch but also represent a double-edged sword. 8GB is a bare minimum in 2024. That does limit thing when you go up in resolutions, but then it's what allows Nvidia to make this such a great value card. Our sister site Techradar, described it as a \"fantastic upgrade for anyone looking for best-in-class 1080p performance while leaving the door open for some solid 1440p performance (with caveats) at an acceptable price point.\" However, we'd say this is for those who insist on going with Nvidia. AMD Radeon RX 7600 at number one on our list offers the best value in terms of the performance you get for the price of the card.  Our expert review: Tradition had it that AMD offered the best value cards in a market of just two players: AMD and Nvidia. However, Intel's venture into the market has shaken things up in budget GPUs, and it's offerings shouldn't be dismissed. The Arc A750 is the cheapest graphics card on our list, and, while it has its failings, it offers excellent value for a modern card with 8GB of GDDR6 VRAM and 3,584 shading cores to crunch through tasks and games. Beyond gaming, we think this card is a solid option for content creators, especially after a driver update in late 2023 improved the performance in content creation workloads by as much as 40 per cent compared to with the 2022 launch drivers. In its tests, Puget Systems found that performance was improved across a variety of creative software, particularly DaVinci Resolve and\u00a0Adobe\u00a0Premiere Pro. It excels at 1080p and ray-tracing performance is decent. However, you'll almost certainly need the Resize BAR software to get the most out of the Arc A750, as our sister site PC Gamer found recommended. It's a little power thirsty too. But, overall, it's a fine budget GPU and one that, in the right PC, will do a very solid job.  Our expert review: We could have picked the slightly cheaper Radeon RX 6600 card to give you the most budget graphics card from AMD, but we think the 6600 XT offers a slightly better proposition for not much more money. While it is from AMD's previous generation of cards, it's still a 1080p powerhouse and has very efficient power consumption. With 2,048 stream processors and 8GB of GDDR6 RAM, it still has the solid offerings of a plucky budget GPU. 1080p is definitely where it's happiest and fastest. It will give 1440p resolution and work a good go too, though don't expect gangbuster framerates if you're keeping the quality settings high. When it was released it was a little bit too expensive for its mid-range place (taking on Nvidia's RTX 3060), but now the prices have fallen, the value for money here has improved and the gap with the cheaper RX 6600 is smaller. If you've already got a budget graphics card from the AMD generation before the 6600 XT then you might not see an enormous leap, but this is one of the best AMD graphics cards on a budget that can still hold its own.  Our expert review: This isn't exactly a budget graphics card, but it's the cheapest card we can recommend for those who want 4K gaming. The RTX 4070 is about double the cost of the 4060 at number two on our list, and you won't be getting literally double the performance, but we found the jump to be notable at all resolutions. As I mentioned, the key thing here is that the 4070 is a 4K-capable card, which immediately makes it more future-proof and versatile as well as objectively better.\u00a0In terms of what's under the hood, the 4070 has 12GB of GDDR6X VRAM (a jump up from the 8GB offerings elsewhere on this list) and 5,888 CUDA cores. You also get the usual Nvidia features like DLSS 3 to boost frame rates and advanced ray tracing capability, making it a great mid-range GPU package. This is at at the very top of the budget spectrum, but it may well last you longer as games become increasingly demanding.  Our expert review: You may be tempted to limit your search for the best budget graphics cards to the latest generations, and that does make sense for futureproofing. However, \u00a0if you cast your net wider (or back in time), you may find the RTX 3006 Ti is the perfect GPU. The first thing it has on its side is that it get discounts since it's been usurped by the current generation's 4060. Performance-wise, its 8GB of GDDR6 RAM, and 4,864 CUDA cores offer a lean-but-still-mean spec sheet, and we find no trouble with high-quality gaming or programs at 1080p, with the card happily crunch through tasks at that resolution. While it's still available, the RTX 3060 Ti is still a viable option in budget waters. When choosing computer components like graphics cards, it can be easy to quickly get lost in all the specs, numbers and technical terms, so a good thing to do is keep in mind what you realistically need. When you're choosing a budget graphics card, it pays to be realistic \u2013 you are unlikely to get a 4K graphics card, but in all honesty, you probably don't need one. For most applications, 1080p is just fine, perhaps with 1440p as a stretch option if you have the budget. If you're gaming, you may want to focus more on frame rate, with 60p being preferable over 30p if possible. You're going to be looking at a card from one of the big three names in the industry \u2013 Nvidia, Intel or AMD. Nvidia are very much the flagship leaders when it comes to graphics cards, and they produce some of the best in the business \u2013 however, Intel and AMD can be great manufacturers to look at if you want to maximise value for money. You also don't necessarily have to look at the latest models \u2013 sometimes grabbing a last-gen card can be a great way to save yourself some cash while still getting everything you need. What's the best budget graphics card overall? Our top pick is the AMD Radeon RX 7600 for the balance between performance/features and price. We have picked the best budget graphics cards for this guide based on a combination of our writers' hands-on reviewing and texting experience, as well as that of our other writers and editors and contributors from our sister sites such as Tech Radar. When picking graphics cards we don't just look at the base specs, but also draw on the real-world experience of our writers and look at user reviews, to get a sense of whether a card's performance matches the manufacturer's claims. Even by the standards of computer components (and, y'know, everything else) prices of GPUs have shot up in recent years. However, unlike some other computer components, where prices have returned somewhat to normal in the aftermath of global shockwaves such as the pandemic and the war in Ukraine, GPU prices have remained stubbornly high, even while demand doesn't seem to be rising to meet them. The short answer is that nobody knows exactly why this is, although there are theories. It could be an increase in the cost of wafers from Taiwanese foundry TSMC, though the specifics of the contracts they have with Nvidia and AMD are a closely guarded secret, so we don't know if that's a factor. The answer could be as simple as a good old-fashioned concerted price hike \u2013 discrete graphics cards are a luxury that not many people are willing to pay for, but the manufacturers may be betting that the enthusiasts who want them will simply fork over the asking price regardless of what it is. Some have speculated that the rise of interest in generative AI may be fuelling a perceived spike in interest in GPUs, causing prices to stay at high levels. But ultimately, all this is guesswork, and it may take time for GPU prices to return to reasonable levels. If indeed they do at all. If you're looking for the best cheap graphics card, you'll probably have noticed the Nvidia's RTX cards are cheaper than its GTX cards. GTX stands for Giga Texel Shader eXtreme (GTX) and RTX for Ray Tracing Texel eXtreme (RTX). Both are produced under the GeForce brand, but the latter is a newer technology. The GTX series uses Pascal and Turing architecture while RTX uses more advanced Turing and Ampere architecture. One major difference in gaming is the hardware-accelerated ray tracing in RTX cards, which provides more realism in lighting and shadow. And while they require more power, RTX GPUS are also more efficient on a per watt basis. As with most tech products, the answer to this question is something of a case-by-case basis. As we've seen in this guide, it is absolutely possible to get a cheap graphics card that will do everything you need it to, provided you've set realistic expectations. However, there are also plenty of cheap cards that don't represent good value for money, which is why it always pays to read reviews and make sure you're not getting hoodwinked by a deal that's too good to be true. It depends on what you plan to do with your computer. Discrete GPUs are great for high-intensity gaming with top-end graphics and fast frame rates. They're also great for crunching through design tasks that require a lot of graphical horsepower, such as editing high-resolution videos or photos. If these doesn't sound like the sort of ways you'll be using your computer, then it's likely the built-in GPU your computer has will be sufficient for your purposes.
