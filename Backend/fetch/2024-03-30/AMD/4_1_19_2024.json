One promising additive is graphene and its derivatives, but most organizations don\u2019t know where to begin, so development walls are hit early in the process and therefore projects can be abandoned before success.\n\nBut your chances of success are drastically increased when you partner with industry experts that know what forms of graphene will meet your needs. In this webinar Mito Materials will discuss how to successfully source, formulate and deploy any graphene material in the world \u2014 and do it to your specs and timeline. Semi-empirical techniques such as kinetic modeling play a pivotal role in setting up such systems for optimizing production without compromising quality or escalating cost.\n\nThis webinar is aimed to elevate your understanding of kinetic models to unlock their full potential, empowering you to make informed decisions and extract valuable insights for your polymer processing and applications. With a history of over 50 years, kinetic models are a powerful tool for comprehending and predicting material behavior.\n\nJoin our expert scientists as they explain the process of creating, interpreting and applying these models, from the lab to the production floor. You'll gain insight into how kinetic models are used in the composite production process, as well as their limitations and why relying solely on kinetic models may not be sufficient to gain the process control now required.\n\nThis first masterclass gives the foundation for part two, where we look beyond kinetics and how to evaluate alternatives that challenge the status quo and enable innovative pathways to boost your production efficiency and improve sustainability.\n\nAgenda:\u00a0\n\n\n\tDecoding kinetic models: the core principles of kinetic models and how they wield immense power in optimizing your manufacturing processes\n\tApplication insights: strategic applications of kinetic models within polymer processing and unlocking new avenues for efficiency and performance enhancement in production\n\tNavigating limitations: insights into the derivation process of kinetic models and how to navigate inherent limitations with confidence and clarity Over 12,000 ASTM standards operate globally.
