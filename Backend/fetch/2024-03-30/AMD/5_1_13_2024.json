    "text": "At CES 2024, AMD has showcased its new AM5 Ryzen 8000G Hawk Point desktop APUs. These come with Zen 4 CPU and RDNA 3 GPU cores. They also have the company\u2019s latest Ryzen AI XDNA NPU\u00a0cores, which are there to accelerate artificial intelligence and machine learning tasks. Now, if you\u2019re planning to build a rig with the new Ryzen 8000G APUs, you shouldn\u2019t skimp on the memory. In an interview with PCWorld (video attached below), Donny Woligroski from AMD recommended pairing the Hawk Point APUs with dual-channel DDR5-6000 RAM. The AMD exec says that memory configuration will make a system Ryzen 8000G Hawk Point APU offer \u201cgreat frames and really playable performance.\u201d Fortunately, the prices of DDR5-6000 RAM have dropped quite a bit compared to the launch prices. To illustrate, you can currently pick up a 2 x 16 GB Corsair Vengence RGB kit for $110 on Amazon. If you don\u2019t want RGB, the 2 x 16 GB Teamgroup DDR5 6000 MHz RAM kit with a current price tag of $88 on Amazon is a good pick. Basically, you don\u2019t need to put too much money into the memory department of a system with a Ryzen 8000G APU. For those wondering, AMD has showcased four new Hawk Point APUs at CES 2024. The lineup includes Ryzen 3 8300G, Ryzen 5 8500G, Ryzen 5 8600G, and Ryzen 7 8700G. Among them, the Ryzen 3 will only be available via OEM systems. The rest will be available to the consumers, with the 8500G at $180, 8600G at $230, and 8700G at $330. They are scheduled to be available from January 31. IT Home "
