    "text": "The CPU market is doing incredibly well, with compelling deals from Intel and AMD. The Ryzen 7 7800X3D, which we tested extensively, is going at its lowest price in recent months. The 3D V-Cache processor has been a gamer favorite, topping bestselling charts for as far as I can recall. It launched at an MSRP of $449 last year but can now be snagged for just $349 off Newegg, Amazon, or Microcenter. If you\u2019re looking for a new motherboard, you can get another $50-100 off by opting for a bundle. Intel\u2019s competing Core i7-13700K and the Core i7-14700K are also discounted to new lows, giving enthusiasts ample options. The 13700K retails at $349 on Microcenter, while the 14700K is going for $369. We compared the Ryzen 7 7800X3D against the 14700K, and you can go through our results here. There are plenty of deals on the AMD side. The Ryzen 9 7950X3D has dropped to $594, down from its sticker price of $699. This is the all-around gaming/content creation monster, featuring 16 cores, 128MB of L3 cache, and a boost clock of 5.7GHz. If you want something more affordable, the Ryzen 9 7900X is down to $383 (MSRP: $549). Featuring 12 cores clocked at up to 5.6GHz and 64MB of L3 cache, it is a capable gaming/content creation chip under $400. It\u2019s an excellent option for mid-to-high-end gaming rigs. "
