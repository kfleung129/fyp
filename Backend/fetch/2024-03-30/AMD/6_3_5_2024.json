    "text": "  Posted By Shubhankar Parijat | On 05th, Mar. 2024  Horizon Forbidden West\u00a0is the next big first-party PlayStation exclusive that\u2019s making the jump to PC, and ahead of its launch for the platform later this month, Sony has revealed the port\u2019s system requirements- and they\u2019re quite hefty, as you might expect from a game this technically ambitious. Regardless of which preset you\u2019re choosing to play the game at, you\u2019re going to need 16 GB of RAM, an SSD, and an eye-watering 150 GB of storage. On the lowest settings, which will run the game at 720p and 30 FPS, you\u2019ll need either an i3-8100 or a Ryzen 3 1300X, along with either a GeForce GTX 1650 or a Radeon RX 5500XT. Meanwhile, on the highest settings, to play the game at 4K and 60 FPS, you\u2019ll need either an i7-11700 or a Ryzen 7 5700X, along with either a GeForce RTX 4080 or a Radeon RX 7900XT. You can check out the full system requirements below. Horizon Forbidden West Complete Edition\u00a0will launch for PC via Steam and Epic Games Store on March 21.
