Learn more It\u2019s time to find out now if you have the best CPU for Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, or if you\u2019re due a much-needed update. This buying guide includes our top recommends for AMD and Intel processors from the latest generation so you can stay futureproofed. It\u2019s worth noting that you\u2019ll also want to consider what the best graphics cards and best laptop for Suicide Squad are so you can make an informed decision. The latest of Rocksteady\u2019s games has now launched on next-gen consoles and caused quite a stir. With no reviews ahead of its launch, alongside Denuvo making a late appearance, it\u2019s been a tentative release, for sure. If you\u2019re now getting ready to play Suicide Squad: KTJL, and you\u2019re encountering any performance issues, you might be wondering if your processor is up to the task, and if not, what options you have for an upgrade. Shop on Amazon Shop on Amazon Shop on Amazon Newegg According to the Suicide Squad KTJL system requirements, the recommended CPU needed to run the game is an AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D or an Intel i7-10700K. These are fairly aged and, now inexpensive, processors, so its safe to say that most people\u2019s gaming PCs match or surpass this. If you don\u2019t, and you\u2019re really struggling to run the game, we\u2019re going to recommend that you upgrade to the AMD Ryzen 5 7800X3D, one of our overall best picks for gaming CPUs. Cores 8 Threads 16 Base speed 4.2GHz Boost speed 5.9GHz Cache 104MB TDP 120W BestBuy The Ryzen 7 7800X3D stands out as an astonishing CPU optimised for 4K gaming, and will certainly not be the bottleneck if your gaming PC is experiencing performance issues. The standout feature is, of course, its 3D V-Caching capabilities. This is going to drastically increase the speed and efficiency of your processor\u2019s workflow management which, in gaming terms, is going to make it easier for your PC to reach high frame rates and sustain them. With eight CPU cores and 16 threads, the processor is going to be adept at multitasking, which is great for streamers and content creators, while the ultrafast clock speeds between 4.2GHz and 5GHz are going to tear up intensive graphical rendering processes such as DLSS, FSR, and ray tracing. The AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D sets an exemplar standard for the quality and performance needed from a gaming CPU, with 4K resolution at a steady and consistent FPS almost guaranteed, all for an affordable price. Cores 6 Threads 12 Base speed 4.7GHz Boost speed 5.3GHz Cache 32MB TDP 105W Our second choice for a CPU for Suicide Squad KTJL is going to be the AMD Ryzen 5 7600X, another budget processor that\u2019s going to pack a spicy punch. While it isn\u2019t going to be able to make use of the 3D V-Cache stack that the X3D variants can, there\u2019s going be just as many performance enhancements on offer. With six CPU cores and 12 threads, there\u2019s also 32MB of L3 Cache alongside 6MB of L2 Cache. The specs definitely cater towards mid-range performance, of which you can expect to be running the game at 1080p and 1440p comfortably \u2013 depending on your graphics card, of course. One of the main reasons why I\u2019m a big champion of AMD CPUs over Intel is the affordability and performance on offer. Intel\u2019s CPUs are just a little more expensive in general, with only minimal gains in performance and efficiency. As a budget option, the Ryzen 5 7600X is going to offer up a really well-rounded gaming experience that you\u2019d struggle to match with CPUs in a similar price-bracket. For that reason, we\u2019re going to be including it as one of the best CPUs for Suicide Squad. Cores 14 Threads 20 Base speed P-cores 3.5 GHz / E-cores 2.6 GHz Boost speed P-cores 5.1 GHz / E-cores 3.9 GHz Cache 20MB TDP 125 W / 181 W boost If you\u2019ve had enough Ryzen recommendations here, then an Intel processor will probably sit well with you instead. We\u2019d consider the Intel i5-13600K as a fine mid-range CPU to run Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League with anywhere between 1080p and 4K resolution. It\u2019s a really solid choice, even if it\u2019s not going to perform as efficiently as the 7800X3D might. It\u2019s going to be functioning much faster than the 7600X too, despite the added cost. You\u2019ll be working with 14 cores and 20 threads which are going to be operating between 3.5GHz and 5.1GHz depending on whether or not you\u2019ve overclocked you processor. The TDP of Intel\u2019s CPUs is usually a fair bit higher than that of AMD Ryzen CPUs, so that\u2019s definitely something to consider if you\u2019re concerned about energy consumption. When it comes to performance, you\u2019re going to see extremely steady frame rates and fast load times thanks to the 20MB primary cache, and 24MB secondary cache. That\u2019s as much as we have on the best CPU for Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, though you might consider the best monitor to pair with the game too. Is Suicide Squad KTJL a CPU or GPU intensive game? We\u2019d say that the Suicide Squad game leans more on the side of being a CPU intensive game. Relying on processes such as DLSS and other frame gen processes demands quite a bit from the processor. Amaar loves retro hardware and boring games with more words than action.
