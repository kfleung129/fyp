    "text": " Advanced micro devices (NASDAQ: AMD) The share price hit a 52-week high on March 8, but the chipmaker\u2019s shares have fallen more than 15% since then, even though there has been no significant company-specific development in the meantime. Naturally reports that China is reportedly planning to replace chips from AMD and AMD Intel of Chinese government servers and personal computers (PCs) did briefly weigh on the stock price, but even that shouldn\u2019t be a major problem for AMD in the long run.  This is why. Table of Contents AMD reportedly gets 15% of its total revenue from selling its chips to China.  Any sanctions on the sale of its chips in that country could therefore have consequences for AMD\u2019s financial situation.  However, the dynamics of the semiconductor market are such that even if AMD cannot sell its chips in China, the company will have other options to sell them. For example, sales of both servers and PCs are expected to grow significantly worldwide thanks to the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI).  PC sales fell just 2.7% year over year in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to the 14% decline for the full year.  The market will witness a sea change in 2024, driven by a new cycle of innovation in the enterprise and education markets, as well as the advent of AI-enabled PCs. Market research firm Canalys estimates that 48 million AI PCs could be shipped this year, accounting for 18% of the total market.  Furthermore, the supply of AI PCs could grow 44% annually through 2028 and account for 70% of the total market.  Canalys also points out that AI PCs will likely command a 10% to 15% premium compared to traditional machines. AMD therefore has the opportunity to increase both volumes and average selling price (ASP) of central processing units (CPUs).  It\u2019s also worth noting that AMD has taken market share from Intel in the PC market.  According to Mercury Research, the company held 20.2% of the client CPU market in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to 17.1% in the same period a year ago. The story continues Mercury Research attributed the market share gains to AMD\u2019s early move into the AI \u200b\u200bPC market with its Ryzen 7040 processor.  Meanwhile, AMD claims its CPUs power more than 90% of AI PCs on the market today.  So, stronger demand for AI PCs will give AMD\u2019s client processor business a nice boost. Something similar will likely unfold in the server CPU and GPU (graphics processing unit) markets.  AMD ended 2023 with control of 23% of the server CPU market, compared to 17.6% in the same period a year ago.  AMD CEO Lisa Su noted during the latest conference call that the company is witnessing \u201crobust demand for EPYC server CPUs among cloud, enterprise and AI customers.\u201d AMD also added that \u201ca growing number of customers are adopting EPYC CPUs for workload offloading.\u201d  The good part is that the momentum of AMD\u2019s server CPUs will continue as the AI \u200b\u200bserver market is predicted to see 26% annual growth through 2029.  On the other hand, AMD also saw stronger-than-expected demand for its AI GPUs.  . AMD raised its full-year revenue forecast from data center GPUs to $3.5 billion from its previous estimate of $2 billion.  However, management made it clear on the earnings call that the company could very well surpass this milestone thanks to an improving supply chain that will help meet the additional demand.  All of this suggests that AMD is well-positioned to beat analyst expectations in the coming quarters. When AMD announced its fourth quarter 2023 results on January 30, 2024, the company midway through expected revenues of $5.4 billion for the first quarter of 2024. That would be nearly equal to revenues of $5.35 billion in the same period last year.  Additionally, AMD\u2019s non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) gross margin guidance of 52% for the current quarter would be a slight improvement over last year\u2019s 50%. AMD\u2019s revenue and profit could therefore rise slightly in the first quarter.  However, analysts expect AMD to post quarterly revenue of $5 billion, which is lower than the company expected.  Additionally, consensus estimates predict a decline in AMD\u2019s earnings to $0.55 per share, compared to $0.60 per share a year ago. However, there is a good chance that AMD can exceed market expectations by a large margin due to the multiple AI-related tailwinds discussed above.  The good thing is that AMD\u2019s decline has made the stock cheaper than before.  This is evident from the graph: AMD PE ratio (forward) chart AMD now trades at 49 times forward earnings and has a price-to-sales ratio of less than 13. Earlier this month, the company traded at more than 57 times forward earnings and 15 times revenue.  Smart investors might consider using this decline to accumulate AMD stock, as the aforementioned growth drivers could help the company regain its mojo, and the turnaround could start as early as next month when it reports its first-quarter 2024 results announces.
