The model name is also prominently displayed within a bold red box. The package's rear keeps with the AMD motif, detailing features against a minimalist white backdrop with front-matching patterns and a succinct list of specs.  Upon opening, a layer reveals the documentation, while a denser foam with a tailored cutout securely houses the RX 7900 GRE 16GB, which is encased in a static-resistant bag with extra plastic protection. Any additional accessories are neatly stowed in a special foam compartment.  From a hardware perspective, the graphics card requires a dual 8-pin power connector. It also features a triple -fan cooler within a 3-slot design. Notably, the reference card comes with a backplate. It's a classy looking product alright.The card offers ample connectivity with two DisplayPort 2.1 outputs and two HDMI 2.1 port and supports high refresh rates at high resolutions with AMD's Radiance Display engine.  Thermal regulation is managed by an adaptive fan system that modulates RPMs based on GPU junction and memory temperature, maintaining a base speed of 1600 RPM and ramping up as needed. It can also slow down or halt completely to maintain optimal temperatures. The card requires dual 8-pin power connectors.  When max temperatures are attained, the fan RPM will incrementally increase to sustain the set temperature. If the GPU's temperature stays considerably below the target, the RPM might descend. The fan will cease operation when the GPU's temperature is below all predefined fan stop temperatures, resuming only when the GPU surpasses any of the set fan start temperatures.
