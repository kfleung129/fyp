    "text": " Despite a rich valuation, bringing AI chips to market could propel AMD even higher Advertisement Source: Pamela Marciano / Shutterstock.com Like most other tech stocks, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) has been off to a rough start for 2024. After reaching prices nearing $150 per share in late December, AMD stock has since slid back to around $135 per share. The general direction of the broad market has played a role in this. However, valuation-related worries have also been a factor. AMD continues to trade at a moderately high premium to its main peer, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). This comes despite the fact that Nvidia has made far more commercial progress in the area of AI-compatible chips. But while these factors suggest that declines are more likely than further gains in 2024 for AMD shares, it\u2019s not necessarily set in stone that things play out this way. There\u2019s still a path to further gains for the stock. Why? Let\u2019s take a closer look and find out. As seen from AMD\u2019s latest price performance, the stock is experiencing another round of bearishness. Again, much of this is in tandem with investor sentiment about the broad market. The November and December rally has given way to a January sell-off, as the market re-assess how much the macro picture will improve this year. This negative sentiment shift could carry on in the near-term, having a further impact on the valuation of AMD stock. Alongside this, the other aforementioned factor affecting AMD\u2019s price performance may not be waning in impact, either. Valuation concerns have only just now had an effect, despite commentators from Barron\u2019s and elsewhere expressing them a month ago. Possibly in \u201cpriced for perfection\u201d territory, if Advanced Micro Devices falls short of expectations, when it releases its latest results/updates to guidance later this month, investors could use it as justification to make their exit from the stock. Then again, maybe not. Although the skeptics may think that it\u2019s the beginning of the end for AMD\u2019s incredible AI-driven run-up, that\u2019s not necessarily the case. Subsequent developments related to the company\u2019s move into chips for the generative AI market could instead provide more runway. At present, the price-to-forward-earnings ratio for AMD stock is approximately 51. NVDA stock has a forward earnings ratio of only 38.9. On the surface, this suggests that AMD is overvalued, given that it\u2019s Nvidia, not Advanced Micro Devices, that has already capitalized on the AI chips trend. Still, this may be a short-sighted takeaway. AMD\u2019s management has been quite conservative in its AI-related sales forecasts. Back in October, CEO Lisa Su forecasted that the company would sell $2 billion worth of its Instinct MI300 accelerators in 2024. However, AMD could ship 400,000 units of this chip this year. With comparable chips from Nvidia selling for tens of thousands per unit, clearly there\u2019s room for the MI300 to have an outsized impact on AMD\u2019s fiscal results this year. That\u2019s not all. As discussed recently, the company has another promising AI chip product: its Ryzen 8040 Series processors for laptops. Put it all together, and AMD clearly has the ingredients in place for another banner year. The company could \u201cbeat and raise\u201d in the quarters ahead, the sell-side could continue raising their earnings forecasts, and the market may carry on factoring in future growth into the stock price. If weakness persists with AMD shares in the coming weeks, this may work to your advantage. That\u2019s not to say that you\u2019ll be able to buy this stock at prices last hit in January 2023, but the recent pullback, or any pullback ahead of earnings, may prove to be a solid entry point. Considering Advanced Micro Devices\u2019 latest product launches, plus continued strong demand trends for AI chips, chances are this month\u2019s quarterly earnings release will unveil positive surprises rather than major disappointment. As the months progress, and the company not merely meets, but beats, AI-related expectations, the stock could re-hit its high water mark ($161.91 per share), then keep heading up to new highs. Hence, do not get scared off by the macro doom-and-gloom, or by the valuation skeptics. Make AMD stock a buy instead. AMD stock earns an A rating in Portfolio Grader.
