    "text": "Liliputing Acer is refreshing two of its thin and light laptops with new models powered by AMD\u2019s Ryzen 8040 processors featuring RDNA 3 integrated graphics and Ryzen AI features. The new\u00a0Acer Swift Go 14 (SG140-63/T) sells for $700 and up and supports up to a 14 inch, 2.8K OLED, 90 Hz display and Ryzen 9 8945HS processor, while the Acer Swift Edge 16 (SFE16-44) starts at $1300, supports up to a Ryzen 7 8840U processor, and ships standard with a 3.2K OLED, 120 Hz refresh rate. Both laptops should hit the streets in the coming months. Acer is positioning the new laptops as \u201cAI PCs,\u201d thanks to the Ryzen AI neural processing units baked into AMD\u2019s latest chips, along with a few other features including dedicated Windows Copilot buttons on the keyboards and support for Acer\u2019s AI-enhanced voice, graphics, and image editing software. But those are hardly distinguishing features: most new laptops that ship this year with the latest Intel, AMD, or Qualcomm processors have built-in NPUs. Still, the upgraded NPU is just about the only thing setting AMD\u2019s new Ryzen 8040 series processors apart from the previous-gen Ryzen 7040 chips, which have the same CPU and GPU architecture. The new\u00a0Acer Swift Edge 16 is thinner and lighter than the new Swift Go 14, despite having a larger display. It measures 358 x 246 x 13mm (14.1\u2033 x 9.7\u2033 x 0.5\u2033) and weighs 1.23 kg (2.71 pounds). It also offers optional support for WiFi 7, which is not available on the 14 inch model.\u00a0But it achieves that thin and light design by featuring a smaller battery and a less power-hungry U-series processor.

Why is the frame around the screen so big in 2024? keyboard arrow keys are impractical.. Matthew Moniz YouTube review of a 2023 version of this same Swift Edge 16 with AMD 7840U (https://youtu.be/T9q5Yd8d5PE?t=285) uncovered an interesting fact about what otherwise seemed like a pretty compelling laptop \u2013 the fact that idle fan noise is around 45 dB and he was unable to tame/lower it with settings. Hopefully this years model somehow addresses it, but on the other hand who knows why the Acer chose to minimize heat so aggressively? Maybe there is a compelling reason to do so? I can only imaging how ridiculous it would be to buy a 7840U that is marketed as \u201cultra low power\u201d APU only to discover that idle fan noise is not anywhere near zero. The blame is hard to place exactly. I would be inclined to look at AMD as far as \u201cblame\u201d goes because AMD for some reason it sees like it is not offering low enough power (TDP?) APUs besides custom designed chips for Steam Deck (AMD Van Gogh). That way AMD is loosing the entire x86 tablet market for example and who knows what else. Perhaps extreme minimization of weight of this device is also partially a culprit? I wonder if Acer should consider Frore AirJet or some similar passive cooling material or technique, perhaps peltier even? Perhaps there even exists a lightweight passive cooled material? I also wonder why x86 manufacturers don\u2019t seem to get that passive cooled laptops are actually attractive for this segment as demonstrated with Mac Air passive cooled laptops..
