    "text": "KeyBanc\u00a0analyst John Vinh maintained an Overweight rating on\u00a0Advanced Micro Devices, Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:AMD) with a price target of $270. The analyst said AMD grew modestly in February, as Genoa\u2019s growth remained strong. AMD processor instances were +1% month-on-month (M/M), +24% Y/Y, compared with January (+1% M/M,+35% Y/Y). Genoa instance growth remained strong (+19% M/M), led by\u00a0Amazon.Com Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS, after growing +13% M/M in January. Rome was +1% M/M,+14% Y/Y. AMD\u2019s price target is $270, based on 30x Vinh\u2019s 2025 EPS estimate of $9.05. AMD is trading at 21x Vinh\u2019s 2025 EPS estimate and 38x the 2025 consensus EPS estimate compared to its peers, trading at an average consensus 2025E P/E multiple of 34x.  Vinh\u2019s February results showed a continued decline in traditional server demand and China, as cloud instances saw a slight decrease of 1% M/M, a downturn from January\u2019s 1% growth M/M. This overall decline was marked by\u00a0Alibaba Group Holding Limited\u2019s\u00a0(NYSE:BABA) significant 11% reduction in M/M, underscoring the weakness in China\u2019s cloud sector. On a company basis,\u00a0Nvidia Corp\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) and\u00a0Arm Holdings Plc\u00a0\u00a0(NASDAQ:ARM) remained stable M/M, and\u00a0Intel Corp\u00a0(NASDAQ:INTC) experienced a 1% decline M/M. In contrast, Intel\u2019s Sapphire Rapids instances slowed to 2% M/M growth following a significant 50% M/M surge in January. Nvidia\u2019s GPU growth remained stagnant M/M, mirroring its January performance, with U.S. cloud service providers (CSPs) allocating capital expenditure towards internal generative AI workloads.  ARM\u2019s server growth was flat m/m versus a slight 1% M/M increase in January. Based on the latest cloud tracker data, these findings suggest a moderately positive outlook for AMD and a neutral impact on ARM, Intel, and Nvidia. Investors can gain exposure to AMD via\u00a0AOT Growth And Innovation ETF\u00a0(NASDAQ:AOTG) and\u00a0Invesco PHLX Semiconductor ETF\u00a0(NASDAQ:SOXQ).
