Though specific details on Sony\u2019s next gaming console remain scarce, industry insiders have revealed a few tidbits \u2013 one of these being that the multinational tech conglomerate will stick with AMD CPUs for their upcoming gaming system. Now, this isn\u2019t exactly shocking, considering the PS4 and PS5 were equipped with the AMD Jaguar and Zen 2, respectively. What\u2019s surprising, however, is that Sony apparently wasn\u2019t considering any vendor other than AMD. According to YouTuber RedGamingTech, the only time Sony considered switching suppliers was prior to the PS5\u2019s 2020 release. During that time, there had seemingly been discussions with other vendors, the most prominent of these being, of course, Nvidia. But for several reasons, including ease of backward compatibility and an already dedicated custom solutions team, Sony eventually decided to stick with its original supplier. Of course, we\u2019d still recommend taking this information with a grain of salt. That is, until the PlayStation team arrives with more details and actual confirmation. Now, whether this remains true ahead of the PS6\u2019s alleged 2028 release date remains to be seen. The company\u2019s higher-ups remain tight-lipped on their upcoming gaming console leaving plenty of room for speculation. In the previously linked video, RedGamingTech also stated that \u201cthe number of compute units and the amount of RAM had not been nailed down,\u201d indicating that it\u2019s still very much in its early development phase. In addition, the PS5 Pro is reportedly gearing up for a late 2024 launch, though nothing is set in stone. This affords Sony some time to work on their next mainline console, the PS6, which will likely be an even more powerful machine with its next-gen AMD CPU. That said, you may need to remain patient for a long while before more information comes out. While you wait, we recommend reading through our PS5 Slim vs. PS5 comparison page to pass the time.
