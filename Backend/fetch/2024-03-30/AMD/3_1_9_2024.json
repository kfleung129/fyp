    "text": "Lenovo has announced a new IdeaPad 5 2-in-1 variant at CES 2024. It comes with AMD's new Ryzen 8000 series Hawk Point processors and two screen sizes. Those looking for Meteor Lake alternatives can check out the IdeaPad 5i 2-in-1. The IdeaPad 5 2-in-1 16-inch starts at $749, and the 14-inch version is $729. Both laptops will go on sale in April 2024. The Lenovo IdeaPad 5 2-in-1 is available in 14-inch and 16-inch flavours. The 16-inch variant has two configurations: 2K (2,048 x 1,280) OLED, 60 Hz refresh rate, 400 nits peak brightness and 100% DCI-P3 colour gamut coverage and WUXGA (1,920 x 1,200) IPS, 60 Hz refresh rate, 300 nits peak brightness and 45% NTSC colour gamut coverage. Both are touch-enabled and come with TUV Rhineland certification. The 14-inch IdeaPad 5 2-in-1 uses a WUXGA panel for both configurations, with the main differentiator being OLED and IPS LCD. Otherwise, the specs are identical to that of the 16-inch version. Under the hood, the Lenovo IdeaPad 5 2-in-1 packs an AMD Ryzen 7 8845HS processor with a Radeon 780M iGPU. Interestingly, the memory is capped out at 16 GB of LPDDR5X RAM, which can be paired with 1 TB NVMe SSD. The former is not upgradable, but the latter could be. The IdeaPad 5 2-in-1 draws power from a 57 Wh battery and supports Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.2. Its 1080p webcam comes with a privacy shutter and a dual-mic array. I/O includes 2x USB 3.2 Gen2 Type-C ports, 2x USB 3.2 Gen1 Type-A ports, one HDMI 1.4b port, one 3.5 mm combo jack and an SD card reader. Lastly, it is important to note that the 16-inch version's keyboard comes with a numpad, while the 14-inch variant does not, presumably due to size constraints. Lenovo "
