The GPU, dubbed Golden Rabbit Edition, was exclusively released in China in the middle of last year, and despite AMD noting a U.S. price, the card never made its way across the Pacific \u2014 until now. I\u2019ve been testing the RX 7900 GRE, a version of the GRE for the U.S. that comes with an attractive new price of $550. Striking back at the RTX 4070 Super and delivering a step between AMD\u2019s value-focused and flagship lineups, the RX 7900 GRE is a surprising option that I didn\u2019t know the GPU market needed. And its smart pricing and great performance squarely lands it among the best graphics cards. The RX 7900 GRE comes in at only $50 more than the RX 7800 XT, but it\u2019s a significant jump in specs. That\u2019s because it\u2019s using the Navi 31 GPU, which is the same core you\u2019ll find on the RX 7900 XT and RX 7900 XTX. Unlike several GPUs we\u2019ve seen this generation, the name is appropriate on this one. It\u2019s a cut-down RX 7900 XT, not a souped-up RX 7800 XT. Unsurprisingly, the memory spec outclasses what Nvidia offers at this price. You\u2019re getting 16GB of GDDR6 memory across a 256-bit bus, along with 64MB of AMD\u2019s Infinity Cache. That\u2019s the same memory configuration you\u2019ll find on the RX 7800 XT, but the RX 7900 GRE earns its stripes with a massively boosted core count. It comes with 5,120 cores, which is 33% more than the RX 7800 XT, but more surprisingly, only 5% less than the RX 7900 XT \u2014 a GPU that\u2019s currently selling for around $750. The RX 7900 XT comes with a better memory spec, and it\u2019s a faster GPU overall. But it\u2019s shocking how close the RX 7900 GRE gets considering its $550 price tag. This is still a lower-power GPU \u2014 literally. The RX 7900 XT can draw up to 300 watts, while the RX 7900 GRE tops out at 260W. That\u2019s almost identical to the RX 7800 XT. The specs are fantastic, but that\u2019s not surprising. When AMD originally revealed the RX 7900 GRE last year, it announced a price of $650 in the U.S. Several months in China has seemingly made AMD reverse course, with the RX 7900 GRE hitting the U.S. market at a much lower price. You\u2019re getting a lot for your money here, which translates into real-world performance. Starting off with a look at 3DMark, the stage is already set well for the RX 7900 GRE. In the DirectX 12-based Time Spy, the card is 5% faster than Nvidia\u2019s competing RTX 4070 Super, and a massive 18% faster than the RX 7800 XT. This is a dominating lead for AMD, as Nvidia\u2019s competing GPU is not only slower, but also more expensive. It shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise that a benchmark with ray tracing, like 3DMark\u2019s Port Royal, paints a slightly different picture. In this test, the RTX 4070 Super and RX 7900 GRE trade places, with Nvidia\u2019s GPU ahead by 4%. Still, the jump here for AMD is impressive, with the RX 7900 GRE leading the RX 7800 XT by 22%. The RX 7900 GRE is even ahead of the RTX 4070 by around 12%. The narrative that AMD is behind in ray tracing is alive and well, but it\u2019s not as big of a deal today as it was even a year ago. The RX 7900 GRE matches the RTX 4070 Super if you take rasterized and ray tracing performance into account \u2014 just for $50 less. Once you start looking at real games, it even takes a lead. At $550, the RX 7900 GRE is an aspirational GPU for 4K. It can handle 4K in a lot of games, but the most demanding titles won\u2019t run at playable frame rates without some upscaling assistance. On average, however, the RX 7900 GRE passes the playable mark more cleanly than its direct competitors. Across the full test suite, including ray tracing titles, the RX 7900 GRE is 6% ahead of the RTX 4070 Super and 12% ahead of the RX 7800 XT. There are games where the RX 7900 GRE shoots ahead of the RTX 4070 Super, including Forza Horizon 5, Red Dead Redemption 2,\u00a0and most surprisingly,\u00a0Returnal. That game is particularly impressive for the RX 7900 GRE as it matches the performance of the $800 RTX 4070 Ti Super. In other titles, the RX 7900 and RTX 4070 Super are much closer, such as\u00a0Horizon Zero Dawn\u00a0and\u00a0Cyberpunk 2077.\u00a0There are a few frames between the graphics cards, but this is performance parity overall. It\u2019s not all upsides for the RX 7900 GRE, however. As you can see in The Last of Us Part One,\u00a0the RX 7900 GRE falls short of the RTX 4070 Super and only provides a minor uplift over the RX 7800 XT. That said, you can see how the RTX 4070 Ti Super and RTX 4070 Super posted very similar results in game, showcasing that the title still has some strange behavior with GPUs. The Last of Us Part One\u00a0is the only game where I saw the RX 7900 GRE below the competition from Nvidia. In Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla,\u00a0AMD is once again in the lead, and by a very significant margin if you factor in the performance of the base RTX 4070 that also sells for $550. The RX 7900 GRE is surprisingly potent at 4K. It managed to cross 60 frames per second (fps) in the vast majority of games I tested and occasionally headed into the triple digits. And in the titles where it fell short, a bit of help from upscaling went a long way. The RX 7900 GRE is most comfortable at 1440p, where it now reaches an average in the triple digits. It once again leads the RTX 4070 Super by about 5%, and it manages to outclass the RX 7800 XT by 12% and the base RTX 4070 by a massive 16%. Even with the Super refresh, Nvidia is still selling the RTX 4070 at $550, and the RX 7900 GRE is 16% faster at the same price. This average includes ray tracing, so the RX 7900 GRE leads in a more dominating way in some rasterized titles. In Forza Horizon 5,\u00a0for example, it\u2019s 14% faster than the RTX 4070, and in\u00a0Returnal, it\u2019s over 35% faster, matching the performance of the RTX 4070 Ti Super.\u00a0Red Dead Redemption 2\u00a0also shows AMD out in front, with the card 22% ahead of the base RTX 4070 and 6% ahead of the Super variant. In\u00a0Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla\u00a0and\u00a0Horizon Zero Dawn,\u00a0however, the RX 7900 GRE and RTX 4070 Super are evenly matched (though AMD\u2019s card still shows a lead over the base RTX 4070). Some of the oddities at 4K come out in the favor of AMD at 1440p. In\u00a0Cyberpunk 2077,\u00a0for example, the performance barrier is gone, allowing the RX 7900 GRE to outclass the RTX 4070 Ti Super. That\u2019s not too surprising, as you can see AMD\u2019s GPUs perform exceptionally well in this title with ray tracing turned off. The biggest shift is\u00a0The Last of Us Part One,\u00a0where the lower resolution doesn\u2019t stress the memory interface of these GPUs as much. Down at 1440p, the RX 7900 GRE leads the RTX 4070 Super by 10% and the base RTX 4070 by a massive 28%. Although the RX 7900 GRE is impressive at 4K, the GPU shines much more at 1440p. Without factoring in ray tracing, it\u2019s leagues ahead of the RTX 4070 and RTX 4070 Super, and even when ray tracing is brought into the mix (more on that below), it still comes out slightly ahead. It\u2019s hard justifying a $550 graphics card for 1080p, with options like the RX 7600 XT and RTX 4060 being better suited for this resolution. I still ran all of my benchmarks at 1080p, but we\u2019ll just look at the high-level average rather than diving into individual games. At 1080p, we start to see a CPU bottleneck come into play, with the RX 7900 GRE and RTX 4070 Super showing identical performance on average. However, AMD still holds a sizeable 11% lead over the base RTX 4070, which is available at the same $550 price as the RX 7900 GRE. The elephant in the room with any new AMD GPU is ray tracing, and just like before, the script flips in favor of Nvidia in ray tracing titles.\u00a0Cyberpunk 2077\u00a0is a great example of that. Across resolutions, even the base RTX 4070 manages to outclass the RX 7900 XT, much less the new RX 7900 GRE. The good news for AMD here is that the RX 7900 GRE is much closer to the RX 7900 XT than it is the RX 7800 XT. Cyberpunk 2077\u00a0remains one of the most demanding games with ray tracing. In a less demanding title like\u00a0Returnal,\u00a0the RX 7900 GRE trades blows with the RTX 4070 Super, but it consistently outclasses the base RTX 4070. It\u2019s an impressive jump for AMD\u2019s ray tracing efforts, and a big reason why the RX 7900 GRE comes out on top on average. Ray tracing is still Nvidia\u2019s game, but the RX 7900 GRE has enough chops to keep up with Nvidia\u2019s offerings around this price. You\u2019re giving up some ray tracing performance, but you\u2019re gaining better performance in titles without ray tracing, which still represents a majority of games you\u2019ll likely play on the graphics card. Even with ray tracing catching up, Nvidia holds a lead in the feature department with its DLSS 3.5. AMD has FSR 3, which is available to the RX 7900 GRE and all other modern GPUs, but support still hasn\u2019t picked up. At the time of writing, FSR 3 is available in less than 15 games, a good chunk of which are legacy titles. Hopefully, support will pick up soon. AMD holds a slight edge over Nvidia with its Fluid Motion Frames feature. This is exclusive to AMD graphics cards, offering driver-based frame generation for thousands of DirectX games. It doesn\u2019t always work well, but it\u2019s still an option you get with the RX 7900 GRE that you won\u2019t find on the competition from Nvidia. The RX 7900 GRE could have been a disaster. Given what we saw last year with the GRE model in China and its initial pricing, it would have fallen short of expectations. A price adjustment has put it in a much better spot. On price, it\u2019s directly in competition with the RTX 4070 while providing vastly superior performance. It even manages to trade blows with the more expensive RTX 4070 Super, often coming out ahead. It\u2019s an aggressive GPU that\u2019s sure to turn some heads at Team Green. The main thing holding the RX 7900 GRE back from a resounding recommendation right now is FSR 3 support. The feature isn\u2019t in enough titles, and even with a performance loss, a GPU like the RTX 4070 Super still has a lot of value thanks to Nvidia\u2019s robust DLSS 3.5 support. Thankfully for AMD, that\u2019s a problem with an expiration date. FSR 3 support will improve over time, maybe reaching parity with DLSS. In the meantime, the RX 7900 GRE is an excellent GPU that plants a firm stake with its raw performance, even if it has to play a little catch-up on the feature front. Anti-aliasing is the hidden backbone behind making your games look great. It serves a simple purpose -- fixing the jagged edges that show up in games -- but the specifics are complicated. In this guide, we'll explain the anti-aliasing options you see in games so that you can achieve the image quality and performance your gaming PC needs.
