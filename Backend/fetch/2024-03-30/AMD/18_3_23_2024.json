Modern gaming PCs of late are more than just capable computers built around a powerful GPU, with other factors including the CPU, memory, and storage playing increasingly important roles in enabling gaming experiences for end users. The most overlooked part that allows all of these to work together in cohesion without causing issues or bottlenecks is perhaps the motherboard with system builders often compromising when it comes to this to get higher-end components. RELATED: The Best Motherboards For AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D CPUs Motherboards are an important thing to get right as newer technologies such as PCI-E 5.0, higher-clocked DDR5 memory, and better networking standards kick in. As more demanding CPUs require higher-end VRMs, as well as capable I/O to maximize their capabilities, motherboards have morphed over time from a simple PC component that connects internals, to one that handles quite a few key tasks while ensuring compatibility with the latest and greatest in terms of hardware. This is particularly true for AMD's motherboards, which are often required to be a bit more future-proof to ensure they can upgrade with ease. Intel's recent 12th and 13th-generation CPUs both work on the same socket and the newly released 14th-generation motherboards follow suit, ensuring gamers looking for Intel's LGA 1700 socket platform offerings have plenty of hardware choices available to them in 2024. Need more budget video gaming gear? Consider acquiring a great budget 4K monitor to enhance gameplay! Well-Rounded Current Gen Choice The Gigabyte B650 Aorus Elite AX is a high-end motherboard featuring the B650 chipset that allows it to command a much lower price point, closer to AMD's more budget-oriented motherboard lineups. It is a capable entry that also offers a PCI-E Gen 5 M2 slot that should allow access to faster PCI-E 5.0 storage down the line. The GIGABYTE B650 AORUS Elite AX offers the full ATX treatment to AMD's entry-level B650 chipset while throwing in plenty of storage options, a capable power delivery mechanism, and high memory overclocking potential in a neat package that can be had for just under $200. It also offers a complete networking stack out of the box with 2.5G Ethernet, Wi-Fi 6E, and Bluetooth 5.3 out of the box, a combination that is normally found on pricier, higher-end motherboards. It uses its limited PCI-E 5.0 lanes on offer to power a single M2 PCI-E 5.0 slot for next-generation storage needs. At the same time, it skips on a PCI-E 5.0 x16 slot, somewhat hurting its future-proofing prospects. While modern GPUs tend to be limited to PCI-E 4.0 speeds, it is expected that the coming generations will take advantage of the new PCI-E 5.0 spec and may require a motherboard upgrade to allow users to fully benefit from the added bandwidth. That being said, the GIGABYTE B650 AORUS Elite AX has a lot going for it as an entry-level motherboard. It has a solid set of VRMs, excellent connectivity and I/O, and plenty of flexibility in terms of memory overclock potential. All of these factors combine to make it one of the best motherboards in the business in 2024. This, coupled with better pricing makes it an excellent gaming motherboard to recommend on a budget if one is building a gaming PC in the near future. High-End Chipset Sans The Price Tag The ASRock Z790 Pro supports\u00a0Intel 12th-14th gen\u00a0Intel Core Processors and has plenty of room for storage expansion with 4x M.2 NVME connectors. There is a 2.5G Ethernet port to ensure fast connectivity. This motherboard supports up to 128 GB of RAM across its 4 DDR4 slots. This is a perfect entry-level Z790 motherboard to build a gaming PC on a budget. The ASRock Z790 Pro RS/D4 ATX LGA1700 Motherboard is an excellent ATX-based, gaming-centric motherboard that promises a value approach to the high-end Intel Z790 chipset while offering features that are normally found in more premium motherboards. With 2.5G Ethernet on offer in addition to 4 M2 slots for users looking to add storage or a Wi-Fi key as part of their upgrades. It happens to be one of the cheapest Z790-based motherboards currently available, supporting both Intel's 12th and 13th-generation CPUs alongside PCI-E 5.0 GPUs as a future-proof measure. It does, however, skip on PCI-E 5.0 storage support currently, and does not come with an add-in card to enable it. The choice of DDR4 memory makes it a relatively cheap upgrade compared to some DDR5 motherboards for gamers looking for an update that allows them to use their existing last-generation memory. At the same time, not all gamers will be enthusiastic about going with a 13th-generation Intel motherboard in a DDR4 configuration. Those looking to build a new PC from scratch would be better off buying the DDR5 version that clocks in at the same price tag. As DDR5 memory continues to tumble in pricing, the costs are more frequently closing in on DDR4 offerings. Note: With a BIOS update on offer that enables support for Intel's 14th generation CPU lineup available for download, users might want to reconsider if they are not upgrading from an older LGA 1700-based CPU given that Asrock has chosen to eliminate the BIOS flashback button and utility that allows users to update the BIOS on its Z790 motherboard options. This essentially means users looking to pair this with a 14th-generation CPU might need to find a compatible CPU (12th or 13th-generation) for older iterations of the same motherboard to avoid compatibility issues with detecting a newer processor than the BIOS version itself. Flagship Performance, Budget Price The ASUS ROG Strix Z690-E Gaming Wi-Fi offers premium performance at a surprisingly affordable price tag. While based on a last-gen chipset, it's fully compatible with the latest Intel CPUs via a BIOS update. With DDR5 and PCIe 5.0 support, capable power delivery, and excellent overclocking headroom, this motherboard creates a solid foundation for a powerful and future-proof gaming rig. Based on the previous generation Z690 chipset, the ASUS ROG Strix Z690-E Gaming Wi-Fi offers tremendous value for gamers looking to build a killer, no-compromise gaming PC without breaking the bank. It offers more or less the same features as the current Z790 motherboards but without the premium pricing. Unlike the budget-friendly B760 platform, this motherboard supports proper CPU overclocking, allowing gamers to maximize performance from the latest Intel chips. The ROG Strix Z690-E Gaming Wi-Fi is compatible with the latest 13th and 14th Gen CPUs via a BIOS update. It can handle flagship processors like the 14900K and 13900K thanks to its capable 18-phase, 90A V-core VRM and beefy heatsinks. It also comes fully loaded with DDR5 and PCIe 5.0 support, so gamers throw in the best gaming GPUs and fastest RAM kits to round out a truly high-end gaming machine. Design wise, ASUS retained the classic black-themed design with onboard RGB lighting and plenty of RGB headers for extra personalization. It ticks all the right boxes for connectivity, with 12 USB ports in the rear I/O, Wi-Fi 6E and 2.5G Ethernet, and five M.2 slots, including a future-proof PCIe 5.0-enabled slot. In addition, the user-friendly BIOS, 7-segment display, and BIOS FlashBack button make it easy to overclock and troubleshoot when things go wrong. For a little over $200, the ROG Strix Z690-E Gaming Wi-Fi is a perfect option for a budget-friendly but powerful gaming PC. A Well-Designed Alternative The\u00a0NZXT N7 B650E Gaming Wi-Fi 6 Motherboard is an excellent AMD socket AM5-based motherboard based on the 650E chipset with decent overclocking, excellent power delivery, and above-average expansion slots in tow. It comes in a white or all-black design that is enthusiast-friendly in terms of its design and feature set. The NZXT N7 B650E is one of the best-looking and feature-packed AM5-based motherboards a gamer can grab, even as it trades at a somewhat high price tag for a B650E-based motherboard. It comes with excellent power delivery allowing it to run AMD's highest-end 7950X/7950X3D CPUs with ease. It couples this with PCI-E 5.0 readiness for both the GPU slot and a single M2 socket while offering support for a total of 3 NVME drives. It delivers excellent networking, offering 2.5G Ethernet, Wi-Fi 6E, and Bluetooth 5.2 out of the box. While it does cost considerably more than most B650E motherboards, it offers tight integration with NZXT's CAM software, plenty of RGB, and fan headers. This allows it to be a very versatile offering that can handle pretty much any gaming PC's requirements with considerable future-proofing available under the hood. Its aesthetics do set it apart as a more premium, albeit budget-oriented option for an AMD gaming motherboard in 2023 with some of its (higher-end) competition edging past the $600 mark with ease. The NZXT N7 B650E continues to deliver the goods as one of the most popular gaming motherboards on offer while also offering slightly better value with a sub-10% price cut over its previous market price, making for an excellent value-added option for gamers looking for a more premium option currently. Powerful, Versatile Offering The\u00a0MSI MPG Z790 Edge Wi-Fi Gaming Motherboard is a capable entry from MSI that supports current-generation Intel Raptor Lake and previous-generation Alder Lake CPUs.It comes packed with a PCI-E 5.0 x16 slot, a very capable networking stack, and as many as 5 M2 NVME connectors making it a compelling choice for gamers, creators, and people looking for a feature-packed motherboard for work or entertainment. The MSI MPG Z790 Edge WiFi Gaming Motherboard is a premium, but somewhat mid-range Z790 motherboard on offer that throws in better overclocking support than its peers thanks to its 16-1-1 phase VRMs. It doubles down with aggressive cooling to keep temperatures down on the main board while offering a PCI-E Gen 5 x16 GPU slot and support for up to 7200MHz memory out of the box. It comes with a full networking stack on offer with 2.5G Ethernet, Wi-Fi 6E, and BT 5.3 out of the box and offers looks that match with more premium-tier gaming motherboards with ease. Much like other Z790-based motherboards, however, it does not offer PCI-E 5.0 NVME slots or an adapter that makes use of the Gen 5 x16 slot to leverage faster storage, instead opting for a more future-proofed GPU slot. For users intending to use Intel's 14th generation CPUs, an updated model of the same, the MSI MPG Z790 Edge TI MAX WiFi is also available, shipping with a Rocket Lake Refresh-ready BIOS, Wi-Fi 7 support, and better-overclocked memory support in tow. A No-Nonsense AM5 Motherboard While not the most flashy motherboard, the Prime B650-PLUS AM5 motherboard from Asus has an impressive feature set, making it a good home for budget-friendly and top-of-line components. This motherboard is ATX and has 4 DDR5 memory slots, 2 M.2 NVME connectors, and built-in 2.5 GB LAN. The Asus PRIME B650-PLUS ATX AM5 Motherboard is an entry-level AM5 motherboard that offers an acceptable, but utilitarian feature and upgrade set to gamers and end users looking to build a simple, gaming-centric PC without too many bells and whistles. It does offer 2.5G Ethernet and a PCI-E 5.0 NVME slot out of the box, as well as support for high-clocked DDR5 memory. However, it compromises on its feature set considerably. Thanks to the B650 chipset, a somewhat underwhelming VRM set with limited cooling on offer, this motherboard limits itself to PCI-E 4.0 speeds for the GPU and sacrifices Wi-Fi to cut in terms of pricing. This also means that some of its competition brings better features at a similar price point for users looking for a better package and not being particular about the ASUS brand name in the sub-$ $200 price range. For users who must have a budget AM5-based AMD motherboard with Wi-Fi, the ASUS TUF Gaming B650-Plus Wi-Fi is an excellent alternative that currently trades at a small discount bringing it to just $10 above the Prime B650-Plus motherboard. Value-Centric DDR4 Motherboard MSI's MAG B760 Tomahawk Wi-Fi DDR4 motherboard is a capable entry from the well-known Taiwan-based tech manufacturer that offers a slew of I/O and onboard slots in a bid to capture the mainstream Intel CPU-based audience with a blend of value, functionality, and reliability. The MSI MAG B760 Tomahawk WiFi DDR4 is an excellent motherboard that supports both Intel's 12th and 13th-generation CPUs as well as support for the newer 14th-generation Raptor Lake Refresh CPUs (with a BIOS upgrade). With high memory overclocking potential and great networking on offer (Wi-Fi 6E, BT 5.3, and 2.5G Ethernet), it offers exceptional value versus its competition. While it does offer PCI-E 5.0 at x16 to the GPU slot, making for an easier upgrade down the line, it does not extend the same when it comes to its M2 SSD slots, all 3 of which sport PCI-E 4.0 instead with users potentially finding issues with its DDR4 RAM limitations. The MAG B76t0 Tomahawk Wi-Fi assuages most of these concerns simply by the sheer amount of value it delivers under $200 while throwing in a significant amount of USB connectivity, making it a great upgrade-friendly motherboard for gamers despite its compromises in some areas. Note: Early iterations of this motherboard do NOT support Intel's 14th-generation CPUs out of the box and would require an older CPU equipped to update the BIOS before the motherboard detects the newer Intel processors which could become an issue for some DIY builders without access to an Intel 12th or 13th generation CPU. Alternatively, users planning to use Intel's higher-end Intel Core 14th-generation CPUs can also benefit from considering the ready-to-go MSI Z790 Tomahawk Max Wi-Fi instead which offers support for the newer CPUs, better power delivery, and Wi-Fi 7 support out of the box. Compact Powerhouse The ASUS ROG Strix B760-I Gaming WIFI may not have the bells and whistles of high-end boards, but it nails the fundamentals for a solid gaming rig without breaking the bank. It has two DDR5 RAM slots, a full-length PCIe Gen 5 x16 slot, decent VRMs, and even some tasteful RGB touches\u2014all packed in a small footprint. Paired with the right CPU and GPU, this motherboard is perfectly capable of running demanding games. For gamers looking to downsize their gaming rig or build a small form-factor PC on a budget, the ASUS ROG Strix B760-I Gaming WIFI is a standout option that packs a serious punch in a compact package. While not the cheapest mini-ITX motherboard, it provides a few key upgrades that make it worth the slight premium. In addition, the B760 chipset offers the sweet spot for mid-range Intel CPUs. The VRM design on the ROG Strix B760-I Gaming WIFI isn't overkill, but it's enough to handle most Intel CPUs comfortably, especially since CPU overclocking is out of the question. Elsewhere, ASUS did not skimp on features. The motherboard boasts solid support for DDR5 memory up to 7600MT/s, two M.2 Gen 4 storage slots for quick game launches, and a PCIe 5.0 expansion slot that can handle high-end GPUs like the RTX 4080. While the onboard heatsinks do a great job on their own, gamers still need to pair this motherboard with an excellent CPU cooler, preferably an AIO cooler or a custom liquid cooling loop, and an ITX case with good airflow to maintain respectable thermals. The only real downside is that the rear I/O panel isn't the most extensive, but gamers still have access to eight USB ports, including two USB-C ports, which are enough to plug most gaming accessories. Any gamers not shopping on a budget should also check out Game Rant's list of the best motherboards available now! RELATED: Best RAM to Pair with RTX 4060/4060 Ti Picking the right gaming motherboard on a budget is harder than simply rolling the dice with the cheapest option one can find online. This is because of how crucial a motherboard can be when it comes to the performance, stability, and longevity of any particular gaming PC. Some of the key things one should be looking out for are: While users on a current-generation AMD platform have only DDR5 support in play for socket AM5, Intel offers both DDR4 and DDR5 motherboards. While the latter is faster, it also tends to cost slightly more than its DDR4 alternatives and also results in slightly higher RAM costs even if they have shrunk greatly in the last few months. An informed user therefore tends to benefit from a higher-end motherboard that has better memory compatibility and benefits from higher clocked memory by allowing for a stable overclock in multiple configurations. Picking a motherboard with a budget chipset or a dated PCI-E slot can limit upgrade potential for some gamers down the line. Choosing a gaming motherboard that can essentially deliver the goods on both current performance and potential upgrades down the line is important for gamers that look to build and upgrade their gaming PC over time. An example would be how AMD's more budget A and B 300 series chipsets on AM4 were limited in terms of the total number of Ryzen-based processors they could support throughout the lifetime of the socket itself. Most budget motherboards tend to use older, more limited ethernet connectors and skip Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity options altogether, something that can be a rude awakening for gamers switching from a prebuilt gaming PC or a laptop where these are often taken for granted. Doing one's research allows gamers to pick an option that supports both the connectivity options needed and the bandwidth class required for certain connectivity options. Many gamers are also power users who require plenty of USB ports, dedicated audio ports, and more to truly unlock the potential of their gaming rigs. While higher-end motherboards generally have plenty of these, budget options tend to skimp or limit on USB ports, M2 slots, SATA ports and in some cases, even PCI-E slots which can be of an older specification irrespective of chipset and CPU-level support under the hood. It therefore pays off the investment of reading the fine print when picking a gaming-centric motherboard for your new PC. Intel's 14th-generation CPUs use the same LGA 1700 bracket that the 12th and 13th-generation CPUs employ. As a result, most Intel-based 6XX and 7XX series motherboards should be able to support the newer upcoming CPUs provided they get a BIOS update to detect the new processors While budget gaming motherboards historically tend to cut down on costs, most budget options on offer currently do have Wi-Fi built in. This is due to cheaper modules and consumer demand leading to it become a lower-end staple requirement, even as motherboards have significantly increased in price (and therefore the definition of budget simultaneously).
