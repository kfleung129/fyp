    "text": "Fixes some minor issues as well Bethesda has released the new Starfield 1.9.67 update that adds official support for AMD FSR 3.0 and Intel XeSS, as well as some stability improvements to the game. Bethesda has already added AMD FSR 3.0 support with its previous beta patch, but the latest one pulls the support from beta and also adds support for Intel XeSS. The new update is available on both Steam and the Microsoft Store. Bethesda's Starfield now supports all upscaling technologies, as the Nvidia DLSS support was added back in November last year. In addition to AMD FSR 3.0 and Intel XeSS support, the latest patch also fixes some minor graphics issues with clouds while using DLSS, and minor visual artifacts when aiming or task swapping. It also adds stability improvements, fixing various crashes in the game, and fixes an issue with the resolution scale when switching from fullscreen to windowed mode. You can check out the full release notes over at Bethesda's Starfield support page.   "
