    "text": "AMD released the Radeon RX 7800 XT and the RX 7700 XT on September 6, 2023, at MSRPs of $499 and 449 respectively. With only a $50 increase in price for a double-digit performance bump and 4 GB more VRAM, the RX 7800 XT\u00a0seems like a no-brainer when compared to the RX 7700 XT. Indeed, users prefer the RX 7800 XT over the RX 7700 XT based on the former\u2019s 7th position in Newegg\u2019s best sellers chart while the RX 7700 XT is not even in the top 20. In a move that should somewhat improve the RX 7700 XT\u2019s standing in the market, AMD has now officially reduced the price of the GPU by $30 and the card can now be had for only $419.99 (Buy it now on Amazon). The RX 7700 XT price cut comes alongside the introduction of the RX 7900 GRE in the US market. RX 7900 GRE has generally received a warm welcome from reviewers owing to its RTX 4070 Super-beating raster performance and price. Coupled with the price adjustment for the RX 7700 XT which gives the RTX 4060 Ti 16 GB an even tougher time than before, it could be argued that NVIDIA is actually losing the mid-range war to AMD. Hopefully, this price reduction by AMD compels NVIDIA to do the same for the RTX 4060 Ti 16 GB which not only performs worse in rasterization and but is also currently $430 or $10 more than the RX 7700 XT on Newegg at the cheapest.
