Samuel Willetts Published: Feb 20, 2024 It\u2019s often advisable to reuse your old hardware in a new system, be it your CPU or another piece of kit, but sometimes this simply isn\u2019t possible. Whether you\u2019ve broken a mounting pin or there\u2019s some other fault, some processors seem almost destined for the recycling bin. Not all chips need suffer this fate, however, as some might serve you well as a display piece instead. While performance and price are understandably the most important factors when it comes to discussions on the best gaming CPU, seldom a thought is given to their aesthetics \u2013 other than the beautiful shots you can get of the silicon dies themselves. While not consequential to a purchasing decision, it\u2019s hard to imagine any member of the Ryzen 7000 series\u00a0without its trademark jigsaw-like IHS, for istance. Enter these purpose-built display stands designed specifically to show off your spare CPUs, be they from AMD or Intel. They\u2019re made by Japanese manufacturer NBROS, and available from the Yodobashi webstore (thanks, Tom\u2019s Hardware), though clearly you could probably make your own or have something similar 3D printed too. If you\u2019re packing some of the best SSDs and aren\u2019t using them in your PC for some reason, NBROS have another set of stands for solid state drives too. These ones even feature screws for you to mount your storage to save it from any unfortunate knocks. While these stands are somewhat silly, I\u2019d be lying if I said I didn\u2019t want one. Just a few weeks ago, my Intel Core i7 4790K gave up the ghost after almost a decade of service and I would\u2019ve loved to have put it on display instead of throwing it into the electronics recycling bin. The only criticism I have of the whole setup is that I wish they came with a plastic housing to keep away the dust. However, given that Yodobashi is a Japanese retailer\u2026 I likely won\u2019t be ordering one anytime soon anyway.\u00a0Likely.
