    "text": "Published on By New details have appeared on the Internet about future AMD Radeon video cards, which may be released at the end of this year. According to the author of the Moore\u2019s Law Is Dead channel, AMD\u2019s top solution of the new generation will be the Navi 48 GPU. The name is not very clear, since according to current naming principles it should be something super-budget, but no, it will be a pre-top GPU, if you evaluate it by the standards of the new generation. \nThe graphics card based on it will probably be called Radeon RX 8800 XT, although this is not necessary. \nCurrently, the performance of this solution is expected to be somewhere between the RX 7900 XT and RX 7900 XTX.  We\u2019ve heard about this before with the addition that this card could cost around $600.  Of course, we don\u2019t yet know what Nvidia will offer in this segment, but in any case, such an offer looks very strong for the new generation, considering that the RX 7900 XT launched with a price of $900.  However, we should not forget that right now this card can be bought for $700-750, and against this background the new card may no longer look so impressive. \nIt is also reported that the GPU will be produced using the improved TSMC N4P technical process, and the area of \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bthe crystal, which will be monolithic, will be about 300-350 mm2.  For comparison, Navi 31 has an area of \u200b\u200b529 mm2. \nThe video card will also receive a 256-bit bus and, probably, GDDR6 memory with a frequency of 20 GHz.  Considering the width of the bus, we are likely to get 16 GB of memory.  \nSeparately, the author made a point regarding GDDR7 memory, which should appear this year.  For the top GPU Navi 41, which was cancelled, support for a new type of memory was planned, but there is no data yet that such memory would be used for lower-end adapters. \nAs for the card\u2019s release, it is now scheduled for the fourth quarter of this year, although there is a small chance of a release in the third quarter or the first quarter of 2025.\nThere is also information about the Navi 44 GPU, on which the junior video card of the new family will be based.  Perhaps it will be the RX 8600. Its performance will lie somewhere between the RX 7600 and RX 7800 XT, but this is a very wide range, so it does not give much insight.  However, since this is a new generation, it is logical to expect a significant increase relative to the RX 7600, although the RTX 4060 is an example of the opposite.  In any case, Navi 44 will receive a 128-bit bus, that is, the video card can have 8 or 16 GB of memory.  The crystal area will be only 210 mm2which is comparable to Navi 33.

Published on By AMD has solved the problem with overclocking the memory of the Radeon RX 7900 GRE video card, and recent tests have shown that the adapter now looks much more attractive.  Of course, for those who want to resort to overclocking.  The authors of Hardware Unboxed took the Sapphire adapter and overclocked it to 2.7 GHz for the core and 21.2 GHz for the memory.  As you can see, the performance increase turned out to be quite good.  At 1440p, the overclocked card became 12% faster relative to the reference one, and at 4K the increase was almost 17%, which is very good by modern standards. As a result, after overclocking, the RX 7900 GRE competes with the RTX 4070 Ti at 1440p, and reaches the RTX 4070 Ti Super at 4K.  At the same time, the RX 7900 GRE in Europe costs from 570 euros, the RTX 4070 Ti \u2013 from 700 euros, and the RTX 4070 Ti Super \u2013 from 840 euros.  Of course, Nvidia cards can also be overclocked, but the price difference will still remain. Published on By Not only new Intel video cards, but also a new processor appeared in the SiSoftware Sandra database today.  The Lunar Lake model included in the Samsung Galaxy Book5 Pro is registered in the software database, revealing some of its parameters.  The unnamed CPU contains only eight cores (four large and four small), but for Lunar Lake this is the maximum.  The presence of only eight threads confirms leaks that future Intel CPUs do not support Hyper-Threading. The processor operated at frequencies of 1.6-2.8 GHz.  These are clearly far from the final frequencies, but Lunar Lake is created with an eye to maximum energy efficiency, so perhaps they will not have very high frequencies.  The CPU also has 12 MB of L3 cache and a Xe2-LPG (Battlemage) generation GPU with 4 Xe cores and a frequency of 1.85 GHz. According to the latest roadmap, Lunar Lake is expected at the end of this year. Published on By Intel Meteor Lake processors only exist in mobile versions.  Or not?  The IBASE MI1002 industrial motherboard indicates that Intel is either planning or has already released Core Ultra as a desktop CPU.  The board with the LGA 1851 socket is designed for Meteor Lake-PS, which Intel has not officially presented.  There were rumors and leaks about such desktop CPUs, but then it became known that Intel abandoned the idea.  True, there was also evidence that such processors would still be released, but not in retail, but would be available to mini-PC manufacturers.  Whether such mini-PCs will appear in retail is still anyone\u2019s guess, but in the industrial sector, as we see, yes. As for the parameters of such CPUs, they are not yet available.  Most likely, these are just mobile models in a different socket \u2013 Intel has already done this.
