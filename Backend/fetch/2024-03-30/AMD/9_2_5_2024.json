The APUs in question are the AMD Ryzen 7 8700G, 5 8500G, and 3 8300G. According to Team Red, the CPUs will be so powerful that you will be able to play some games at 1080p at 60fps or more. These include major titles like Cyberpunk, GTA 5, and Assassins Creed: Valhalla without the need for a discrete GPU. But where will you be able to pick up these new APUs? Well, we have all the information in our useful guide \u2013 Where to buy the AMD Ryzen 8000G APUs. For additional info on the AMD Ryzen 8000G APUs, be sure to check out our specs, performance, and price breakdown of each APU here. First, let\u2019s tell you where to find them. If you\u2019re excited about the release of the AMD Ryzen 8000G APUs, you are probably wondering about the best place to pre-order the models. Luckily, we are here to help ease the stress of upcoming launch dates. Although demand may be high, the APU market is generally less popular than that of flagship GPUs. Just as well, as pre orders don\u2019t seem to be available. The same appears to be true for the newly launching AMD Ryzen 7 5700X3D as well. However, we do believe it is worth checking with your local retailer to see if reserving a model is an option. Plenty of buyers will likely be purchasing, and we would hate to see you get shortchanged by a stock shortage. Below you will find expected retailers for both the US, Canada, and the UK. For the US, the AMD Ryzen 8000G APUs will likely find a place at Amazon, Best Buy, and Newegg. As always, we\u2019ll be sure to keep this page updated with all the latest information. For Canada, the AMD Ryzen 8000G APUs will likely find a place at Amazon, Best Buy, and Newegg. For the UK, the AMD Ryzen 8000G APUs will likely find a place at Amazon, Scan, and Overclockers. For pricing, the cost differs from each AMD Ryzen 8000G APU. So let\u2019s go one by one. The flagship Ryzen 7 8700G has an MSRP of $329, which offers top-tier performance for users seeking the best in integrated processing and graphics. The mid-range Ryzen 5 8500G is set at $179, presenting a more budget-friendly option. The Ryzen 5 8600G, positioned between these two, is priced at $229, balancing cost and capability for fans. Finally, the Ryzen 3 8300G is available exclusively within pre-built systems, providing an accessible entry point into AMD\u2019s latest technology. The AMD Ryzen 8000G APUs will be officially released on January 31, 2024. This launch is a key event in AMD\u2019s calendar, showcasing its commitment to advancing AI computing and integrated graphics capabilities.  PCguide.com\u00a0is part of the BGFG family of websites.
