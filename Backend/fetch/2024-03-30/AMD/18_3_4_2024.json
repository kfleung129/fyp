    "text": "Nvidia RTX 4090 is the fastest GPU on the market. Here are the best PC builds to maximize its potential for gamers and power users alike. Nvidia's RTX 4090 is a behemoth of a GPU that can do much more than just max out modern games. It has uses that can vary across the board, which makes it a challenging addition to most PCs. After all, the RTX 4090 requires a beefy PSU, plenty of ventilation, and a capable CPU to eke out its potential performance at full throttle. The requirements for gamers, enthusiasts, and professionals can vary based on their needs. Gamers would ideally want to pair it with the highest-end gaming-centric CPU money can buy. At the same time, productivity-based users might take a more nuanced, multi-threading performance-centric approach. On the other hand, enthusiasts might want the fastest all-round PC that offers plenty of expansion, upgradability, and overclocking potential out of the box. This means that RTX 4090-based PCs can not be a one-size-fits-all solution that performs best for gamers, creators, and professionals alike (but some builds come very close). Therefore, the team at Game Rant has handpicked three different gaming PC builds that feature an RTX 4090 to eke out the highest possible performance from Nvidia's flagship GPU in 2024. The AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D is AMD's latest and greatest CPU when it comes to gaming. With an excellent and highly efficient gaming performance that tops the charts currently, the Ryzen 7 7800X3D is here to stay and has a crown to claim thanks to its 3D V-Cache-enabled prowess when it comes to gaming on a PC.The octa-core CPU currently happens to be the fastest in the business for gaming even as it leads efficiency charts at the top, making it a very sought-after gaming upgrade. Corsair iCUE H170i Elite CAPELLIX XT provides a big surface area for heat dissipation and performs very well with flagship Intel and AMD CPUs. The cooler uses a 420mm radiator that constantly dissipates heat with the help of high airflow fans and has distinguished RGB lighting. The fan curve can be customized with respect to the coolant temperature which is an excellent way of improving its performance The G. Skill Trident Z5 NEO sticks are a pair of 32GB RAM sticks that conform to AMD's more stringent EXPO memory requirements for overclocking. With tight timings and a CAS latency of just\u00a030-40-40-96.With a subtle RGB effect and a premium feel, the Trident Z Neo is one of the best premium RGB RAM sticks money can buy that is designed for AMD-based systems. The\u00a0ASRock X670E Taichi Carrara is one of the best-looking motherboards for AMD's latest Ryzen 7000 series CPUs. It also comes packed with features including excellent networking, storage options, and dual PCI-E 5.0 x16 slots in tow.With excellent\u00a024+2+1 power phases, high memory overclocking support, and RGB lighting on the motherboard itself, it should please gamers, enthusiasts, and power users looking beyond simply the excellent aesthetic it has on offer. The ASUS ROG Strix GeForce RTX 4090 OC Edition may be one of its largest GPUs ever, but the patented design supports the most potent overclocking potential out of its peers.With a vapor chamber in tow, the ROG Strix comes in both black and white and does not disappoint in either looks or power. It is easily the most powerful 4090 out there, clocking at a stable 3120 MHz in Game Rant's in-house testing. The Teamgroup T-Force\u00a0Cardea Z540 SSD offers some of the fastest PCI-E Gen 5 SSD speeds money can buy in 2024 while throwing in a thin, patented graphene-based heatsink to keep things low-profile by design.It offers a whopping\u00a011,700 MB/s sequential read and\u00a09,500 MB/s sequential write speeds with decent random read/write speeds in tow,With a 3,000,000-hour MBTF and 700 TBW rating along with a comprehensive 5-year warranty in tow, the Teamgroup T-Force\u00a0Cardea Z540 SSD delivers on its promise as a premium PCI-E 5.0 SSD in 2024. The\u00a0MSI MPG A1000G PCIE5 PSU is built from the ground up to support the ATX 3.0 spec while also being PCI-E 5.0 compatible in a fully modular design without costing an arm and a leg unlike some of its nearest competitors, making it a viable contender for a gaming PC. The CORSAIR Obsidian Series 1000D is the ultimate super-tower PC case able to house the most incredible PCs within its iconic tempered glass design. Hinged tempered glass and aluminum doors make accessing the system a breeze, while a dual-system layout lets builders install two full PCs into a single case. Plus, with up to 18 fan mounts and room for a 480mm radiator, this case makes it easy to keep even the most powerful components cool. For gamers looking to max out the performance of Nvidia's RTX 4090 for gaming, one can't go wrong with AMD's Ryzen 7 7800X3D. The octa-core CPU offers significant performance gains versus both its AMD and Intel counterparts, retaining its performance crown well into 2024. With 64GB of handpicked low latency (CL30) G.Skill memory on offer that can leverage the sweet spot for AMD's Ryzen 7000 series CPUs at 6000 MHz, even as the X3D units are less dependent on faster memory than their predecessors, the PC comes with enough memory to keep most games ticking without any major bottlenecks in the near future. The ASRock Taichi Carrara X670E is the centerpiece of the build, as it pushes an all-white look backed by its marble-themed design and even offers excellent VRMs. It also features M2 slots with extensive PCI-E 5.0 support that extends to both the GPU and the storage options, even as it leverages the large Corsair Obsidian 1000D case to fit it all and future add-ons with ease. Do note that while this case can essentially handle two builds simultaneously, it does not come with the requisite fans. To fix this, users can leverage the Carrara's bundled limited-edition 120mm fan and take inspiration from some of the best cooling fan kits available. With a high-end 1000W from MSI and the relatively reduced peak power draw from the 7800X3D (compared to other high-end gaming CPU options), the PC can more than handle the top-tier ASUS RTX 4090 Strix OC at peak power consumption without breaking a sweat. In addition, it can support multiple hardware add-ons, depending on a user's needs. The build leverages a very fast PCI-E 5.0 SSD from Teamgroup (Z540) that ships without a large heatsink (the Carrara has dedicated heat spreaders on all slots that could potentially be used instead). The high-end 420MM Corsair iCUE H170i Elite CAPELLIX XT tri-fan AIO can more than handle the 7800X3D's modest thermal needs. All in all, the ultimate RTX 4090 gaming PC is built around maximizing performance while looking at both balance and relative value for money, without compromising meaningfully when it comes to performance for enthusiasts looking for something that can hold its own in 2024.
