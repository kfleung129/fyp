    "text": "After extensive testing and comparison of over 100 CPU coolers, we have selected the best coolers for the AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D, based on a variety of factors, including performance, noise, and price. The AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D CPU shines bright as one of the top gaming CPUs on the market with its impressive 96MB L3 cache and magnificent boost clocks of 4.5GHz. However, with a 105W TDP, you must also provide the processor with adequate cooling. Therefore, after lots of testing, here\u2019s our list of the top CPU coolers for the AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D processor. Here is a comparison table for our picks: More from the Ryzen 7 5800X3D: Here are our Best CPU Cooler picks for the AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D CPU: Best Low Profile CPU Cooler For Ryzen 7 5800X3D Specifications: Type:\u00a0Low Profile Air Cooler\u00a0|\u00a0RGB:\u00a0No |\u00a0Dimensions:\u00a0114 x 92 x 37mm |\u00a0Fan:\u00a01x Noctua NF-A9x14 PWM 92mm |\u00a0Fan Speed:\u00a0600 \u2014 2,500RPM |\u00a0Noise:\u00a023.6dB(A) |\u00a0Socket Support:\u00a0AMD:\u00a0AM4 Cooling Performance:\u00a0The Noctua NH-L9a-AM4 CPU cooler uses a single 92mm fan running at 2,500RPM speeds, offering slight cooling capabilities. While the cooler is only enough to keep the Ryzen 7 5800X3D CPU from thermal throttling, we noticed in our dedicated benchmarks that the cooler didn\u2019t bottleneck the CPU. Sajjad Hussain, one of our hardware reviewers, challenges the cooler\u2019s low-profile height and its performance, stating: \u201cDon\u2019t even think for a second that cooler of this much small footprint would not be adequate for the cooling requirements as this cooler has performed well from noise-to-performance ratio.\u201d Build Quality:\u00a0Although it\u2019s a budget CPU cooler, we loved its sturdy build quality. To explain, the heatsink consists of 55 aluminum cooling fins that are thick and robust. Moreover, it has two copper heat pipes with a 6mm diameter. The heat pipes are also directly soldered to the baseplate, which helps heat dissipation. Aesthetics:\u00a0There isn\u2019t much to look at with the low-profile design of the CPU cooler. You can choose between two colors: brown and black. However, neither of these variants offers any RGB and looks extremely plain. The design is slick but simple. The aesthetics are suited for gamers who are building darker PCs. We took a few images during our review: \u2705 You don\u2019t want your CPU to thermal throttle in an ITX build:\u00a0If you\u2019re building your PC around the Ryzen 7 5800X3D in an ITX chassis and don\u2019t want it to thermal throttle, we recommend purchasing the Noctua NH-L9a-AM4 CPU cooler because of its performance and clearance. \u274c You don\u2019t want to upgrade your cooler again:\u00a0If you don\u2019t want to upgrade your cooler again with your next CPU purchase, we don\u2019t recommend buying this CPU cooler because of its low socket support. The Noctua NH-L9a-AM4 provides immense value at a reasonable price, suitable for consumers with a tight budget. This excellent cooler can fit anything. Thus, this compact cooler easily secures the spot as the best low-profile CPU cooler for the AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D CPU Best White CPU Cooler For Ryzen 7 5800X3D Specifications: Type:\u00a0Single Tower Air Cooler |\u00a0RGB: Yes |\u00a0Dimensions:\u00a0142 x 98 x 164mm |\u00a0Fan:\u00a02x TF 140s |\u00a0Fan Speed: 500 \u2014 1,200RPM |\u00a0Noise:\u00a031.5dB(A) | Socket Support: Intel:\u00a0LGA1700, 1200, 2066, 2011, 2011-3, 115X\u00a0AMD:\u00a0AM4, AM5 Cooling Performance:\u00a0The DeepCool AS500 Plus White CPU cooler utilizes 2x 120mm fans running at 1,200RPM speeds for most of its cooling.

We have gathered a few points to help you better decide on the best CPU cooler for the AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D. These factors are also helpful for any CPU cooler purchase. No. The Ryzen 7 5800X3D does not have a stock cooler; therefore, purchasing an aftermarket CPU Cooler is necessary. Going for an AIO liquid cooler is recommended since it provides optimal performance and offers enough TDP for overclocking without worrying about the temperature. However, it is completely based on preference. Since the Ryzen 7 5800X3D has a TDP of 105W, it is bound to reach high temperatures. However, pairing it with a decent CPU cooler, preferably an AIO liquid cooler, won\u2019t be an issue. No, AMD\u2019s Ryzen 7 5800X3D doesn\u2019t support overclocking or PBO, and that\u2019s the downside to adding this 100MB cache (4MB L2, 96MB L3). Recent Updates Looking for more options?
