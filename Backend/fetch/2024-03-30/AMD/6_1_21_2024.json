    "text": "Minisforum has launched two new mini PCs onto the market: Both the UM580D and the UM590D are currently only available in China, but it is also likely that these models will also come onto the global market if past experience is anything to go by. The two new PC systems are compact, but nevertheless promise strong computing power. The\u00a0AMD Ryzen 7 5800H and AMD Ryzen 9 5900HX each use powerful processors, namely APUs, meaning that the mini PCs should not only be able to handle office tasks well, but also video gaming and photo/video editing. The cooling system consists of two heat pipes, but there is also a fan with 120 fins for heat dissipation. The differences between the UM580D and UM590D are not just limited to the computing chip: The UM590D also comes with a HDMI 2.1 port. But regardless of the model variant, HDMI is always on board, as well as several USB ports and an Ethernet port, of which the latter is said to offer high data transfer rates of 2.5 GBit/s. In China, the UM580D is on offer at a price of $230 while the UM590D is priced at the equivalent of around $250. It should be possible to set up the mini PC with the appropriate stand, but the systems can also be mounted on the back of a monitor via VESA. Minixpc "
