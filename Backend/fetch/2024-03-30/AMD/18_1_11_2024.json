    "text": "AMD\u2019s newest addition to their lineup of Ryzen processors is a pretty significant one. Firstly, the new Ryzen 5000 series from AMD is touted as having the best single-threaded CPU performance in the industry right now \u2013 which of course means an uplift in the overall performance in-game, causing some drastic ramifications when it comes to the whole AMD versus Intel debate. Secondly, every single iteration of the new 5000 series chips is going to offer enhanced performance over its previous counterpart regardless of the price point attached to the CPU itself. The range includes the Ryzen 9 5950X, the Ryzen 9 5900X, the Ryzen 7 5800X, and the Ryzen 5 5600X, with each of these chips benefitting from a 7nm processing node and AMD\u2019s latest Zen 3 architecture, as well as an uplift in power efficiency and leading gameplay performance. Which of course, is all very good. But, the real question that should be asked is how this chip is going to run, and will it be affected by the parts and components surrounding it? Well, that\u2019s a good question, and we are going to apply it to RAM right here.  For background (in case you didn\u2019t know) RAM is a pretty vital component when it comes to CPU loads and processing speeds. You can sum it up pretty simply: The faster your RAM, the faster your processing speed. Why? Well, RAM allows memory to be shared from one component of a computer to another. If you want a simple explanation, RAM is the conduit that your PC parts use to talk to each other. This means the faster your RAM kit is, the faster your processor is going to be able to communicate with different parts of your PC, which translates to (you guessed it) a faster processing power. So, now all that is out of the way, you might see why you could be interested in upgrading your RAM if you want to get yourself a Ryzen 5000 CPU. In order to get the most out of your processor, you need to make sure that you are running the best and most compatible parts! So, without any more preamble, here are the best RAM for Ryzen 5000 options, all picked for their ability to bring out the best in the new CPU line.   The G.Skill brand isn\u2019t a new one. In fact, if you have any history in the world of computers or PC building, then you are going to be fairly familiar with G.Skill\u2019s work, as they are one of the biggest names in the memory game, and their RAM kits are a staunch favorite amongst those with a gaming PC (and general PC users) worldwide. So, it\u2019s no surprise then that their Trident Royal Z RAM has made it to the top of our list of the best RAM for Ryzen 5000, and that\u2019s for a few reasons. The first being that this Trident Royal Z RAM is clocked at 4000MHz. This is important because even AMD themselves have come out and said that the Ryzen 5000 series has been optimized and designed for use with 4000MHz RAM kits. This is basically due to the reasons I outlined before about how RAM allows the CPU to communicate faster with the other components in the PC \u2013 4000MHz RAM is the fastest way to allow that. So, a little bit more about what makes the G.Skill Trident Z Royal RAM ideal for Ryzen 5000 then. First off is the latency \u2013 you are going to find that this kit offers an amazingly low latency coupled with a fast memory allocation speed, which paired together means you are going to experience some pretty quick computational speeds from your CPU. If you have yourself a high-end gaming PC, this is all going to come together to bring you high framerates, faster load times, and generally better in-game performance. That\u2019s if you\u2019re a gamer. If you work in any other field such as media, like music production for example, you are going to find that this RAM allows your processor to work much faster within editing software, helping shift the load speed and tasks from the CPU around your PC much quicker, making the editing bay a much less stressful environment. And, if you are wondering to yourself why we are touting a 4000MHz kit (outside of the fact that it\u2019s what the manufacturer recommends), it\u2019s because this RAM for Ryzen 5000 can actually be overclocked \u2013 as long as you have the capable motherboard. Now, in the past, AMD branded CPUs have had an issue with faster RAM kits, but with the 5000 series accepting 4000MHz memory as standard, it could be interesting to see what kind of performance you can get from your CPU by unlocking its performance \u2013 and this RAM kit can perform far better than the specifications on the box. If you are looking for negatives to this particular best RAM for Ryzen 5000 kit, then you could argue that it runs a little pricey and that its power consumption is a little high \u2013 but realistically, for the performance you are getting and the output the promised life span of the G.Skill Trident Z Royal, you really are getting what you pay for. Plus it has RGB that looks like diamonds. That has no bearing at all on performance \u2013 but the Lighting Control Software that G.Skill developed to control the RGB on their RAM is easy to use, and pretty handy if you like your RAM to shine like a diamond mine. Or not, as admittedly, the RGB can be a little overwhelming at its factory settings. Shine or no shine, this RAM will work brilliantly with the AMD Ryzen 5000 series.   Ok, so I spent some time talking about how the 4000MHz frequency was the one touted by AMD, and therefore should be stuck to by all strictest definition when it comes to choosing the best RAM for Ryzen 5000 CPUs. However. Thermaltake makes some seriously impressive products. It\u2019s what they do, and they do it well \u2013 and their TOUGHRAM series is no exception at all. And that\u2019s the first reason they make such a great RAM kit for the new Ryzen 5000 CPU, because the TOUGHRAM itself acts exactly as you want it to as a kit of RAM. First off, the heatsink present in the kit is top-notch, and really does geat when it comes to temperature management. That quality is present throughout the kit as well, with the TOUGHRAM sticks being made with high-quality parts that suggest ToughRam is a long-term investment. The RGB on the sticks is high-quality as well. Easily controlled with the free TOUGHRAM software, you can easily customize your RGB patterns to have them the exact way you like \u2013 bright, dark, integrated with your PC or Amazon Alexa for an all-encompassing RGB glow \u2013 or, you can actually set it to use. The TOUGHRAM software lets you take a peek inside the RAM itself, giving you a look into the temperature, load size, temperature, and frequency of your RAM kit, so you\u2019re never caught out when it comes to internal performance. And, if that wasn\u2019t enough you can actually tune your RGB lighting to give you an alert if your CPU, RAM, or memory is in danger, so alight of your choice blinks on to give you a handy real-world alert. And then there is the performance itself. This RAM gives out the DDR4 4000MHz performance you might expect, although whether or not the Ryzen 5000 series will be able to handle that speed competently is anyone\u2019s guess at this stage, especially when you take overclocking into account (which again, with the right motherboard is totally possible in this RAM). However, the 4000MHz on the box is just the manufactures ceiling. If anything, it\u2019s giving you some wiggle room when it comes to increasing your speed as the capabilities of both the motherboard and CPU are developed and uncovered during their life cycle. Then you have the price of the TOUGHRAM itself \u2013 and it\u2019s great. Around $100, give or take twenty here and there, but for that price, you can overlook certain factors like how certain timings with the RAM itself could be tightened up a little \u2013 but to be honest, the overall latency and speed of this RAM kit is hard to beat at the price, and some personalized tinkering with the settings might net you a better result. In summary, if you are looking for attractive, cost-effective, reliable, and fast RAM for Ryzen 5000, then ThermalTake\u2019s TOUGHRAM is the one for you.   If you are concerned with the amount of money you might have to put down in order to get quality RAM into your PC, then you had better make sure that every penny is going into a product that will give you every penny\u2019s worth \u2013 and that\u2019s where the Corsair Vengeance RGB Pro comes in. If you aren\u2019t familiar with Corsair, they are a PC building and gaming brand that fast rose to the forefront of the component and computer market thanks to the overall quality of their products. Prebuilt PCs, Mice, RAM \u2013 Corsair pretty much do it all, and they have a lot of experience doing it. So when it comes to squeezing out every single penny\u2019s worth of performance, you can invest happily in the Corsair Vengeance RGB Pro. Now, right off the bat, you are going to notice that the Corsair Vengeance RGB Pro DDR4 3200 RAM, you guessed it, only comes with a factory clock of 3200MHz. Don\u2019t get put off by that number though. The Corsair RAM kits come factory-made with components that AMD loves to work with, and their CPU chips have traditionally run brilliantly alongside. Those Samsung B0DIE chips that are commonly used in RAM kits? Corsair is using them here in the Corsair Vengeance RGB Pro, and historically that\u2019s great news for AMD users as it usually means maximized performance. Then you have the latency. At its factory setting, it works great and gives you fast (don\u2019t forget this is DDR4) performance with a latency you can\u2019t be disappointed in. But, if you did want to overclock your RAM here then we expect it would be perfectly possible to achieve maybe a 300-600MHz boost, making it at least a DDR4 3600 kit instead of DDR4 3200 depending on your other components and how the RAM plays with them. Then of course you have the RGB, which performs as you would expect, and Corsairs RGB controllers allow you to sync up your lighting with other RGB products from their lines \u2013 but all of that is suited to taste, and if I\u2019m being completely honest in the world of RGB, these RAM sticks are very run of the mill. That\u2019s not a bad thing though \u2013 this Corsair Vengeance RGB Pro kit is $85, and for that price reliable, boilerplate RGB is pretty good. If you do want a little more for your money though, you could put down another $50 and get yourself the 32GB of this RAM kit. Remember, the DDR4 4000 RAM kits previously listed here are all 16GB, so you are effectively doubling your load capacity here, and not losing any latency for it. So, saving money, reliable speed, and latency with a decent-looking exterior all for under $100. All of this makes the Corsair Vengeance RGB Pro RAM kit a brilliant start point for those money-conscious PC builders with a new Ryzen 5000 CPU in their PC!   Why isn\u2019t the best performing RAM the same as the best overall RAM for Ryzen 5000? Well, let\u2019s put it like this. If you asked me what the best car for racing was, I\u2019m not going to point to an affordable sedan that most people are going to be able to afford, own, and operate. The same rules apply here, and the Corsair Vengeance 64GB DDR4 4000 MHz is not going to be geared towards the everyday PC user. Instead, you are going to have to be either incredibly dedicated to your hobbies, or need a lot of computing power to warrant this kind of RAM size. To keep things short and simple, everything I previously said about Corsair applies here. This is still a quality piece of kit, and the DDR4 4000 advertisement does exactly what it says. Paired with the 64GB total space contained on these two RAM sticks, however, and you are going to find that you have a lot of room in your pc to run a lot of applications, at pretty high speeds. Now, if you are seriously considering buying RAM of this caliber, I will say this \u2013 it would pair best with the Ryzen 9 5950X chip, plainly because you are going to want to make the most out of any possible CPU / RAM pairing. This matchup is probably going to be able to handle anything you throw at it as well, so don\u2019t fret if you often work on software heavy programs, in UHD files, or other processor-heavy applications, as this RAM is going to be able to handle it with ease \u2013 and with the same low latency, quick memory times you might find in smaller Corsair RAM kits. Now. It doesn\u2019t have RGB. But does that really matter? We are talking the best RAM for performance here, and RGB is the equivalent of a go-faster stripe, so trust me, it has no bearing. Realistically, if you want unmatched processor speed and application load capabilities within your PC, then this is the RAM to go for \u2013 it just doesn\u2019t come cheap.   When choosing the best RAM sticks for Ryzen 5000 CPUs you should consider the following: When it comes to memory kits, you don\u2019t have a lot to think about in terms of performance or compatibility in most cases, and here we are outlining for a specific CPU range \u2013 the Ryzen 5000 series, so your list of checkboxes to tick before hitting the buy button is reasonably small. Just remember to think about what you are going to be using your PC for, and decide whether your needs warrant the purchase of memory kits with larger memory sizes, as if you don\u2019t need huge memory banks (and that applies to a lot of gaming PCs and home media professionals), you can focus on the speed of the RAM itself. Check your budget too. DDR4 RAM is great, and 4000MHz does pair best with the Ryzen 5000 series, but if you do need to watch the pennies after you buy a new AMD CPU, then you can always make do with the budget entry on our list here. Essentially, all of these different best RAM for Ryzen kits are going to work brilliantly with the Ryzen 5000 series \u2013 it\u2019s up to you to make sure your motherboard is compatible and that you can spare the cash to optimize your PC!  3200MHz RAM speeds are advertised as the maximum the 5600X can handle at stock but usually, with some tweaks, you can slot in RAM that has higher speeds and get the CPU to take advantage of them. However, if you don\u2019t want to tinker with anything, 3200MHz is perfect for the 5600X and should probably be your go-to. The short answer is yes, 4000MHz RAM is almost perfect for the Ryzen 5000 series CPUs. This is because AMD has optimized these new processors to work extremely well with RAM kits of these speeds making it a \u2018sweet spot\u2019. However, the 5600X is advertised to only be compatible with 3200MHz (but can be overclocked) so it\u2019s up to you whether you need RAM of this caliber for this more budget CPU. With the ever-increasing memory requirements of today\u2019s applications and programs, it\u2019s always wise to have a lot of RAM capacity just in case. With 32GB RAM, it provides you with that wiggle room while also being somewhat future-proof. Moreover, if you\u2019re a creative user working with video editing, having RAM of this ilk in your PC could be vital. On the flip side, some do think that 32GB RAM is a little overkill and to a point, we agree but only in terms of the casual user. The casual user doesn\u2019t use those intensive programs that need the extra memory and therefore, 16GB would be just fine.  If you are looking for the best RAM for Ryzen 5000, then we recommend you go with the G.Skill Trident Z \u2013 or failing that you select the ThermalTake TOUGHRAM, as both offer performance that is well balanced, and suited to their price point. If you are on a budget, then lower frequency RAM kits like the Corsair Vengeance RGB Pro kit will still perform nicely, with solid overclock options available to you even though you are putting less money down. And, if performance is key, and you can\u2019t do without the best, it\u2019s Corsair again with their 64GB Vengeance RAM kit. Whatever RAM you pick though, we are sure you are going to see an uplift in your new Ryzen 5000 series CPU productivity and speed. If you\u2019ve got an older AMD chip, we also have a guide for the best RAM for Ryzen which considers all the top RAM selections for different chip iterations over the years.
