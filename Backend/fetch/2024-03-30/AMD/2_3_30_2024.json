The Intel\u00a0Pentium Gold 4425Y\u00a0is a low power entry level processor for small laptops or tablets and based on the Kaby Lake architecture. It was announced in Q1 2019 and offers two processor cores clocked at 1.7 GHz (no Turbo Boost). Thanks to Hyper Threading, the processor can execute up to four threads simultaneously. The chips also includes the Intel HD Graphics 615 GPU, a dual-channel memory controller (DDR3L/LPDDR3) as well as VP9 and H.265 video de- and encoder. It is still produced in a 14 nm process with FinFET transistors. Compared to the much faster Core m3-7Y30, the Pentium 4425 offers no Turbo Boost, different CPU and GPU clock speeds, a smaller L3 cache and a higher TDP of 6 Watt. Compared to the predecessor Pentium Gold 4415Y from 2017, the Pentium Gold 4425Y is clocked 100 MHz higher (the CPU cores). \nArchitecture \nIntel basically used the familiar micro architecture from the Skylake generation, so the per-MHz performance is identical. Only the Speed-Shift technology for faster dynamic adjustments of the voltages and clocks was improved, and the matured 14 nm process now also enables much higher frequencies and better efficiency than before.\u00a0 \nPerformance \nDue to the missing Turbo Boost, the Pentium 4425Y offers a significantly worse single thread performance than the more expensive Core m3-7Y30. This should be noticeable in daily tasks. Compared to older CPUs, the Pentium Gold should match a Core i3-4100U (100 MHz higher clock speed but older architecture). \nGraphics \nThe integrated Intel HD Graphics 615 GPU has 24 Execution Units (EUs) like the old\u00a0HD Graphics 515\u00a0and runs with clocks between 300 and 850 MHz in combination with this processor. The performance heavily depends on the TDP limit as well as the memory configuration; with fast LPDDR3-1866 RAM in dual-channel mode, the GPU should sometimes be able to compete with the\u00a0HD Graphics 520, but can also be much slower in other scenarios. Modern games from 2016 will, if at all, only run smoothly in the lowest settings. \nContrary to Skylake, Kaby Lake now also supports hardware decoding for H.265/HEVC Main10 with a 10-bit color depth as well as Google's VP9 codec. \nPower Consumption \nThe chip is manufactured in an improved 14 nm process with FinFET transistors, so the power efficiency was once again improved significantly.
