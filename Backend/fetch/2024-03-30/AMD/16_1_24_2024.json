Advanced Micro Devices Inc. shares \n        AMD,\n        +0.50%\n       have shot up 140% over the past year, but an analyst at New Street Research says there\u2019s still time to jump on the bull train. New Street\u2019s Pierre Ferragu upgraded AMD\u2019s stock to buy late Tuesday, while setting a $215 target price for late 2024. That implied more than 25% upside from Tuesday\u2019s close, though the shares were roaring more than 5% higher late in Wednesday\u2019s session. Don\u2019t miss: Why Marvell just dethroned Nvidia as Citi\u2019s top chip-stock pick \u201c[O]ur work on AI architectures & ecosystems suggests [graphics processing units] will remain dominant,\u201d Ferragu wrote. \u201cSecond, structural scarcity is likely to last for several years, making it easy for\u00a0AMD\u00a0to carve out a defensible challenger position.\u201d His upgrade comes amid an analysis of what the chip sector would look like if the overall data-center chip market attracted $400 billion in annual spending come 2027. \u201cAMD\u00a0not only comes out of this analytical work as the most attractively valued,\u201d Ferragu wrote, but also it looks poised to show \u201csome upside with a minimal share gains & slow adoption.\u201d In other words, \u201ceven if market shares against Intel slow or stabilize in [central processing units] \u2026and Gaming and Embedded growth remain slow on the back of the current correction,\u00a0AMD\u00a0could still grow revenues by more than 20%\u201d per year over the next four years, he added. Opinion:\u00a0How Nvidia and AI changed the landscape of the chip industry, as rivals must now play catch-up The stock represents his preferred way to play a situation where data-center AI chips get adopted very quickly. Meanwhile, Ferragu said that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. shares \n        TSM,\n        -0.47%\n       look like the \u201cmost de-risked\u201d option, holding \u201climited market-share uncertainty, upside to expectations, and attractive valuation in both a fast and a slow adoption scenario.\u201d Trading in General Electric\u2019s power-generation spinoff began this week.
