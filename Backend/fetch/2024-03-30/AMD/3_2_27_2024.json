    "text": "Part of the Dual OC and TUF Gaming lineup Asus has introduced its own custom versions of the Radeon RX 7900 GRE graphics card. The Radeon RX 7900 GRE was limited to China, but AMD has officially announced it for a global release in order to counter Nvidia's $550 RTX 4070 non-Super graphics card. Asus custom RX 7900 GRE graphics cards will come as a part of the Dual OC and TUF Gaming lineups. Asus is cleverly using the Radeon RX 7800 XT custom design boards, considering that the RX 7900 GRE shares a lot of similarities, so the Asus RX 7900 GRE DUAL OC is a triple-slot, dual-fan version with 100mm Axial Tech. It lacks RGB lighting and works at 1927MHz Game clock, which is a decent factory-overclock from the reference 1880MHz. It also gets a Dual BIOS feature.  The Asus TUF Gaming RX 7900 GRE is a whole different beast as this one gets a triple-slot, triple-fan cooler with DirectCU III TUF Gaming cooling solution. It also gets a Dual BIOS feature, and slightly higher factory overclock of 1972MHz.  Both should be coming to the market soon but due to custom design, we expect them to launch closer to $600, rather than $550. Nevertheless, factory-overclocked Radeon RX 7900 GRE holds its ground even against the RTX 4070 Ti Super.   "
