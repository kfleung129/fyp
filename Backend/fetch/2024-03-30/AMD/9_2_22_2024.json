    "text": "Feb. 22: Researchers at Telos Foundation, supporting the Telos blockchain, and Input Output Global, known for its work on the Cardano blockchain, have teamed up to publish a white paper revealing a new protocol, \"Snarktor,\" that developers can leverage to scale blockchains more efficiently and securely across millions of use cases via the integration of zk-SNARK technology. According to the abstract for the paper, published in Cryptology ePrint Archive: \"We present a new protocol for decentralized recursive proof aggregation allowing one unique proof to aggregate many input proofs to be efficiently verified on-chain, increasing the throughput and cost efficiency of SNARK-based blockchains. The protocol is designed for decentralized environments where independent actors (provers) can join and contribute to the proof generation process.\" Feb. 22: Vault, an assisted self-custody wallet by the global Web3 financial platform Uphold, is exiting the two-month beta phase on Thursday. According to the team: \"The previous beta phase has seen a significant volume of $33M in assets traded amongst the select group of beta users.

According to the team: \"The dWallet Network introduces a new primitive for multi-chain collaboration in Web3 \u2013 dWallets \u2013 a noncollusive and massively decentralized signing mechanism that can be used as a building block on L1s and L2s to sign native transactions to all chains. With assets always staying on their native chains, eliminating the cross-chain risks of wrapping, bridging or messaging. It\u2019s the first-of-its-kind composable modular signature network built on dWallet's new protocol 2PC-MPC.\" Feb. 22: Binance Labs, the venture capital and incubation arm of Binance, has invested in Renzo, a Liquid Restaking Token (LRT) and strategy manager for EigenLayer, built to promote the widespread adoption of EigenLayer. \"Renzo Protocol, an EigenLayer restaking hub, consists of Ethereum smart contracts that facilitate trustless collaboration between stakers, node operators, and Actively Validated Services (AVSs),\" according to the team.
