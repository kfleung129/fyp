The 8350G has no dedicated graphics memory, but shares the main memory with the CPU cores.\nThe integrated UVD3 video decoder allows the full decoding of Multi-View Codec (MVC), MPEG-4 Part 2 (DivX, xVid), MPEG-4 AVC/H.264 and Adobe Flash HD videos.\nAccording to the clock rates of 514 - 720 MHz (Turbo), the\u00a0performance\u00a0is only a few percent above a\u00a0Radeon HD 7420G. Thus, the Radeon HD 8350G performs similar to a dedicated\u00a0Radeon HD 7450M. Modern and demanding games (2013) will be only playable in very low settings and resolutions. Without fast dual-channel memory the performance drops even more.\nThe shaders of the chip can also be used for general computing.\nThe APU is manufactured in 32nm and rated at a\u00a0TDP of 35 watts. This allows the chip to be used in notebooks from 13 to 14 inches or bigger. The\u00a0AMD Radeon HD 8350G\u00a0is a processor graphics card in the AMD Richland APUs (A4-5150M).

The performance depends on the used graphics memory, clock rate, processor, system settings, drivers, and operating systems. So the results don't have to be representative for all laptops with this GPU. For detailed information on the benchmark results, click on the fps number.

Reducing the details to high and turning off anti-aliasing, the game was fluid at 33 fps (min 21 fps). With minimum settings and still full HD resolution we recorded an average of 52 fps. In medium detail settings with 1366x768 we benchmarked only 22 fps on average on a 5 vs 5 game with bots. Still the game was playable. Reducing the details and resolution resulted in a much better framerate.
