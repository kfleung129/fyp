Ray tracing cores are important if you plan on using Blender\u2019s Cycles render engine for hyper-realistic lighting effects, as these dedicated cores significantly accelerate ray tracing calculations. Lastly, software optimization is also considered because it determines how well each GPU is optimized for Blender\u2019s specific workloads, ensuring you get the most out of your investment. Last but not least, we also pulled on our in-depth knowledge of GPUs, more specifically, our reviews of the RTX 4090, the RTX 4080, the RX 7900 XTX, and the RTX 4070 Ti Super. Having hands-on experience is super important, as we\u2019ve been able to make our decision not only based on the benchmarks of each of these cards in 4K gaming and synthetic performance, but also on their pricing and overall aesthetics. Essentially, you can rest assured that each of these choices has been tested, and approved, by us.    The NVIDIA RTX 4090 earns our top spot as the best GPU for Blender, providing unparalleled performance in both rendering and viewport operations: and getting a 4.5/5 in our review. This beast of a graphics card comes with jaw-dropping 16,384 CUDA cores and 24 GB of GDDR6X VRAM, ensuring that it can tackle even the most demanding Blender projects with ease. The RTX 4090\u2019s support for hardware-accelerated ray tracing makes it a top choice for artists who need realistic lighting, shadows, and reflections in their renders. As pretty much the best GPU that money can buy you right now, it\u2019s unsurprising that our benchmarks from in-house testing by\u00a0WePC\u2019s Sebastian Kozlowski confirm just how capable this GPU for graphics and rendering. The 4090 reached 6.44 seconds in Blender\u2019s bmw27, and a 3DMark graphics benchmark score of 18,940 in Time Spy Extreme. If you were to\u00a0benchmark your current graphics card\u00a0you\u2019d gain additional understanding too if you\u2019re looking to upgrade. In addition to its exceptional ray tracing capabilities, the RTX 4090 also boasts impressive AI performance, thanks to its Tensor cores. These cores can accelerate denoising and other AI-based tasks in Blender, helping to streamline your workflow. While the premium price of the RTX 4090 might be daunting for some, it is a worthwhile investment for professional 3D artists and animators who require the absolute best performance for their work.   The Zotac 4080 is a formidable powerhouse, delivering top-tier gaming performance and exceptional capabilities for Blender tasks. Boasting 16GB of GDDR6X memory, a clock speed of 2520MHz, PCIe 4.0 support, vibrant RGB lighting, and an integrated triple-fan cooling setup, this GPU stands ready to tackle the most demanding tasks, whether it\u2019s running Unreal Engine 5 or handling intensive rendering jobs. Zotac\u2019s rendition of the Nvidia 4080 epitomizes premium-grade GPU performance. With a robust 16GB VRAM capacity, clocked at 2520MHz, and boasting a triple-fan cooling configuration, it delivers top-notch performance time and time again.

Furthermore, it includes a sizable heatsink paired with composite heat pipes, fan vibration dampeners, and a bundled GPU support stand, enhancing both functionality and user experience. In our review, we found our industry-standard synthetic benchmarks in 3DMark and Blender 4.0 to be more than sufficient: only to be outdone by the likes of the pricier RTX 4090 GPU. The Monster, Junkshop, and Classroom rendering scenarios scored 4345.6, 2065.9, and 2143,6 samples per minute respectively. So, although the RTX 4080 does not quite pack the same amount of punch as the newer RTX 4090, it has a more than reasonable performance and is arguably more efficient than our first option; it will cost you less and won\u2019t be considered overkill.   We know some users like to live and die by their manufacturers so we thought it best to include an AMD option for all those supporting Team Red. However, we will preface this by stating that AMD\u2019s lack of ray tracing technology significantly weakens their performance and rendering capabilities with Blender, even though this cards 4K capabilities are strong. AMD\u2019s flagship GPU, the 7900 XTX, emerges as a formidable contender in the realm of high-performance graphics. This Speedster edition offers impressive specifications, including a generous 24GB VRAM capacity and a rapid 2615MHz clock speed, ensuring seamless performance across demanding creative tasks, as well as gaming.
