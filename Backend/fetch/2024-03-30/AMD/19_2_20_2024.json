    "text": "Following AOHi's success with the Starship's crowdfunding campaign, rival fast-charging accessory brand Sharge has hit back by announcing that the \"wait is over\" for those who would prefer to buy the Shargeek\u00a0170 via online retail channels rather than crowdfunding websites. It has a typical capacity of 24,000mAh, compared to 40,000mAh for the AOHi Starship; then again, Sharge has outfitted its \"futuristic\"\u00a0power bank with a larger and more colorful Smart Display to keep track of how fast it is charging and how much it has left in its transparent housing. It also comes with a 240W cable in the box. The OEM indicated that it would list the uniquely \"prismatic\" power bank at a full price of ~$198; however, the Shargeek 170 (so called as it is rated to deliver up to 140W\u00a0of charge via either of its dual USB-C ports and 30W via an additional single type-A port) has been released at $149\u00a0(or \u20ac138.27) for a limited time. The 170 is also now listed on Amazon, and may have the same deal when its page goes live, provided it does so before March 4, 2024 at 04:59 AM CET (or 23:59 PST).
