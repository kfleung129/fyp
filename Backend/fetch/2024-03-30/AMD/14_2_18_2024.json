If they are using an older AM4 socket CPU (Ryzen 3000, 4000, 5000), they can consider X570, B550, B450, X370, A320, and some other chipsets. Price A motherboard is one of those components that should not be purchased without heavy research. Every build has a budget for the different components and the motherboard being one of the key components, should be given proper consideration. Along with the features one may need, it also determines future expandability and the general future-proofing so getting a cheaper motherboard may warrant an upgrade fairly soon. Every manufacturer has a range of motherboard offerings ranging from budget to premium and GameRant has extensive coverage on the different types of motherboards to help make the decision easier. Form Factor ATX is the standard size for motherboards while eATX or extended ATX is a bit bigger and offers more connectivity options. mATX or micro-ATX boards are smaller than regular ATX boards but still offer a decent number of connectivity options. Mini-ITX boards are the most compact and have limited expansion/ connectivity options. They are ideal for small form factor builds like HTPCs (home theater PCs). Connectivity/ Expansion Depending on the use case, gamers may require several USB ports, SATA drive connectors, extra PCIe slots, wireless connectivity options, or all of these features. The larger the motherboard form factor, typically, the higher the connectivity and expansion options. Wi-Fi is also an important requirement these days and most modern motherboards offer Wi-Fi connectivity. Overclocking Overclocking is not really a concern for some people, as not everyone likes to push their hardware to its limits. But, for those looking to see how far they can push their CPU or GPU or RAM, a motherboard that has been designed with overclocking in mind is a must. The motherboard needs to be able to supply enough power to the components that would require extra wattage without breaking down. Note that motherboards that are designed for overclocking are typically more expensive.
