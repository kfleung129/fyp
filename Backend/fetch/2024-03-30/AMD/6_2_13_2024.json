    "text": " With earnings a little over a week away, Nvidia is clearly still a strong buy. Advertisement Source: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com Any Nvidia\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) stock outlook has to start by considering its staggering gain of more than 240%\u00a0last year. The company\u2019s share price has risen nearly 46%, and we\u2019re only now heading into mid-February. Nvidia could have another successful year because of the high demand for its AI solutions. Nvidia is a favorable choice because of the ongoing AI trend. The below NVDA stock outlook says this company is still a strong buy. Nvidia dominates about\u00a081% of the market\u00a0for AI chips used in cloud and data centers. Until AMD\u2018s (NASDAQ:AMD) AI chips gain traction, this will be the case for the time being. While there has certainly been \u201cAI hype\u201d in the past several months as businesses have tried to hop on the artificial intelligence train with their own \u201cAI-enhanced\u201d products. What is not hyped up, however, is the demand for Nvidia\u2019s chips. Because of U.S. export, Nvidia\u2019s chips have become more expensive in Asia, but this has not quelled demand for these chips in the region. The RTX 4090 has been difficult to find in Taiwan and parts of Southeast Asia, for example. The AI craze has also hit Japan with some local semiconductor equipment manufacturers seeing a boost in revenue and profits off of sustained demand for AI chips. Nvidia also\u00a0announced a $1 billion deal\u00a0to provide India-based companies with its AI chips. This is likely just the beginning of the ripple effect these chips are having on the international stage. According to the Financial Times, Nvidia invested in over 2 dozen AI start-ups in 2023, which made the chip maker the most active investor in the space for that year. With more than $18 billion on its balance sheet as the third quarter of 2023, it\u2019s no wonder why the company has been eager to invest. These investments can work out in the long run, especially as the AI space goes beyond generative AI and includes various kinds of applications. Nvidia will probably always be there to provide the chips to train AI models, but the chip maker can get the best out of the AI boom by making bets on capable companies. Nvidia\u2019s stock is trading at a record high, but its forward P/E ratio is still well below where it was 12 months ago. Then, the stock was trading at over 54.2x forward earnings. Nowadays, the chip maker\u2019s stock trades for just 36.3x forward earnings. This puts Nvidia\u2019s earnings multiple below that of its key competitor, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) That\u2019s all to say, despite Nvidia\u2019s valuation looking expensive, it is much less than it was in prior months. The company\u2019s continued growth in the coming months will likely justify where its multiple is sitting now.
