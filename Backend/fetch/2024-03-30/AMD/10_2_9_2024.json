    "text": "HELLDIVERS 2 DLSS & AMD FSR 3 Support: Are they available Well, Arrowhead Game Studio\u2019s Helldivers 2 is finally here and has turned out to be quite a successful endeavor for both the studio and Sony. As of now, Helldivers 2 has achieved a 24-hour peak of about 81,840 players on Steam. Suffice it to say, Helldivers 2 is now one of Sony\u2019s biggest PC launches, along with titles like God of War, Horizon Zero Dawn, The Last of Us, and more. However, being such a fresh release, there\u2019s a lot about it that many players don\u2019t know about. And right now, what most players are curious about is whether Helldivers 2 has DLSS and FSR 3 support. For a lot of players, playing games without any upscaling isn\u2019t really ideal. Upscaling technologies like DLSS, FSR, and XeSS have been monumental in changing the gaming landscape, and it\u2019s almost impossible to imagine modern gaming without them. Most players expect upscaling to be included with a game, and the same goes for those playing Helldivers 2. So, does Helldivers 2 have DLSS and FSR 3 support? Well, let\u2019s go ahead and find out. As of now, Arrowhead Game Studio\u2019s Helldivers 2 supports neither DLSS nor AMD\u2019s FSR 3. As expected, many players aren\u2019t quite happy with this, but so far Arrowhead hasn\u2019t really released any statement related to this particular issue. One major thing to note here is that Helldivers 2 does have an in-game upscaling option under Display Settings. The Render Scale setting offers seven options: Ultra Performance, Performance, Balanced, Quality, Ultra Quality, Native, Supersampling, and Ultra Supersampling. Now, some players are of the opinion that this is FSR, while others aren\u2019t so sure. What\u2019s frustrating is that Arrowhead has yet to share any information on what upscaling tech they are using in the game. One of the major issues Helldivers 2 players have with it is that the visuals kind of look \u2018\u2019messy\u201d and that the anti-aliasing is also quite bad. This is an issue that can be fixed by releasing DLSS 3 and FSR 3 for the game. Even the previous generation, DLSS 2 and FSR 2, could work wonders for the game. Now, compared to DLSS 3, AMD\u2019s FSR 3 is quite new and, as such, doesn\u2019t have that many games that support it. The latest title to get FSR 3 support is Bethesda\u2019s latest title, Starfield. However, we are sure to get more FSR 3-supported titles this year and beyond with the release of games like Pax Dei, Warhammer 40K: Space Marine II, Starship Troopers: Extermination, Crimson Desert, and more. Unfortunately, Helldivers 2 hasn\u2019t been announced to be on this list. For now, all players can do is wait for Arrowhead to release DLSS and FSR 3 for Helldivers 2. Till then, you will have to enjoy the game as it is. By the way, here\u2019s a helpful guide if you want to know where the game\u2019s save files are exactly located.
