Learn more If you\u2019re after the best GPU for the Ryzen 7 5700X and wondering what GPU bottlenecks the 5700X, we have you covered. It\u2019s important to make sure to get a good combo for the best experience out of your hardware without losing out on too much performance. Bottlenecks are present when components can\u2019t keep up with each other\u2019s speed, most of the time you want your graphics card to be the one slowing things down but not too much. You should always be building your PC with screen resolution in mind, especially if you\u2019re looking to do some GPU-intensive tasks such as gaming on modern AAA titles. So for the best picks for the best GPU for the 5700X, you can expect the RX 7800 XT, RTX 4070 Ti Super, and RX 6750 XT. Shop on Amazon Shop on Amazon Shop on Amazon Now if you\u2019re looking for a good GPU to pair up with your Ryzen 7 5700X then there are some good options to pick from. Core clock speed 2,254MHz game, 2,565MHz boost Stream processors 3,840 Memory 16GB GDDR6 Dimensions 326 x 126 x58mm PSU required 700W TBP 263W A GPU targeting 1440p performance and a great match to what the 5700X has to offer is the RX 7800 XT. A card that came out later in the life cycle of the RDNA 3 as the more accessible tier option came nearly a year after the initial 7900 XTX. But the game performance of it provides a great value choice not quite at the high-end of the spectrum. Featuring an MCM chip package it combines the N5/N6 processes from TSMC to provide a combined and unique architecture to its Navi 32 XT processor. As for its memory makeup, it utilizes 16GB of GDDR6 going through a 256-bit bus that clocked at 19.5Gbps to give it a bandwidth of 624GB/s. The GPU features 3,840 stream processors, with 240 TMUs, 96 ROPs, 60 CUs, and 60 RT cores. The XFX Speedster Merc319 offers a base clock of 1.634 GHz, a game clock up to 2.2254 GHz, and boosting up to 2.565 GHz. While coming in with a size of 326 x 126 x 58mm and a weight of around 2kg. All in a package TDP of 263W, and an MSRP of $499 although he custom cards are likely to vary from that. Core clock speed 2,670MHz boost, 2,340MHz base CUDA count 8,448 Memory 16GB GDDR6X Dimensions 336 x 150 x 63 mm ( 13.22 x 5.9 x 2.48 inch) PSU required 750W TBP 285W Now for the ultimate Nvidia experience, you have the RTX 4070 Ti Super to go for. An upgrade to what was already on offer, the Supers boost the value of the Ada range, even if plenty would agree that they should have come out in that way but better late than ever. Although it might be the last ditch effort before the RTX 50 series release. The 70 Ti Super is in the middle of the pack and is a bit of a harder choice of the lot but provides a good combination with the CPU. As we found in our RTX 4070 Ti Super review it reaches high frame rates across the board even with it targeting just 1440p, 4K is accessible to it as well. Even by featuring newer technologies like frame generation and DLSS 3, it can go above and beyond the rest, if you have to rely on inclusion by the game like Cyberpunk 2077 does as even there on Ultra it achieves 44 FPS in our testing, so getting more takes something else. The ROG Strix model is the one we tested, it comes with a large overclock on the processor with a default boos up to 2,670 MHz and an OC mode of 2,700 MHz. But that does come in a large package measuring 336 x 150 x 63 mm and weighing around 1.8kg. In general, the specs are the AD103-275 GPU made with TSMCs 5nm and contains 8,448 CUDA cores, 264 TMUs, 96 ROPs, 66 SMs, 264 Tensor cores, and 66 RT cores. Core Clock Speed 1614 MHz base, 2729 MHz boost, 2623 game Stream Processors 2560 Memory Size 12GB GDDR6 Dimensions 330 x 140 x 60 mm PSU Required 650W The last best GPU to pair with the Ryzen 7 5700X is the RX 6750 XT. The RDNA 2 GPU has benefitted from being an older pick as it drops its price but not the performance on offer. Providing a great value choice for those after a budget GPU and brings a great combination of AMD hardware for the utilization of its ecosystem. The card is built on Navi 22 KXT and features a TSCMs 7nm process. Coming in with 2,560 stream processors, 160 TMUs, 64 ROPs, 40 CUs, and 40 RTs. Along with the memory of 12GB GDDR6 with a 192-bit bus width and bandwidth of 432 GB/s from the 18 Gbps clock. The ROG Strix has a 2,623MHz boost clock up to 2,643MHz in OC mode, whilst the game clock goes to 2,554MHz and 20MHz more in OC mode. The model sits at a size of 322 x 141 x 56.5 mm and a TDP of 250W. In our RX 6750 XT review the card performs well across the board, with the likes of CSGO, Rainbow Six Siege, and Warzone reaching those high frame rates. But even in more graphics-demanding games it can do well but falls back in ray tracing compared to Team Green and in synthetic benchmarks. But the price did drop it down, but over time that has become much less of an issue and makes it a worthy choice. Now that we\u2019ve talked about the best GPU for your 5700X, what would push it too far and bottleneck it? Well, just about any stronger GPUs on the high end will be too much for the processor to keep up with. For the 5700X it starts with the RX 6800 XT and RTX 3080. At low resolutions, the CPU can\u2019t keep up with them. This means any higher GPUs are also in danger of doing the same and at a higher level. Cards like the RTX 4090 and RX 7900 XTX will especially be too much for the lower processor and 1080p. There will of course be less bottlenecking at higher resolutions such as 1440p and 4K though \u2013 which is what these GPUs are designed for. Updated cooling to adapt to the higher power rating Comes with a GPU support to help with the heavier build and prevent bending Strong design with a light feature A bit more of a dated design Shop on Amazon A cheap basic alternative without any extras on top Simple and basic design without any additions Lower quality build with plastic builds Shop on Amazon The Ryzen 7 5700X is a great CPU, so it\u2019s open to be paired with a bunch of different GPUs that work well with it. If 1080p or even 1440p gaming is what you\u2019re after, we\u2019d suggest the RTX 4070, 4060 Ti, RX 7700 XT, or 7800XT. Otherwise look to the old generation, the RTX 3060 Ti, 3070, or RX 6700 XT as highly capable cards to sit alongside your 5700X. If you pair your fast CPU with an entry-level GPU. It will mean the processor will be held back in performance so you won\u2019t be getting the best out of it. Especially in GPU-heavy applications like games, it will be less worth the system as it\u2019s better to be maxing out your GPU but at a higher level. You\u2019ll always encounter a bottleneck somewhere in your system, but pairing a 5700X and 3080 is a good combination that won\u2019t hold back too much. There you have a good range of graphics cards for the 5700X. A good match-up to match the performance and provide a good gaming experience. The AMD Ryzen CPU is a good choice for a value pick for the AM4 platform even to this day especially compared to Intel\u2019s Core lineup. So now you can enjoy it to the fullest with these GPUs as well. With a background in engineering and PC gaming, Seb is a staff writer with a focus on GPU, storage, and power supplies.
