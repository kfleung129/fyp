Learn more The best CPU for Overwatch 2 will help you keep frame rates steady, an increasingly important performance factor in reaction-based shooters nowadays. Overwatch 2 isn\u2019t the most graphically intensive game out there, and you\u2019re going to be able to play the game on pretty standard hardware with the best graphics settings set up. If you\u2019re still struggling to get a decent FPS, you might also want to consider upgrading to a the best GPU for Overwatch 2, one which will thankfully carry over to other games like Apex Legends and The Finals. We\u2019d recommend a few different CPUs that cover budget options, those with integrated graphics, and also top-tier CPUs that will net you extraordinary frame rate gains over the competition. Shop on Amazon Shop on Amazon Shop on Amazon Cores 8 Threads 16 Base speed 4.2GHz Boost speed 5.9GHz Cache 104MB TDP 120W BestBuy The first CPU we\u2019re going to be recommending for Overwatch 2 is going to be the AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D, a CPU that we consistently recommend as one of the best CPUs for gaming. Released last year, the 7800X3D quickly became a household name (within gaming) thanks to the powerful cache management provided by the 3D V-Caching technology. The efficient organisation of memory has allowed for a drastic increase in frame-rates, and it also doubles up as a powerhouse for productivity too. Alongside that, there\u2019s also significant gains in power-efficiency over Intel\u2019s counterpart processors. There\u2019s one eight core processor laced with 16 threads, and while it\u2019s only going to reach 5GHz, you won\u2019t find this an issue in Overwatch 2. If you pair with with capable DDR5 RAM, and the AM4 motherboard it deserves, expect to see really solid performance in game capable of churning out way more than 60FPS in Overwatch 2 at the highest resolutions. Cores 14 Threads 20 Base speed P-cores 3.5 GHz / E-cores 2.6 GHz Boost speed P-cores 5.1 GHz / E-cores 3.9 GHz Cache 20MB TDP 125 W / 181 W boost. Intel\u2019s 13th Gen CPUs are extremely versatile having compatibility with previous and current generation sockets, and DDR4 and DDR5 RAM. This means it\u2019s even easier to upgrade your gaming PC without having to strip everything from the bones up. The Intel i5-13600K is exactly one of those components bridging the gap between old and new, but sits firmly on the side of current quality. Having 14 cores and 20 threads, it\u2019s clockable between 3.9GHz and 5.1GHz. On top of that, there\u2019s 20MB cache that\u2019s going to help you increase your frame rate gains in Overwatch 2. It\u2019s not too expensive either, with an MSRP of $329 that\u2019s consistently discounted now that it\u2019s two years into its lifespan. Compared to its AMD competitors though, it\u2019s going to run at a TDP of up to 181W, which is a significant increase over the generally accepted 120W threshold. Cores 8 Threads 16 Base Clock 4.2GHz Boost Clock 5.1GHz Graphics Component AMD Radeon 780M TDP 65W I\u2019m gonna suggest something pretty unconventional, maybe controversial, as an option for Overwatch 2: Consider using a CPU with an integrated graphics chip. I\u2019d recently been using the AyaNeo AM01, a mini PC with a Ryzen 7 5700U inside, and though modern gaming was nowhere near as smooth as what you\u2019d expect from a full size gaming PC, it was still a budget friendly experience worth writing about. The AMD Ryzen 7 8700G only released earlier on in 2024 and features clock speeds up to 5.1Ghz. alongside that, there\u2019s eight cores and 16 threads as you\u2019d expect from Zen 4 architecture CPUs. It\u2019s a really solid option, especially if you\u2019re not happy spending anywhere between $300 \u2013 $1,000 on a graphics card you might not even need. The AMD Radeon 780M is baked into the Ryzen 7 8700G, powered by RDNA 3 architecture and sporting performance levels you\u2019d expect from a GTX 1650, or an equivalent graphics card. The 8700G is capable of running AAA games like Cyberpunk 2077 and Baldur\u2019s Gate 3 at minimum graphics settings, so you\u2019re going to be able to comfortably say that Overwatch 2 is going to run just fine with one of the best APUs for gaming. What frame rate should you aim for in Overwatch 2? When playing any competitive shooter, 60FPS is the bare minimum you\u2019re going to want, though striving for anything over 120FPS is really where you\u2019re hoping to sit.
