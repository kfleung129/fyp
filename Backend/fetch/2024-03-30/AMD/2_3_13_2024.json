The license was issued back when Donald Trump was US President, and then AMD tried to force the government to revoke this license.  Intel managed to defend it, having sold hundreds of millions of dollars worth of its chips to Huawei over the past time.  Following the publication of the source, Republican Senator Marco Rubio called on the Biden administration to revoke Intel's license \u201cimmediately.\u201d \nAMD applied for a similar license in 2021 under Biden, but was never granted permission.  Reuters notes that the reasons why Intel was granted a license and AMD was not are unknown.  As a result, the share of laptops with AMD CPUs in Huawei sales decreased from 47.1% in 2020 to 9.3% in the first half of 2023.

Published on By Microsoft has made a major update to the Windows 11 operating system, also known as Moment 5, available to all users as an optional update KB5035942. Users can optionally install KB5035942 through Windows Update.  Previously, the company allowed enthusiasts to manually activate new features from an update.  Moment 5 is now available to everyone directly from Windows Update. \nWindows 11 Moment 5 brings quite a lot of innovations.  Among them are an improved Copilot AI assistant function with new plugins and skills, improved \u201cPhotos\u201d with a smart \u201ceraser\u201d, an improved Clipchamp video editor (possibly removing \u201cawkward pauses\u201d), closer integration with Android smartphones (can now be used in as a webcam), and much more.

Published on By Space meteorologists have issued a forecast for this week warning of a possible geomagnetic storm caused by the release of plasma from a solar flare.  This could affect radio transmissions on Earth and contribute to the observation of the \u201cnorthern lights.\u201d According to an alert issued March 23 by NOAA\u2019s Space Weather Prediction Center in Boulder, Colorado, the public has no reason to be concerned.

Jonathan Lash, a forecaster at the center, noted that many commercial aircraft can use satellite communications as a backup option.\nSatellite operators may also have problems tracking their spacecraft, and the power grid may detect induced current in its lines.\n\u201cFor the general public in high latitudes, with clear skies, this will be a great opportunity to see the \u2018northern lights,'\u201d Lash said.\nEvery 11 years, the Sun\u2019s magnetic field changes and its north and south poles switch places.  During this cycle, solar activity also changes and is now approaching its peak, which is called solar maximum.\nDuring solar maximum, geomagnetic storms like the one observed last Sunday can occur on Earth several times a year, according to Lash.  During periods of solar minimum, several years may pass between storms.\nLast December, the largest solar flare in recent years disrupted radio communications.

Published on By BYD is going to beat Toyota and Volkswagen by offering modern cars at very low prices.  According to Bloomberg, the Chinese automaker has reduced prices on more than 100 of its electric and hybrid models. For example, BYD\u2019s new generation-changing Seagull hatchback now costs less than $10,000, while the manufacturer\u2019s best-selling electric sedan, the Qin Plus, costs less than $11,000. BYD announced the beginning of an era called \u201celectricity is cheaper than oil\u201d, when hybrid and pure electric models become as affordable as traditional models with internal combustion engines, or even cheaper. In total, BYD has already relaunched more than 70 models with lower prices.  According to Bloomberg, only the newest Yangwang supercar worth 233 thousand dollars has not fallen in price so far.\nBy lowering prices, BYD wants to convince drivers to ditch gasoline cars and switch to electric vehicles and hybrids.  This aggressive pricing policy poses a real threat to Toyota, Volkswagen, Nissan and other manufacturers.\nPreviously, BYD Auto officially announced the production of its 7 millionth new energy vehicle, which turned out to be the Denza N7.
