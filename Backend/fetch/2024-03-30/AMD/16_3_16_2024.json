It is called\u00a0AMD Dual Graphics\u00a0or asymmetric CrossFire and uses AFR (Alternate Frame Rendering) to render different frames on the two graphic cores. Therefore the combination also suffers from\u00a0micro stuttering\u00a0(different spaces between two images lead to stuttering altough the framerate is high enough for fluent gaming with only one GPU).\nThe\u00a0performance\u00a0of the Dual Graphics solution depends greatly on the driver support for the used games. In some games the performance may even degrade by 10-15% compared to using only the APU graphics card. Therefore, due to the micro stuttering and performance problems, Dual Graphics may impose more problems than bring performance gains. Only in a best case scenario the performance almost matches a GeForce GT 635M.\nThe\u00a0features\u00a0like PureVideo HD (UVD3) or OpenCL support are similar to the two graphics cards.\nAs both graphics cards are rendering frames, the\u00a0power consumption\u00a0is clearly higher than using only one GPU.

The performance depends on the used graphics memory, clock rate, processor, system settings, drivers, and operating systems. So the results don't have to be representative for all laptops with this GPU. For detailed information on the benchmark results, click on the fps number.
