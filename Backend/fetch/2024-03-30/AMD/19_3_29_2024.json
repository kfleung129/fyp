    "text": "Intel Corp. Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger got a big bump in compensation in 2023, but it still amounted to just over half what Lisa Su made as CEO of rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc. In Intel\u2019s 2024 proxy statement filed Thursday, it was disclosed that Gelsinger had total compensation of $16.86 million in 2023, or 45% more than his total 2022 compensation of $11.61 million. As a point of reference, Intel\u2019s stock \n        INTC,\n        +0.91%\n       soared 90.1% in 2023 after tumbling 48.7% in 2022. In comparison, the S&P 500 index \n        SPX\n       gained 24.2% in 2023 after falling 19.4% in 2022. AMD\u2019s stock \n        AMD,\n        +0.50%\n       shot up 127.6% in 2023, after slumping by 55% in 2022. Broken down, Gelsinger\u2019s 2023 salary fell 18% to $1.07 million, from $1.3 million in 2022, but the value of the stock awards he received increased to $12.43 million from $8.87 million, while his non-equity incentive plan compensation, which includes cash performance bonuses, jumped to $2.89 million from $945,900. He also received $112,000 in deferred compensation, to reflect changes in the value of his pension, which he didn\u2019t receive last year. The \u201call other compensation\u201d category dropped to $362,900 from $497,100. In 2023, that category included $16,500 in retirement-plan contributions, $84,200 in deferred compensation plan contributions, $27,500 for financial planning and physicals and $227,200 for company-provided car service. Regarding the car service, the amount reported represents the cost of the service used for \u201cnonbusiness\u201d purposes. \u201cWe do not consider these additional security measures to be a personal benefit for our CEO, but rather appropriate expenses for the benefit of Intel that arise out of our CEO\u2019s employment responsibilities and that are necessary to his job performance as well as his safety,\u201d Intel said. There was also $7,500 in \u201cother\u201d compensation, which included $1,500 for residential security and $6,000 in charitable contributions made on Gelsinger\u2019s behalf. Meanwhile, AMD\u2019s proxy statement released earlier this week put Su\u2019s total 2023 compensation at $30.35 million, or barely above her 2022 compensation of $30.22 million \u2014 but still 80% more than what Gelsinger made. Su\u2019s salary last year was $1.2 million, and she had $21.85 million in stock awards, $5.84 million in option awards, $1.43 million in non-equity incentive plan compensation and $28,711 in all other compensation. Su\u2019s all other compensation included contributions of $14,850 to her 401(k), $2.412 in life-insurance premiums paid, and \u201cother\u201d compensation of $11,449, which was the cost of \u201cspousal travel on company aircraft\u201d for business trips. Don\u2019t cry for Gelsinger, however. Remember that in 2021, after he returned to Intel as CEO on Feb. 15, he reaped total compensation of $178.59 million. That included \u201cnew-hire equity awards of a significant magnitude\u201d \u2014 $140.43 million to be exact \u2014 so the company could hire \u201cthe best leader possible.\u201d From the time Gelsinger became CEO through Thursday\u2019s close, Intel\u2019s stock has tumbled 28.5%, while AMD shares have charged up 92.5%. And what of Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia Corp. \n        NVDA,\n        +0.12%,\n       the rival chip maker and current hottest artificial-intelligence play? Nvidia hasn\u2019t filed its proxy statement for its latest fiscal year, which ended Jan. 28. But for the fiscal year that ended Jan. 29, 2023, Huang\u2019s total compensation was $21.36 million, down from $23.74 million the year before. What will his compensation for the latest fiscal year be, after the stock rocketed by 238.9% in 2023? Nvidia\u2019s stock is up by 503.9% from Feb. 15, 2021, through Thursday, and its market capitalization as of Thursday\u2019s close was $2.26 trillion, which was 4.7 times the combined market cap of Intel, at $186.75 billion, and AMD, at $291.63 billion. Walgreens\u2019 stock seesawed around the flatline Thursday, after the drugstore chain swung to a large quarterly net loss and trimmed its full-year outlook, but also reported the biggest beat for quarterly adjusted profit in at least five years.
