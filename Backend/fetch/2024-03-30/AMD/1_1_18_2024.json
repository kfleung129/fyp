    "text": "By Emily Bary AMD's stock joins other chip stocks in rallying on the heels of TSMC's upbeat outlook Advanced Micro Devices Inc. shares were on pace to close at an all-time high Thursday, which would mark the name's first new record finish in more than 25 months. Shares of AMD (AMD) were up 3.1% $165.20 shortly after Thursday's open, amid a broader rally in semiconductor names on the heels of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.'s (TSM) upbeat outlook. The stock's current record close of $161.91 came Nov. 29, 2021. TSMC's revenue forecast for the current quarter was better than the midpoint of the range of expectations, and executives offered some upbeat long-term commentary about artificial-intelligence chips.

Nvidia Corp. shares (NVDA) were up 1.9% toward a record close shortly after Thursday's open, while Marvell Technology Inc.'s stock (MRVL) was ahead 4.2% at a 21-month high. The PHLX Semiconductor Index SOX was up 2.8%, and was approaching the Dec. 27 record close of 4,214.59. Even before TSMC's report, AMD's stock was feeling some love, as Cowen & Co. analyst Matthew Ramsay turned more bullish overnight, upping his price target to $185 from $130. The company's MI300 chip, focused on AI applications, is \"poised for material growth/upside,\" according to Ramsay. \"We came away from the company's official MI300 launch in December with more conviction that the MI300 portfolio should position the company for long-term growth in AI computing,\" he wrote. The MI300 is emerging as an \"increasingly capable\" alternative in the generative AI market, Ramsay noted. Nvidia is overwhelmingly the market leader here.
