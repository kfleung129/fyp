Core clock speed 2,810MHz boost, 1,720MHz base Streaming processors 2,048 Memory 16GB GDDR6 Dimensions \u200e11.93 x 4.53 x 0.04 inches PSU required 600W TBP 190W At the top of the selection is the XFX Speedster QICK309, providing a great choice for the graphics card in general. As the board power increases between the 7600 XT vs 7600, the cooling on the XFX comes to improve it. Keeping things elegant and simple it has a slim if a bit long design to it. It keeps things clean and optimizes airflow with three fans on its model. It also has a flow-through design as well as open sides to allow for the hot air to escape. It has a four-piece heatpipe for moving all the heat away from the processor itself and allowing the processor\u2019s clocks to keep on a higher level. It also comes with a dual BIOS for ease of use and plenty of flexibility into which mode you want to use it in. Core clock speed 2,801MHz boost, 1,720MHz base Streaming processors 2,048 Memory 16GB GDDR6 Dimensions 227.2 x 123.24 x 49.6 mm PSU required 600W TBP 190W For a more compact option, the ASUS Dual RX 7600 XT is the one to go for. Knocking things down to a smaller dimension, it also only utilizes one power connector so you can keep things cleaner. But it still comes with a great overclock that provides a good performance improvement over more base-level cards. It does keep things down to only two axial tech fans to keep the temperature under wraps, they come with rings to keep the airflow going where it should. Whilst it might not have a flow-through design, it does come in a t 2.5slots so takes up more space with its heatsink to still be an effective solution and keep your performance going. Core clock speed 2810MHz boost, 2539MHz game Streaming processors 2,048 Memory 16GB GDDR6 Dimensions 281.4 x 116.6 x 52.6 mm PSU required 600W TBP 190W Gigabyte can keep things big and simple. With a thick Windoforce cooling system, it has three 80mm fans that counter-spin and five composite heat pipes on the processor, so you can be sure to get a great cooling capacity on the GPU. The air has a lot of areas to leave through as the back plate has a cut out for it to go through along with an open area around the sides. There is also a simple RGB logo on the side that can be controlled for a bit of flair, whilst the rest of the card keeps things simple and stylish. It provides a great quality for the cost it asks and allows you a great choice of RX 7600 XT. Typically AMD doesn\u2019t actually release Founder\u2019s Editions of their graphics cards that are available to the public. They produce a reference model that is used for their own testing and benchmarks and which is sent out to manufacturers to aid them, however, the ones that actually hit the retail market are the AIB versions made by these third-party manufacturers. AMD usually quotes the prices for its products with a SEP (Single Exit Price) figure, however, given that RX 7600 XT Founder\u2019s Edition GPUs aren\u2019t really available, this is only some guidance as to how much the various AIBs will cost. We know that AMD has given the SEP value for the RX 7600 XT as $329 USD, and we\u2019ve seen an XFX Speedster on Amazon sell for $369.99. Assuming that the SEP is the likely minimum value then, we can estimate a price range of roughly $330 \u2013 $400 USD for the various different variants. Although the AMD Radeon RX 7600 XT release date and release time have already come to pass, we haven\u2019t yet seen many variants listed online. Hopefully, more AIBs will be listed on Amazon, etc. in the coming days. That being said, we don\u2019t anticipate stock issues for the models that are up and available to buy. We trust you are now well-versed in what the best RX 7600 XT is for your needs.
