    "text": "ASUS is now officially confirming support for high-capacity DDR5 modules.  ASUS has officially announced the compatibility of a selection of its motherboards with DDR5 memory modules, which have a capacity of 64GB. This represents the highest capacity currently available for DDR5 modules, which have previously been offered in 8GB, 16GB, 32GB, and later non-binary 24GB/48GB configurations. The company has confirmed that 54 of its 700-series motherboards designed for Intel processors with four DIMM slots, will support this capacity. However. Support can vary depending on the BIOS version installed. For details, users are advised to check the chart below. Additionally, ASUS has extended support for Intel 600 series motherboards, albeit limited to certain high-end Z690 boards and workstation-oriented W680/Q670 models. There are in total 20 models listed. Interestingly, ASUS AMD 600 motherboard owners can easily upgrade to 64GB of memory without having to update their motherboards. This implies that users can purchase new memory modules and upgrade their systems without encountering any issues, as the support is already built-in.
