Continuing with our coverage from CES 2024, we\u2019re keen to investigate the impact of AI on all things tech \u2013 and what it means for the future of computing. In attendance at CES, and in light of the company\u2019s new 8000 series APUs, our By Gamers For Gamers colleagues asked AMD\u2019s Senior Processor Technical Marketing Manager, Donny Woligroski, for his view on AI-enabled chips at the heart of computing. The response we got was telling. Certainly, AMD\u2019s latest 8000 series chips, like those of Intel, will be felt on a wider industry scale. Woligroski\u2019s response that \u201cevery silicon provider is now going to be tied to the hip\u201d with AI, clearly suggests there\u2019s no going back from a hardware perspective, as there likely isn\u2019t in terms of AI software or apps (think ChatGPT or Google Bard) and its wider impact on humanity. In terms of computing, Woligroski went on to point out he did not believe that the process of AI capabilities in all consumer chips would be happening \u201ctomorrow\u201d. Instead, things would morph over time gradually as AI becomes more influential and unavoidable in everyday life. Coming off the back of AMD\u2019s announcement of its 8000 chips, which include the AI-enabled Ryzen AI NPU, and generally, AI has been a hot topic at this year\u2019s CES 2024 panels. Unlike other industries, the processor and gaming community appears to have a united front when it comes to AI moving forward \u2013 something Woligroski described as \u201cencouraging\u201d. Of course, graphics cards are already courting AI technology with the likes of DLSS 3.5 and Huang\u2019s law is firmly coming into play to move things forward away from hardware. However, in terms of how quickly AI\u2019s influence and impact will be, it is important to acknowledge that AI is currently still in its early stages of development \u2013 it actually hasn\u2019t been around in the public sphere for long at all. So it may take time for the benefits of this new software and the hardware that supports it to become widely noticeable. However, with AMD and other manufacturers embracing AI capabilities and technology, these changes could be fast-tracked in home computing when compared to other major tech industries. The reason is that AI provides processors with extra capabilities that cannot be replicated in hardware alone. Wolrigroski also speculated that the rumored 2024 Windows releases could be the first time users begin to see fundamental differences in their PC or laptop in terms of AI\u2019s influence. With a lot of exciting developments potentially on the horizon, who knows what component developments we\u2019ll see next? Here at PC Guide, we\u2019ll be sure to keep you updated on all upcoming releases and announcements including, for example, the arrival of AI into gaming accessories.
