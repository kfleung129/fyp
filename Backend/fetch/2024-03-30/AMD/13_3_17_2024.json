    "text": "Apple may have\u00a0given up on automotive hardware even before its first generation; however, its ever-present rival Samsung is still firmly in the game, determined to become a major player in the sector in a number of ways, not the least of which is camera hardware. The South Korean giant's Electro-Mechanics department has reportedly developed a potentially class-leading image-sensing module. These in-built components have become firmly linked to improved electronic assistance, theft-resistance and, above all, safety on the road, and Samsung will reportedly underpin those use-cases with an apparently super-durable housing for its new camera. It might extend the product's useful life by up to 6x the current industry average, according to the Korea Herald, thanks to new \"water-resistant\" and general ingress-protection treatments. It is also backed to be a self-heating car camera, in that it can clear itself of snow or frost in 60 seconds or less. Then again, it is also backed \"to operate flawlessly in extreme temperatures\" thanks to a new iris-like attachment that optimizes exposure in all conditions. On that note, the new camera is also tipped to live up to its maker's reputation for image quality, thereby supporting even higher levels of advanced driver-assistance. Samsung Electro-Mechanics is projected to start mass production for its new 'all-weather' car-cam imminently, and reportedly backs it to take up to 24% of its market by 2025.
