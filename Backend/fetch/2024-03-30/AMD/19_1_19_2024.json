    "text": "Farming Simulator 22 is adding FSR3, a seventh title to do so.  AMD\u2019s FidelityFX Super Resolution 3 (FSR3) continues to expand its support, with three new titles added to the roster within a week. The current lineup features seven titles, and if you count Warzone separately, it becomes eight. While the pace of FSR3 adoption might not align with initial expectations since its September launch, it appears that the momentum is gradually building. In the most recent update for Farming Simulator 22 (version 1.13.1.1), FSR3 support has been integrated, enhancing the upscaling technology for a game that already had FSR2 compatibility. Notably, the FSR3 package also introduces Frame Generation. Developers repeat AMD\u2019s recommendation that a game should ideally run at a minimum of 60 FPS before engaging Frame Generation. While this is more of a suggestion, sticking to it will likely result in a better gaming experience. If you want to try something different, you can use FSR3 profiles to make your gameplay faster. Feedback from gamers has been varied, with some reporting nearly doubled framerates on Radeon GPUs. However, others have encountered resolution scaling or tearing issues when using AMD Enhanced Sync.
