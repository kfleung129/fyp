    "text": "Secrets of Grindea Mod, HDR, Ultrawide (21:9), Super Ultrawide (32:9), AMD FSR 3 & DLSS Support Details After over a decade-long wait, Secrets of Grindea is finally here in all its glory. Developer Pixel Ferret released Version 1.0 of the game on February 29, 2024, officially marking the end of a thirteen-year-long development. Suffice it to say, there\u2019s a lot of excitement for this game. Plus, now that it\u2019s finally out, a lot of players want to know if they can enjoy it with mods, HDR, ultrawide, super ultrawide, ADM FSR 3, and DLSS. It\u2019s only evident that a newly released title like Secrets of Grindea will warrant questions like these. Every player has their own preference when it comes to how they want to play a game. Some like to mod their games, while others prefer to enjoy their games on big and wide screens with everything turned to max. And for all that, it\u2019s important to know what kind of features a game supports. So, does Secrets of Grindea have modding, HDR, ultrawide, super ultrawide, AMD FSR 3, and DLSS support? Well, let\u2019s go ahead and find out.  At the time of publishing this, Secrets of Grindea doesn\u2019t have official mod support. Fans have been asking for mod support for quite a while, but the developers have refrained from doing that. Furthermore, the game does have Steam Workshop support, but unfortunately, it\u2019s limited to translation and nothing else. This isn\u2019t to say that there isn\u2019t a dedicated modding scene for Secrets of Grindea. In fact, there are a handful of fans who have been working on adding proper third-party mod support for a long time. However, because there\u2019s no modding APU for the game, it\u2019s been a challenge to properly mod Secrets of Grindea. But there\u2019s a ray of hope! With Secrets of Grindea officially released, there\u2019s a high chance that we will see official mod support in the future. But for now, there\u2019s nothing much to do when it comes to modding in Secrets of Grindea. Besides that, the game also doesn\u2019t have native HDR support currently. However, you can try using Windows 11\u2019s Auto-HDR or third-party tools like\u00a0Special K\u00a0or\u00a0autohdr_force and see if any of them work out. If none of these are of help, then you will have to wait for the developers to add in proper HDR support, like some players are doing for ultrawide and super ultrawide. Currently, if you play the game in 21:9 or 32:9 aspect ratios, the game just stretches the image on the screen, resulting in bad visuals. However, developers are aware of this and have promised to address it in future updates. Secrets of Grindea also doesn\u2019t have AMD FSR 3 or DLSS support. However, this is to be expected. The game isn\u2019t a resource hog at all and can run even on the most potato PC out there. So, adding upscaling options will just overcomplicate things when it doesn\u2019t need them at all in the first place. Well, that\u2019s all the information we have on this. You can also take a quick look here if you want to know whether Pacific Drive also supports the same features. And for more such content, keep following DigiStatement.
