As you may have seen, just last week the RX 7700 XT was treated to an official price cut by AMD, with Team Red dropping the MSRP in the US by 7%, down to $419. Tom\u2019s Hardware spotted that there are now more RX 7700 XT GPUs down at that level on Amazon.com and Newegg, which is good news \u2013 while AMD can recommend a price, its third-party card-making partners don\u2019t necessarily have to follow that guidance. (And there is no reference board made by AMD in the case of this GPU). But it seems those card vendors are doing just that, and indeed looking at Newegg right now, the 7700 XT has sunk below that new MSRP. There\u2019s a Sapphire Pulse RX 7700 XT down to $419, but with a $10 off promo code at checkout, it\u2019s now $409, a real bargain for this graphics card. That one is still in stock \u2013 at least at the time of writing \u2013 although there\u2019s another model with the same deal, a $10 off discount code making it $409, but it\u2019s run dry sadly. That\u2019s the ASRock Challenger spin on the 7700 XT, which you can back-order if you wish (or it might even come back in stock by the time you read this). It\u2019s a good sign that two of these GPUs are now barely over $400 in the US, and just maybe we\u2019ll see pricing coming down further \u2013 and proportionate reductions in other regions outside the US, too. We are seeing some movement in the UK, for example, like a Gigabyte Gaming 7700 XT down at \u00a3420 at Overclockers, but that\u2019s out of stock currently, unfortunately. This is a good graphics card and a sterling 1440p performer, but as we point out in our\u00a0RX 7700 XT review, the main problem is the pricing. Or was the pricing, rather, as with the cost of the GPU now having been reduced nicely (at least in the US), it makes a lot more sense. The gap between the RX 7700 XT and 7800 XT didn\u2019t really line up before \u2013 with the latter only being $50 more expensive, it was a no-brainer unless that extra expenditure broke your budget. However, on Newegg now the cheapest 7800 XT is $500, so the 7700 XT is almost a hundred bucks under that, where it looks like a good value proposition \u2013 and maybe it\u2019ll be sneaking onto our list of the best graphics cards soon, at this rate. And that most definitely wasn\u2019t a possibility at the launch of the 7700 XT. All that noted, if you\u2019re looking at a mid-range GPU from AMD, and can wait, it might be prudent to do so. After all, RDNA 4 is going to top out at the mid-range, if the rumor mill is right \u2013 and those graphics cards are likely to really go for the throat in terms of value proposition, as this will likely be AMD\u2019s best way of looking good in the face of Nvidia\u2019s rival next-gen GPUs. The RTX 5090 could arrive as early as Q3 2024 perhaps \u2013 though Q4 is more likely \u2013 and is purportedly going to be a massive leap in performance that\u2019ll truly blow away anything Team Red has. So, AMD\u2019s obvious counterattack could be on pricing in the middle of the pack, to save its public perception in terms of starting to look too far behind the competition.
