Written by CMC Markets 21 Feb 2024, 12:35 Share this Semiconductor stocks have recently garnered significant interest from our clients, as developments in AI continue to unfold in real time. While NVIDIA and TSMC often grab the headlines, this brief turns the spotlight on AMD and ARM, two notable stocks worthy of attention. This analysis examines the technical trends, price drivers, and future trajectory for these stocks. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) is a global semiconductor company. Within the global semiconductor industry, it offers x86 microprocessors, either as standalone devices or incorporated into accelerated processing units for commercial and consumer markets. AMD devices are used in mobile personal computers (PCs), tablets, professional workstations, servers and graphics and multimedia products.  AMD has a pivot point potentially at $163.31 for a reversal to an upward trend. The alternative scenario is price goes below the $162.50 pivot with a potential pull to the Support at $149.97. Moreover, AMD is trading above both its 20- and 50-day MA at 173.8550 and $156.4430 respectively with a price Resistance is at $184.9050. The RSI is above the 50 with the MACD below its signal line, and positive. There is a probability the stock could retrace in the short term. AMD could potentially rise to the $198.00 \u2013 $214.20 range with a current bullish consensus Price Target of $193. Base case assumptions are of further share gains for AMD in server compute and notebook continue to drive growth, further supported by a strengthening AI story and a 1 year forward FY2025 EPS of $4.21. Bull consensus: Bull case assumes further execution for AMD. In computing and graphics, AMD continues to gain material market share, while both CPU and GPU markets remain healthier than forecasted. Their server business re-accelerates and grows faster than forecasted, culminating in a bull case FY2025 estimate of $5.03 EPS on a 50x multiple with a price target of $252.00. Bear consensus: The bear case assumes AMD loses momentum as Intel regains its footing with early success in server due to Granite Rapids. The multiple compresses to 30x as they are unable to drive meaningful revenues in AI markets beyond 2024 resulting in a FY2025 estimate of $3.84 EPS and a target price of $115.00. Catalyst To Upside Downside Risk ARM is a leading semiconductor IP provider specialising in the licensing of CPU cores for the use in advanced digital chips. Its low power, high performance designs are optimised for use in mobile, cloud infrastructure, and IoT as well as the emerging compute in vehicles. ARM also licenses designs for neural processing capabilities (NPUs), graphics cores (via its Mali products) and offers custom system-on-chip (SOC) services as well. The company also provides technical support and training services. ARM has headquarters in Cambridge, UK as well as its North American base in San Jose. It employs almost 6,000 people worldwide and was set up in the 1980s as a spin out of Acorn computers and was originally named Advanced RISC Machines (or ARM for short).  ARM Holdings has a pivot point at $118.1125 with potential a reversal continuing its upward trend. The alternative scenario is price goes below the $118.1125 level with a potential pull to the $72.28 Support. ARM is relatively extended and trading well above both its 20- and 50-day MA at 100.1852 and $83.2704 respectively with a price Resistance is at $163.9450. The RSI is above the 50, closer to the overbought level at ~67% with the MACD above its signal line in as strong momentum and positive. The stock is consolidating in the short term with a probability for a short-term reversal. ARM consensus price range of $55.40 \u2013 $140 with a current bearish Price Target of $107. Base case assumptions model ARM\u2019s non-GAAP EBIT margin to pass c.51% in FY26e, giving EPS of $2.15. Consensus expectation is for revenues to grow with an estimated 22% CAGR to FY26, despite slowing growth in licensing. ARM\u2019 s business model and dominant market position combined with structural growth opportunities (AI and autos) could suggest the stock deserves a valuation premium to peers. Bull consensus: ARM could see better than modelled gains, especially in the infrastructure segment, driven by AI and general cloud growth, as well as a more uniform transition to higher royalty rates (shift to v9 architecture) than modelled with key customers (esp. in autos, smartphones) all shifting to 5%+ rates. This would all drive higher royalties\u2019 growth and could see adjusted EBIT pass 60% by FY26e. This could see its FY2026e EPS reach $4, a 50x multiple then takes the shares to $200. In this scenario AI & higher rates drive and creating an inflection; the EPS nears $4 with a Consensus Target Price of $200.00. Bear consensus: Key downside risks include (i) weaker royalty rates in key end markets, (ii) the business impact from an unfavourable litigation outcome, (iii) loss of share to competitors in growing end markets and (iv) the possibility that geopolitical issues limit global reach longer term. As such the FY26e EPS may reach only c.$1.5 as operating leverage fails to push EBIT margins much beyond c.40%. A cycle low c.25x PE multiple would mean a c.$38/share valuation in this bear scenario. Risk factors impact; EPS edges to c.$1.5 with a Consensus Target Price of $38.00. Catalyst to Upside Downside Risk This analysis was prepared on February 20, 2024.
