    "text": "Bethesda has just announced that a new beta patch for Starfield will be released next week that will add support for AMD FSR 3.0 Frame Generation. Starfield already supports NVIDIA DLSS 3 Frame Generation. As such, it will be interesting to see whether FSR 3.0 will be able to come close to it. And yes, we\u2019ll benchmark FSR 3.0 once it comes out, and compare it against DLSS 3. We're excited to share that @AMD FSR 3 is coming to @StarfieldGame's Steam Beta next week!#FSR 3 will be available to all PC players later this month ahead of our next scheduled update. pic.twitter.com/LQ1pA8TU78 \u2014 Bethesda Game Studios (@BethesdaStudios) February 2, 2024  The first games that supported AMD FSR 3.0 were quite disappointing. Both Forspoken and Immortals of Aveum played awful with it. And while Avatar had a better implementation, it still had major issues. However, things completely changed with Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth and The Talos Principle 2. In these two games, AMD FSR 3.0 Frame Generation works incredibly well. So, I\u2019m really curious to see whether the FSR 3.0 in Starfield will be as good as in those two games. Before closing, you might be interested in some mods for Starfield. Last month, we talked about one that adds\u00a0cool quests when you explore new places. There\u2019s also a\u00a0mod that makes dead bodies move realistically, as well as a\u00a0mod that aims to\u00a0overhaul the game\u2019s enemy AI. In September, we shared the\u00a0Disk Cache Enabler Mod, which helps reduce how much space the game uses on your computer. There\u2019s also a\u00a0mod that gives characters super realistic eyes. Oh, and if you don\u2019t like the default camera views in dialogue, there\u2019s a\u00a0mod to disable them. Sprinting Stuttering Fix\u00a0is another cool mod that stops the annoying stutters when you run. Then, you can grab\u00a0this mod\u00a0that makes the game run smoother by fixing a bunch of scripts. And don\u2019t forget these\u00a0two must-have mods\u00a0that make the game look and feel better with a new User Interface and cooler Particle Effects. On the other hand,\u00a0this mod lets you travel between planets in real-time. Oh, and let\u2019s not forget\u00a0this mod\u00a0that brings a dynamic weather system into the game, as well as\u00a0this mod\u00a0that aims to\u00a0improve the behavior of NPCs. Finally, here are all the\u00a0best Starfield mods you can download. Be also sure to read Nick\u2019s review. Stay tuned for more! John is the founder and Editor in Chief at DSOGaming.
