Don\u2019t despair \u2013 there\u2019s still a burger segment! We send out a huge THANK YOU to our generous and ever faithful Patreon members. New folks and current ones that are bumping their patronage are greatly appreciated. This show cannot go on without you \u2013 you know who you are, please consider helping our efforts. It most definitely helps keep us on the air. And helps Josh buy burgers. Thank you!
