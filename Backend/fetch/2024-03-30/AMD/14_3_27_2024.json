Compared to the A6-9220, the 9220C is rated at a reduced TDP of 6 versus 15 Watt and also reduced clock speeds. It integrates two CPU cores (one Excavator module with 2 integer and on FP unit) clocked between 1.8 - 2.7 GHz (versus 2.5 - 2.9 GHz on the A6-9220). \nArchitecture \nStoney Ridge is the successor of the Carrizo architecture and the design is almost identical. Thanks to optimized manufacturing processes and more aggressive Boost behavior, however, the clocks are a bit higher at the same power consumption. The memory controller now also supports DDR4-RAM, in this case up to 2133 MHz. Stoney Ridge is the designation for the smaller dual-core and single-core chip, while Bristol Ridge is the bigger quad-core chip with dual-channel memory controller.

The AMD Athlon 300U is a mobile entry level dual core SoC that was announced in January 2019. It combines two Zen cores (with SMT / Hyperthreading so running 4 threads) clocked at 2.4 - 3.3 GHz with a\u00a0Radeon RX Vega 3\u00a0graphics card with 3 CUs (192 Shaders) clocked at up to 1000 MHz. Specified at 15 Watt TDP, the SoC is intended for thin mid-range laptops. It is quite similar to the AMD Ryzen 3 3200U (2.6 - 3.5 GHz). \nCompared to the Picasso APUs of the Ryzen 3000 series, the Athlon 300U is still based on the first generation of the 2000 series. Only the PRO variant is based on the new Zen+ microarchitecture that should lead to a 3% IPS (performance per clock) improvement. \nThe integrated dual-channel memory controller supports up to DDR4-2400 memory. As the features of the Picasso APUs are the same compared to the Raven Ridge predecessors, we point to our\u00a0Raven Ridge launch article. \nIn contrast to the faster quad-core Picasso APUs, the Athlon 300U only supports 3 instead of 4 displays in total. \nPerformance wise, the Athlon 300 should be slightly slower than the\u00a0Ryzen 3 2200U\u00a0(2.5 - 3.4 GHz Dual Core with SMT).
