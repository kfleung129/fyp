It offers 128 shader cores and two Compute Units based on the GCN architecture and is clocked at 400 MHz with no support for Turbo. The graphics card does not have dedicated VRAM and will access the main memory of the system (up to single-channel DDR3L-1333).\nThe HD 8240 integrates both UVD 4.2 and VCE 2.0 video encoders. It supports up to two external monitors via VGA, DVI, HDMI 1.4a and DisplayPort 1.2.\nDepending on the benchmark, the\u00a0performance\u00a0of the Radeon HD 8240 is somewhere between the\u00a0Intel HD Graphics (Ivy Bridge)\u00a0and\u00a0HD Graphics 4000\u00a0GPUs. This is on par with a dedicated\u00a0Radeon HD 6450M, but is\u00a0still too slow for modern games as of 2013. However, some older and less demanding games will run fluently if the performance of the CPU is sufficient.

However, some older and less demanding games will run fluently if the performance of the CPU is sufficient. The following benchmarks stem from our benchmarks of review laptops. The performance depends on the used graphics memory, clock rate, processor, system settings, drivers, and operating systems. So the results don't have to be representative for all laptops with this GPU. For detailed information on the benchmark results, click on the fps number.
