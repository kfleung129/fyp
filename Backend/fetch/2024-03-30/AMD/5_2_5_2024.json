The news follows the recent announcement of the company\u2019s highest annual sales volume in 2023, shifting 782,451 vehicles in the US alone, a 12% increase on its previous record from 2022. Kia America supplied 51,090 units in January 2024, citing growth across its SUVs, utility vehicles and EVs. SUVs accounted for 74% of the company\u2019s January sales, including 1,408 units of the new EV9. This was also an increase compared to the December sales volume of 1,113. The\u00a0EV6\u00a0was also noted, with 9% sales volume growth compared to last January, reaching 1,213. The number of Kia Niro EVs sold was not provided as these are accounted for alongside the hybrid versions of the Niro.

In other news, Kia has announced that the EV9 was declared the North American Utility Vehicle of the Year, an award delivered by the North American Car of the Year (NACTOY) jury; previous winners include the Kia EV6.
