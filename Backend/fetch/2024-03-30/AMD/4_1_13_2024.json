    "text": "Minisforum, renowned for its Mini-PCs, is stepping into new territory with the Minisforum BD770i by offering a motherboard with a soldered CPU. Adhering to the ITX standard as the form factor, this motherboard is compatible with most PC cases. Given its compactness, it is likely to find applications in very small Mini-ITX housing. The BD770i is powered by an\u00a0AMD Ryzen 7 7745HX processor, featuring eight Zen4 cores.\u00a0This SoC is expected to deliver ample performance for handling complex tasks. We delved into the gaming performance together with an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090,\u00a0as the graphics card can operate at peak performance thanks to the full PCIe x16 slot. Minisforum currently offers five different motherboards, each equipped with a processor from the notebook sector. In the following overview, we have compiled information about these devices, highlighting their key specifications.  In order to ensure the test's authenticity, we choose to run all tests without a dedicated graphics card. We used the Phanteks Enthoo Evolv Shift XT case, chosen for its compact design, to provide a solid foundation. Additionally, for the performance comparison involving a dedicated graphics card, we assessed the Minisforum BD770i alongside the Palit GeForce RTX 4090\u00a0GameRock OC\u00a0in an open setup. The size of the graphics card prevented its installation in the Phanteks Enthoo Evolv Shift XT. The case accommodates graphics cards with a length not exceeding 32.4 centimeters. Included in delivery is the Minisforum BD770i mainboard With a SoC heat sink already fitted. Furthermore, a relatively large WLAN antenna with a magnetic stand and the matching IO shield are included also. Other parts are needed in order to operate the Minisforum BD770i. Neither a 120-millimeter fan nor pre-installed RAM or SSD are offered by the producer. In addition, a suitable PC power supply is needed; it should be small and in SFX format to fit within the Phanteks Enthoo Evolv Shift XT case. Consequently, the Minisforum BD770i serves as a solid foundation for a compact DIY PC in a miniature form factor. Equipped with the\u00a0AMD Ryzen 7 7745HX,\u00a0the Minisforum BD770i mainboard features a modern SoC, albeit not the latest AMD processors. Nonetheless, the installed SoC stands out with its eight Zen4 cores capable of processing 16 threads. The excellent cooling ensures consistent high performance, and thermal limitations are not as severe as in laptops or mini PCs. In our performance assessment, the AMD Ryzen 7 7745HX closely trailed an\u00a0 AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D.\u00a0In comparison to Intel, it surpassed a Core i5-12600K, although an Intel Core i5-13600K performed slightly better. We appreciated the strategy of integrating a mobile processor into a traditional desktop PC, as these CPUs are generally easier to cool while still delivering commendable performance. Even a current\u00a0Intel Core i5-14600K\u00a0only achieves a ten percent lead in the performance rating. This highlighted the positive performance development of mobile SoCs with efficient cooling. During individual tests, the AMD Ryzen 7 7745HX may not match the performance of well-known flagship models due to its lower core count. Notable is the comparison of the\u00a0AMD Ryzen 7 7840HS\u00a0and the\u00a0AMD Ryzen 9 7940HS,\u00a0which were both evaluated in Minisforum Mini-PCs (Minisforum EliteMini UM780 XTX and\u00a0Minisforum Venus Series UM790 Pro).\u00a0Not to be overlooked is the fact that the two HS models use marginally less power. Nonetheless, it becomes apparent that mobile SoCs can deliver significantly more performance with effective cooling. This requires appropriate UEFI settings that allow the processor to receive more sustained power, provided thermal conditions permit. The BD770i from Minisforum does not artificially limit values, and the power limit can be manually adjusted. In the default state, we documented a stable power consumption of 75 watts for the AMD Ryzen 7 7745HX. For additional comparisons and benchmarks, please refer to our CPU comparison table. * ... smaller is better The Cinebench R15 Multi continuous test provides an initial insight into the performance of the installed cooling solution.

In this scenario, the\u00a0AMD Ryzen 7 7745HX\u00a0is on par with an Intel Core i7-13700, and even the Intel Core i7-13700K cannot outperform it.\u00a0The ranking of our test sample remains consistent at higher detail levels and maximum settings. The Minisforum BD770i mainboard continues to compete with the Intel Core i7-13700, and when examining individual tests separately, the AMD Ryzen 7 7745HX, paired with the Palit GeForce RTX 4090 Gamerock OC, can compete with top models in certain instances.\u00a0All current titles may be played smoothly in 2,160p with no loss of detail in this configuration.All the systems listed in this comparison were tested with the same graphics card, namely the\u00a0Pait GeForce RTX 4090 Gamerock OC. An important note when using an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090: Our test sample of the Minisforum BD770i was not equipped with the latest BIOS during testing. Consequently, the graphics card was only connected with PCIe 4.0 x1. Version 1.05 is the only one that allows the graphics card to run at maximum bandwidth; it can be found on the support website. The BIOS update process can be initiated directly from Windows. Minisforum provides the BD770i mainboard with a pre-installed heatpipe cooling system. However, users are given the flexibility to choose the 120-millimeter fan for installation. It's worth noting that temperature variations may occur with different fans compared to our Noctua NF-A12x25 fan. Overall, we have few criticisms about the cooling unit. The SoC and voltage converters on the motherboard receive direct cooling, emphasizing that alternative coolers cannot be installed. The temperatures of the AMD Ryzen 7 7745HX hover just above 90 \u00b0C in both closed and open systems. This is within the acceptable range for a CPU from the mobile sector, as AMD's specifications allow the processor to reach temperatures up to 100 \u00b0C before experiencing performance reduction. Even during extended stress tests, we did not reach 100 \u00b0C. One of the standout features of the Minisforum BD770i is its power consumption. We recorded only 127.5 watts in the Cinebench R15 Multi test, resulting in exceptional efficiency, surpassing other desktop systems in comparison. In gaming scenarios, where a significant portion of energy is utilized for the graphics card's performance, we documented a comparatively good result with an average of 495 watts. The efficiency of the AMD Ryzen 7 7745HX is on par with the AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D. However, in terms of efficiency in gaming mode, the AMD Ryzen 7 7745HX outperformed the AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D. Without the use of a dedicated graphics card, the test system operateed significantly more economically, requiring an average of only 60 watts in gaming mode. Regarding overall operation and noise levels, we observed that our installed power supply unit is audible in our test setup. Throughout both idle and load conditions, we did not detect any measurements influenced by the installed adapter. The small pre-installed fan for active cooling of the SSD operates very quietly and remains inaudible from a closed case. The BIOS settings on the Minisforum BD770i motherboard offer limited options for adjustment. Users can set the CPU power in predefined steps (45, 55, and 75 watts) and adjust the maximum CPU temperature to any value. Compared to well-known motherboard producers, the Minisforum BD770i motherboard has more limited setting options. The ability to adjust the fan curve might be a valuable addition for users who prefer flexibility over experimenting with the SoC's power and temperature limits. * ... smaller is better * ... smaller is better The Minisforum BD770i from the Chinese system producer, known for compact PCs, provides an excellent foundation for building highly efficient devices.
