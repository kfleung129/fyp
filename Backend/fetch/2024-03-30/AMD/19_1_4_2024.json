    "text": "AMD\u2019s upcoming offerings for the AM4 platform, including the new GT series and new X3D SKUs have been listed online. Alongside the specifications, we can get an idea regarding AMD\u2019s pricing structure for these CPUs. The leak sources from Geizhals, a German price comparison website, and boutique.gesci, a French hardware retail store. The listings include the Ryzen 5 5500 GT, the Ryzen 5 5600 GT and even the Ryzen 7 5700X3D. The Ryzen 5 5500 GT features 6 cores / 12 threads using the Zen3 architecture and has a base clock of 3.6GHz. The frequency can go as high as 4.4GHz, 200MHz higher than the Ryzen 5 5500. And yes, these CPUs do come packed with an iGPU so you won\u2019t need an external GPU for display. The Ryzen 5 5600 GT has not been detailed completely, as is the case with the Ryzen 7 5700X3D. Anyhow, the 5600 GT should have 6 cores / 12 threads with a boost clock of 4.6GHz. Pertinently, both the 5500 GT and 5600 GT will include an AMD Wraith Spire cooler out of the box. The Ryzen 7 5700X3D based on a previous leak has similar specifications to the 5800X3D, though with slower clocks. It can clock up to 4.1GHz and packs 100MB of cache. The Ryzen 5 5500 GT is priced at \u20ac133.98, the 5600 GT at \u20ac185.63,\u00a0and the 5700X3D at \u20ac271.00. We have compiled a table below to show the respective pricing of these processors in USD. The new Ryzen 5000 GT and Ryzen 7 5700X3D CPUs are expected to be announced sometime this quarter. While we do not have an exact date, they could be released along with the AM5 APU lineup on the 31st this month. Source: Geizhals (5500 GT, 5700X3D), Gesci (5600 GT) Abdullah Faisal "
