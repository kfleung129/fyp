In this article, we will compare the AMD Ryzen 7 8700G vs AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D; taking a deep dive into specifications, performance, and price analysis to judge which comes out on top. Additionally, we will take a look at the major differences between an APU and a CPU. For additional CPU comparison, be sure to check out our AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D vs AMD Ryzen 9 7950X piece and AMD Ryzen 7 8700G vs AMD Ryzen 7 5700G. For now, though, let\u2019s continue with this one. In the specs and performance arena, the AMD Ryzen 7 8700G processor and Ryzen 9 7950X3D are leagues apart, each catering to vastly different user needs. Just a glance at their major components, such as the core counts, can reveal the stark contrast in their market positioning. The Ryzen 7 8700G, equipped with 8 cores and 16 threads, reaches a max frequency of 5.10 GHz and supports up to 256 GB of memory across 2 channels. On the other hand, the Ryzen 9 7950X3D boasts 16 cores and 32 threads, with a towering max frequency of 5.70 GHz. Amazingly, it supports up to 128 GB of memory in 2 channels. Shop on Amazon Shop on Amazon The 3D V-Cache technology, a standout feature of the 7950X3D, sets it apart significantly. With a whopping 128 MB of L3 cache, it\u2019s a behemoth for gaming. In comparison, the 8700G\u2019s 16 MB cache pales. That\u2019s not all bad news for the 8700G. The specs make it a more versatile, all-rounder APU. Moreover, manufacturing processes are another key. The 8700G is produced using a 4 nm process, while the 7950X3D uses a slightly larger 5 nm process. This smaller node is essential for its existence as an APU, allowing it to combine CPU and GPU functionalities efficiently. However, this doesn\u2019t translate to a significant advantage over the 7950X3D. However, when it comes to sheer performance, how does each unit fare? In a range of public benchmarks, the Ryzen 9 7950X3D outperforms the Ryzen 7 8700G by a staggering 75% in combined results. This level of superiority is a clear indicator of the 7950X3D\u2019s prowess in handling complex, multi-threaded tasks. Specific benchmark comparisons further highlight this disparity. In Passmark CPU Mark tests, the 7950X3D outperforms the 8700G by nearly 50%, a testament to its robust processing power. This trend continues in Cinebench 2024 (Multi-Core) tests, where the 7950X3D\u2019s adeptness at managing intensive, multi-threaded workloads is once again evident. The gap does narrow significantly in single-core performance tests. In this arena, the 8700G demonstrates its strength, closing the performance difference to just about 10% behind the 7950X3D. This shows how the APU 8700G is capable of delivering good competition to a lot of CPUs out there. Paired with a strong GPU like a 7800XT or a 4070 Ti Super, the performance will be pretty good for the majority of users. As expected, price is the main difference in this comparison. They are in completely different markets after all. The 8700G has an MSRP of $329, while the 7950X3D goes up to $699 \u2013 almost double the price. You would need to add to this the fact that the 8700G is ready to function and perform greatly thanks to the 780M integrated graphics card. So, if you\u2019re looking to purchase the best system money can buy, the 7950X3D would be the one to choose from these two. Though, if you\u2019re looking for a more balanced price-to-performance ratio the 8700G, alongside a strong dedicated GPU, would suffice. As we know, the AMD Ryzen 7 8700G is already available. The official release date was January 8, 2024. Currently on the market with an MSRP of $329, the AMD Ryzen 7 8700G\u2019s price is likely to fluctuate for a few months post-release. However, as AMD releases more APUs and GPUs into the market, availability should rise and prices should begin to drop. If sheer performance is your priority, the Ryzen 9 7950X3D stands unrivaled \u2013 it\u2019s the powerhouse for the most demanding tasks. On the flip side, for those balancing cost with solid performance, the Ryzen 7 8700G, complemented by a good GPU, offers an impressive, cost-effective alternative. Although, like always, the consumer will have final choice over which model best suits their own gaming needs. PCguide.com\u00a0is part of the BGFG family of websites.
