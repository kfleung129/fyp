At the recent AMD AI PC Innovation Summit, AMD confirmed that Strix Point chips would feature RDNA3+ integrated graphics and XDNA2 architecture NPUs, with a launch expected within the year. The Fire Range processors, offering 8 and 16-core options, are positioned as successors to the current Dragon Range (Ryzen 7045HX series) processors. These are in the B0 development step with a 55W TDP, and their core specifications are anticipated to be on par with desktop processors. Their release is projected for the first half of the next year.
