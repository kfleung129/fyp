    "text": " Cryptocurrency mining is starting to grow in popularity once again, but this time it\u2019s the CPU market that is being affected. Specifically, AMD\u2019s Ryzen 9 7950X is being targeted by cryptocurrency miners in some markets. This has lead to low stock levels in some regions, as this CPU is fairly profitable when it comes for QBIC mining. Right now, the UK market does not appear to be affected by this rising Ryzen 9 CPU demand. This is likely due to the UK\u2019s high cost of electricity when compared to some global regions. Mining demand is highest in places where power is cheap. These are the areas where cryptocurrency mining becomes most profitable, allowing miners to recoup their investments faster. According to profit-mine.com, AMD\u2019s Ryzen 9 7950X CPU can generate $3 in profit per day when mining QBIC. This assumes an electricity cost of $0.1 per KWH. For regions with more expensive power, CPU mining is less profitable or not profitable at all.  QBIC mining is only profitable on AMD\u2019s Zen 4 processors. AMD\u2019s support for AVX-512 with Zen 4 has given their latest CPUs a huge boost in performance when mining this specific cryptocurrency. With AMD\u2019s 7950X CPU offering buyers the most cores/$, it makes sense that miners are targeting this specific CPU model. Thankfully, mining demand for AMD\u2019s Zen 4 CPUs is restricted to global regions where electricity is cheap. Thanks to that we expect AMD\u2019s Zen 4 CPUs to remain on store shelves in the UK, unless mining becomes much more profitable. Now I understand, 7950X is the king in Qubic mining. https://t.co/r8Uo79B6C6 \u2014 MEGAsizeGPU (@Zed__Wang) March 12, 2024  Is a new mining craze starting? Who knows. Bitcoin\u2019s price has risen sharply in recent months, but mining remains largely unprofitable on today\u2019s consumer-grade GPUs. Will that change in the future? Again, who knows? Let\u2019s hope not. I think I speak for most PC enthusiasts when I say that cryptocurrency mining can have a hugely negative impact on the PC market. You can join the discussion on cryptocurrency miners targeting AMD\u2019s Ryzen 9 7950X processor on the OC3D Forums.
