    "text": "The AMD Ryzen 5 PRO 6650HS is a processor for big (workstation) laptops based of the Rembrandt generation. The R5 6650HS integrates six of the eight cores based on the Zen 3+ microarchitecture. They are clocked at 3.3 (guaranteed base clock) to 4.5 GHz (Turbo) and support SMT / Hyperthreading (12 threads). The chip is manufactured on the modern 6 nm TSMC process. The HS variant offers a 10 W reduced TDP and therefore a lower sustained performance than the H version. The 6650HS is the professional version of the consumer R5 6600HS\u00a0with additional management features and the Microsoft Pluton Security processor. \nThe new Zen 3+ is a refresh of the Zen 3 architecture and should not offer a lot of changes. The chip itself however, offers a lot of new features, like support for USB 4 (40 Gbps), PCI-E Gen 4, DDR5-4800MT/s or LPDDR5-6400MT/s, WiFi 6E, Bluetooth LE 5.2, DisplayPort 2, and AV1 decode. \nIn the 6000 series, AMD finally switched to the current RDNA 2 graphics architecture for the iGPU. The 6650HS only offers the slower Radeon 660M with 6 of the 12 CUs enabled and 1.9 GHz max. clock rate. \nPerformance \nWhile we have not tested a single system built around the 6650HS as of August 2023, we have tested at least one system featuring the 6600HS, a chip with very similar specs (6 cores, 12 threads, up to 4.5 GHz, Zen 3+). Based on that, expect the 6650HS to be about as fast as the Ryzen 5 5600H, the Ryzen 7 5800U and also the Core i7-1260P, as far as multi-thread benchmark scores are concerned. \nYour mileage may vary dependingon how high the CPU power limits are and how competent the cooling solution of your system is. \nPower consumption \nThis Ryzen 5 has a default TDP (also known as the long-term power limit) of 35 W. Which is way too high to allow it to become a heart of a passively cooled tablet, laptop, mini-PC. \nThe APU is built with TSMC's 6 nm process for great, as of late 2022, energy efficiency.

The APU is built with TSMC's 6 nm process for great, as of late 2022, energy efficiency. The AMD Ryzen 5 7540U is a fast mid-range laptop processor of the Phoenix series. It offers 6 cores (hexa core) based on the Zen 4 architecture that supports hyperthreading (12 threads). The cores clock from 3.2 (base) up to 4.9 GHz (single core boost). The processor includes 6 MB L2 cache and 16 MB L3 cache. \nThanks to the new Zen 4 architecture and higher clock speeds, the R5 7540U is clearly faster than the old Ryzen 5 6600U (Zen 3, 6 cores, 4.5 GHz). Compared to the similar 7640U, the 7540U offers a lower base clock and a slower iGPU. \nThe chip integrates a modern and fasts RDNA 3 graphics card (iGPU) called Radeon 740M with 4 of the 12 CUs and 2.5 GHz clock speed. Furthermore, the Phoenix series include a video engine with AV1 de- and encoding\u00a0and a dual-channel DDR5-5600 / LPDDR5x-7500 memory controller (with ECC support). The new Xilinx FPGA based\u00a0XDNA AI accelerator\u00a0(Ryzen AI) is not included\u00a0in the 7540U.\u00a0The connectivity features includes 2 possible USB 4 (40 Gbps) ports and 20 PCIe 4.0 lanes for a GPU and SSDs. \nThe Phoenix series uses a single monolithic design (unlike the chiplet design of the 7045HX series) and is manufactured in the modern 4nm process at TSMC.
