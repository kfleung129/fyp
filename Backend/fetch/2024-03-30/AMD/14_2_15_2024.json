Shop on Amazon Shop on Amazon Shop on Amazon If you\u2019re short on time and want to know what the best CPU for RTX 4070 is, we would absolutely choose either the AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D or i9-13900K. Cores: 16 Thread: 32 Boost speed: 5.7 GHz Cache: 144 MB TDP: 120W   The AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D has emerged as the best CPU for the RTX 4070 \u2013 even despite the 14th-generation chips from Intel now on the scene. Boasting an impressive 16 CPU cores and 32 threads, all clocked at an impressive 5.7GHz, the 7950X3D takes the cake with its considerably larger cache size than any other CPU presently available on the market. Although the V-cache on this CPU is a remarkable addition, it comes with its limitations. It is known to be highly sensitive to high voltages and temperatures, requiring a certain degree of restriction to maintain its proper functioning. Fortunately, the Zen 4 version of the X3D CPUs is a game-changer as it features 3D V-cache built only onto one of the two CCDs. As a result, only half of the CPU is subjected to the limitations imposed by the 3D V-cache, providing greater performance efficiency. In terms of gaming, the 7950X3D outperforms the competition by up to 40%, which becomes evident when comparing its performance to that of the 5800X3D. Although this top-tier CPU comes with a substantial price tag, the substantial gains in gaming and computing performance justify the investment. In short, the AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D reigns supreme as the undisputed best CPU for gaming in 2024, showcasing the latest and greatest advancements in technology. Cores 24 Threads 32 Base speed P-cores 3 GHz / E-cores 2.2 GHz Boost speed P-cores 5.8 GHz / E-cores 4.3 GHz Cache 36MB TDP 125 W / 253 W boost. The i9-13900K is still an incredibly powerful CPU that outperforms the competition, boasting 24 cores and 32 threads that excel in both single and multi-core workloads, positioning the 13900K as the leader in multi-threaded performance after a long time. With a TDP of 125 W base and 253 W boost, the 13900K significantly increases the TDP compared to the previous generation\u2019s Alder Lake CPUs, but this translates into a massive jump in performance. The 13th-generation Raptor Lake CPUs deliver up to 15% improved single-core performance and up to 41% improved multi-core performance. The best part is that you don\u2019t need to upgrade your motherboard to access all of this performance, but there are advantages to upgrading. This time, the L2 CPU cache is doubled, which gives the CPU access to larger, faster storage, enabling it to process instructions quickly without developing a backlog that results in slowdowns. The 13900K is incredibly fast, with a boost core speed of up to 5.8 GHz, the fastest core speed currently available. However, all of this performance comes at a cost: the 13900K runs very hotly under heavy load. While it\u2019s unlikely that you\u2019ll reach the same usage and stress levels as we did in our testing, we managed to get the 13900K to throttle up to 13% using a 360mm AIO. Overall, the 13900K is a beast that\u2019s unmatched by any other CPU. With its immense amount of cores and the speeds at which they operate, the 13900K will keep the RTX 4070 continuously fed, making it the ideal partner for the GPU. Cores 12 Threads 24 Base speed 4.7GHz Boost speed 5.6GHz Cache L3 64MB Socket AM5 The Zen 4 architecture includes the 7900X, which AMD has implemented on the new AM5 platform, resulting in a significant performance boost. The AM5 socket supports both DDR5 and PCIe Gen 5, bringing the 7000 series up to speed. The 8-core, 16-thread Ryzen 7900X is capable of remarkable multi-core and single-core performance, thanks to its substantial 5.6 GHz boost clock speed. This time, AMD has doubled the cache to 1MB per core from 512KB, which means more efficient instruction buffering and a reduced chance of the CPU getting stuck in a backlog, causing slowdowns. Unfortunately, the TDP of the 7900X is 170 W at the base core speed and 230 W at the boost speed, which means that the CPU runs much hotter than desired, much like the 13900K. It appears that CPU cooler technology is struggling to keep up with the amount of power packed into the new generation of CPUs. However, this CPU is a gaming powerhouse and has enough cores and threads to handle multithreaded workloads, such as content creation and streaming, making it an ideal high-end AMD CPU to pair with the RTX 4070. AMD hoped that this CPU will be enough to compete with the likes of the 13700K, and it definitely is. Cores 8 Threads 16 Max boost speed 4.5GHz L3 Cache 96MB (64MB 3D V-cache) TDP 105W If you happen to be using an older-gen AMD CPU, which is a possibility according to research, you might want to look into the Ryzen 7 5800X3D. This CPU is a game-changer in terms of engineering, having already dominated the 12th-generation flagship CPUs in terms of pure gaming performance. The Ryzen 7 5800X3D, with its eight multi-threaded cores, is a great choice for gamers, and it\u2019s equipped with an unprecedented 96MB of AMD 3D V-cache. This amount of cache is unmatched by any other CPU, even by the current generation\u2019s flagship CPUs. This CPU\u2019s most distinct feature is its 3D V-Cache, which distinguishes it from every other CPU currently on the market (until the release of Zen 43D). This cache differs from conventional 2D caches in that it\u2019s stacked vertically using innovative 3D printing technology. As a result, more chipsets can be placed within a given area, allowing AMD to achieve a massive 96MB L3 cache with a total access speed of 2TB/s in its 5800X3D CPUs. The 5800X3D has base core speeds of 3.4GHz and a maximum of 4.5GHz, which are even slower than those of its siblings, the 5800X. The reason for this is due to the instability of the 3D V-cache at higher clock speeds, which also explains why overclocking is disabled by default on this CPU. Despite this limitation, the Ryzen 7 5800X3D is an excellent choice for gaming and other intensive tasks. This would be the perfect older-gen pick for the RTX 4070. Boost clock speed (single core) 5.3 GHz Total Cores / Threads 16/24 P-cores 8 E-cores 8 Socket LGA 1700 Overclockable Yes The i9-12900K was once the flagship CPU from Intel, replacing the previous generation\u2019s i9-11900K with a new Alder Lake architecture instead of the Rocket Lake architecture of its predecessor. Unlike the previous CPU release, the i9-12900K has been well-received by reviewers. The i9-12900K has a 125W TDP, higher than the 105W TDP of the AMD 5950X, which means that it can run hot on the CPU die, although not as hot as the i9-13900K. The i9-12900K is only compatible with the LGA1700 socket, which requires a complete motherboard upgrade from the LGA 1200. However, the good news is that this CPU will work with both 600 and 700 series Intel motherboards. The i9-12900K boasts a core count of 16 and 24 threads, making it a great all-around CPU for both gaming and multitasking. With the new Alder Lake architecture, Intel has focused on architectural improvements that improve almost every aspect of the CPU. With these improvements, Intel reclaimed the top spot for gaming performance when it launched \u2013 but it still holds its own today. Furthermore, in workstation and multitasking scenarios, the i9-12900K is almost on par with the AMD 5900X in multi-core performance. Combine this with the better single-core performance and Intel\u2019s impressive overclocking potential, and you have a powerful CPU that pairs well with the RTX 4070.C Cores 14 Threads 20 Base speed P-cores 3.5 GHz / E-cores 2.6 GHz Boost speed P-cores 5.1 GHz / E-cores 3.9 GHz Cache 20MB TDP 125 W / 181 W boost. The Intel i5-13600K is an exceptionally efficient CPU, owing to its 14-core, 20-thread design and clock speed of over 5GHz. It operates at significantly lower temperatures than its larger sibling, the 13900K, which speaks volumes about Intel\u2019s prowess at both the high and low ends of the market. The 13900K is cost-effective, positioned between the 7600X and the 7700X from Team Red. Yet, it outperforms the former and comes close to matching the latter, demonstrating Intel\u2019s formidable position in the market. The 13600K is an ideal choice for the average gamer who desires a CPU upgrade without breaking the bank. It boasts 20 threads that are perfect for multi-core-based workloads, achieving a balance that is uncommon in other CPUs that tend to prioritize either single-core or multi-core performance. The 13600K is a true jack-of-all-trades and a good choice for gamers on a budget. As per our Intel 14th Gen review, we don\u2019t believe the 14th Gen is the best value at the time of writing. Instead, as per every Intel generation, it\u2019s sometimes better to upgrade to the previous generation. The 14th Gen was really more of what Intel calls a \u2018Refresh\u2019, so just like the 13th Gen, is compatible with the LG1700. At the time of writing, we believe the 13th Gen will be the way to go for the RTX 4070. Several factors come into play when looking for a CPU to pair with your RTX 4070. While we can\u2019t cover all of them in detail, we\u2019ll discuss the essential ones that matter the most. One of the most crucial factors that determine a CPU\u2019s power is its core and thread count. In general, a CPU with more cores and threads will be better at multitasking and handling multiple tasks simultaneously. This setup is ideal for content creators and streamers. However, if you\u2019re only a gamer, you might want to focus more on our next factor: core speed. Core speed is the measurement of how fast a CPU core can complete an instruction cycle. This cycle involves three main actions: fetch, decode, and execute. The faster a CPU can complete these actions, the faster it can process information. Clock speed is measured in GHz, which indicates the number of billions of cycles per second. Therefore, a CPU with a clock speed of 5 GHz has a processing power of 5,000,000,000 cycles per second. CPUs with higher clock speeds and more cache capacity are ideal for gaming scenarios. For instance, the new X3D CPU from AMD offers massive cache capacity, compensating for the slight hit to core speed. A CPU cache is a small amount of memory on the processor chip that stores frequently accessed data for faster access. It is important for gaming performance because modern games require a lot of data to be processed by the CPU in real time. The CPU cache acts as a buffer between the CPU and the main system memory, allowing the CPU to access frequently used data more quickly, which can significantly reduce the amount of time spent waiting for data to be retrieved from the slower main memory. More, faster cache reduces slowdowns, and stutters, and increases the overall performance of the CPU in all scenarios, but it mainly benefits gaming workloads. Choosing the best CPU for RTX 4070 requires considering various factors. While core and thread count are crucial for multitasking, core speed is more important for gaming scenarios. With the information discussed here, you can make an informed decision based on your specific needs. Yes, the CPU can indeed affect the performance of the RTX 4070. The CPU and GPU work together in a computer system, and their performance can be interdependent in certain tasks and applications. The CPU handles tasks related to general computing and system operations, while the GPU specializes in graphics rendering and processing. In some scenarios, the CPU may become a bottleneck if it cannot keep up with the demands of the GPU. For example, in gaming, the CPU is responsible for handling game physics, artificial intelligence, and other calculations that go beyond graphics rendering. If the CPU is not powerful enough or lacks sufficient cores/threads, it may struggle to keep up with the GPU\u2019s processing requirements, leading to a CPU bottleneck. This can result in reduced GPU performance, as the GPU may have to wait for the CPU to complete its tasks before it can process and render graphics. Additionally, certain applications, such as video editing or 3D rendering software, rely on both the CPU and GPU for optimal performance. These tasks often require intensive processing from both components. If the CPU is not capable of efficiently feeding data to the GPU or if the CPU\u2019s performance is limited, it can impact the overall performance of the GPU. In summary, while the GPU is primarily responsible for graphics processing, the performance of the CPU can influence the GPU\u2019s performance in certain situations. A balanced system with a powerful CPU and GPU combination is essential to achieve optimal performance in a wide range of tasks and applications.
