Due to Hyperthreading, the four cores can handle up to eight threads in parallel, leading to better utilization of the CPU. Each core offers a base speed of 2.4 GHz, but can dynamically increase clock rates with Turbo Boost up to 3.4 GHz (for 4 active cores), 3.5 GHz (for 2 active cores) and 3.6 GHz (for 1 active core).\u00a0A noteworthy feature is the fast integrated graphics unit (GT3e) with eDRAM memory (128 MB, 77 mm\u00b2, on-package, 102 GB/s).\nHaswell\u00a0is the successor to the Ivy Bridge architecture with improvements on both GPU and CPU performance. The CPUs are produced in 22nm and offer an optimized branch prediction as well as additional execution ports, improving especially the Hyper-Threading performance. Furthermore, new features like AVX2 and FMA should increase the performance in future applications.Due to these changes, the performance per clock has been improved by about 10 percent compared to Ivy Bridge. Therefore, the performance of the i7-4950HQ is similar to the slightly faster clocked\u00a0i7-3840QM\u00a0(Ivy Bridge based).The integrated\u00a0Iris Pro Graphics 5200\u00a0GPU offers 40 Execution Units (EUs) clocked at 200 - 1300 MHz (with Turbo Boost), making it significantly faster than the\u00a0HD 4000\u00a0or\u00a0HD 4600. The additional eDRAM memory further improves performance. As a result, the HD 5200 competes with dedicated mid-range graphics cards.The i7-4950HQ is rated at a\u00a0TDP of 47 W\u00a0including the integrated graphics card, memory controller and VRMs. \u00a0Therefore, the CPU is best suited for laptops 15-inches or greater.

The AMD Ryzen 5 PRO 6650U is a processor for thin and light laptops based of the Rembrandt generation. The Ryzen has six out of a possible eight cores based on the Zen 3+ microarchitecture. They are clocked at 2.9 (guaranteed base clock) to 4.5 GHz (Turbo) and support SMT / Hyperthreading (12 threads). The chip is manufactured on the modern 6 nm TSMC process. The Ryzen 5 PRO 6650U is the professional version of the consumer\u00a0R5 6600U\u00a0with additional management features and the Microsoft Pluton Security processor. Compared to the similar R5 6650H, the 6850U offers a lower base clock speed and a lower TDP. \nThe new Zen 3+ is a refresh of the Zen 3 architecture and should not offer a lot of changes. The chip itself however, offers a lot of new features, like support for USB 4 (40 Gbps), PCI-E Gen 4, DDR5-4800MT/s or LPDDR5-6400MT/s, WiFi 6E, Bluetooth LE 5.2, DisplayPort 2, and AV1 decode. \nPerformance \nThe average 6650U in our database is very close to the Core i7-1260P and the Core i7-10870H, as far as multi-thread benchmark scores are concerned. This is a really good result, as of late 2022. \nThanks to its decent cooling solution and a long-term CPU power limit of 32 W, the ThinkPad T16 G1 is among the fastest laptops built around the 6650U that we know of. It can be about 20% faster in CPU-bound workloads than the slowest system featuring the same chip in our database, as of August 2023. \nIn the 6000 series, AMD finally switched to the current RDNA 2 graphics architecture for the iGPU. The 6650U only offers the small\u00a0Radeon 660M\u00a0with 6 of the 12 CUs enabled and 1.9 GHz max. clock rate. \nThe TDP of the APU is specified at 15 - 28 Watts (default). The power efficiency should be very good, thanks to the improved 6nm process and additional power saving features in the 6000 series.
