    "text": "Get All the Market Moving News, Squawk, and Mentorship NOW Get All the Market Moving News, Squawk, and Mentorship NOW Advanced Micro Devices Inc\u00a0AMD, alongside\u00a0Intel Corp\u00a0INTC, controls the x86 chip standard, pivotal in the\u00a0global semiconductor market. This dominance is challenged by China\u2019s strategic pivot towards the open-source RISC-V architecture, revealed through a patent by a Beijing-based military institute. RISC-V\u2019s design for cloud computing and smart cars indicates China\u2019s intent to circumvent U.S. sanctions and reduce dependency on Western chip technologies, including AMD\u2019s x86 and Britain\u2019s\u00a0Arm Holdings Plc\u00a0ARM architecture, Reuters reports. Analysts hail AMD as the most significant AI technology beneficiary after\u00a0Nvidia Corp\u00a0NVDA. The stocks saw some profit booking last month as fund managers sought\u00a0better price points. Despite existing U.S. and U.K. export controls limiting the sale of advanced x86 and Arm designs to China, the inclusive nature of RISC-V positions it as a geopolitically neutral alternative, potentially reshaping chip manufacturing and application. In contrast with the proprietary and complex nature of x86 and Arm, RISC-V\u2019s simplicity and flexibility offer a path towards more energy-efficient and customizable chip solutions. Despite the current dominance of x86 and Arm, China\u2019s push for RISC-V adoption, backed by significant patent filings and the development of high-performance chips and operating systems, suggests a potential shift in the balance of chip technology power. This shift could influence AMD\u2019s market position, as RISC-V\u2019s growth challenges the established architectures and opens new avenues for chip innovation and application. Price Actions:\u00a0AMD shares closed higher by 4.21% at $177.65 on Friday.
