    "text": "The release of Cyberpunk Phantom Liberty introduced Ray Reconstruction to all GeForce RTX GPUs. We\u2019ve already covered the whys and hows of DLSS 3.5. Ray Reconstruction in DLSS 3.5 has been trained to recognize various ray-traced effects, including shadows, reflections, and ambient lighting, and further enhance them. Let\u2019s have a look at how DLSS 3.5 improves image quality in Cyberpunk Phantom Liberty. One of the most obvious improvements comes in the form of clearer, anti-aliased reflections that retain more detail through the upscaling process. In the below close-up, you can see the reflection of the vegetation on the left is less blurry, with more defined boundaries for every other reflection in the scene as well. In this particular example, we see how some of the reflection details that are lost with DLSS 2 are retained with DLSS 3.5. Note the reflection near the top, close to the pavement. DLSS 2 and FSR 2 almost completely miss the dividing bars, while DLSS 3.5 retains it with proper clarity. In this close-up, the reflection from the upper floor of the building is better rendered with DLSS 3.5, while DLSS 2 and FSR 2 completely miss it. The existing upscalers produce fuzzy reflections, a side-effect of temporal upscaling. Continue to the next page for more DLSS 3.5 comparisons and close-ups\u2026 "
