    "text": "Please note that this post is tagged as a rumor. Chinese sources claim that AMD is rethinking its strategy for the RX 7600 XT launch.  We frequently discuss cards that are exclusively available in China or designed specifically for this region. Interestingly, there are also cards that will initially be unavailable in China. On the official launch day, the Radeon RX 7600 XT graphics card won\u2019t debut in all regions. The availability of the Radeon RX 6750 GRE (Golden Rabbit Edition) cards, exclusively found in China, has led AMD to reconsider and delay the plans to introduce the RX 7600 XT in the country. This doesn\u2019t mean the card will not launch in China, but rather that it will not be available at the same time as in other regions. The RX 7600 XT, rumored to have 16GB of memory, is expected to enter the market close to the $300 price point, directly competing with the RX 6750 GRE 12GB and RX 6750 GRE 10GB positioned at $289 and $269, respectively. Although AMD has not officially confirmed the final price for the new RDNA3 GPU, it\u2019s well-known that this market segment is very competitive. Introducing another model in this range could potentially impact the sales of RDNA2 models that AMD is currently trying to phase out. Insiders also mentioned that the Radeon RX 7600 XT 16GB will currently not be available for sale in China. This is mainly because, at the present stage, the most cost-effective product in the AMD China market is the Radeon RX 6750 GRE. Therefore, the decision has been made to temporarily delay the introduction of the 7600 XT 16GB in the Chinese market. As for the final release date of the Radeon RX 7600 XT 16GB, it remains uncertain. \u2014 Benchlife (translation) The RX 6750 GRE is recognized as one of the most cost-effective GPUs in the Chinese market. While its feature set and memory capacity align with the GeForce RTX 4060 series, the RDNA2 series requires more power. But for gamers in the mid-range GPU segment, the power efficiency and ray tracing performance of the RX 6750 GRE series might not pose concerns. Initial plans indicated that the Radeon RX 7600 XT would launch in the fourth week of January. However, due to the delay in the Chinese release, Benchlife now expresses uncertainty regarding whether this date might be subject to change. We will keep an eye on the rumors and provide an update as soon as new information is available. Source: Benchlife We may earn an affiliate commission through Amazon and Newegg links.
