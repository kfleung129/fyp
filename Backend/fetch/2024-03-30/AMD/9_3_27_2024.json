It was revealed in June 2014 for notebooks and is manufactured by GlobalFoundries using a 28 nm SHP process. In addition to having two CPU modules for a total of four integer cores clocked at 2.4 - 3.3 GHz, the AMD chip also integrates a Radeon R5 GPU clocked at up to 626 MHz with 256 GCN shaders and a dual-channel DDR3-1866 memory controller.\nArchitecture\u00a0\nKaveri is the successor to the 2013 Richland architecture (e.g.\u00a0A10-5750M). The revised CPU cores, codenamed Steamroller, represent the third generation of the module-based Bulldozer design. A number of major changes include modified decoders (now one per integer core), optimized branch prediction, and increased L1 I-cache from 64 KB to 96 KB per module. These revisions boost the performance per clock slightly over a similarly clocked Richland APU. For more details about the AMD Kaveri architecture, see our detailed analysis here:\nAnalysis of the AMD Kaveri Notebook Platform\nPerformance\u00a0\nAccording to the clock rates, the A8-7200P should offer a CPU performance level similar to the Sandy Bridge-based Intel\u00a0Core i3-2310M\u00a0or\u00a02330M.

Since the GPU is based on AMD's GCN 1.1 architecture, both DirectX 11.2 \"Tier 2\" and Mantle are supported. Furthermore, the GPU can be used for general purpose computing in various applications, such as Adobe Photoshop via the OpenCL API.\u00a0\nIn terms of 3D performance, the GPU benefits from its DDR3-1866 memory support.

As a result, the A8-7200P is best suited for 14-inch notebooks or larger. The quad-core\u00a0AMD A8-7200P\u00a0is a mid-range processor based on the Kaveri architecture.

The\u00a0Intel Core i7-7700T\u00a0is a fast quad-core processor for desktops based on the Kaby Lake architecture and was announced in January 2017. It is the top model of the 35 Watt models and significantly slower than the similar named Core i7-7700K. The four Skylake based CPU cores are clocked from 2.9 - 3.8 GHz and support HyperThreading / SMT (8 threads).\nArchitecture\nIntel basically uses the same micro architecture compared to Skylake, so the per-MHz performance does not differ. The manufacturer only reworked the Speed Shift technology for faster dynamic adjustments of voltages and clocks, and the improved 14nm process allows much higher frequencies combined with better efficiency than before.\nPerformance\nThe performance of the i7-7700T is slightly faster than the Core i5-7600K with sufficient cooling and TDP settings. Therefore, the CPU is fine to handle even demanding tasks and apps.\nGraphics\nThe integrated Intel HD Graphics 630 has 24 Execution Units (similar to previous HD Graphics 530) running at 350 - 1150 MHz. The performance depends a lot on the memory configuration; it should be comparable to a dedicated\u00a0Nvidia GeForce 920M\u00a0in combination with fast DDR4-2133 dual-channel memory.\nContrary to Skylake, Kaby Lake now supports hardware decoding for H.265/HEVC Main 10 with a 10-bit color depth as well as Google's VP9 codec. The dual-core Kaby Lake processors, which were announced in January, should also support HDCP 2.2.

The Intel\u00a0Pentium Gold 4425Y\u00a0is a low power entry level processor for small laptops or tablets and based on the Kaby Lake architecture. It was announced in Q1 2019 and offers two processor cores clocked at 1.7 GHz (no Turbo Boost). Thanks to Hyper Threading, the processor can execute up to four threads simultaneously. The chips also includes the Intel HD Graphics 615 GPU, a dual-channel memory controller (DDR3L/LPDDR3) as well as VP9 and H.265 video de- and encoder. It is still produced in a 14 nm process with FinFET transistors. Compared to the much faster Core m3-7Y30, the Pentium 4425 offers no Turbo Boost, different CPU and GPU clock speeds, a smaller L3 cache and a higher TDP of 6 Watt. Compared to the predecessor Pentium Gold 4415Y from 2017, the Pentium Gold 4425Y is clocked 100 MHz higher (the CPU cores). \nArchitecture \nIntel basically used the familiar micro architecture from the Skylake generation, so the per-MHz performance is identical. Only the Speed-Shift technology for faster dynamic adjustments of the voltages and clocks was improved, and the matured 14 nm process now also enables much higher frequencies and better efficiency than before.\u00a0 \nPerformance \nDue to the missing Turbo Boost, the Pentium 4425Y offers a significantly worse single thread performance than the more expensive Core m3-7Y30. This should be noticeable in daily tasks. Compared to older CPUs, the Pentium Gold should match a Core i3-4100U (100 MHz higher clock speed but older architecture). \nGraphics \nThe integrated Intel HD Graphics 615 GPU has 24 Execution Units (EUs) like the old\u00a0HD Graphics 515\u00a0and runs with clocks between 300 and 850 MHz in combination with this processor. The performance heavily depends on the TDP limit as well as the memory configuration; with fast LPDDR3-1866 RAM in dual-channel mode, the GPU should sometimes be able to compete with the\u00a0HD Graphics 520, but can also be much slower in other scenarios. Modern games from 2016 will, if at all, only run smoothly in the lowest settings. \nContrary to Skylake, Kaby Lake now also supports hardware decoding for H.265/HEVC Main10 with a 10-bit color depth as well as Google's VP9 codec. \nPower Consumption \nThe chip is manufactured in an improved 14 nm process with FinFET transistors, so the power efficiency was once again improved significantly. The TDP is rated at 6 Watt and can be reduced to 4,5 Watt (cTDP down).
