    "text": "AMD Fluid Motion Frames (AFMF), the equivalent of DLSS 3 for NVIDIA graphics cards, has moved out of technical preview status and is now available with the release of Adrenalin Edition 24.1.1 drivers for all AMD Radeon 700M, RX 6000, and RX 7000 desktop and notebook GPU series. It's here! If you haven't tried it yet, you're missing out on huge frame rate gains across thousands of games:AMD Fluid Motion Frames (AFMF) \u2013 Boost FPS up to 97% for a smoother gaming experience by adding frame generation technology to any DirectX\u00ae 11 and 12 game.\u2026 \u2014 Frank Azor (@AzorFrank) January 23, 2024  According to the developer, AMD Fluid Motion Frames works with any DX11/DX12 game (no separate game support is required, as in the case of DLLS 3) and provides a frame rate increase of up to 97% in 1080p and up to 103% in 1440p. The technology currently works only in full-screen mode with VSYNC deactivated and automatically turns off in fast-paced scenes (as users have already complained about in responses to Frank Azor\u2019s tweet). AMD warns that using AFMF can create additional latency and thus is not the best option for fast multiplayer games. The company also recommends using AFMF in conjunction with another technology, AMD Radeon Anti-Lag, which will help reduce latency and maintain the minimum frame rate at 60 fps.
