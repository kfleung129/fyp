We are here to ensure you get the best graphics card for running this latest early-access game based on your budget and requirements. Nightingale is a PVE open-world survival crafting game that you can play solo or with friends. The game is available as an Early Access PC-exclusive launch with plans of Steam Deck compatibility and partial controller support. And the publisher hasn\u2019t shared plans to release the game on consoles, which may change in the future. Either way, we are here to simply show you our picks for both Nvidia and AMD cards for running Nightingale, which we have carefully selected after intricate testing. We also didn\u2019t forget about the Nightingale system requirements, which are listed below, and you will see that it cannot be considered demanding from any angle. That said, we always try to suggest a balanced recommendation \u2013 A GPU that won\u2019t put a dent in your wallet but will deliver superb performance for the game in question and the upcoming releases. Shop on Amazon Shop on Amazon Shop on Amazon So, let\u2019s check out our picks for the best GPU for Nightingale, which includes both Nvidia and AMD graphics. While some players prefer either Nvidia or AMD, we don\u2019t differentiate. We also tried our best to make the list as elaborate as possible, with a GPU choice for each significant resolution, so that you never run out of options.\u00a0Among the three listed GPUs, our best pick is the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Ti Super, which is one of the best GPUs Nvidia has launched in recent times, with more than enough horsepower to run any recent games, including Nightingale in 4K resolution at highest settings. Core clock speed 2,670MHz boost, 2,340MHz base CUDA count 8,448 Memory 16GB GDDR6X Dimensions 336 x 150 x 63 mm ( 13.22 x 5.9 x 2.48 inch) PSU required 750W TBP 285W The first pick on the list is the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Ti Super, and we are going heavy with this recommendation as you need a powerful GPU to run Nightingale at 4K resolution at the highest possible resolution. So, there should be no compromises. The RTX 4070 Ti Super is also one of the Nvidia GPUs we recently had the pleasure of reviewing, and it didn\u2019t disappoint. In fact, the card performed exceedingly well, equipped with 16GB or GDDR6X VRAM.\u00a0Hence, we find the GeForce RTX 4070 Ti Super suitable for running Nightingale at 4K. However, we are not suggesting purchasing this excellent GPU with an enormous price tag just for playing Nightingale.\u00a0Getting a good GPU isn\u2019t just about the game in front of you. It\u2019s also about the games that are about to be released. And you wouldn\u2019t want to invent a graphics card that ran Nightingale well, exceeding your expectations but struggling with the newer releases. Clock Speed (Base/Boost) 2110MHz/ 2360MHz VRAM 16GB GDDR6 Ports HDMI x 1 DP x 2 USB Type C x 1 The second pick for playing Nightingale is the AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT: for running the game at 1440p comfortably.\u00a0The Radeon RX 6800 XT is an exceptional card. Although you won\u2019t get Nvidia features like DLSS 3.0, you will get 16GB VRAM and RDNA 2.0 architecture.\u00a0The card is even capable of running Nightingale in 4K resolution. However, you won\u2019t be able to run the game at the highest settings, but at slightly lower settings, you will get good framerates. Clock Speed 1890MHz Boost Clock (OC) VRAM 8GB GDDR6 Thermal Design Axial-tech Triple Fan The last pick for this list is the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Ti for running Nightingale at 1080p resolution with buttery smooth performance.\u00a0The RTX 3060 Ti is not the best and brightest Nvidia has to offer. But there\u2019s no need for one to begin with. You need a reliable card with a history of good performance, capable of delivering an excellent Nightingale playing experience at 1080p resolution.\u00a0While you will also be sacrificing the latest Nvidia techs, such as DLSS 3.0, you will have 8GB GDDR6 video memory at a considerably pocket-friendly price. You can also try running the game 1440p with this card, and it will do an okay job, but we wouldn\u2019t recommend it. So, this is the official recommended system requirements for Nightingale, coming from the publisher\u2019s page. As we have mentioned earlier, Nightingale isn\u2019t a demanding game, and the system specs don\u2019t say otherwise. But you need to remember these specs will only run the game at 1080p, barely touching the 60FPS landmark. There\u2019s also a minimum requirement, but we suggest ignoring it. There you have it! The best selection of graphics cards to play Nightingale with excellent framerates. While the publisher recommended an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 Super or an AMD Radeon RX 5700XT is enough for this game, we suggest otherwise. The publisher\u2019s recommendation will take you as far as 1080p, barely crossing the 60FPS mark, but we know better. Hence, we have created this comprehensive list of the best GPUs for Nightingale.
