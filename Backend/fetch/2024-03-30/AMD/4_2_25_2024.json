    "text": "Stock Analysis Insiders who bought Arrow Minerals Limited (ASX:AMD) in the last 12 months may probably not pay attention to the stock's recent 33% drop.  Reason being, despite the recent loss, insiders original purchase value of AU$572.9k is now worth AU$1.82m. While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing,  we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. Check out our latest analysis for Arrow Minerals In fact, the recent purchase by David Flanagan was the biggest purchase of Arrow Minerals shares made by an insider individual in the last twelve months, according to our records.    We do like to see buying, but this purchase was made at well below the current price of AU$0.004.  While it does suggest insiders consider the stock undervalued at lower prices, this transaction doesn't tell us much about what they think of current prices. In the last twelve months Arrow Minerals insiders were buying shares, but not selling.    The average buy price was around AU$0.0013.    It is certainly positive to see that insiders have invested their own money in the company.  However, we do note that they were buying at significantly lower prices than today's share price.

I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company.   From looking at our data, insiders own AU$819k worth of Arrow Minerals stock, about 3.1% of the company.   We do note, however, it is possible insiders have an indirect interest through a private company or other corporate structure.   I generally like to see higher levels of ownership. It is good to see recent purchasing.    We also take confidence from the longer term picture of insider transactions.   But on the other hand, the company made a loss during the last year, which makes us a little cautious.
