The benefits of next-gen AMD 3D V-cache technology give you low latency and even more game performance.\u201d We earn a commission if you make a purchase, at no additional cost to you. AMD Ryzen 9 7900X3D is currently its lowest price yet, costing you \u00a3447. Although Amazon UK lists this as a 44% discount, we haven\u2019t seen it exceed the \u00a3600 mark in months. Prices for the chip fluctuate wildly, but it\u2019s realistically around 10% off its average. Still, it is definitively its best price ever and amps up the value tremendously. Residents across the Atlantic can nab 23% off the same processor, bringing it down to $463.23. This is a stone\u2019s throw from the lowest we\u2019ve seen on Amazon US, and we rarely see it reduced at all. This is the second in AMD\u2019s current generation to debut with 3D V-cache. Essentially, this doubles the L3 cache to 128MB, offering the most on any consumer processor. What that means for you is much better gaming, going toe-to-toe with the best CPUs that are usually in a different weight class. Under the hood, you also get 12 cores, 24 threads, and a 5.6GHz boost clock. Grabbing one at a discount means you sidestep the premium 3D V-cache usually brings with it. Buy one sooner rather than later, and AMD will even throw in a free copy of Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora. It\u2019s a lot like Ubisoft\u2019s other games, particularly Far Cry, but a bit more refined. If these are too rich for your blood, AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D is a smidge over its best price, reduced to \u00a3269.49. Once again, ignore the -49% tag on this one as it hasn\u2019t been full price over the past two years. It\u2019s probably closer to 12% off. US folks can also get one for $315, chopping 30% off the overall price tag. Ryzen 7 5800X3D is one of the cheapest ways to get 3D V-cache, being from the previous generation. It was the very first to include 3D V-cache. That doesn\u2019t slow it down, though, as its 100MB L3 cache will easily carry you through modern games. Plus, the last time we saw it reduced so low was six months ago, so you\u2019d do well to grab one while you can. AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D \u201cThe first-generation AMD 3D V-cache CPU, designed to lower latency and amp up your gaming so you can enjoy more frames than ever before.\u201d We earn a commission if you make a purchase, at no additional cost to you.
