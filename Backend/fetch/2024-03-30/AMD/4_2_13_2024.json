    "text": "At the beginning of February, we reported on the results obtained by a Ryzen 7 5700X3D. However, the results were surprising, to say the least, since they put the CPU on a par with a Core i5 13600KF. Techspot has a radically different view, with its review of the processor! As a reminder, the Ryzen 7 5700X3D is a brand-new processor based on AMD\u2019s AM4 platform. It features a total of eight hyperthreaded cores running at 4.1 GHz boost. However, it is distinguished by the presence of 3D V-Cache memory, with a total of 96 MB of L3 cache. In layman\u2019s terms, we\u2019re dealing here with a \u201clittle\u201d 5800X3D, since the only difference between the two is the lower boost frequencies on the 5700X3D side. Finally, how does it behave? Techspot put the CPU through its paces and compared it to other models on a total of 10 games. Clearly, we\u2019re a long way from the 13600K(F), which is 8.33% faster on average over the 10 games. In actual fact, this new 5700X3D, while seriously distinguishing itself from the 5700X thanks to its 3D V-Cache, is positioned between the Ryzen 7 8700G and Ryzen 5 7600X. But let\u2019s not get carried away: this model has the advantage of an affordable price. In fact, it currently retails for less than \u20ac275 on Amazon. This makes it the most affordable Ryzen X3D in AMD\u2019s catalog, and an interesting upgrade option for those on a tight budget, even if the 5800X3D will take you a little further for a few euros more.
