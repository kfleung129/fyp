Get an AMD Ryzen 7 CPU & MSI motherboard for $419.99 If you were looking for a reason to upgrade your PC, look no further than this bundle deal on an AMD Ryzen 7 CPU and an MSI motherboard. This bundle deal includes the AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D CPU and the MSI B550 Gaming Plus motherboard. Now in terms of the CPU, this was at one point one of the fastest if not the fastest gaming CPUs on the market. This was back in 2022 of course when the CPU was a new release. Things have changed a little since then, obviously. But this is still a darn good gaming CPU and it\u2019s a big upgrade if you\u2019re working with something older. Now the typical price for this bundle is about $479.99. So with the price coming down to $419.99 you\u2019re saving $50 on the total between the two items. Worth noting is that the CPU alone has a full retail price of $459. So this bundle is a pretty great deal. In terms of the motherboard, you\u2019re looking at plenty of room for your other components. With two M.2 slots for your NVMe SSD storage, four slots for RAM, 6 SATA ports, and some other useful features like an extended heatsink.Advertisement\n\n\nAdvertisement As far as the processor goes, it has support for PCIe 4.0 and has a max clock speed of 4.5GHz and a base clock of 3.4GHz. It has less cores and a lower thread count than some comparable chips both from Intel and AMD. So if you\u2019re looking for something that provides faster performance in a multitude of single and multi-threaded apps, this might not be the CPU you\u2019re looking for. If, however, what you\u2019re concerned with is mostly gaming, this is an excellent CPU to game with. Buy At Amazon Copyright \u00a92024 Android Headlines. All Rights Reserved.
