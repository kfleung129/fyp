    "text": "AMD launched several desktop parts at CES 2024, such as the Ryzen 8000G series APUs and a few goodies for the AM4 platform, shortly after debuting the Ryzen 8000HS and U processors for laptops. AMD also stealth launched a new Ryzen 7000 HX part, the Ryzen 9 7940HX. It showed up alongside the TUF Gaming A16, one of Asus' newly-announced mid-range gaming laptops ($950 on Amazon). As predicted earlier, the Ryzen 9 7940HX is essentially a Ryzen 9 7945HX with lower clocks (5.2 GHz boost vs 5.4 GHz). Everything else, such as its core/thread count and cache, is identical across both SKUs. Interestingly, the Ryzen 9 7940HX is nowhere to be found on AMD's official website, so there's no way to confirm its full specs for now. An earlier rumour stated the Ryzen 9 7840HX would accompany the Ryzen 9 7940HX, but it has yet to show up anywhere. It, too, was supposed to launch as an underclocked Ryzen 9 7845HX variant. Nevertheless, these don't appear to be China-only SKUs as they've been listed on Asus' US website. Asus via @9550Pro on X, Videocardz "
