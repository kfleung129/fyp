Let\u2019s get into the details. It starts with the Gigabyte B650 Aorus Elite AX V2 which is available for just $199.99 (was $230) for a $30 saving. This is then compounded with the AMD Ryzen 5 7600X for only $229 (was $299) for $70 off. Then you factor in Crucial Pro Overclocking 32GB DDR5 RAM for a mere $92.99 (was $160) for $67 off with the ASUS ROG Strix 850W being $10 off. That\u2019s an initial saving of $177 before factoring in the further combo deals which add up to a staggering $267 off taken as a whole. That\u2019s because there\u2019s an extra $10 off the Crucial Pro Overclocking DDR5 RAM, $20 off the Samsung 990 Pro 2TB, $10 off the ASUS ROG Strix 850W, and $10 off the Corsair iCUE Link H150i RGB AIO. All together you\u2019re looking at a total combo up saving of $90 for a total of $1,031.45 when taking the entire build on as a whole. Check out the full bundle for total combo savings.

Speaking to the motherboard, which includes a Gen 5 SSD port as well as two Gen 4 SSD ports for fast storage as well as a solid rear I/O packed with USB 3 ports, USB-C ports, and fast ethernet, all for under the $200 mark. Then we get onto the Samsung 990 Pro which is among the best SSDs for gaming, especially with its discounted price tag. It caps out at the end of what Gen 4 NVMe SSDs can do with performance pushing above 7,000MB/s read and write respectively. Once you install your OS on it, you\u2019ll enjoy lightning-fast boot times, with enough storage for many high-end PC games. While there\u2019s no GPU included in this bundle, you\u2019ll be well-equipped to slot one with all this gear setting you up for success all over just over the $1,000 mark. There\u2019s a leading AMD motherboard, solid mainstream chipset, fast RAM, excellent AIO, and powerful 850W so you shouldn\u2019t have to worry about future upgrades any time soon.
