    "text": " AMD are gearing up to launch next-generation APUs, with Kraken Point being set to succeed Hawk Point with Zen 5/Zen5c CPU cores and RDNA 3.5 graphics. While it will not be AMD\u2019s fastest next-generation mobile CPU, it will feature all of AMD\u2019s latest architectural enhancements with Zen 5 based CPU cores, RDNA 3.5 graphics, and an XDNA 2 AI processor. With Kraken Point, AMD will be delivering users a premium hybrid CPU for the first time. This processor will reportedly feature four Zen 5 CPU cores and four Zen 5c CPU cores. The CPU will also feature 4 RDNA 3.5 WGPs. This information comes from Everest on Twitter/X. These specifications gives this new APU the same number of GPU compute units as Valve\u2019s Steam Deck, but with AMD\u2019s newer RDNA 3.5 graphics architecture. This should allow this APU to deliver respectable levels of gaming performance. 4 WGP https://t.co/bCXt9hTzh9 \u2014 Everest (@Olrak29_) January 26, 2024  On the higher-end of AMD\u2019s Zen 5 APU product stack the company has their Strix Point and Strix Halo products.
