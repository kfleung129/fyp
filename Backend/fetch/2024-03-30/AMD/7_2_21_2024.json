    "text": "The Wormhole team hopes to minimize trust assumptions in its protocol through zero-knowledge proofs Wormhole and Adobe Stock modified by Blockworks share AMD, one of the world\u2019s biggest semiconductor makers, is providing Wormhole with hardware and advice as the interoperability app seeks to grow its zero-knowledge infrastructure. Wormhole announced the partnership Monday in a blog post. It previously said the AMD hardware accelerators would be sourced for Wormhole contributors, and Wormhole will develop \u201clight-client\u201d integrations that run zk proofs with fewer resources. Wormhole is a protocol for moving assets across more than 30 different blockchains. Last fall, investors valued Wormhole at $2.5 billion in its eye-popping $225 million fundraise.

In a Jan. 31 blog post, Wormhole said it hoped to decentralize its verification layer with zk technology. Zk proofs allow the contents of a message to be proven true without revealing the message\u2019s contents. In the context of Wormhole, this could take the form of verifying the amount of crypto moving from one wallet to another without revealing details about the transaction itself. However, zk proofs are highly energy intensive. In a blog post, AMD director of product Hamid Salehi said the firm\u2019s FPGA semiconductors could help Wormhole scale its zero-knowledge infrastructure. It would do so through parallelization, whereby computing processes are carried out simultaneously instead of one by one. Omer Shlomovits, founder of the zk hardware startup Ingonyama, said in a Telegram message that the FPGA accelerator cards being added to Wormhole \u2014\u00a0U55C and U250 \u2014\u00a0are well-suited for scaling zk applications cost effectively.

AMD is among the ten largest chip companies, boasting roughly $265 billion in market capitalization. Its stock price has more than doubled in the past year, buoyed lately by its push into AI.

Hivemapper\u2019s token model catalyzes both a cost and product advantage via unmatched map freshness and near real-time accuracy, which is its wedge into a market characterized by stale data and high data collection costs. Its current and potential future product suite may represent one of the strongest possibilities for PMF in crypto today. by Ryan Connor /  Breaking headlines across our core coverage categories.
