    "text": "The HX200G has arrived as part of MINISFORUM's CES 2024 showcase. While the company has not revealed full device details yet, it has provided an overview both to the likes of GDM in Japan and on Twitter. For example, the MINISFORUM HX200G is said to support PCIe 5.0 SSDs thanks to its AMD Ryzen 9 7945HX APU. As a refresher, the Ryzen 9 7945HX arrived almost a year ago as the mid-tier option in AMD's Dragon Range-HX series. Based around 16 cores, the\u00a0Ryzen 9 7945HX\u00a0also has a 55 W TDP and is derived from the desktop-class Ryzen 9 7950X. Additionally, the MINISFORUM HX200G will combine its high-end APU with the Radeon RX 7600M XT, an RDNA 3 discrete GPU that features 32 Compute Units (CUs) and 8 GB of GDDR6 VRAM. Supposedly, MINISFORUM has included a 'dual-liquid metal cooling system' to keep both components in check, with quoted 45 dBA fan speeds even when pulling 85 W from the system's CPU and 120 W from its GPU. Incidentally, the HX200G is not the only new device that MINISFORUM has shown at this year's CES. Also, the company has previewed the UH185 Ultra, an Intel Meteor Lake-H option that has a few other tricks up its sleeve beyond its Core Ultra 9 185H processor. Please see our MINISFORUM UH185 Ultra launch article for more details. Purchase the MINISFORUM Neptune HX99G on Amazon MINISFORUM via GDM & VideoCardz "
