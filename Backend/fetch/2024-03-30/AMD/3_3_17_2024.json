    "text": "NoypiGeeks Philippines' Technology News and Reviews Intel continues to dominate the PC processor market, holding a significant lead over its competitors AMD and Apple. According to a recent report by Canalys, a firm specializing in PC industry research, Intel commands 78% of the market share for PC CPUs. This figure excludes tablet processors, which could have slightly increased Apple\u2019s contribution, as well as that of Qualcomm. In terms of specific market share, AMD holds 13%, while Apple\u2019s proprietary silicon represents approximately 8%. The remaining share is split among other players like MediaTek, Qualcomm, and ARM. In 2023, Intel experienced a 3% increase in CPU shipments, contributing to a total annual PC shipment revenue of $40 billion, an increase of 2% from the previous year. On the other hand, AMD suffered a 1% decrease in shipments but still managed a 6% growth in revenue, reaching $8 billion. Apple also saw significant financial success with an 8% growth in its final quarter revenue of 2023, totaling $8 billion. Looking at the distribution of AMD-based computers, Lenovo leads with 40% of all units, followed by HP at 23%, and Dell at 3%. ASUS also had a notable presence with 14%. These figures underline the prevalence of these manufacturers in the laptop market, although finding laptops powered by AMD chips can sometimes be more challenging. Despite facing its largest financial loss ever in 2023, including a 133% drop in earnings per share and a 36% drop in year-over-year revenue, Intel appears to remain strong based on Canalys\u2019 report.
