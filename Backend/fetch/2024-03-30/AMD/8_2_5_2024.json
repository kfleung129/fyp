    "text": "AMD had a fruitful 2023, expanding its revenue and market cap to new heights. Team Red is the sixth largest chipmaker (by market cap), behind ASML, Samsung, Broadcom, TSMC, and NVIDIA. The data center (Epyc and Instinct) was the primary driving factor behind its growth last (and probably this) year. In the client segment, the Ryzen 7000 CPUs contributed to a massive 62% increase in revenue YoY, totaling $1.5 billion in Q4 2023. The gaming segment was down 17% due to lower semi-custom revenue (consoles, including the PS5 and XSX), partially offset by higher Radeon GPU sales. Yes, that\u2019s right, the Radeon RX 6000 and RX 7000 graphics cards are selling well. AMD CEO Dr. Lisa Su revealed that the Gaming Revenue grew year-over-year and sequentially, driven by \u201cstrong demand in the channel for both the Radeon RX 6000 and RX 7000 GPUs.\u201d No details were provided on which SKUs drove the most sales, but we have enough data to make an educated guess. Mindfactory sales figures from Germany indicate that the Radeon RX 7800 XT has been a hot seller for several months. The same can be observed (on a smaller scale) at Newegg and Microcenter. In addition to the RX 7800 XT, the Radeon RX 6600/6600 XT, RX 6800 XT, and RX 7900 XTX are also among the bestsellers (and have been for some time now). AMD may fall short at the high end, but it has some decent options in the midrange and upper midrange segments. We expect a similar run with RDNA 4. There won\u2019t be a Radeon rival to the RTX 5090, but the RTX 5070 and 5070 Ti will have their work cut out for them. "
