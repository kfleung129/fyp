    "text": "The AMD Radeon R9 390X is a high end desktop graphics card that was announced in summer 2015. It is based on the same chip (Hawaii, now called Grenada) as the predecessor the Radeon R9 290X with slightly increased clock rates. AMD specifies the R9 390X with a core clock of 1050 MHz and memory clock rate of 6000 MHz (effective) for the GDDR5. However, most third party vendors are using slightly higher clock rates.\u00a0 \nThe chip is based on the second generation of the GCN architecture (also called GCN 1.1) and supports DirectX 12 with Feature Level 12_0. It offers 2816 shaders, 176 TMUs, 64 ROPs and a 512 Bit GDDR5 memory system. \nThe similar named AMD Radeon R9 M390X for laptops is a lot slower as its based on the smaller Tonga chip with 2048 shaders and slower clock rates. \nThe performance is depending on the game but on average it is similar to a desktop GeForce GTX 980 (or notebook version, that is similar). Compared to the older R9 290X it is only minimally faster due to the slightly increased clock rates. \nWith a TDP of 275 Watt, the R9 390X is a relatively power hungry card and cant compete with the efficiency of the Nvidia counterpart.

The following benchmarks stem from our benchmarks of review laptops. The performance depends on the used graphics memory, clock rate, processor, system settings, drivers, and operating systems. So the results don't have to be representative for all laptops with this GPU. For detailed information on the benchmark results, click on the fps number.
