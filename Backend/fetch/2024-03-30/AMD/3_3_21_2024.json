    "text": "The AMD Radeon R9 380 is a desktop graphics card of the performance class that was introduced in mid 2015. It is based on the 28 nm Tonga GPU with 1792 activated shaders (of the 2048) and a 256 Bit GDDR5 memory interface (5700 MHz effective resulting in 182.4 GB/s). The card integrates 112 TMUs and 28 ROPs and supports DirectX 12 (Feature Level 12_0). \nThe R9 380 competes with the desktop GeForce GTX 960 and in our benchmark tests it was able to pull slightly ahead on average but stay behind the older Radeon R9 280X. Therefore, demanding games of 2015 should be playable in maximum detail settings and full HD resolution. See below for a list of tested games. \nThe power consumption is rated at 190 Watt (TDP) and is on average clearly higher than the GTX 960. Compared to the only slightly faster 280X however, the 280 is very efficient. The AMD Radeon R9 380 is a desktop graphics card of the performance class that was introduced in mid 2015.

The following benchmarks stem from our benchmarks of review laptops. The performance depends on the used graphics memory, clock rate, processor, system settings, drivers, and operating systems. So the results don't have to be representative for all laptops with this GPU. For detailed information on the benchmark results, click on the fps number.
