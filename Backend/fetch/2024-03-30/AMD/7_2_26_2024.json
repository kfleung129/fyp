    "text": "Released last year exclusively for the China market only, the AMD Radeon RX 7900 GRE is finally launching globally on 27 February and will retail for US$549. The \u201cGRE\u201d actually stands for \u201cGolden Rabbit Edition\u201d, which was meant to be a 2023 release since it was the Year of the Rabbit last year. According to AMD, the Radeon RX 7900 GRE offers up to 12 percent more FPS per dollar on average at 1440p max settings compared to the price-matched NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070. The RX 7900 GRE has 16GB of GDDR6 memory most ideal for 1440p gaming though it can also handle up to 4K decently. Or if the RX 7900 GRE is above your budget, you\u2019ll be happy to know that the AMD Radeon RX 7700 XT is now at a new low price of US$419 (originally US$459), starting from today. So if you\u2019re thinking of a graphics card upgrade without breaking the bank, and currently running a monitor at 1440p resolution instead of 4K, The RX 7900 GRE or the 7700 XT might just be it for 2024.
