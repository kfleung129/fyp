    "text": "AMD is prepping the Radeon RX 7600 XT for a late January launch in an attempt to dampen NVIDIA\u2019s Super release. We already discussed the specifications of the card a few days back. It\u2019ll leverage a heavily cutdown Navi 32 GPU with 2,560 shaders across 40 Compute Units (CUs) alongside a 16GB memory and a 128-bit wide bus. The RX 7600 XT will (gradually) replace the immensely popular RX 6600 XT and 6650 XT at an MSRP of $299 to $349. Benchlife claims that the January launch of the RX 7600 XT 16GB is already confirmed. However, the midrange RDNA 3 GPU will see a delayed launch in China on account of the RX 6750 GRE. The latter is exclusive to the Chinese market, and follows the RX 7900 GRE. The Radeon RX 6750 GRE leverages the RDNA 2 graphics architecture, but performs similar to the RX 7600 XT 16GB. It comes in two variants featuring 10GB and 12GB of GDDR6 memory and costs between $269 and $289. The source claims that the Radeon RX 7600 XT 16GB won\u2019t be available in China for the first few months as the 6750 GRE is already outselling its rivals in the sub-$300 segment. A launch date for the former (in China) hasn\u2019t been confirmed, but you can be sure that it won\u2019t coincide with the global release. "
