    "text": "While the GPU temperature is heavily dependent upon the particular graphics card AIB model chosen, above is a look at the thermals for all of the graphics cards I tested for this article. The ASRock Challenger Radeon RX 7900 GRE had an average temperature of around 65 degrees with a recorded peak of 69 degrees. The core temperature average was similar to the Radeon RX 7800 XT tested but with a lower peak. Across all of the benchmarks conducted, the Radeon RX 7900 GRE had an average power consumption of 200 Watts with a recorded peak of 240 Watts, or just about 5% higher than the Radeon RX 7800 XT. When taking the geometric mean of all the benchmarks carried out for this Radeon RX 7900 GRE embargo lift, this graphics card was matching the performance of the prior gen GeForce RTX 3080 while being 94% the speed of the RTX 4070 SUPER overall. That puts the $549 USD Radeon RX 7900 GRE graphics card slightly ahead of the RTX 4070 SUPER at $599 USD. The Radeon RX 7900 GRE was 15% faster than the Radeon RX 7800 XT and 82% the speed of the Radeon RX 7900 XT. See all of this RX 7900 GRE Linux testing via this OB result page.  The Radeon RX 7900 GRE will be available worldwide beginning tomorrow, 27 February, starting at $549 USD. Going along with today's embargo lift is also word from AMD that the Radeon RX 7700 XT suggested retail pricing is dropping from $449 to $419 USD. Thanks to AMD for providing the Radeon RX 7900 GRE for this Linux testing ahead of the US and worldwide launch. The Radeon RX 7900 GRE is running well on AMD's fully upstream and open-source graphics driver stack for Linux gamers and enthusiasts alike.
