    "text": "Telecommunications company Telstra and Swedish telco vendor Ericsson have deployed Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) microprocessors for Ericsson\u2019s bare metal cloud environment, known as cloud native infrastructure solution (CNIS), to deliver energy efficiency for Telstra\u2019s 5G core functions. The deployment will see both companies leverage high core densities AMD Genoa processors, representing 4th generation of AMD\u2019s EPYC family of server processors, on a closed loop liquid-cooled server system, powered by Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE). The combination of AMD\u2019s processors with HPE\u2019s closed-loop liquid cooling system reduces overall cooling requirement of the system compared to traditional air cooling, claimed the companies. Telstra and Ericsson used the new hardware to host containerised workloads for Ericsson\u2019s Packet Core Gateway and Packet Core Controller applications.  In addition to delivering a liquid-cooled server and processor technology, Telstra and Ericsson also worked to improve Telstra\u2019s infrastructure footprint by devising power management features and solutions with radio access network. Ericsson\u2019s CNIS solution and packet core gateway and core controller demonstrated up to 49% less energy consumption. \u201cOur latest deployment of Ericsson 5G Core functions using next-generation AMD processors on liquid-cooled infrastructure has the potential to deliver a step-change in performance and efficiency \u2014 one that will benefit individuals and businesses throughout Australia. Perhaps most importantly, this new milestone provides us with tangible progress towards contributing to achieving our T25 climate goals,\u201d said Telstra executive network applications and cloud Shailin Sehgal. \u201cThis technology is an important milestone for delivering greater sustainability for the 5G mobile telecommunications infrastructure that millions of Australians rely on every day,\u201d said Ericsson head ANZ Emilio Romeo.
