    "text": "A wide range of extended support options, system-specific accessories, long-lasting availability of spare parts, and extended warranty options are staples in this category. In addition, these notebooks often come with ports that have been all but eradicated on other devices but are still fairly common in businesses worldwide. Product cycles tend to be very long, and a case can easily remain current for three or more years. Prices more often than not start significantly above $1,000 and can quickly rise to seeming exorbitant levels. The main driving cost factors, in addition to above-mentioned characteristics, are the professional-level GPUs often found in these devices. Unlike the more common consumer-level GPUs they have special capabilities and are optimized for stability, compatibility, and reliability when used with certified software. And while this may not be relevant for home users businesses tend to have very different priorities, and these GPUs can make or break a purchase decision. Please consider the following lists as well: The table above contains an overview over the best portable workstation laptops reviewed by Notebookcheck over the course of the past 12 months as well as still relevant and available older products. In cases of identical score the more recent device is listed first. All prices in above table and price comparisons are updated daily and can thus differ.Link:\u00a0all devices in this class reviewed Performance is an important aspect when evaluating a mobile workstation. The mobile workstations in ultrabook format, which are more oriented towards mobility, are usually not bad notebooks, but they rarely belong to the top devices due to the significantly lower computing and graphics performance. ZBook Firefly, Power, Studio, Fury: There are many different variants of HP's workstation series. HP markets its classic mobile workstations with a clear focus on performance and versatility as the ZBook Fury. The latest version goes by the name HP ZBook Fury 16 G10 and achieved an excellent rating in our review. This is mainly due to the extremely good upgradeability with up to four SO-DIMM modules and four M.2 2280 SSDs, the very high CPU and GPU performance and the excellent 4K IPS display with a refresh rate of 120 Hz and good color space coverage. The major strengths clearly outweigh the few weaknesses: The SD card reader could be a little faster, and the CPU performance has not yet been fully exploited. Overall, however, this can be chalked up to \"criticism at a high level\". The ZBook Fury 16 G10 maximizes GPU performance, making it one of the fastest mobile workstations when it comes to graphics. However, this seems to come at the expense of SSD and CPU performance. Amazon US offers some variants of ZBook Fury 16 G9, prices depending on\u00a0particular configuration. The X1 Extreme no longer exists, but the ThinkPad P1 does: Lenovo has decided to focus fully on the workstation offshoot. The Lenovo ThinkPad P1 G6 is the latest model with Raptor Lake. It is an excellently balanced mobile workstation that combines very high performance, extremely good input devices and a good battery life with a relatively low weight. The Lenovo ThinkPad P1 Gen 6 hardly has any real weaknesses. The ThinkPad P1 G6 is a very good mobile workstation, whereby the focus here is more on mobility than pure performance. The new Ada GPUs from Nvidia offer plenty of performance and the optional IPS display with 500 nits and a frequency of 165 Hz is definitely a recommendation if you don't need an extended color space. Wide selection of configurations\u00a0of\u00a0ThinkPad P1 G6 are available from Lenovo, starting from around $2,490. Alternatively, our review configuration can be purchased from Amazon. Lenovo had a lot planned for the ThinkPad P16 G1: After all, Lenovo's first full-fat 16-inch workstation was supposed to replace both the ThinkPad P15 and the ThinkPad P17. At the same time, it is the first model with the HX55 CPU series, which requires stronger cooling. The project has succeeded, Lenovo has created a very good mobile workstation. The model we tested with Nvidia RTX A5500 and Intel Core i9-12950HX is the most powerful mobile workstation we could test up to the time of the review. This leads to a surprising problem: The 240-watt power supply is not sufficient to charge the ThinkPad behemoth under permanent load. Besides that, the missing RJ45 port and the rather slow SD card reader are points of criticism. On the plus side, besides the extremely high performance, there is a very maintainable, modular design as well as a surprisingly restrained active cooling when the device is not running at full steam. The ThinkPad P16 Gen 1 maximizes performance even though this means higher power consumption and core temperatures. However, the 230 W power supply might be too conservative considering the very demanding processors of our top-end configuration. Some variants of ThinkPad P16 G1 are available through the usual retail channels, such as Best Buy and Amazon. For more configurable options, users can purchase directly from Lenovo's online store. Dell believes in the potential of 14-inch workstations. At least that seems to be the case, because while HP and Lenovo largely neglect this segment, Dell goes all-in with the Precision 5480. Dell packs Raptor Lake H CPUs and the Nvidia RTX 3000 Ada into the compact chassis, which is similar in design to the XPS series. This results in impressive performance for such a compact device, but the Dell Precision is not free from criticism. The 720p webcam is unacceptable these days, upgradeable RAM is missing and there is no option for an OLED display or a screen with DCI-P3 coverage. The 14-inch Precision 5480 is aimed at power users on the go who want to take full advantage of the fast RTX 3000 Ada GPU. Otherwise, the alternatives from Lenovo and HP tend to be much quieter and less obtrusive. Customers from the US can purchase the device directly from Dell's online store or Amazon as well. Asus is not necessarily a manufacturer associated with the workstation class. However, if more laptops like the Asus ExpertBook B6 Flip appear, that might change in the future.After all, it passes the most important hurdles for a workstation with flying colors in our test: The ExpertBook offers high performance, is not too loud at the same time, and it proves to be very maintainable and upgradeable. In addition to that, there are the convertible features that are almost never seen in workstations of this format. However, the Asus laptop is admittedly not free of criticism. The missing pen silo is to be criticized, and there is also no SD card slot. As a 2-in-1 workstation, this laptop is unique. The Asus ExperBook B6 Flip is probably one of the most powerful convertibles. At the time of writing, the device is not yet available in North America. HP's cheaper workstations are called ZBook Power. However, this does not mean that these devices are uninteresting: For the first time, the HP ZBook Power 15 G10 is also available with an AMD option, which is withheld from the ZBook Studio and ZBook Fury. However, the ZBook Power is deprived of something else: The more modern 16:10 format, as the ZBook Power is one of the few models that still relies on 16:9 and the 15.6-inch form factor. All in all, it is still a very good workstation, even if it is not as luxurious as the more expensive ZBooks and lacks some high-end options. The ZBook Power 15 G10 will probably be one of the last 15.6-inch workstations from HP before the series is refreshed with a more modern 16:10 design. Amazon US offers a variant of the HP's laptop for $1,340. Alternately, users can order the\u00a0ZBook Power 15 G10 via HP's online store. The Lenovo ThinkPad P16s G2 is one of the lighter, thinner workstations, which is why this model relies on the AMD Ryzen U series. The high efficiency of the Ryzen CPU ensures that CPU performance remains high. However, there are also disadvantages: The RAM is soldered, there is only one SSD slot and no dGPU. The integrated AMD graphics are not bad, but don't really come close to dGPUs. Plenty of computing power, usually enough graphics performance and a decent configuration make the P16s G2 AMD an excellent notebook for work, university or creative activities. Users can purchase ThinkPad P16s G2 AMD directly from Lenovo with many configurable options, starting at $1,059. Alternatively, the device is also available on Amazon US for $1,650. Of all the Lenovo workstations in the ThinkPad P series, the Lenovo ThinkPad P14s G4 AMD is the smallest and most compact.\u00a0 Unlike Dell's Precision 5480, the ThinkPad does not rely on Intel processors and Nvidia GPUs, instead it contains the latest Ryzen chips. It is a small powerhouse, but lacks GPU power compared to other workstations. The soldered RAM is also a limitation, as is the limitation to one USB4 port. Somewhat basic, connections not optimal, but a lot of power, a strong iGPU and plenty of battery life: The ThinkPad P14s is a very good choice from a sober point of view. The ThinkPad P14s G4 AMD is available through Lenovo\u2019s own web shop as well as usual retail outlets, such as Amazon US. * ... smaller is better "
