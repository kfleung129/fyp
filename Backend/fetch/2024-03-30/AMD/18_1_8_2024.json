    "text": "AMD (AMD) is bringing the AI PC race to the world of desktop computers at CES 2024 with the debut of what it says is the world\u2019s first desktop processor with a dedicated neural processing unit (NPU). Coming to AMD\u2019s upcoming Ryzen 8000G series chips, which hit the market Jan. 31, the NPU is designed to handle AI-based tasks on your desktop computer without having to send data to the cloud. Apple (AAPL) already offers a dedicated neural engine in its M line of processors for its Mac laptops and desktops, but AMD says it\u2019s the first to put a dedicated NPU in an x86 desktop chip. Apple\u2019s chips are based on ARM processors. The AI PC revolution is seen as the next major growth area for the PC industry, as manufacturers and developers lean into the massive explosion in interest in AI following the debut of ChatGPT in 2022. AMD, Intel (INTC), and Qualcomm (QCOM) have each already debuted their own laptop chips with AI capabilities, but AMD is the first to bring that to the desktop. What exactly that does for consumers, though, is still largely up in the air. Sure, there are a handful of programs that take advantage of the neural engines available in AI PCs, but chipmakers are depending on developers to pump out a swath of applications that put their NPUs to the test. According to chipmakers, using an onboard NPU means that you\u2019ll be able to run generative AI applications on your device rather than in the cloud. That should mean that your data will stay secured on your own system, rather than having to send it to a third-party company\u2019s servers where it could also be used to train that firm\u2019s AI systems. Cloud-based AI services can also require fees to process some requests, something that onboard AI programs won\u2019t. It\u2019s not just chipmakers, either. Ahead of CES, Microsoft (MSFT) announced that it and its PC partners are bringing dedicated Copilot buttons to Windows laptop and desktop keyboards. The first major change to the Windows keyboard in three decades, the Copilot button will call up Windows\u2019 built-in Copilot AI assistant. In addition to the Ryzen 8000 series\u2019 NPU, AMD says the chip also packs the world\u2019s fastest integrated desktop graphics processor. That means you\u2019ll be able to play games like \u201cCyberpunk 2077\u201d and \u201cFar Cry 6\u201d at frame rates of more than 60 frames per second. The caveat here, though, is that you\u2019ll have to opt for the high-end Ryzen 7 8700G version of the chip with a built-in Radeon 780M GPU and set the games\u2019 performance to low with a resolution of 1080p. If you\u2019re a serious gamer, you\u2019re still going to want to purchase a separate, dedicated graphics card. But the fact that you can even run those games on an integrated GPU is still impressive. The new chips are also another shot at rival Intel as that company navigates its turnaround efforts and attempts to gain back market share it\u2019s lost to AMD. Shares of AMD have jumped 122% over the last 12 months as of the close of trading on Friday. Intel's stock price has climbed just 70% over the same period. Neither chipmaker, however, can touch Nvidia's (NVDA) performance. That company's shares have rocketed 244% over the last year.
