However, there are still some glaring differences that separate these two models. Hence, we thought that comparing the AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D vs Ryzen 7 3700X would be an interesting debate for users and fans alike. In this comparison, we will take a deep dive into specs, performance, and price \u2013 ultimately deciding which AMD Ryzen model comes out on top. For additional CPU comparison, be sure to check out the AMD Ryzen 7 5700X3D vs Ryzen 7 5800X3D and AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D vs Ryzen 5 7600X here. Anyway, where were we? In this specification section, we will discuss everything from components to FPS performance. Both processors share the same AM4 socket and are built on a 7nm architecture, offering efficiency and performance benefits. They both feature 8 cores and 16 threads, making them capable multitaskers suitable for various computing needs. Additionally, they support DDR4 memory and boast similar L1 and L2 cache sizes of 64 KB (per core) and 512 KB (per core), respectively.

This feature allows the 5800X3D to stack an impressive 64 MB of L3 cache as a 3D cache, significantly boosting data access speeds and reducing latency. In contrast, the Ryzen 7 3700X settles for a more conventional 32 MB L3 cache. This distinction in cache size and architecture is key to the substantial performance disparity between the two processors. Regarding power consumption, the Ryzen 7 5800X3D comes with a TDP of 105 Watts, indicating a higher power draw than the Ryzen 7 3700X, which has a TDP of 65 Watts. This means there will be a need for a better CPU cooler for AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D. While the increased performance power might raise concerns about heat generation and energy efficiency, it\u2019s important to note that the Ryzen 7 5800X3D\u2019s performance gains may justify the additional power requirements for many users. Moving on to performance metrics, benchmark results reveal a notable discrepancy between the Ryzen 7 5800X3D and the Ryzen 7 3700X. In Geekbench tests, the Ryzen 7 5800X3D outshines its predecessor with a single-core performance score of 2087 and a multi-core score of 10931. In comparison, the Ryzen 7 3700X lags with a single-core score of 1651 and a multi-core score of 8097. By our calculations, these results underscore the significantly better performance of the Ryzen 7 5800X3D offers, which is attributed largely to its enhanced cache technology. When it comes to CPU speeds, the Ryzen 7 5800X3D and the Ryzen 7 3700X offer competitive figures. The 5800X3D boasts a base frequency clock of 3.4 GHz and a boost clock of up to 4.5 GHz. Meanwhile, the 3700X operates at a slightly higher base clock of 3.6 GHz but with a boost clock of up to 4.4 GHz. These clock speed differentials may not seem drastic, but they can impact performance in various computing tasks, particularly in demanding applications and gaming scenarios. While performance is crucial, price considerations also play a pivotal role in the decision-making process. At launch, the Ryzen 7 5800X3D was priced at $449, marking a premium over the Ryzen 7 3700X, which debuted with an MSRP of $329. While the Ryzen 7 5800X3D commands a higher price tag, its superior performance and innovative features justify the premium for users seeking cutting-edge performance and future-proofing. Although Intel and Ryzen never acknowledge a direct equivalent in terms of models, we have done some research to find which specs and release dates make the right match in this case. For the AMD Ryzen 7 57800X3D, the Intel equivalent is most likely the Intel Core i5 13600K. The AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D is a clear winner compared to the Ryzen 7 3700X, thanks to its advanced 3D V-cache technology, superior performance metrics, and enhanced value proposition. While the Ryzen 7 3700X remains a capable processor in its own right, the Ryzen 7 5800X3D represents a significant leap forward in AMD\u2019s processor lineup. Overall, catering to enthusiasts and professionals who demand uncompromising performance and efficiency from their computing hardware.
