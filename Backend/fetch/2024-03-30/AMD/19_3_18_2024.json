    "text": "MSI is one of the most popular motherboard vendors today, and these are Game Rant's picks for the best options for gamers. Motherboards no longer serve just as an \"interface\" to connect all other pieces of hardware but bring much more to the table to uplift the performance of a gaming PC. MSI needs no introduction in the world of high-quality gaming motherboards as they offer tons of features, reliability, and top-notch specifications for affordable prices. Intel's Raptor Lake Refresh and AMD's Zen 4-based Ryzen 7000 series are currently the most popular CPU families in the mainstream desktop market and hence, millions of gamers are searching for the best gaming motherboards for their builds. MSI, being one of the top players in the motherboard market, has a wide range of motherboards with different chipsets for these processors that offer unparalleled power delivery, connectivity, and durability at fair prices. So, whether users want to set up a budget gaming computer or max out their high-end Intel or AMD CPU's potential, this guide covers every good MSI motherboard. MSI MPG Z790 Carbon WiFi brings a solid 21-power phase VRM for enthusiast overclockers that leaves behind every other mid-range motherboard. The support for high-frequency DDR5 memories and the presence of several M.2 connectors make it the best MSI motherboard for Intel users who want the best features for price. The MSI MPG Z790 Carbon Wi-Fi belongs to the premium MPG series that offers distinguished features that are solely produced for enthusiast PC builders and gamers. Everything from power delivery to connectivity is top-notch so that users can not only overclock their CPUs to their full potential but are also able to upgrade easily anytime. Compared to every other MSI Z790 motherboard, except for the flagship ones, this one brings a much better VRM with 19 VCore power phases with each phase rated at 105A of current. This allows overclocking even the flagship Intel processors without breaking a sweat. Another noteworthy feature is the presence of 5x M.2 connectors that should eliminate the need for SATA drives for the most part. The first two M.2 connectors are powered via the PCI lanes from the CPU. Hence, one of them runs in PCI-E 5.0 x4 mode and so does the primary PCI-E x16 slot. Connectivity is another notable advantage users are going to get from this board. The I/O and onboard connectors are sufficient for connecting multiple high-bandwidth devices as well as peripherals. Moreover, there are onboard troubleshooting EZ Debug LEDs and Error LED Codes that can come in handy anytime. The MPG X670E Carbon WiFi is a powerful board for high-end Ryzen 7000 CPUs that comes with a reliable 21-power VRM, great support for high-frequency DDR5 RAM, and native PCI-E 5.0 support for graphics card and NVMe SSDs. The onboard debugging options, multiple high-speed USB connectors, and several fan/AIO headers on board make it perfect for a future-proof build. The MPG X670E Carbon Wi-Fi is the Z790 Carbon Wi-Fi's alternative for AMD CPU users who own a mid-range or high-end gaming CPU. It's not meant for budget gaming CPUs as the power delivery is too good to be used for a simple 6-core CPU. The 18 VCore phases are rated at a good 1620A of total current, which although lower than the Intel motherboard, is still more than required for high-level overclocking. The VRM is hidden with an attractive I/O shroud with an RGB dragon logo that can be customized using the Dragon Center. So, users don't have to compromise either way. There are multiple ports and headers to connect as many peripherals or devices, which eases the path to upgrade. Moreover, unlike the Z790 Carbon Wi-Fi, users will get 2x M.2 connectors that support Gen 5.0 bandwidth instead of only one. This allows adding even faster SSDs for quick OS and app boot. Lastly, at the I/O, there are buttons for clearing the BIOS or upgrading it, along with tons of fast USB ports, including a Gen 2x2 Type C port that can handle a transfer speed of up to 20Gbps. The\u00a0MSI PRO Z790-A Wi-Fi Gaming Motherboard is an excellent, well-rounded Z790 motherboard with plenty of connectivity features while supporting Intel's 12th and 13th-generation processors. In addition, it has a decent 16+1+1 phase power delivery system at a price that makes it comparable to Intel's more budget B760 motherboards. There are a handful of great motherboards when searching through the $200 to $300 price range. The MSI PRO Z790-A Wi-Fi is one of the cheapest yet competitive boards that match the performance of motherboards that cost $40 to $50 more. With a powerful 16+1+1 power phase VRM, it is as good as some mid-range motherboards, including the Tomahawk and Edge Wi-Fi motherboards. While it lacks in some areas, it is overall the perfect board to build a budget or mid-range gaming build with a processor like the Core i5 13500 or 14600K. With 16 VCore phases, users can easily overclock their CPUs without any fear of thermal throttle, considering that they are using a decent aftermarket cooling solution. The board also comes with native PCI-E Gen 5.0 support for the primary PCI-E x16 slot but unfortunately, there is no Gen 5.0 support for any M.2 connector. Still, the Gen 4.0 support for every M.2 connector is impressive at this price. Moreover, the EZ Debug LEDs on the PCB and several headers for chassis fans, AIO pumps, and RGB headers for RGB devices make it a solid option for users who want to build a gaming PC for under $1000. MSI B650 Gaming Plus is an excellent choice for AMD CPU users who are looking to get the job done without spending over $200. The 15-power phase VRM will be adequate for mid-range CPUs, while the multiple PCI-E slots will allow users to add various expansion cards. There are plenty of connectivity options too, including several fan headers, a built-in WiFi adapter, fast USB headers, and even troubleshooting options. Budget or Mid-Range Ryzen CPU owners don't have to spend over $200 or $300 when the MSI B650 Gaming Plus Wi-Fi is out on the market. With a sufficiently powerful VRM that boasts 12 VCore power phases, users will be able to boost their core clocks without any fear of thermal throttling. While it's not made for higher-end CPUs like the Ryzen 7950X, it is surely sufficient for CPUs like Ryzen 7600X, 7700X, and even Ryzen 7800X3D, which is the best gaming processor at the moment. There are plenty of fast USB ports on the I/O along with various connectivity options, including Wi-Fi 6E and a Type C Gen 2x2 connector for fast devices. Moreover, there is a Flash Bios button too, which helps upgrade the BIOS pretty easily. However, with the B650 chipset, users will be limited to PCI-E Gen 4.0 speeds on the PCI-E slots and M.2 connectors. A clear drawback for enthusiasts but certainly not a dealbreaker for users on a budget. MSI MEG Z790 ACE Max pushes the limit of Intel CPUs. With an unbelievably powerful VRM of 27 power phases, it's ready to break some overclocking records. The top grade PCB with excellent thermal solution all over it eliminates any fear of overheating. Plenty of onboard features, connectors, and high bandwidth for each of them make it a monster for any high-end gaming build. Users who aren't afraid to spend several hundred dollars on the motherboard should opt for the MEG Z790 ACE Max, which transcends the gaming capability of regular motherboards. This is an absolute beast with overwhelming features, including a rock-solid power delivery system with 24 VCore power phases. This is plenty for even breaking overclocking records considering users also invest in a premium AIO cooling solution. The Max edition features beautiful customizable RGB LEDs on the heatsinks that cover the whole PCB for heat dissipation. Storage connectors are too many, with five M.2 connectors and six SATA ports to have a huge capacity for storing multiple big games. Similarly, there are 3x PCI-E x16 slots for the graphics cards with two of them featuring Gen 5.0 bandwidth support. However, users have to keep in mind that the ports and slots share bandwidth, which disables or limits the performance of the other. Apart from that, there isn't anything about this motherboard that doesn't blow the mind. Talking about connectivity, the motherboard features headers that support up to 8x USB ports for the front panel, including 2x Type C Gen 2x2 ports. The internet connectivity is also unparalleled, thanks to the Wi-Fi 7 module, which supports up to 46Gbps of speed compared to 9.6Gbps through Wi-Fi 6E. This may or may not be a dealbreaker for many, as such high-speed internet is not available everywhere. However, it does open the path to such speeds in the future and remains one of the best motherboards for high-end Intel processors. MSI MEG X670E Ace is designed with one of the best power delivery systems, featuring 25 power phases, each rated at 105A to enable users to do nitrogen cooling to break world records in overclocking. The durable 8 layer PCB and effective thermal solution will keep this motherboard running for several years. While not cheap, it's definitely much better in value than the Godlike. For AMD users, MSI also has an excellent MEG X670E Ace edition that costs the same as the MEG Z790 Ace and brings several identical features. There are some minor changes in many places, but it is overall the best MSI gaming motherboard for high-end Ryzen 7000 CPUs. With a robust power delivery system that features 22 VCore power phases, users are more than welcome to experiment and try breaking world records. It's almost as good as the MEG X670E Godlike except that the latter is twice as expensive as the Ace. One of the most outstanding features of this board is its thermal solution that passively cools every component on the board through large heatsinks on the VRM, M.2 connectors, and the chipset. Moreover, each of the PCI-E x16 slots is made very durable through the use of steel armor. At the I/O, there are 8x USB Type-A ports, each of them featuring a speed of up to 10Gbps, while the three Type-C ports are also there for super high transfer speed. Lastly, users who like to experiment with overclocking and stuff can benefit from the EZ Debug LEDs, Debug Code LED, and multiple BIOS controlling buttons at the I/O. Apart from providing a solid 12-power phase VRM design for overclocking and support for highly overclockable memories, the Z790I Edge Wi-Fi brings the highest number of SATA ports for expanding the storage capacity. Moreover, the EZ Debug LEDs single-handedly make it a worthy ITX board for mid-range PC builds. From the ITX motherboard lineup, MSI has its MPG Z790E Edge Wi-Fi as a top-tier choice for users who are looking forward to building a compact gaming system. While ITX boards typically have poor upgradeability, they can still share identical specs as found on bigger form factor motherboards. The MPG Z790I Edge Wi-Fi is a great example of 'good things come in small packages'. Not only does it boast support for highly overclocked DDR5 memories, but it also allows CPU overclocking as well. Using a Core i5 or an i7 won't be a problem unless users are aiming for intensive overclocks. Constructed using a 12-layer server-grade PCB and gorgeous yet effective silverish heatsinks that cover half of the PCB, the motherboard is highly durable, provides ample cooling, and looks sleek. It brings the PCI-E Gen 5.0 bandwidth natively for the PCI-E x16 slot and comes with a lot of storage connectors that include 3x M.2 and 4x SATA ports, which is a rare feat of ITX motherboards. Intel Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3 are available for wireless connectivity and all the latest USB ports for the peripherals are at the I/O.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b The best MSI overall motherboards for gaming are the MPG Z790 Carbon WiFi for Intel CPU users and MPG X670E Carbon WiFi for AMD CPU users. However, users can also opt for the Ace motherboards if they would like to take their performance to the max level. MSI motherboards are one of the most reliable options on the market, and they generally provide a higher value than other popular motherboard manufacturers. However, gaming performance is something that also depends on other hardware. We hope you like the items we recommend and discuss!
