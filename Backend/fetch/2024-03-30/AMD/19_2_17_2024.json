    "text": "One of AMD's top-of-the-line gaming CPUs, the Ryzen 9 7900X3D, has dropped to a new record-low price. It's currently available on Amazon for $409.98, which is a $189.02 drop from the listed price. This new price makes the processor stiffen up the competition against the K-series CPU options of the Intel Raptor Lake Refresh and Raptor Lake lineups. When it comes to benchmarks, AMD's internal test data unveiled at launch claimed a 24% boost from the Core i9-13900K (curr. $519 on Amazon) in gaming. While internal tests are generally exaggerated, third-party benchmark data of the Ryzen 9 7900X3D do hint that it's better (more on it in the video attached at the end). With 12 cores and 24 threads, the AMD Ryzen 9 7900X3D also shines in workloads other than gaming. The processor has enough power to meet most people's creative and productivity needs. But if you need more, you might want to consider the Ryzen 9 7950X3D. It comes with 16 cores, 32 threads, and more L1 and L2 cache, all of which make it sit higher than the Ryzen 9 7900X3D in terms of raw power. This processor is also enjoying a generous discount, with the current price at $599 on Amazon. You can learn more about these gaming processors and check how they perform from the videos attached below. Disclaimer: Notebookcheck is not responsible for price changes carried out by retailers.
