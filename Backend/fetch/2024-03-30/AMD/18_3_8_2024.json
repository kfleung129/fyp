It costs around $160 and is available for that price at the time of writing. In This article, we are going to go over some of the best AMD Radeon RX 6400 graphics cards that you can buy right now in 2024. The AMD Radeon RX 6400 graphics cards are available in low-profile designs which makes them ideal for a sleeper build and small form factor builds. Since these cards do not need external power, you can easily install them on older computers or office PCs in order to do some gaming. The AMD Radeon RX 6400 features 12 CUs, 12 Ray Accelerators, and throughput of 7.13 TFLOPs. It has a game clock speed of 2039 MHz and can boost to 2321 MHz. Furthermore, it has 768 Stream Processors and 48 Texture Units. It comes with 4 GB of GDDR6 memory and a 64-bit memory interface. Since this is a budget graphics card, there are some downsides. The AMD Radeon RX 6400 only has 4 PCIe lanes so your PCIe bandwidth is going to be cut in half unless you have a Gen4 motherboard and CPU. Similarly, if your system is even older and supports only PCIe Gen2 then the bandwidth will be cut to a quarter. This is going to impact gaming performance. In Far Cry 6, for example, the RX 6400 can do 72 FPS on average on Gen3 but only 43 FPS on Gen2. The same is the case in Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla as you can see in the image below: The difference in performance across the different PCIe generations is less significant when playing older games and competitive titles such as Rainbow Six Siege and Valorant. It is worth noting that when the PCIe Gen4 requirements are met the performance is comparable to the Nvidia GTX 1650, which is priced at around $229-300 at the time of writing. So the AMD Radeon RX 6400 does offer some value for budget gamers. It is worth mentioning that the graphics card cannot stream Netflix at 4K because of no AV1 decoding and H261 encoding. It only has a pair of display ports. So you can only connect two monitors without a splitter. We cannot even recommend spending more money and going with the 6500 XT as it has the same issues. The following are some of the best AMD Radeon RX 6400 graphics cards that you can buy right now in 2024: The ASRock Challenger is a nice-looking card even though it has a basic design.

The SAPPHIRE PULSE is a bit longer than the models that we have seen above but it is still low-profile and ideal for ITX builds.
