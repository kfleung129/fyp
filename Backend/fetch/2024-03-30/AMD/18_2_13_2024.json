Whether you don\u2019t have the best graphics card and want to get extra frames on a game or finish specific video-focused tasks faster, this guide will help you accomplish that by overclocking your GPU in the safest way possible. If you\u2019re keen to overclock your CPU check out our guide, providing you with that processing boost. Don\u2019t forget to also check how to update Nvidia drivers, how to stress test your GPU, and how to check if your GPU is failing \u2013 in which case you won\u2019t want to overclock. Firstly, check you have enough power and cooling to overclock your card. You don\u2019t want it to basically break your whole setup, or potentially overheat, making it a redundant component. If you\u2019re unsure what wattage your power supply is, you\u2019ll have to open your case and take a look. More than likely you have enough power, but there\u2019s no harm in making sure. Another vital check is ensuring what model graphics card you have. Luckily, no need to open your case this time, you can check your system settings, or download Speccy, where you can see all of your PC\u2019s info. This will give you the knowledge to avoid any hiccups. Having the correct software for overclocking your GPU is important. You should know if you have an Nvidia or AMD graphics card but, if not, as stated previously, check your system settings, or use a program like Speccy. We\u2019ll go into more detail about what software works with what, but there are a variety of programs out there that make overclocking a quick and easy process. This is a commonly overlooked step as many wouldn\u2019t think that having the correct drivers will impact overclocking. Thankfully, this is easily done both in Nvidia and AMD\u2019s proprietary control panels by simply clicking a button. You can see what drivers are currently installed and if they need updating. If they do, download the correct drivers and install them before advancing. You\u2019re going to want to benchmark your graphics card\u2019s current performance before overclocking so you\u2019re able to see the capabilities in advance of adding that extra oomph. It\u2019ll also give you an idea of whether it\u2019s worth the hassle, or whether putting that extra strain on an already-used graphics card will tip it over the edge. Utilizing software like 3DMark will give you some clear results both before and after overclocking, providing some insight into how it will perform when gaming. This is a step you do not want to miss. Doing research on the graphics card you have in terms of its limits will make or break your system. You will need two key pieces of information; max graphics clock speed and max memory clock speed. Of course, it will differ slightly from card to card but this will give you an idea of how hard to push it and what\u2019s possible if you overclock a graphics card. Below we\u2019ll go through the steps of how to overclock a graphics card, with Nvidia and AMD specifics further down, so keep reading for key information you\u2019ll need! Step Step Conduct a baseline performance test of your GPU. Use benchmarking tools like Unigine Heaven or 3DMark to assess your GPU\u2019s current performance and stability. This initial test gives you a reference point to compare against after overclocking and helps identify any pre-existing issues with the GPU. Step Step Install GPU overclocking software. MSI Afterburner is highly recommended for its user-friendly interface and robust features. It\u2019s compatible with a wide range of GPUs and offers extensive control over clock speeds, voltage, and fan speeds. Download it from the official website and install it on your system. Step Step Begin gradually increasing your GPU\u2019s core clock speed. Start with small increments to the core clock speed, such as 20-30 MHz at a time. After adjusting the core clock, you can similarly start to increase the memory clock. Adjusting in small increments will help in finding the optimal overclocking setting without overloading the GPU, and doing each separately makes it clear which could cause any instability. Step Step Apply the new settings and conduct stress tests. After each adjustment in MSI Afterburner, apply the settings. Then, run a stress test using the same tools as in Step 1. This step is crucial to ensure that the GPU remains stable and performs well under the new settings. If the GPU passes the stress test without issues (like visual artifacts, system crashes, or overheating), you can proceed to the next increment. If you encounter any instability, revert to the previous stable setting. Step Step Closely monitor the GPU temperature. As you overclock, keep a constant watch on the GPU\u2019s temperature using MSI Afterburner\u2019s real-time monitoring. It\u2019s crucial to ensure the temperature remains within a safe operating range (usually under 80-85\u00b0C, but this can vary based on the GPU model). Overheating can cause damage or reduce the lifespan of the GPU. Step Step Determine the highest stable overclock. Continue the process of incrementally increasing the clock speeds and conducting stress tests. Your goal is to find the highest clock speeds at which the GPU can run stably without any crashes, artifacts, or excessive heat. This optimal point is your stable overclock limit. Step Step Fine-tune the GPU\u2019s cooling. To counter the additional heat generated from overclocking, adjust the fan curve settings in the MSI Afterburner. Increase the fan speed to improve cooling, especially at higher temperatures. Effective cooling is essential to maintain the stability and longevity of the overclocked GPU. Step Step Conduct extended stability tests. Once you\u2019ve established a stable overclock, it\u2019s advisable to run extended tests to ensure the GPU\u2019s long-term stability under the new settings. Use a mix of stress tests and real-world usage scenarios, such as gaming or graphic applications, to thoroughly vet the overclock over several hours. Here are some additional important tips to keep in mind when you overclock a graphics card. Nvidia has made overclocking your RTX family GPU easier. The company\u2019s GeForce Experience software comes with enables you to automatically or manually overclock by selecting and setting values and away you go. Use ALT+Z to open the overlay, and select the Performance tab. Then, once you choose the \u2018Enable automatic tuning\u201d option, you will get a warning advising you to be wary of instability, and that the tuner will stop if the GPU utilization is high. Alternatively, you can use the sliders to tweak and test as outlined in the steps above. You don\u2019t want to just scale everything up to the max because you could blow your graphics card up; you want to find out those limits and work back from there. For example, just upping your Power Maximum isn\u2019t a great idea without considering the impact on your PSU. Like Nvidia\u2019s Control Panel software, AMD has its own piece of kit that makes for a smooth and simple process in search of a performance boost \u2013 AMD Software: Adrenalin Edition. You can adjust overclock settings \u2013 fan speed, clock speeds, and even easy-to-see voltages here. There are also presets built-in, helping you choose predefined settings based on your requirements. Again, research is key. Like Nvidia graphics cards, AMD\u2019s offerings will cut out if pushed too hard so finding out the limits you can push them to is essential. Another popular piece of software, offering some great overclocking options and a clean interface, is MSI\u2019s Afterburner. While you might think this software is reserved for MSI-manufactured cards, you\u2019d be wrong. You can use it with whatever brand graphics card you have but if you do have an MSI-specific card, you\u2019ll gain access to some special features. We think using Afterburner is a good way to overclock your graphics card no matter if you have AMD or Nvidia. It offers fantastic customizability and monitoring, allowing you to see how the overclocking is affecting it coupled with its easy-to-use format, enabling even users lacking in-depth PC knowledge to succeed and keep an eye on things like the card\u2019s power limit, core clock and core voltage. It also works on a profile system so you can save your overclock and if the load seems to work as expected come back to it later. After you\u2019ve chosen your designed clock speeds for both graphics and memory, confirm it and see what happens. If you start to see some artifacting appear then you know you\u2019ve got your settings a little too high. Slowly crank those settings down until you\u2019re back to a standard viewing experience. If you end up with full black screens, you know you\u2019ve gone far too high. Dial back those settings a lot or even go back to the defaults and slowly increase from there. Once you\u2019ve found that sweet spot, do some stress testing to make sure your rig is coping well with that graphics card boost. From this, you will be able to see if any further adjustments need to be made, tuning that card to perfection. After you\u2019re in a comfortable position, you could benchmark your system again. You should see improved FPS in your favorite games and better overall performance. There we have it, you now know how to overclock a graphics card. Jump into your games and experience some top results! Overclocking your GPU can be a worthwhile endeavor, especially in scenarios where every bit of extra performance makes a difference. Gamers stand to gain the most immediate benefits: enhanced frame rates and smoother gameplay, particularly in graphically demanding games. Overclocking can also extend the relevance of an older GPU, squeezing out more power and delaying the need for an expensive upgrade. For those who thrive on achieving peak system performance, the process of overclocking itself can be both challenging and rewarding, offering a deeper understanding of your hardware\u2019s capabilities. Professionals in fields like video editing, 3D modeling, and animation, where rendering times are critical, also find substantial value in overclocking. Faster clock speeds can translate to quicker render times, enhancing overall productivity. However, it\u2019s important to balance the pursuit of performance with the stability of your system. Overclocking should be considered if you find your current setup struggling to keep up with your requirements or if you\u2019re looking to maximize the potential of your existing hardware. Overclocking a GPU is generally independent of the motherboard used. Unlike CPU overclocking, which often requires a motherboard that supports overclocking, GPU overclocking is primarily dependent on the graphics card itself and the software used to overclock it. Most modern GPUs can be overclocked using software provided by the GPU manufacturer, like Nvidia\u2019s GeForce Experience or AMD\u2019s Radeon Software. Overclocking a GPU can potentially reduce its lifespan, primarily due to increased operational temperatures and voltage stress. When a GPU is overclocked, it operates beyond its factory-set parameters, which can lead to higher heat output. Consistently high temperatures can accelerate wear and tear on the hardware components, especially if the cooling solution is inadequate. PCguide.com\u00a0is part of the BGFG family of websites.
