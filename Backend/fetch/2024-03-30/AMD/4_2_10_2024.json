    "text": "Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio has released a new patch for Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth. Title Update 1.15 brings a number of bug fixes and resolves some crashes. Moreover, it fixes the stuttering issues that could occur when enabling DLSS 3 Frame Generation. We\u2019ve tested this patch ourselves and we can confirm that DLSS 3 Frame Generation no longer stutters. However, this update does not resolve its performance issues. On our main PC system (AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D, 32GB of DDR5 at 6000Mhz, and NVIDIA\u2019s GeForce RTX 4090), DLSS 3 was actually slower with Frame Generation. And yes, FSR 3.0 Frame Generation is still way faster than DLSS 3 FG. The best way to play the game on a high-end RTX GPU is only with DLAA. And that\u2019s because you can\u2019t enable AMD FSR 3.0 Frame Generation with DLAA. That wouldn\u2019t be a problem if FSR 3.0 Super Resolution was able to compete with DLSS 3 Super Resolution. However, the image quality of DLSS 3 is still superior to what AMD\u2019s upscaling tech currently offers. Anyway, alongside this DLSS 3 FG fix, there\u2019s also a fix for a rare bug that made the game crash sometimes when you\u2019re battling Sujimon. And hey, they also fixed a problem in Hawaii where characters would get stuck in walls during fights. That was messing up the game, but now it\u2019s fixed. I\u2019m currently playing Infinite Wealth and I have to say the character models are awesome. This is the best-looking Yakuza/Like a Dragon game for sure. I mean, check out these screenshots. This looks gooood. Like always, Steam will download this patch the next time you launch its client. Below you can also find its complete changelog.
