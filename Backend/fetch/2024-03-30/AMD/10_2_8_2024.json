    "text": "First up was the HPCG benchmark that tends to enjoy as much memory bandwidth as possible. The GH200 performance came out just ahead of the Xeon Platinum 8380 2P and just shy of the EPYC 9654 Genoa 2P performance... Not bad at all for an initial showing. Of the single processor configurations the GH200 was the fastest albeit with 2P Genoa(X) and Intel Emerald Rapids with more cores did come out ahead. The NVIDIA GH200 was nearly twice the performance of the Ampere Altra Max 128-core Arm processor. For the Rodinia HPC benchmark with the LavaMD test case the GH200 was tied with the EPYC 9684X Genoa-X 1P processor. For AMG the GPTshop.ai GH200 system nearly matched the Xeon Platinum 8380 2P for CPU performance. Very impressive for the NVIDIA GH200 CPU performance was with the NWChem computational chemistry software. The single GH200 was nearly tied to AMD EPYC Genoa in the leading 2P configuration.
