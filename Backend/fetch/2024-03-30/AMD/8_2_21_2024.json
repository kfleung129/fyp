We have you covered. With combined CPU and GPU technologies into a single chip, you might just get away with an all-in-one solution for your setup. Be it for work or gaming, they do give a nice budget-friendly option, so what are they and what are the best picks? While an APU isn\u2019t as strong in CPU or GPU performance as standalone components, there are good reasons to put them together. They can still pack a punch, but they won\u2019t replace the separate hardware we\u2019re used to. This article takes into account the Ryzen 7000 series CPUs, whilst we know they have an iGPU within them, it\u2019s not made for gaming therefore we excluded them from this list by choice. But AMD has now brought the 8000G series release and brought a whole new range to pick from. This isn\u2019t the best CPU with an iGPU, it\u2019s the best APU. Shop on Amazon Shop on Amazon Shop on Amazon The Best AMD APU for gaming will feature the new AMD Ryzen 8000 series, as these CPUs are far superior to the 5000G series. The new 8700G comes with a more capable RDNA 3-based 12-core Radeon 780M graphics chip, which could offer around 3x the iGPU performance over the 5700G. The list we have compiled today is ranked from best to worst. Not to say we dislike any of the CPUs on the list today, just some are better suited than others. If you\u2019re wondering why there are no Intel CPUs on the list, particularly the Intel 14900K, then that\u2019s because APUs are technically exclusive to AMD and Intel\u2019s integrated performance doesn\u2019t quite cut it. Speed 4.2-5.1 GHz Core (threads) 8 (16) Socket AM5 Graphics Radeon 780M Now at the top of the pack, you can find the Ryzen 7 8700G as part of the newer generation choice that AMD is bringing to the AM5 platform with integrated graphics. It upgrades to Radeon graphics bringing plenty of features to the processor with the AMD Adrenalin software now accessible to it. It comes with 8 cores and 16 threads for matching with the best abilities of CPUs. While it also boosts to much higher speeds than previous generations. For the cache capacity, L2 provides you with 8MB and L3 goes up to 16MB, so not quite X3D levels but still a good amount. For graphics, you get Radeon version 780M with 12 cores and running at 2.9GHz. That boosts the capabilities but also the processor comes with Ryzen AI with 16 TOPS for some light work capabilities of what it can achieve. Even then the processor only has a 65W TDP and has a great efficiency for what it is capable of, although you can even push that further as it is overclockable if you still desire. Speed 3.5-5.0 GHz Core (threads) 6 (12) Socket AM5 Graphics Radeon 740M For a cheaper choice out of the lot of new 8000Gs, the Ryzen 5 8500G is the option to go for. It drops down the price but also the specs of the processor. Getting rid of the AI processing capabilities of the processor but cutting it to under $200, does make it a strong choice of an APU. The cores fall to 6 and threads down to 12, still giving you a good capability with processing workloads and graphics. These can even boost up to 5GHz, not as far as the 8700G but still a well-capable option. As for the cache you get 6MB of L2 and 16MB of L3 so nothing changes in that, which is also the case for the TDP as that 65W spec stays the same. But the Radeon graphics also drop down a couple of tiers to 740M with only 4 cores, running at a 2,800Mhz frequency. You can only expect 720p true performance and light 1080p work with a good framerate achieved with some help. Speed 3.8GHz \u2013 4.6GHz Core (threads) 8 (16) Socket AM4 Graphics Vega 8 The Ryzen 7 5700G is AMD\u2019s current flagship APU and is widely considered to be the world\u2019s most powerful thanks to the integrated graphics the chip comes paired with. Unlike the previous gen, this features a higher amount of cores, increased speeds, and a more efficient design. The AMD Ryzen 7 5700G comes equipped with 8 cores and 16 threads, respectively. It features impressive clock speeds of 3.8GHz base and 4.6GHz boost, alongside a total of 16MB L3 cache and 4MB L2 cache. TDP will be equivalent to its predecessor at 65W and it brings VEGA 8 integrated graphics, with 8 CUs and 512 stream\u00a0processors (all running at 2.0GHz). While the 5700G is the most expensive APU from AMD to date, it is also by far the most powerful. With the current GPU climate, the 5700G can provide you with solid processing power and integrated graphics. While the integrated graphics may not be good enough for everyone, basic 1080p performance is there. Furthermore, when you finally get your hands on a dedicated GPU, you can easily slot it in with this APU for a quality overall gaming PC. Speed 3.9GHz \u2013 4.4GHz Core (threads) 6 (12) Socket AM4 Graphics Vega 7 The Ryzen 5 5600G, is an excellent choice for budget-conscious builders, It offers a compelling combination of affordability and performance. It follows in the footsteps of the older 3400G, providing solid gaming capabilities while ushering in significant improvements in core count and design efficiency. In terms of specifications, the Ryzen 5 5600G boasts 6 cores and 12 threads, with base and boost clock speeds of 3.9GHz and 4.4GHz, respectively. Like its sibling, the 5700G, it offers a generous 16MB of L3 cache, albeit with a slightly reduced 3MB of L2 cache. Despite these improvements, the APU maintains an energy-efficient 65W TDP and includes AMD\u2019s VEGA 7 iGPU, clocked at 1.9GHz and equipped with 448 stream processors. While the choice of the Vega 7 iGPU may initially appear to be a step backward, the gains in efficiency more than make up for the reduction in core count, ensuring that the graphical performance remains strong without compromising on power efficiency. Speed 3.7GHz \u2013 4.2GHz Core (threads) 4/8 Socket AM4 TDP 65W The AMD Ryzen 5 3400G, a former flagship APU from AMD, is renowned for its outstanding performance, largely owing to its integrated graphics capabilities. This chip, a significant step up from the 3200G, boasts 4 cores and 8 threads, 6MB of cache, and the impressive VEGA 11 graphics engine. Although it is scraping the bottom of the barrel in 2024, this CPU is not something that will take you very far with AAA titles even in 1080p. With a base clock speed of 3.7GHz and a boost clock of 4.2GHz, the 3400G represents a substantial improvement over its predecessor. AMD has further enhanced its performance with high-quality metal TIM (thermal interface material) and support for AMD\u2019s precision boost overdrive, a feature that intelligently overclocks the chip as needed. The integrated GPU operates at a base clock of 1,400MHz, a notable 150MHz faster than its predecessor, the 2400G. Additionally, like the 3200G, the 3400G includes AMD\u2019s Wraith Spire CPU cooler, ensuring efficient thermal management. What truly sets the 3400G apart is its exceptional value proposition. With a retail price of under $150, it offers tremendous performance for the cost, especially considering that its predecessor, the 2400G, was initially priced at $170. While the Accelerated Processing Unit is a very attractive name, make no mistake: an\u00a0APU is pretty much just a combination of a CPU and a GPU. Many Intel processors using Integrated graphics, for instance, are essentially the same as APUs. That being said, though, their graphics chips are much\u00a0less powerful than the ones inside these Ryzen APUs. Note; you can also use these strictly as CPUs by adding a dedicated GPU to your setup. A similar concept in a different sector of the industry is \u201cSoCs.\u201d SoC stands for System on Chip, and these tend to combine\u00a0all\u00a0components of the system onto a single, well, chip. This is seen most often in gaming consoles (both the\u00a0PS4\u00a0and\u00a0Xbox One, for instance, are using AMD SoCs), smartphones, and on rare occasions, laptops. There are many things to consider on the hunt for the best AMD Ryzen APU. Choosing the best AMD APU for your specific needs is important so that you aren\u2019t left with a product that doesn\u2019t meet your requirements. Let\u2019s go over a few key terms. Pairing your Ryzen CPU with a suitable set of RAM is more important than you might think. Ryzen CPU core communication speed is directly correlated to RAM speed, essentially meaning the slower the RAM the slower the CPU without getting overly complicated. Intel CPUs aren\u2019t affected in this manner as their CPUs are constructed a little differently. This is especially true for APUs as the system\u2019s RAM is also used as VRAM for the integrated graphics. Whether this is a Vega iGPU or a Radeon RX iGPU, it\u2019s the same case for both. This is because the integrated graphics portion of the Chip is built directly into the CPU, instead of being on a spacious GPU PCB where VRAM can be built with ease. Because of the spacial limitations being built into a CPU package presents, the iGPU has to get creative and use the already available system RAM as Video RAM. The sweet spot for AM4 Ryzen CPUs is 3600MHz, this speed of DDR4 RAM gives you the best returns, any speed beyond this you\u2019ll receive diminishing returns and as a result, less value for money. If you\u2019re planning on building a PC centered around an APU, it\u2019s a good idea to invest in a higher RAM capacity for reasons we mentioned earlier, to make sure the iGPU RAM requirements do not interfere with the rest of the system requirements. As for AM5 APUs, and the Ryzen 8000G processors, DDR5 is the RAM you want. There you want to look at around 6000MHz. Clock speed is the measurement of how many times per second a CPU can complete what\u2019s called an instruction Cycle, this cycle consists of three main actions. These actions are: fetch, decode, and execute. And it\u2019s these three actions that make up the fundamentals of CPU operation as we know it. This isn\u2019t just for desktop processors, this is the same on the mobile platform and OEM too, although clocked lower for efficiency\u2019s sake because of the power constraints being a mobile platform brings. Generally, when discussing and comparing CPUs in the same architecture, CPUs with the same or greater number of cores and a higher clock speed will perform better. \u2013 this is also a single-core performance metric, as cores with higher clock speeds will perform better in single-core workloads. The more CPU cores your CPU has the better at multitasking it will be. However, it all depends on whether the application or software you are using is coded for multiple cores. Some older programs are not and will generally perform no better when given access to more cores. For software that does support multi-core utilization, more cores are better. Core count is a metric for multi-core performance, As CPUs with a higher number of cores will perform better in multicore workloads, due to the abundance of available CPU cores. If you\u2019re interested in seeing how these APUs stack up, then check out our CPU hierarchy. Threads tell a similar story to cores, more threads make for a CPU that\u2019s better at multitasking natively. However, cores and threads are not created equal. All of the APUs on the list support SMT (Simultaneous Multithreading). This is AMD\u2019s version of Intel\u2019s Hyperthreading. This is a technology that allows one CPU core to process and execute two instructions at once. This means that the operating system can see and utilize your CPU as if it had double the number of physical cores. The collection of cores and threads is labeled \u2018logical processors\u2019 by operating systems. These threads are known as V-cores and are virtual, so named because they do not physically exist or occupy space on the CPU die. These virtual cores have to share resources with the physical cores and threads suffer slower processing speeds as a result. Again SMT relies on software integration and compatibility but it\u2019s better to have and not need than to need and not have. Most modern software has multithreading integration and support. If you want to know more about SMT you can read our in-depth feature on SMT. Graphics refers to the included \u201cGPU.\u201d In this case, the hierarchy starts with Vega 8 on the budget APU and ends with Vega 11 at the highest end, for now. If you\u2019re interested in seeing how these compare, then check out the comparable graphics cards below and our\u00a0GPU hierarchy. The iGPUs inside these APUs are very underpowered compared to dedicated graphics powered by your GPU. With that being said, however, you shouldn\u2019t write them off. APUs can be powerful enough for low-end 1080P gaming. Especially with the advancements made in AMD FSR and RSR. There are a few Ryzen APUs available now, but there are only a few that remain relevant in the current climate. Although we recommend the 3400G, we don\u2019t advise buying one new for a brand spanking PC build. There are plenty of APUs available for you to choose from. Although the Ryzen 8000 G series has made major strides over the 5000 series processors, AMD APUs are generally not better than dedicated GPUs, but they will absolutely beat out older GPUs. Ryzen 8000 series APUs are fantastic and can certainly hold their own in gaming performance, since they are based on RDNA3, they have AI enhancements such as FSR to help them along \u2013 which can be the difference between 1440P 30FPS and 1440P 60 FPS in some cases. We have a large range of in-depth buyer guides here on WePC and we would hate it if you missed the chance to read them, feel free to check out any of the related guides below. In the ever-evolving landscape of gaming APUs, AMD continues to push the boundaries with its impressive 8000G series chips, offering a harmonious fusion of CPU and GPU technologies. While standalone components may still outshine APUs in specific aspects, the unique advantages they bring to the table are hard to overlook. Now, with the new RDNA3 iGPUs, the possibilities are endless and offer theoretical performance gains of 3x over the 5000G series APUs.
