    "text": "Hexworks has released Title Update v.1.1.598 for Lords of the Fallen. According to the devs, this latest patch brings to the game performance optimizations, AMD stability improvements and PVP balance tweaks. Going into more details, in Patch 1.1.598, Hexworks made some changes to how the game loads levels to make it run smoother in certain areas like Skyrest Bridge and near the big boss fight with the Sundered Monarch. Also, the devs teamed up with AMD to fix crashes that were happening on AMD\u2019s graphics cards. So now, if you\u2019re playing on an AMD GPU, the game should be more stable. As said, Title Update 1.1.598 also packs numerous PVP balance tweaks. For example, the PVP damage multiplier was reduced from 0.5 to 0.25. Additionally, the PVP Status Effect buildup multiplier was decreased from 0.66 to 0.5. The dual wield status effect buildup was also reduced from 1.0 to 0.7, and the devs have made an overall balancing pass of spells. In Version 1.1.598, matchmaking now only pairs up players who have the same game version. This means you\u2019ll be playing against others with the same updates as you. Also, the devs fixed a problem where some special holy weapons were doing extra magic damage during invasions. Along with that, they sorted out a bunch of visual bugs and other problems in the game. Like always, Steam will download this update the next time you launch its client. Below you can also find its complete changelog. John is the founder and Editor in Chief at DSOGaming.
