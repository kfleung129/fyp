    "text": "MINISFORUM has shared full specifications for the V3, roughly six weeks after re-branding the device from the 'V3 AMD Tablet'. To recap, the company has previously confirmed that the MINISFORUM V3 would feature the following hardware: While it only refers to the APU as a 'Ryzen 7 flagship processor', the specifications listed on the MINISFORUM V3 product page all but confirm the presence of a Ryzen 7 8840U. Additionally, the 16:10 display is said to provide 500 nits peak brightness with 100% P3 Colour space coverage; other display features like response times remain unknown for now. Meanwhile, the device will actually come with a 50.82 Wh battery, as well as 2 MP front-facing (Windows Hello) and 5 MP rear-facing cameras. According to MINISFORUM, the V3 measures 318 x 213.8 x 9.8 mm and weighs 946 g. Presumably excluding its detachable keyboard cover, this footprint puts it in the mix with competitors like the ASUS ROG Flow Z13, Dell XPS 13 9315 and Microsoft Surface Pro 9. Unfortunately, pricing remains unknown for now, as does a precise release date beyond a commitment to a Q1 2024 launch. For reference, the MINISFORUM V3 will ship with the following connectivity: Purchase the MINISFORUM Venus UM790 Pro (AMD Ryzen 9 7940HS) on Amazon MINISFORUM "
