The Ryzen 8000G series are decent for code compilation workloads but you're best off getting a processor with as many CPU cores as you can afford if frequently compiling code with multiple jobs. The Core i9 14900K was slightly faster than the Ryzen 9 7950X at compiling the Linux kernel, but meant significantly higher power consumption.
