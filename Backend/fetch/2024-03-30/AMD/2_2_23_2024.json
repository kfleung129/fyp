Learn more If you want to know the best GPU for Ryzen 7 5800X processors, then we\u2019re here to make that process a doddle. Built upon TSMC\u2019s 7nm process, the 5800X fits 4.15 billion transistors into its 81mm\u00b2 die size. And it offers up 8 cores and 16 threads. These have the potential to clock at 3.8 GHz and boost up to 4.7 GHz. With a 105W, the older choice CPU is still a great option to this day even with AM5 out in the world. But what graphics card can match up to it? Balancing price and performance, you want to pair it well, otherwise you won\u2019t get the maximum performance out of your new (or old) processor. We keep all our guides as fresh as possible with the latest tech launches, where applicable, so you can rest assured that what you see below is the best currently available. We\u2019ve listed the top three picks immediately below if you\u2019re looking to waste no time and want to buy your GPU ASAP, alternatively read further below for the individual product reviews. Shop on Amazon Shop on Amazon Shop on Amazon Core clock speed 2,550MHz boost, 2,295MHz base CUDA cores 10,240 Memory 16GB GDDR6X Dimensions 330 x 136 x 58 mm PSU required 750W TBP 320W Our best GPU for the Ryzen 7 5800X is the RTX 4080 Super. Coming in from the Super upgrade of the Ada series, it does bring a bit more value to the 80 model. Especially as it starts off with a $200 lower MSRP so gamers don\u2019t have to pay as much of a premium on it, although that depends on which model you end up going for. Comparing the 4080 Super vs 4080 there\u2019s not too big of an improvement as we saw when we got hands-on with the 4080 Super. But the architecture is a really great choice of selection, as the Nvidia GPUs bring features and performance that are hard to match even for AMD. DLSS 3 with its frame generation, great rendering and ray tracing performance, and outright high frame rates make the 4080 Super a top contender for the high spot in the list. With a high FPS across the board, it is even a strong contender for 4K as well. The card comes with the AD103-400 GPU processor that offers up 10,240 CUDA cores, 320 TMUs, 112 ROPs, 80 SMs, 320 Tensor cores, and 80 RT cores. For the memory, it utilizes 16GB GDDR6X, with a 23Gbps clock across a 256-bit bus it has a 763GB/s bandwidth. All of this comes in a 320W TGP as the Gigabyte model reaches a 2,550MHz boost clock, in a card that comes in at a size of 330 x136 x58 mm. Core clock speed 2810MHz boost, 2539MHz game Streaming processors 2,048 Memory 16GB GDDR6 Dimensions 281.4 x 116.6 x 52.6 mm PSU required 600W TBP 190W When it comes to a more budget GPU for the 5800X then the RX 7600 XT is a great choice for the job. The more entry-level RDNA 3 card comes as a more modern choice with an improvement to its capabilities over the previous gen. It certainly bolsters AMD GPUs as a great value choice as Nvidia hardly competes at that level. For that offering, the RX 7600 XT brings 16GB of GDDR6 memory, clocked in at 18Gbps with a 128-bit bus providing a bandwidth of 288 GB/s. Along with 2,048 steam processors, 128 TMUs, 64 ROPs, 42 CUs, and 32 RT cores. It comes with a launch price of $329 and a power package of 190W. For the Gigabyte Gaming OC, you have a boost clock speed up to 2.81 GHz, with the game clock up to 2.539 GHz. But it does come in a more compact size as well 281.4 x 116.6 x 52.6 mm to keep things powerful but fitting in a lot of smaller builds. Even though it might be limited in tiers, the Radeon support does provide it with strong enhancements, such as RSR bolstering its gaming performance. But even without that, we saw the 7600 XT performance do well in our testing. It will be a great pairing to the Ryzen gaming CPU. Core Clock Speed 1,895 MHz base, 2,395 MHz shader & game, 2,565 MHz boost Stream processors 6,144 Memory Size 24GB GDDR6 Dimensions 352.9 x 158.2 x 72.6 mm PSU Required 850W TBP 355W Now if you\u2019re looking for the utmost performance, the AMD CPU fits well with a Radeon card. Currently, there is no better choice than the RX 7900 XTX. Based upon RDNA 3, the card brings plenty of improvements that push the performance of the card far. And especially with the build of the TUF model, there is plenty of potential there as it shines as the best graphics cards from AMD currently. The card comes with 6,144 stream processors, 384 TUMs, 192 ROPs, 96 CUs, and 96 RT cores in the Navi 31 XTX RDNA 3 card that also utilizes an MCM split design. The VRAM utilizes 24GB of GDDR6 with a 3840-bit memory bus clocks at 20 Gbps to provide a bandwidth of 960 GB/s, with a power rating of 355W. As for the TUF model, it has a game clock of 2,395MHz and 2,455MHz in OC mode, with the boost reaching 2,565MHz, and 2,615MHz in OC mode. It also measures a rather large 352.9 x 158.2 x 72.6 mm. We got hands-on with the 7900 XTX and found it to have an exceptional performance for a gaming GPU. Of course, it may not be as effective in ray tracing and productivity tasks but for matching the 5800X it does incredibly well. Running the game at max settings and in 4K, Radeon has brought a strong contender to the table. As you look to enjoy the use of the 5800X, you may be wondering if you need to actually pair it up with a graphics card. But as part of the Zen 3 family, not all the CPUs AMD has come with onboard graphics. Not being a processor with the G suffix, the 5800X does not have integrated graphics. That means you won\u2019t get any output at all. Even if it did, onboard graphics aren\u2019t great for anything too intensive. Gaming on them is not a good option as the performance will be lacking as well. For the best GPU for the 5800X, we have a range of options to pick from. The top choice is the RTX 4080 Super. Whilst the budget choice would be the RX 7600 XT an exceptional card to pair it with is the RX 7900 XTX. Being a solid CPU, any GPU you choose for it will be a strong contender for great performance across the board.
