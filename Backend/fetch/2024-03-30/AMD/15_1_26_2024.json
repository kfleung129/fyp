    "text": "Carrying the AN16-41-R5KC model number, the Acer Nitro 16 gaming laptop with the octa-core AMD Ryzen 9 7940HS processor and Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 graphics under the hood packs quite a punch in the sub-$1,500 area of the market (obviously, one should keep in mind that this is a discounted price). Its Amazon list price is $1,799.99 and the average shown by Camelcamelcamel is $1,647.49, so the ongoing $1,499.99 deal is a pretty good one, although the 17% discount isn't stellar. The lowest price recorded by the Amazon price tracker mentioned above is $1,429.99, for those who might have been wondering about this detail. The full list of specs and features of this machine is quite attractive, as it also includes 16 GB DDR5 memory, a 1 TB PCIe Gen 4 SSD, Wi-Fi 6E connectivity, as well as an RGB backlit keyboard. The 16-inch G-Sync Compatible display has a resolution of 2,560 x 1,600 pixels, up to 165 Hz refresh rate, and uses an IPS panel. The operating system is Windows 11 Home. Although this particular model hasn't been under our scope, its sibling with an\u00a0AMD Ryzen 7 7735HS\u00a0inside visited our labs for an in-depth review and didn't fail to impress. The conclusion of the review is that Acer delivers \"a well-specced, mid-range gaming laptop\" and that the Nitro 16 doesn't have any fatal weaknesses. Its minor flaws include the rather ubiquitous loudness encountered in this class, thermal SSD throttling, and occasional sub-par gaming performance.
