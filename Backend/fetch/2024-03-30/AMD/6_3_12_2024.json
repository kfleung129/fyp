NVIDIA DLSS, or Deep Learning Super Sampling, uses artificial intelligence (AI) and dedicated Tensor cores found on NVIDIA RTX series GPUs to boost gaming performance without compromising visual fidelity. That said, the latest version, DLSS 3.5, in its full glory, is exclusive to the RTX 40-series GPUs. Thankfully, there\u2019s AMD with its FSR technology. It\u2019s an open-source technology, and the modding community has devised a clever workaround to use AMD FSR on NVIDIA RTX GPUs. That means you get to enjoy frame generation on your existing RTX card, allowing you to experience smoother gameplay and potentially significant performance boosts in supported games. In this guide, we\u2019ll walk you through the steps to use AMD FSR3 on your NVIDIA RTX GPUs. So, let\u2019s get to it. If you\u2019re on a previous generation of NVIDIA\u2019s RTX GPUs, chances are that your GPU still handles most games very well. That said, you are still missing out on the extra boost that DLSS 3.5 would have provided. That\u2019s where the AMD FSR3 mod comes in handy. This mod allows you to experience frame generation technology without upgrading to the latest RTX 40 series. It translates to smoother gameplay and performance improvements in supported titles. While it\u2019s not an official solution and might not work with every game, it\u2019s a simple and free way to boost your gaming performance. Before we walk you through the actual steps to use the AMD FSR3 mod, ensuring that your system is compatible is important. First and foremost, the mod only works on NVIDIA RTX 20-Series or 30-Series GPUs. Secondly, you can use it in titles that natively support DLSS 3 or FSR 3 frame generation. Finally, ensure you have the latest NVIDIA GPU drivers installed for your graphics card. You can download them from the official NVIDIA website linked below. Download NVIDIA Drivers Now that you have your system ready, it\u2019s time to install the AMD FSR3 mod and use it. Here\u2019s how to go about it. Step 1: First, enable Hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling by heading to Windows Settings > System > Display > Graphics > Default graphics settings. Enable the toggle and restart your PC to apply the changes. Step 2: Next, download the latest build of the dlssg-to-fsr3 mod from the link below. While there are different versions available, the standard version should work. Download dlssg-to-fsr3 Mod Click on the \u2018Manual Download\u2019 option as shown. Note that you must sign up at NexusMods to download the file. That said, it\u2019s a free download, so you don\u2019t have to pay anything. Step 3: Once the mod\u2019s ZIP file has been downloaded, extract it to a folder of your location. Inside the extracted folder, you\u2019ll find several DLL files and a configuration file, as shown below. Step 4: Now, in another Windows Explorer window, navigate to the installation location of the game you wish to install the mod in. For example, for Cyberpunk 2077, this is the directory containing Cyberpunk2077.exe. Step 5: Now, go back to the folder where you extracted the mod\u2019s files. From there, copy the \u2018dlssg_to_fsr3_amd_is_better.dll\u2019 and \u2018nvngx.dll\u2019 files and paste them to the game\u2019s folder. Step 6: Finally, double-click on the \u2018DisableNvidiaSignatureChecks\u2019 registry file inside the mod folder. This will fool your PC into thinking that your GPU is DLSS 3 compliant, even if not. Ensure that permissions are granted if requested to add values to your registry. Step 7: And that\u2019s it. The AMD FSR3 mod has been installed. You can now launch the game and head over to the graphics settings. There, the option to enable DLSS 3 should be available. Enable it, and you\u2019re done. As good as the FSR3 Mod is, there are some issues with it. For starters, certain UI and HUD elements might not render properly. Secondly, some users have noticed increased input latency with certain titles. Finally, while the mod works great for single-player modes, if you plan on gaming online, disable the mod to avoid the risk of getting banned. Thankfully, the way to uninstall the AMD FSR3 mod is simple. Step 1: Navigate to the game\u2019s installation folder as before. Now, delete both \u2018dlssg_to_fsr3_amd_is_better.dll\u2019 and \u2018nvngx.dll\u2019 files. Step 2: Next, open the mod\u2019s extracted folder and double-click on the \u2018RestoreNvidiaSignatureChecks\u2019 file. This will restore your registry to the way it was. Using the AMD FSR 3 mod provides a unique opportunity for owners of Nvidia RTX 20 and 30 series GPUs to experience frame generation technology previously exclusive to the latest RTX 40-series cards. While it\u2019s not without its limitations and potential risks, the mod brings enhanced performance and visual quality to a wider audience. We hope that with our detailed guide, you successfully installed and used the AMD FS3 mod on your NVIDIA RTX GPU. So, enjoy the extra frames for the lost cost of zero bucks on your gaming rig.
