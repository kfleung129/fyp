Learn more Escape From Tarkov is an extremely popular and competitive first-person shooter game that has gained a huge following in recent years. It\u2019s not particularly demanding on hardware, as the minimum requirements are fairly low. However, if you\u2019re building a new gaming PC, you may wonder about the best CPU for Escape From Tarkov. Shop on Amazon Shop on Amazon Shop on Amazon We\u2019ll be covering two of the best value gaming processors for this guide. Escape From Tarkov can run on nearly any machine out there, so our recommendations are based on performance per dollar rather than just raw performance. With that said, here are our picks for the best CPU for Escape From Tarkov. If you\u2019re looking for a pure gaming CPU then the core count matters less than the core speed does, as games often don\u2019t utilize more than a few cores. What you need is a CPU that already has a high base and boosts CPU core speed. With that being said, you should probably consider picking up an overclockable CPU. This will help extend its life cycle, as you can pump some extra juice through the Cores to speed things up a bit when it starts to slow down. Cores 14 Threads 20 Base speed P-cores 3.5 GHz / E-cores 2.6 GHz Boost speed P-cores 5.1 GHz / E-cores 3.9 GHz Cache 20MB TDP 125 W / 181 W boost. Specs: The Intel Core i5 13600K is a fantastic processor for the price. Thanks to its high core count, excellent single-threaded performance, and a boost clock of up to 5.1 GHz, it delivers superb performance in modern games and also works well for professional workloads. For Escape From Tarkov, it\u2019s difficult to find a better processor at this price. While it may be overkill just for running the game, any processor could handle that with ease, it is a good long-term investment considering the CPU performs incredibly well in other modern titles too. Pair with a good Z690 or Z790 motherboard and DDR5 memory for the best possible performance. Other than that, if you can pair this CPU with a PCIe Gen 4 drive, you\u2019ll have quite a powerful rig that can handle triple-A games at high settings for the next couple of years. Speed 3.7GHz/ 4.6GHz Core (Threads) 6/12 Socket AM4 TDP 65W Specs: Yet again, we can\u2019t help but recommend the Ryzen 5 5600X. We covered this in a similar guide previously. Thanks to the six cores, excellent gaming performance, and great value proposition, the 5600X proves to be a great processor for Escape from Tarkov. On top of all of that, the 5600X is still a great processor for modern games. It will continue to handle upcoming intensive games without many issues. It proves to be an even better choice if you play at a higher resolution since games are not CPU-bound at resolutions higher than 1080p. CPU-intensive games and GPU-intensive games are terms used to describe the type of computer games that rely on either the CPU or GPU for their performance. The CPU, or Central Processing Unit, is responsible for executing instructions and managing processes, while the GPU, or Graphics Processing Unit, is responsible for rendering images and animations. CPU-intensive games typically rely heavily on the CPU\u2019s processing power to execute complex game mechanics, handle artificial intelligence, and manage physics calculations. These types of games often have large open worlds, intricate environments, and high levels of interactivity that require significant CPU resources. Examples of CPU-intensive games include strategy games, simulation games, and massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs). On the other hand, GPU-intensive games rely heavily on the GPU\u2019s graphical processing power to render high-quality graphics, animations, and visual effects. These types of games often have high-resolution textures, complex lighting effects, and advanced particle systems that require significant GPU resources. Examples of GPU-intensive games include first-person shooters, racing games, and action-adventure games. To sum it up, the Intel Core i5 13600K and Ryzen 5 5600X are the best CPUs for Escape from Tarkov. Both provide excellent value, though one is cheaper than the other. Either way, you can\u2019t go wrong with one or the other. As a Junior Staff Writer, Jack is involved in writing and maintaining a bunch of hardware guides & reviews.
