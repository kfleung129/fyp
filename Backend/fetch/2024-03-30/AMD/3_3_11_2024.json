Our strengthened team provides us with an opportunity to enrich and accelerate the AXPAXLI clinical programs.\u201d Dr. Dugel concluded, \u201cI believe the Company has made outstanding progress over the last several months, with the initiation of the Phase 3 SOL-1 study with AXPAXLI in wet AMD and successful financings that raised more than $440 million in gross proceeds from existing and new top tier health care investors. Further, I believe that wet AMD is just the beginning for AXPAXLI. We look forward to providing an update on the Company\u2019s strategy and objectives related to our increased focus on retinal disease during our upcoming Investor Day, planned for the second quarter 2024.\u201d Recent Achievements: Anticipated Upcoming Milestones: Fourth Quarter and Year End\u00a0December 31, 2023\u00a0Financial Results Total cash and cash equivalents (Cash) were $195.8 million as of December 31, 2023. The Company also completed a private placement of common shares in February 2024 that provided gross proceeds of $325.0 million, before deducting placement agent fees and offering expenses. Based on current plans and related estimates of anticipated cash inflows from DEXTENZA\u00ae, the Company believes that its current cash balance is sufficient to support its planned expenses, obligations and capital expenditure requirements into at least 2028. Total net revenue includes both gross DEXTENZA product revenue, net of discounts, rebates, and returns, which the Company refers to as net product revenue; and collaboration revenue. Total net revenue was\u00a0$14.8 million\u00a0for the fourth quarter of 2023, a 5.0% increase over total net revenue of $14.1 million in the comparable period in 2022, driven by DEXTENZA sales. Total net revenue for the full year 2023 was\u00a0$58.4 million\u00a0versus\u00a0$51.5 million\u00a0in 2022, an increase of 13.4%. Research and development expenses for the fourth quarter of 2023 were $16.2 million versus $13.5 million for the comparable period in 2022, driven primarily by an increase in overall clinical and regulatory expenses associated with product development programs. Overall R&D expenses for the full year increased $7.6 million to $61.1 million from $53.5 million in 2022, reflecting the timing and conduct of our clinical trials. Selling and marketing expenses were $9.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, as compared to $10.5 million for the comparable quarter of 2022, primarily reflecting a reduction in personnel costs driven by lower expense for stock-based compensation and other items. Overall, selling and marketing expenses for the full year increased nominally to $40.5 million from $39.9 million in 2022, related to an increase in personnel costs and other costs, offset by lower spend on professional services. General and administrative expenses were $8.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 versus $8.3 million in the comparable quarter of 2022, lower primarily due to a reduction of professional-related fees and other expenses. Overall, G&A expenses for the full year increased by $1.7 million to $33.9 million from $32.2 million in 2022, related to an increase of personnel-related expenses, including stock-based compensation, partially offset by lower professional-related fees and other expenses. Net loss for the fourth quarter of 2023 was\u00a0$(29.2) million, or a loss of\u00a0$(0.35)\u00a0per share on both a basic and diluted basis, compared to a net loss of\u00a0$(15.5) million, or net loss of\u00a0$(0.20)\u00a0per share on a basic basis and a loss of\u00a0$(0.24)\u00a0per share on a diluted basis, for the comparable period in 2022. The net loss in the fourth quarter of 2023 included a\u00a0$(6.5) million\u00a0non-cash expense attributable to changes in the fair value of the derivative liabilities associated with the Company\u2019s convertible notes and the Barings credit facility versus the net\u00a0loss in the fourth quarter of 2022 that included\u00a0a\u00a0$5.2\u00a0million\u00a0non-cash\u00a0gain attributable to the derivative liability associated with the Company\u2019s convertible notes. Non-cash charges for stock-based compensation and depreciation and amortization were\u00a0$5.3 million\u00a0in the fourth quarter of 2023 versus\u00a0$4.7 million\u00a0for the comparable quarter in 2022. Overall, the Company reported a net loss of\u00a0$(80.7) million,\u00a0or a loss of\u00a0$(1.01)\u00a0per share on a basic basis and a loss of\u00a0$(1.02)\u00a0on a diluted basis, for the year ended\u00a0December 31, 2023\u00a0versus a net loss of\u00a0$(71.0) million,\u00a0or a loss of\u00a0$(0.92)\u00a0per share on a basic basis and a loss of\u00a0$(0.97)\u00a0on a diluted basis, for the year ended December 31, 2022.
