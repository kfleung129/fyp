We've run hundreds of GPU benchmarks on Nvidia, AMD, and Intel graphics cards and ranked them in our comprehensive hierarchy, with over 80 GPUs tested.  The results below are from our previous version of the GPU benchmarks hierarchy, using a different test suite and test PC (Core i9-9900K) and combining results from nine games with six resolution and setting combinations. All of the scores are combined (via a geometric mean calculation) into a single overall result, which tends to penalize the fastest and slowest GPUs \u2014 CPU bottlenecks come into play at 1080p medium, while VRAM limitations can kill performance at 4K ultra.\n\nThese results have not been updated since early 2022, when we added the RTX 3050 and RX 6500 XT to the list. We won't be adding future GPUs to this table, so there's no RTX 40-series, RX 7000-series, Arc, 3090 Ti, 6950 XT, 6750 XT, or 6650 XT, but it does help to provide a look at a slightly less demanding suite of games, where 6GB or more VRAM isn't generally required at 1080p ultra settings. You can use these older results to help inform your purchase decisions, if you don't typically run the latest games at maxed out settings. Below is our legacy desktop GPU hierarchy dating back to the late 1990s. We have not tested most of these cards in many years, driver support has ended on most of these models, and the relative rankings are pretty coarse. Note that we also don't factor in memory bandwidth or features like AMD's Infinity Cache or Nvidia's larger L2 cache on Ada Lovelace. The list below is mostly intended to show relative performance between architectures from a similar time period.\n\nWe sorted the table by the theoretical GFLOPS, though on architectures that don't support unified shaders, we only have data for \"Gops/s\" (giga operations per second). That's GeForce 7 and Radeon X1000 and earlier \u2014 basically anything from before 2007. We've put an asterisk (*) next to the GPU names for those cards, and they comprise the latter part of the table. Comparing pre-2007 GPUs against each other should be relatively meaningful, but trying to compare those older GPUs against newer GPUs gets a bit convoluted.\n\nThese results are, at best, merely theoretical and we don't have recent benchmarks for most of the GPUs. As one recent example, AMD's new RX 7900 XTX/XT sit in spots two and three even though the RTX 4080 generally beats the 7900 XT. Take the following with a healthy dose of skepticism and a liberal sprinkling of salt, in other words, but it does contain a list of just about every major desktop GPU from the past 25 years. * - Denotes performance measured in \"GOps\" \u2014 gigaoperations per second \u2014 as opposed to GFLOPS. Older GPU architectures without unified shader support aren't directly comparable with newer architectures.
