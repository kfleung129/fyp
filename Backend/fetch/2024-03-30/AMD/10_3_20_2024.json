AM4 users can opt for the 5700X if they are seeking a budget-oriented CPU that will also perform greatly in productivity. However, we currently have several other AMD and Intel processors under deal which users can find below.  Gamers interested in upgrading to a newer CPU from Team Red will find the AMD Ryzen 5 7600X to be of spectacular value thanks to its high single-core performance, efficient hexacore architecture, and compatibility with newer technology such as PCI-E 5.0 and DDR5 memory. It also abandons AMD's AM4 design, going for a pin-less processor offering by moving them to the motherboard instead. The AMD Ryzen 7 5700X is a mid-to-high-end gaming CPU that has a maximum clock speed of 4.6 GHz. According to AMD it can deliver over 100 FPS performance in some of the world's most popular games with a compatible graphics card. The processor has 8 cores and 16 processing threads, which are based on the AMD Zen 3 architecture.Other specs include 36 MB of cache, DDR4-3200 support, and overclocking capability. The AMD Ryzen 7 5700X CPU is compatible with a Socket AM4 motherboard. The Ryzen 9 5900X desktop processor from AMD is one of the high-end CPUs that the company offers. It has a staggering 12 cores and 24\u00a0processing threads, which provide excellent multitasking capabilities.

The processor is also unlocked for overclocking, and according to AMD, it can deliver over 100 fps in the most popular games. This processor doesn't come with a cooler and is compatible with the Socket AM4 motherboards. The AMD Ryzen 5 5500 is a 6 core 12 thread processor that is an entry level 5000 series AMD Ryzen-based processor, featuring Zen 3 cores, but a relatively crippled PCI-E 3.0 interface at the processor level. This makes it an appealing choice over the 5600/5600X based on price alone. Team Red fans can snag the Ryzen 7 7800X3D for a drastically discounted price compared to its regular price. The 7800X3D easily outperforms even the best of the best high-end gaming CPUs from both AMD and Intel's latest-generation CPU lineups. With an 8-core/16-thread config and 96MB of L3 cache, it gets enough juice to max out gaming titles when combined with a high-end gaming CPU. Nonetheless, the Ryzen 5 7600X is yet another fantastic mid-range AM5 CPU, which also does an impressive job. With productivity and single-core performance exceeding even the previous gen octa-core processors, the Ryzen 7600X is roughly at the same level as the Ryzen 7 5800X3D from the previous gen. Based on the Zen 4 architecture, the 7600X brings very high clock speeds that remain consistently above 5.0GHz even without overclocking, resulting in superior performance compared to the best AM4 CPUs. Still, if users want to go even cheaper, the Ryzen 7 5700X will be a wonderful option that won't compromise gaming performance or productivity and will be easy on the wallet. The 5700X is also overclockable but needs a good B550 or X570 motherboard if stability is the priority. Ryzen 5700X can also work just fine on entry-level motherboards like those with an A520 chipset. However, that closes the door to overclocking, but it does allow cutting the cost even further. If that still doesn't fit into the wallet, users will be better off with the entry-level Ryzen 5 5500 CPU, which is a 6-core/12-thread CPU and is also highly power efficient. It is also overclockable, but with its L3 cache memory cut in half compared to its bigger siblings like the 5600X, there is a noticeable impact on performance. This problem, however, isn't going to exist with the Ryzen 9 5900X, which is perhaps the only 12-core CPU available for less than $300 and destroys a lot of processors like a walk in the park. Its excellent multicore performance can crunch big numbers, speed up the rendering process, and other such tasks.
