    "text": "If there is something that cannot be discussed amd, is the fact that they do things well, not only because of the processors they launch and that allow you to have a computer with the maximum possible performance for games, but also because of the support they offer.  The company knows perfectly well what people want their products for, so they tend to develop software that allows people to adjust their products however they want, as is the case with the AMD Ryzen Master. For some time we have been seeing how amd It offers those people who want an extremely powerful computer the ability to optimize and increase the performance of its components in the simplest way possible.  We have seen it with the application of AMD software: Adrenalin Edition for your graphics cards, as well as the Ryzen Master application itself for your processors, and the customization offered by these software is all we need for our PC to work as we want.  This software is basically an application that can be used to completely configure the operation of a processor. Ryzen, that is, it is not necessary to modify it from the BIOS.  This is extremely useful for those people who are looking to customize the power of their computer in the simplest way possible, although obviously this always comes with certain problems, since in the end, if you do not know what you are doing it can cause major setbacks.  And in the end it is a software to modify the voltages and operation of our processor, so using it without having certain knowledge is problematic, although as always, amd It thinks about everyone and includes predefined settings so that everyone can use it.  Although it is always better to consult various sources before touching anything, since it not only helps avoid problems, but it is also possible to find the perfect fit for our processor.  In the new version of this software, amd has implemented several important changes, of which we should highlight two that directly affect the operation of this application.  The first novelty that this update offers is support for the new processors that the company has launched, those that belong to the series 8000these are the following: But this is not the only thing it brings, since the most important change after compatibility with the new range of CPUs that the company has launched has to do directly with the operation of this application.  And now it will be possible to directly apply the changes we want related to the Curve Optimize in our Ryzensince the values \u200b\u200bof the curve optimizer can now also be applied on the fly, which means that it will not be necessary to restart the computer to apply these changes, allowing us to check their operation in real time, which can save us a large amount of time.
