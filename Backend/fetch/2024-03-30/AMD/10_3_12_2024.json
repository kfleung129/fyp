The Stadium provides a pitch that is equally beneficial to bowlers and hitters. Pacers are likely to do marginally better on this track than spinners. Batters must find a means to score big while avoiding early swings with the ball. After winning the toss, teams tend to chase the total, with the average first innings score being 104.
