    "text": "AMD\u2019s new Ryzen desktop CPUs for AM4 socket, already in Europe.  The first entries for soon to be launched AMD Ryzen 5000 desktop SKUs have been uncovered on a European price comparison site, as discovered by hardware leaker @momomo_us. It appears that certain retailers have already listed the new Ryzen 7 5700X3D and Ryzen 5 5500GT, some even claiming that they are in stock and ready for shipping. The eight-core Ryzen 7 5700X3D has been spotted on two retail platforms, with prices ranging from \u20ac270 to \u20ac280. This is just \u20ac10-20 cheaper compared to the 5800X3D current price. While it is reported that the 5700X3D may have lower clock speeds than the 5800X3D, neither of the two retailers has officially confirmed the detailed specifications yet. However, according to the screenshot below, the 5700X3D should offer 4.1 GHz clock, 400 MHz lower than 5800X3D.

The available data, sourced from retailers, seems to be populated with partial information obtained from a distributor. The official data from price comparison site Geizhals only specifies compatibility with AMD A520, B550, and X570 motherboards, omitting any reference to 300 and 400 series chipsets. This particular SKU is currently listed with prices ranging from \u20ac134 to \u20ac160. The launch date for AMD\u2019s upcoming AM4 CPU series has not been officially confirmed, but unofficial indications strongly suggest a release this quarter. The existence of retailer listings is a clear signal that the launch is imminent, with expectations leaning towards days or weeks rather than months.
