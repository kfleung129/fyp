The analyst maintained a Buy rating on\u00a0\u00a0Advanced Micro Devices, Inc\u00a0AMD with a\u00a0price target of $195. Both stocks are trading lower on Wednesday. The analyst said that Nvidia holds a dominant position in the $85 billion+ accelerator market, with its leadership in the data center sector driving the majority of its sales. Data center sales will likely exceed 85% of Nvidia\u2019s total sales, a significant increase from about 25% five years ago and around 50% for AMD, up from 10%-15%.

The Hopper (H100/HGX) platform constitutes the vast majority of Nvidia\u2019s data center revenue, with AMD\u2019s data center GPU revenue jumping to approximately $400 million in the fourth quarter, primarily due to shipments for the new El Capitan Supercomputer, the analyst said. Arya cited significant growth in the $85-$90 billion accelerator market, with an estimated total addressable market (TAM) of about $180 billion, still below the bull case estimates of vendors like AMD ($400 billion). In the gaming segment, he stated that the discrete GPU (dGPU) market for PC gaming, low-end PCs, and consoles will likely contribute about 10%-15% of Nvidia and AMD sales over the next few years. In 2023, the dGPU market amounted to $10.4 billion, up 11% year-on-year, with fourth-quarter sales reaching $2.9 billion, up 3% quarter-on-quarter, and a robust 60% year-on-year, benefiting from strong unit growth and price strength, Arya highlighted. Upcoming catalysts include Nvidia\u2019s GTC event on March 18, focusing on Generative Artificial Intelligence and updates on Nvidia\u2019s accelerator and networking roadmaps, as per Arya.\u00a0Broadcom Inc\u2019s\u00a0AVGO analyst day will also provide insights into custom ASIC offerings and advancements in Ethernet for AI networking.
