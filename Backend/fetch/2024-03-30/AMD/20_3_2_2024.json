    "text": "NVIDIA had a highly successful 2023, breaking into the $1 trillion (and then the $2 trillion) club, selling a gazillion Tensor core GPUs. TSMC was its primary foundry partner for the GeForce and AI GPUs, significantly increasing its stake at the Taiwanese fab. NVIDIA became TSMC\u2019s 2nd biggest customer in 2023, accounting for 11% of the latter\u2019s net revenue. NVIDIA\u2019s chip manufacturing bill at TSMC grew to NT$241.15 billion (US$7.3 billion), accounting for 11% of the foundry\u2019s net revenue. Apple was the only other client with a higher (significantly higher) total at NT$546.55 billion (US$17.52 billion), up from NT$529.65 billion the year before. It held a 25% share in TSMC\u2019s net revenue in 2023, up from 23% in 2022. Apple and NVIDIA were the only chipmakers to account for more than 10% of TSMC\u2019s revenue share. Its other major clients, including AMD, MediaTek, and Qualcomm, remained under 10%. Nonetheless, ten foundry clients accounted for 91% of TSMC\u2019s net revenue in 2023, up from 82% the year before. NVIDIA\u2019s rivals are likely among them. Via: Dan Nystedt "
