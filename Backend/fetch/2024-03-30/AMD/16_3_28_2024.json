Whether it's better for a gamer to design a system or purchase one of the best prebuilt PCs is a debate that's been raging for years. Particularly for inexperienced PC builders, it's tempting just to spend money on a ready-to-go system instead of struggling to design a cheap PC build. In reality, while the prebuilt approach is the fastest way to enjoy the many benefits of PC gaming, selecting and installing parts to build a customized rig is now easier than ever before. There are plenty of online resources that suggest compatible build configurations, replete with links to purchase the necessary components at the lowest prices possible. When assembling a budget gaming PC build, some key factors include deciding on an Intel or AMD processor which will dictate the choice of other components like motherboards. Buyers will also have to wrestle with whether to save money on a CPU with integrated graphics or choose a budget graphics card which adds to the total cost of a system considerably. Finally, even an affordable gaming PC can come in a variety of form factors from mini ITX to ATX, housed in compact or full-tower cases. Whatever route a gamer goes, these four budget gaming PC build options are great introductions to the exciting world of custom-made PCs. The team at Game Rant has published (and regularly updates) guides that cater to a variety of budgets for gamers divided into multiple price-based tiers: For users looking to spend or budget around $500, Game Rant recommends one of the 4 builds below depending on one's desired use and upgrade requirements in the future: Intel Core i3-14100F is a refreshed version of the i3 13100F, now with higher clock speeds that go beyond 4.5GHz. Based on the Raptor Lake Refresh architecture, the CPU brings 4 performance cores and a total of 8 threads to get started with any small or medium-scale application. With its capable single-core performance, it is able to outperform almost every entry-level processor in gaming while remaining efficient. Patriot's Viper Steel line of DDR4 memory uses a custom aluminum heat spreader to keep temperatures in check. The\u00a0Patriot Viper Steel DDR4 16GB ram supports XMP 2.0 for excellent overclocking potential.

It also comes with a secondary M2 slot for a Wi-Fi adapter for users inclined to go that route in the future. The motherboard above needs to be updated to a higher version of the onboard BIOS to support the Intel Core i3 14100F. If users are unsure of how to proceed, the team at Game Rant recommends buying a newer budget motherboard that supports the 14th-generation CPU out of the box instead. With a single 16GB to-spec RAM module picked for the current build, users can push their memory configuration to 32GB with ease by buying another cost-effective Patriot Viper memory module in the future for the empty DIMM slot. On the GPU front, the discounted low-profit ASRock Arc A380 offers acceptable performance at a price tag where it delivers a higher amount of VRAM on offer than the competition. For this budget gaming build, the well-priced Thermaltake Versa H18 provides more potential for expansion than most other compact cases and has a clear side window for a premium look. Gamers can install up to four 2.5-inch hard drives or 2 x 2.5-inch and 2 x 3.5-inch hard drives simultaneously, with the 500GB Kingston NV2 NVMe SSD allowing users to take advantage of all 4 going forward. With a 550W Apevia PSU in play to ensure there is enough power on tap for the CPU and GPU to run smoothly, the build still manages to come in at just under $500, while delivering significantly better value for money than its competition in 2024. On the cooling front there is a single fan preinstalled at the rear of the case, but up to eight more can be installed. Combined with a mesh front panel, the fan layout of the Versa H18 should keep the temps of this relatively low-powered gaming rig under control. The\u00a0AMD Ryzen 5 8600G 6-Core, 12-Thread CPU is a powerful entry-level gaming APU that combines AMD's efficient and performant mobile Zen 4 cores with a capable iGPU in the shape of the AMD Radeon 760M.It packs in acceptable gaming performance at a price point that decimates most of its comparable discrete GPU and CPU combinations even as it is one of the first CPUs or APUs that pack AMD's Ryzen AI tech to support on-chip AI acceleration. Corsair's Vengeance RGB DDR5 RAM kit features dual RAM modules, each having 16GB memory capacity. It's XMP 3.0 compatible and is easier to overclock to its advertised frequency at tight timings.
