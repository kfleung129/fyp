    "text": "Modder \u2018gramern\u2019 has released a new mod that aims to fix the annoying ghosting issues that PC gamers were getting when using the AMD FSR 3.0 Frame Generation Mod. Going into more details, the mod eliminates the most irritating frame-gen ghosting behind cars and motorcycles while driving in a 3rd person view. It also manages to slightly reduce ghosting when driving bikes in first-person view. What this mod basically does is disable Frame Interpolation in the area behind the vehicles. However, the rest of the scene is still being interpolated. As such, you can get higher framerates without the ghosting issues. It\u2019s a clever trick that the modder discovered. And, from the looks of it, it works pretty great. According to gramern, this fix is compatible with both LukeFZ\u2019s and Nukem\u2019s AMD FSR 3.0 Mods. So, if you\u2019ve been using them, you can download this fix from this link. From what we know, CDPR does plan to add native support for AMD FSR 3.0. After all, AMD has included CP2077 in the list of its upcoming games that will support it. However, there is no ETA on when this will happen. So, until then, you\u2019ll have to rely on these mods. If you\u2019re into Cyberpunk 2077, there are some other cool mods you should check out. For instance, you can download the\u00a0Enhanced Photo Mode Unlocker. There\u2019s also a\u00a0mod that allows cars to fly, a\u00a0mod that can significantly improve the game\u2019s draw distance, and\u00a0other mods\u00a0that can open up new areas to explore. Oh, and don\u2019t forget these\u00a0mods that allow you to play as Ciri from The Witcher 3. Additionally, there\u2019s a\u00a0mod that adds realistic ragdoll physics to finishing moves. Plus,\u00a0Law Enforcement Overhaul\u00a0is a mod that enhances the game\u2019s Police System. And there\u2019s even a mod that integrates the\u00a0OpenAI API which enables ChatGPT support. Let\u2019s also not forget Cyberpunk 2077 HD Reworked. There is also this mod that fixes the game\u2019s broken Ray Tracing Reflections. And finally, this\u00a0mod restores 100 NPCs that were cut from the game. Have fun! John is the founder and Editor in Chief at DSOGaming.
