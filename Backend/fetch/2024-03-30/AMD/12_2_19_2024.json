    "text": "Jo\u00e3o Silva \nFebruary 19, 2024\nFeatured Tech News, Graphics  AMD and its partners have recently expanded the availability of the RX 7900 GRE. Originally launched as an exclusive GPU for the Chinese market, AMD is now launching the RX 7900 GRE via system integrators in other markets. Following the launch into European retailers, the card has arrived in the UK, with reports claiming the US is coming next. As noted by TechPowerUp, the XFX reference design Radeon RX 7900 GRE is the first model to be available in the UK (now sold out). Priced at \u00a3659.99, the card may not be considered a fantastic value, especially since the RX 7900 XT is currently available for \u00a3699.

According to VideoCardz, the Gigabyte RX 7900 GRE variant is expected to be available in the US later this month. Moreover, AMD announced that the RX 7900 GRE will be available for $549. Sitting between the RX 7900 XT and the RX 7800 XT, the AMD RX 7900 GRE has more cores than its Navi 32-based sibling but packs the same amount of memory (16GB GDDR6). However, note that the Radeon RX 7900 GRE memory is running at 18Gbps instead of 19.5Gbps. Discuss on our Facebook page, HERE.
