Your information is safe with us. The AMD RX 6950 XT is one of the best-performing graphics cards you can buy now. It is aimed at gamers interested in gaming at 4K resolution. In this article, we will go over some of the best AMD RX 6950 XT graphics cards that you can buy in 2024. The AMD RX 6950 XT features 80 compute units, 80 ray accelerators, 128 ROPs, 5120 stream processors, and 320 texture units. The reference design features a core clock speed of 2100 MHz and a boost clock speed of 2310 MHz. The custom variants should be able to run faster. It comes with 16 GB of GDDR6 memory. The following are some of the best AMD RX 6950 XT graphics cards that you can buy right now: This variant is similar to the other Gaming X Trio variants that we have seen, but it is thinner than the MSI RTX 3090 Ti SUPRIM X and not as chunky. The card comes with triple fans and RGB lighting, with a backplate at the back. MSI claims that the graphics card can boost to 2324 MHz, similar to variants from other companies. The card does have some headroom for overclocking, so you can push it to around 2750 if you are interested in getting some more performance out of it. Like other variants, you will need three 8-pin power connectors to run the graphics card. You get a single HDMI 2.1 port and three HP1.4a ports for video output. The Red Devil RX 6950 XT is yet another triple fan variant from Powercolor, and it is a chunky beast. While the design is similar to other Red Devil graphics cards, it does have a unique look compared to other models on this list. The graphics card comes with a backplate and a BIOS switch that allows you to switch between performance and silent modes. The card has RGB lighting, which you can sync with the rest of your parts for some cool effects. The graphics card features a game clock speed of 2226 MHz and a boost clock speed of 2435 MHz. If you switch to silent mode, then the game clock speed is 2116 MHz, and the card can boost to 2324 MHz. You get a single HDMI 2.1 port and three DP1.4a ports for video output. You will need three 8-pin power connectors to run the graphics card. This is yet another massive card with a triple-fan cooler, but there are some green accents on the card, which might not be to everyone\u2019s liking. It comes with a backplate that has honeycomb cutouts for better heat dissipation. The heatsink fins are partially exposed from the sides, which increases heat dissipation and gives the card a raw look. In performance mode, the graphics card has a game clock speed of 2295 MHz and can boost to 2475 MHz. In silent mode, the card has a game clock speed of 2165 MHz and can boost it to 2365 MHz. You will need three 8-pin power connectors to run the graphics card, and for video output, you get a single HDMI 2.1 port and three DP 1.4a ports. This massive graphics card comes with a beefy cooler to cater to the increased power limit. There are three fans on the card that keep the thermals in check. The design is similar to some other cards that we have seen from Gigabyte. The RGB lighting is fairly minimal, and you can turn it off if you are interested in a non-RGB build. The graphics card comes with a backplate with some cutouts for better heat dissipation, but that is expected, keeping in mind the high cost of the GPU. A BIOs switch on the card allows you to switch between OC mode and Silent mode. The game clock speed of the card is 2116 MHz, and the boost clock speed is 2324 MHz. So you get some additional performance out of the box compared to the reference design model. You will need three 8-pin power connectors to run this card, and for video output, you get a pair of DP 1.4a ports and a pair of HDMI 2.1 ports. The Liquid Devil RX 6950 XT comes with a water block pre-installed which is ideal if you are interested in a water-cooled build. The water block has a nickel-plated base to protect the copper from corrosion. The copper increases heat dissipation and keeps the card\u2019s thermals in check. Water cooling is ideal if you are interested in overclocking your card as much as possible and keeping it cool. It also provides a relatively silent operation. A BIOS switch on the card allows you to switch between OC mode and Unleashed mode. In OC mode, the card is rated to boost to 2513 MHz, while in the unleashed mode, it can do 2565 MHz. The graphics card comes with a backplate and RGB lighting to sync the lighting with the other parts in your build. You will need three 8-pin power connectors to run the graphics card, and for video output, you get a single HDMI 2.1 port and three DP 1.4a ports. These are some of the best AMD RX 6950 XT graphics cards you can buy now.
