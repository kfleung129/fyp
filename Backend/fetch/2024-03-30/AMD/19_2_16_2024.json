Ever since the launch of the Nvidia RTX 4000 Super cards, prices of mid to high-end GPUs have shown signs of dropping to more affordable levels. Over the last few days, we have had price cuts on the Radeon RX 7900 series, and 7800 series, as well as on Nvidia's 4070 Ti and 4070 as well. Even the newly released RTX 4070 Super has been discounted by $10 and as such it is already under its MSRP value. On the CPU side, AMD also dropped the price of the 12-core 7900X3D which is still available at just $410. The discount makes sense as the 12-core part is neither as good as the 7800X3D or 7950X3D in terms of gaming nor is it much better value as a production or workstation-class product as the non-X3D 7900X. And if you are not on AM5 and want a great workstation-class processor for Socket AM4, consider this Ryzen 9 5950X 16-core. Although this isn't its all-time low price, currently at $375, this is still a pretty good deal. Get the Ryzen 9 5950X 16-core CPU at the link below: AMD Ryzen 9 5950X, Zen 3, 16-Core, 3.4 GHz, Socket AM4, 105W, No Integrated Graphics - 100-100000059WOF: $379.26 + $4.27 => $374.99 $359 (Amazon US) AMD Ryzen 9 5950X, Zen 3, 16-Core, 3.4 GHz, Socket AM4, 105W, No Integrated Graphics - 100-100000059WOF: $383.99 + $9 off w/ promo code PDSSDPA385, limited offer => $374.99 (Newegg US) **[Amazon has it for cheaper]** If this doesn't interest you, you can also browse through Amazon US, Amazon UK, or Newegg US, to see if you find some great deals that we missed.
