    "text": "AOOSTAR has launched a new gaming mini PC called GEM10. One of the biggest highlights of the little computer is the form factor. It measures 1.7 x 1.7 x 6 cm and has a sleek aluminum body. But don\u2019t let the size fool you because it packs powerful internals inside. Under the hood, the tiny gaming PC has a Ryzen 7 7840HS APU, which comes with the Radeon 780M iGPU. This makes the mini PC capable of running many games at playable frame rates on its own. But if you need more power, you can hook the AOOSTAR GEM10 with an external graphics card (eGPU) through the OCuLink port\u00a0(ZOTAC\u00a0RTX 4070 Super curr. $619.99 on Amazon). This port can offer up to 63 Gbps speeds, making it a much better external graphics dock solution than the 40 Gbps USB 4 connection. Regarding thermal management, AOOSTAR has integrated a newly designed cooling system called Glacier 2.5. With internal tests, the mini PC manufacturer confirmed that its 7840HS systems can offer a sustained performance at 75W with temperatures at about 81 degrees and noise at around 38 dB. Other highlights of the GEM10 gaming mini computer include a host of connectivity ports, support for up to three PCIe 4 SSDs, dual 2.5G Ethernet, 32 GB of LPPDR5 RAM running at 6400 MHz, and triple screen output support at 4K 120Hz. You can learn more from the images attached below. As for the pricing, the AOOSTAR GEM10 gaming mini PC has an early bird discount on the official website. The base variant without SSD is $549, while the variant with a 1 TB NVMe drive is $589.95 (Crucial T500 1 TB Gen 4 curr. $89.99 on Amazon). AOOSTAR via: Liliputing "
