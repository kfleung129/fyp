    "text": "AMD claims huge boost in frame rates from Fluid Motion Frames at CES 2024, and says it will work in thousands of games. Ben Hardwidge Published: Jan 11, 2024 CPU and GPU maker AMD is about to fire a mighty shot across its bows to Nvidia this month, when AMD Fluid Motion Frames exits the preview phase and becomes an official part of its Adrenalin driver package. According to AMD, you\u2019ll be able to enable the new tech in \u201cthousands of games,\u201d and the company even thinks Nvidia is going to have to \u201cdo something similar\u201d in response. Fluid Motion Frames will be competing hard with Nvidia DLSS 3 Frame Generation, which is supported by the company\u2019s Ada GPUs, such as the GeForce RTX 4090, which currently tops our best graphics card guide. The announcement came as AMD launched the Radeon RX 7600 XT at the CES tradeshow in Las Vegas, with the company revealing that AMD Fluid Motion Frames will now become a part of its Hypr-RX suite in its Adrenalin driver software. Speaking to the press for the GPU launch, AMD Senior Manager of Radeon Product, Aaron Steinman, said that \u201cHypr-RX is a one-click gaming profile solution,\u201d adding that, unlike DLSS 3, it \u201cworks across thousands of games.\u201d You basically just need to enable the feature in your game\u2019s profile in the driver, and frame generation should work automatically. Nvidia has had its own frame generation tech in DLSS 3 for over a year now, and it offers a great way to massively increase gaming frame rates with minimal impact on image quality, thanks to its use of AI and Nvidia\u2019s Tensor cores. There are a couple of catches, though. For one, it only works on Nvidia GeForce RTX 4000-series GPUs, such as the GeForce RTX 4070. Secondly, using it requires a game to support it, or for a modder to unofficially add support to a game. AMD was late to respond with its FSR 3 frame generation late last year, and even now it\u2019s only officially supported in a handful of games. However, as Fluid Motion Frames is enabled in the driver, rather than in a game, it should (in theory, at least) basically run on any modern game you throw at it. Not only that, but the driver will support last-gen RDNA 2 GPUs, such as the Radeon RX 6800 XT, as well as the latest RDNA 3 GPUs, such as the Radeon RX 7800 XT. What\u2019s more, while Nvidia\u2019s DLSS tech is a closed eco system that only runs on Nvidia RTX GPUs, AMD has made FSR 3 open source, a strategy that AMD thinks Nvidia will have to emulate at some point. Quoted on PC Gamer, Steinman said: \u201cDLSS is only available on certain solutions, so either Nvidia is going to have to benefit from our solution because we did make it open-source and cross-vendor, or they\u2019re probably going to need to do something similar.\u201d  In its own benchmarks, AMD shows Fluid Motion Frames massively increasing frame rates on the Radeon RX 7600 XT, sometimes nearly doubling. In Baldur\u2019s Gate 3, for example, the Radeon RX 7600 XT usually averages 87fps, but this goes up by a good chunk once you enable FSR resolution scaling in Quality mode, and then goes all the way up to 208fps once you add frame generation to the mix as well. The AMD Fluid Motion Frames release date is January 24, 2024, when it\u2019s officially released as a part of the Radeon RX 7600 XT launch driver, and we\u2019re looking forward to giving it a try.
