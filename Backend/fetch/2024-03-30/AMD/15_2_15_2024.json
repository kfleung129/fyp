Help Center Feb 15, 2024 at 12:13 pm GMT- Raffi Boyadjian Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) stock hit a new intra-day record of 184.79 in January but the price has since been drifting lower, with a battle ground forming around the 261.8% Fibonacci extension of the late December \u2013 early January selloff. This extension level at 178.85 is in the spotlight again today as it\u2019s putting up a barrier against the latest upside attempt.  The technical indicators suggest there might be enough bullish momentum to push the price past this wall in the near term, as the %K and %D lines of the stochastic oscillator are rising and positively aligned, while the MACD has started to trend upwards again. It should be noted, though, that the narrowing Bollinger bands might be a sign of a possible trend reversal soon.  If today\u2019s rally pauses at the 261.8% Fibo but the price manages to close above the short-term descending trendline, the bullish bias should stay intact. However, even if the 178.85 hurdle is overcome, the upper Bollinger band at 181.54 is another obstacle for the bulls before the January peak of 184.79 is revisited. Successfully conquering these levels would turn the focus to the 361.8% Fibonacci extension of 196.12.  To the downside, there is immediate support from the 20-day simple moving average (SMA), also the mid-Bollinger band, at 172.48. Lower down, the medium-term ascending trendline is a crucial support to watch, especially if the breach takes place around the 161.8% Fibonacci of 161.58. A break below this trendline would turn the short-term bias to negative, while additionally slipping below the 50-day SMA, currently at 152.61, would bring the medium-term uptrend into question as well.

When you visit a website, the website sends the cookie to your computer. Your computer stores it in a file located inside your web browser. Cookies do not transfer viruses or malware to your computer. Because the data in a cookie does not change when it travels back and forth, it has no way to affect how your computer runs, but they act more like logs (i.e. they record user activity and remember stateful information) and they get updated every time you visit a website. We may obtain information about you by accessing cookies, sent by our website. Different types of cookies keep track of different activities. For example, session cookies are used only when a person is actively navigating a website. Once you leave the website, the session cookie disappears. Why are cookies useful? We use functional cookies to analyse how visitors use our website, as well as track and improve our website\u2019s performance and function. This allows us to provide a high-quality customer experience by quickly identifying and fixing any issues that may arise. For example, we might use cookies to keep track of which website pages are most popular and which method of linking between website pages is most effective. The latter also helps us to track if you were referred to us by another website and improve our future advertising campaigns. Another use of cookies is to store your log in sessions, meaning that when you log in to the Members Area to deposit funds, a \"session cookie\" is set so that the website remembers that you have already logged in. If the website did not set this cookie, you will be asked for your login and password on each new page as you progress through the funding process. In addition, functional cookies, for example, are used to allow us to remember your preferences and identify you as a user, ensure your information is secure and operate more reliably and efficiently. For example, cookies save you the trouble of typing in your username every time you access our trading platform, and recall your preferences, such as which language you wish to see when you log in.
