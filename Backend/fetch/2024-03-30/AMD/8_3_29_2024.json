    "text": "AMD revealed at the Game Developers Conference (GDC) 2024 that they will be launching the next generation of their FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) technology. The new version, FSR 3.1, will be compatible with Vulkan and the Xbox game development kit. FSR is an AI image interpolation technology that improves the visual quality of video games by upscaling lower resolution images. The latest update, FSR 3.1, will allow interpolated frames to coexist with other popular upscaling technologies like DLSS and XeSS. Microsoft has also entered the super-resolution game with their DirectSR API, which is based on AMD FSR 2 technology. This general-purpose super-resolution technology is designed to execute high-resolution game graphics with minimal computing resources. With the advancements in super-resolution technology from both AMD and Microsoft, gamers can expect to see a significant improvement in visual quality and performance in their favorite games. Stay tuned for more updates on these exciting developments in the world of gaming technology.
