    "text": "With the 24H2 version of Windows 11, Microsoft is set to introduce new functionalities based on artificial intelligence. This time, we\u2019re talking about a Super Resolution function directly integrated into the system. As you can see from these screenshots shared by @PhantomOfEarth on X.com, Windows is set to integrate a Super Resolution function. This would be managed by artificial intelligence and simply activated via a selector. This option is located directly in the Windows graphics settings panel. The option appears to be activated on an application-by-application basis. This means you should be able to activate it on a game-by-game basis too. As for its operation, this function should take advantage of either your processor\u2019s built-in NPU or your graphics card. In either case, the function in question is AI-based, but may \u201ccause unexpected results\u201d. For the time being, Intel and AMD are already offering CPUs with NPUs for AI. Intel\u2019s Meteor Lake and AMD\u2019s Hawk Point processors are just two examples. But we\u2019re still in the early iterations. With Strix Point and Lunar Lake, we\u2019re promised triple the performance in this area. All in all, we\u2019ll have to wait a while before we can enjoy a decent AI experience. As a reminder, Microsoft\u2019s requirements in terms of artificial intelligence: an NPU of at least 40 TOPS, which is not the case with current chips. Fortunately, the 24H2 should see the light of day by the end of the year, just like the new CPUs from Intel and AMD.  "
