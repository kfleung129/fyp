    "text": " China has rolled out a new directive that will slowly phase out US-made processors like Intel and AMD from government devices and servers, according to a report released by The Financial Times on Sunday. This includes all government agencies in the country above the township level. Referred to as the new PC, laptop, and server guidelines, the idea was first proposed on December 26 2023 by the Finance Ministry and the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT). Speaking about the guidelines, a local government official managing IT system substitution said it is the \u201cfirst nationwide, detailed and clear instructions for the promotion of Xin Chuang (innovation)\u201d. The authorities want the government agencies to purchase \u201csafe and reliable\u201d processors. A list of 18 safe processors has already been released which includes many popular Chinese manufacturers such as Huawei and Phytium. For other companies, they\u2019ll have to submit their product\u2019s complete R&D documentation.\u00a0 The regulators will decide whether it\u2019s fit for China based on its design, development, and production. Given the issues between the two nations right now, US companies are not likely to make the cut. Both Microsoft and Intel have declined to comment while AMD is yet to respond to the comment request.

Previously, China relied heavily on the US for most of its technical resources. However, the US took a series of steps that limited their access and forced them to boost their own tech industry. As per reports, US sanctions directly boosted China\u2019s chip-making industry. Its top 10 equipment manufacturers reported a 39% boost in revenue in the first half of 2023 compared to the previous year. Now that China has decided to punch back, it will be interesting to see how this move impacts the businesses of Intel, AMD, and others. This might also be just a start of completely phasing out US chips from the Chinese markets. Experts believe that this ban can be extended to the entire Chinese market in the coming years.
