    "text": " AMD might have something to slot above its current flagship X670E motherboards \u2013 recently, ASUS has filed entries on EEC (Eurasian Economic Commission) which reveals two workstation motherboards featuring the brand-new X690E chipset.  The two models involved are the Pro WS X690E-SAGE SE and the Pro WS X690E-SAGE SE WIFI, and this is the first time this chipset has been mentioned. The nature of this chipset is still a mystery at this point as there is nothing aside from these two listings, though one can make reasonable guesses based on the limited information we have today. Given the chipset\u2019s presence on ASUS\u2019s workstation lineup of motherboards, one can assume this is intended for workstations, like Intel\u2019s obscure W680 chipset supporting LGA1700 processors (such as 12th Gen). This would offer a way for users to build budget workstations with Socket AM5 Ryzen processors, without shelling large amounts of money into HEDT platforms like the Threadripper CPUs and TRX50/WRX90 platforms. It\u2019s worth noting that there used to be plans for a similar chipset before, like the X590. Some motherboards still have references to this chipset, though ultimately the nature of this particular chipset was largely unknown.
