Following that, the \"Red team,\" courtesy of Newegg US, also made the 8-core 5800X3D a great option by bundling it with a free $90 B450 motherboard, all for just $315. While those discounts and promo offers are no longer available, and if you don't have an affinity for AMD processors only, you can consider going the Intel route as the Core i5-14600K, which is based on Intel's latest (14th Gen) Raptor Lake refresh design is up for sale for its lowest ever price of just $300 (buying links towards the end of the article). We reviewed the i5-14600K alongside the flagship i9-14900K, and although the latter was faster, we found ourselves admiring the 14600K just as much since the Core i5 was not gobbling down power like the i9, and hence offered a bit more balance in terms of performance-per-watt. You'd still need to pair up the i5 with a decent Socket LGA1700 (600 or 700 series chipset) motherboard that costs around $150 or more to get the best performance out of it. In doing so, expect to extract excellent gaming performance out of it as long as you pair it up with a capable GPU like an AMD 7800 XT/ 7900 XT or XTX, or an Nvidia RTX 4070 or higher. The 14600K also does not come with a stock cooler and hence a 240mm AIO is recommended at the minimum.
