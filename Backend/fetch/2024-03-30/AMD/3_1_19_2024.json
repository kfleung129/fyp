Overall, these products may provide an edge to AMD in the automotive AI market, similar to its lead in the data center AI market. In the data center market, AMD has already noted positive developments as tech leaders, especially Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) and Meta Platforms (META), two of the largest clients of Nvidia, have signaled a shift towards AMD's Instinct MI300X as a cost-effective alternative to Nvidia's chips (which cost around $40K per chip).  We are seeing very strong demand for our new Instinct MI300 GPUs, which are the highest-performance accelerators in the world for generative AI. We're now expecting that the data center accelerator TAM will grow more than 70% annually over the next four years to over $400 billion in 2027. CEO: Dr. Lisa Su. AMD is significantly emphasizing the anticipated growth in its data center GPU segment. The company projects that data center GPU revenue will be approximately $400 million in Q4 and is expected to surpass $2 billion in 2024. This projection is based on the progress made in the data center GPU business, particularly with introducing the Instinct MI300 accelerators. MI300 is potentially becoming the fastest product to ramp to $1 billion in sales in AMD's history. Interestingly, the entire growth projection for data center GPU revenue appears to hinge on the progress of the MI300 accelerators. To support prolonged and significant progress in the data center GPU business, AMD lacks a diversified portfolio approach to capture market share from Nvidia. Therefore, it raises concerns about the company's capability to shield itself from shifts in market demand for specific types of GPUs and an edgy product launch from Nvidia or Intel. Over the long term, AMD's stock (~700%) has outperformed the benchmark iShares U.S. Technology ETF (IYW) (~200%) and competitor Intel Corporation (INTC) (~9%). However, the stock underperformed Nvidia (+1350%), which capitalized heavily on AI hype during 2023. However, with the vital announcements in December 2023 and January 2024, AMD is leading the performance with a 34% price return since December 2023 against IYW (6%), Intel (7%), and Nvidia (22%). StockCharts.com | Advanced Financial Charts & Technical Analysis Tools StockCharts.com | Advanced Financial Charts & Technical Analysis Tools Following the previous technical coverage, AMD's stock price is now experiencing resistance at $165, as expected (but sooner). Based on the current analysis, AMD's stock price may reach $225 by the end of 2024. In an optimistic scenario, it may hit $270 projected through higher high momentum and Fibonacci retracement. On the upside, the price may experience resistance near $203. The short-term trend is bullish, as observed in moving average convergence/divergence (MACD). However, the relative strength index (RSI) is over 70, signaling an overbought state of the stock price. Also, a bearish divergence is emerging (not fully developed yet). Therefore, a correction in the coming weeks may lead the stock price towards the pivot level of $129. On the downside, $107 serves as critical mid-term support. However, considering the Fed's rate cuts, resumed supply chain resilience, and improving macroeconomic data (especially inflation), a significant downside is less likely. A correction can be considered an opportunity to accumulate, as the price has completely recovered, leaving 2021's high behind. As a navigator, the performance of a company's top and bottom lines should be monitored. It may continue to influence the stock price and cause large shifts in volatility, which justifies Nvidia's outperformance relative to AMD.
