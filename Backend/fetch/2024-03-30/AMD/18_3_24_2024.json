The Max-Q variant is the power saving version of the mobile GTX 1650Ti with reduced clock speeds, performance and of course power consumption. It is using the same TU117 chip with 1,024 shaders. Therefore, it is intended for thin and light gaming laptops. Compared to the faster RTX 2000 GPUs (e.g.\u00a0RTX 2060), the 1650 Ti integrates no Raytracing or Tensor cores. \nThere are two variants of the 1650Ti Max-Q, one with 35 Watt and 1035 - 1200 MHz and a faster 40 Watt version with a clock speed of 1200 - 1365 MHz. Both however are significantly lower clocked than the normal Max-P version with 50 / 55 Watt and 1350-1385 MHz. The memory is most likely clocked at 1250 MHz = 10,000 MHz effective (Gbps) in most laptops, although there might be versions with 1500 MHz = 12,000 Gbps.The\u00a0Turing\u00a0generation did not only introduce raytracing for the RTX cards, but also optimized the architecture of the cores and caches. According to Nvidia the CUDA cores offer now a concurrent execution of floating point and integer operations for increased performance in compute-heavy workloads of modern games. Furthermore, the caches were reworked (new unified memory architecture with twice the cache compared to Pascal). This leads to 50% more instructions per clock and a 40% more power efficient usage compared to Pascal. \nCompared to the bigger Turing chips (like the TU116 of the GTX 1660 Ti and the RTX lineup), the TU117 does not include the new NVENC encoder but an older one similar to the one used in Pascal and Volta. \nThe power consumption of the 1650 Ti Max-Q laptops is specified at 35 Watt TGP (Total Graphics Power) by Nvidia and therefore 25 Watt lower than the mobile GTX 1650 Ti in the same package (other variants can reach up to 80 Watt).

The AMD Radeon 740M is an integrated GPU in the Ryzen 7040 series for laptops (Phoenix, e.g. Ryzen 5 7540U). The iGPU is based on the new RDNA3 architecture and has only 4 of the 12 CUs (= 256 shaders) clocked at up to 2.5 GHz (depending on the CPU model). The 740M\u00a0supports hardware raytracing, although the performance is too slow to use it in current games. \nDue to the reduced core count and clock speed, the performance is clearly below the Radeon 760M and 780M. \nThanks to the modern 4nm process and clever power-saving features, the power consumption is comparatively low (according to AMD). The whole chip of the first two models can be configured between 15 - 30 Watt TDP. The AMD Radeon 740M is an integrated GPU in the Ryzen 7040 series for laptops (Phoenix, e.g. Ryzen 5 7540U).
