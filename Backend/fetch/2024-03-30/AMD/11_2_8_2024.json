    "text": "Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) released the Ryzen 7 5700 desktop processor not too long ago. On top of this, they also released Ryzen 7 5700X3D along with Ryzen 8000G chips with AI capabilities. With the Ryzen 7 5700 out in the wild, it has been found that it is actually slower in gaming performance when compared to the Ryzen 5 5600.\n\n\n\nThis is a major problem because, generally speaking, many would assume that the Ryzen 5 5600 is inferior to Ryzen 7 5700. But in this case, the opposite is true. How did this happen, and why did AMD release the Ryzen 7 5700 with wildly different performance capabilities than people expected? Let me explain. \n\n\n\n\nBelow is a specification comparison of two AMD AM4 processors, including the Ryzen 7 5700X as well. As you can see, the L3 cache on the 5700 is lower than the 5700X. This reduction is not something that the Ryzen 5 5600 goes through, and the non-X variant remains competent against the 5600X.\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 5000 Processor (AM4)Cores & ThreadsBase & Boost ClockL3 CacheTDPPriceRyzen 7 57008 cores, 16 threads3.70 GHz / 4.60 GHz32MB65W$175Ryzen 7 5700X8 cores, 16 threads3.70 GHz / 4.60 GHz16MB65W$180\n\n\n\t\tRecommended Articles\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAMD Ryzen 7 5700X3D AM4 CPU out for Sale; Faster than Core i5-13600KF for Gaming?\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSatyam Kumar\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFeb 2, 2024\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSteam Deck 2: Steam Deck 2: Speculated Release Date, Potential Specifications, and More\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSampad Banerjee\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJan 30, 2024\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\nWith this important specification, everything changes. While the AMD Ryzen 7 5700 has a higher core count, the Ryzen 5 5600 wins in gaming performance benchmarks! So, if you don\u2019t mind having a slightly worse core & thread count (6C/12T), the Ryzen 5 5600 is more affordable at $134.99 at the time of writing and better in gaming.\n\n\n\nImage Courtesy: Hardware Unboxed\nCheck out the testing above by Hardware Unboxed, which has tested 12 games at 1080p. The below benchmark shows the average gaming performance of several modern processors that sell today. By the way, all you need is a BIOS update on your AM4 motherboard (B450, B550, X570, and others), after which you can install a new CPU, including the Ryzen 5000 series. \n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s Ryzen 5 5600 is not too far ahead, but a new PC builder who may not know the drastic cache differences between the Ryzen 7 5700 and 5700X could make the wrong choice. I hope that you will help fellow aspirational PC builders like yourselves know about the Ryzen 7 5700\u2019s gaming performance so they don\u2019t make a mistake.\n\n\n\nWhat do you think of the Ryzen 7 5700? The X3D version is quite tempting, but the new non-X variant is definitely a weird processor. Let us know your thoughts in the comments below!
