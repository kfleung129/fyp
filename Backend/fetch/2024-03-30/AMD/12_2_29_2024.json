    "text": "Rumours about the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 have been showing up with increasing frequency. Internally, it is referred to as the SM8750 and shows up as \"Sun\" on benchmarking platforms. Performance-wise, it has a leg up on MediaTek's Dimensity 9400 thanks to its 6 custom Oryon performance cores. Qualcomm has now confirmed we'll see it in action before the year ends. Don McGuire, the company's Chief Marketing Officer, posted a video on the Snapdragon Insider's X handle talking about its plans for the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4. The AP will make its debut in the annual Snapdragon summit to be held in October this year. If previous events are anything to go by, it'll likely happen somewhere in Hawaii. McGuire also talks about the \"evolution of our NPU story\", hinting the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 could come with an upgraded NPU. Regardless, it will mean nothing if Qualcomm can't keep its power draw in check. It also faces stiff competition from the 2025-bound Exynos 2500 manufactured on Samsung's 3GAP node. We can expect the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 to debut alongside the Xiaomi 15 or a smartphone from a Chinese OEM. Buy the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 powered Galaxy S23 Ultra on Amazon Snapdragon Insider on X "
