    "text": "The Ryzen 9 7940HS is a powerful Phoenix family APU that saw the light of day in H1 2023. Its 8 cores are powered by the Zen 4 architecture and are SMT-enabled for a total of 16 processing threads. 4.0 GHz is the base clock speed and the highest Boost clock speed achievable is 5.2 GHz. \nThe 7940HS introduces Ryzen AI which is AMD's answer to Intel's DL Boost and GNA technologies. The Radeon 780M serves as the integrated graphics adapter. \nArchitecture & Features \nPhoenix family chips are powered by the Zen 4 architecture, much like Dragon Range family chips are. The latter however lacks hardware AI workload acceleration capabilities that Phoenix has. Ryzen AI is set to give applications such as DaVinci Resolve and Photoshop quite a bit of generative AI magic. \nMore importantly, Zen 4 introduces AVX512 support (which Zen 3 chips did not have) and, thanks to a plethora of other improvements including larger caches/registers/buffers across the board, is slated to bring a double-digit IPC improvement. \nThe 7940HS has 16 MB of L3 cache and support for super-fast RAM (up to LPDDR5x-7500 or DDR5-5600, including ECC-enabled memory). The processor is compatible with USB 4 and thus with Thunderbolt; PCIe support is limited to the 4.0 spec for a throughput of 1.97 GB/s per lane. \nOS support is limited to 64-bit editions of Windows 11 and Windows 10 and of course to Linux. Note that the chip isn't overclockable and neither is it user-replaceable as it gets soldered down for good (FP7, FP7r2, FP8 socket interfaces). \nPerformance \nThe average 7940HS in our database is in the same league as the Core i9-12900HK and also, somewhat disappointingly, the Ryzen 7 7840HS, as far as multi-thread benchmark scores are concerned. \nThanks to its decent cooling solution and a long-term CPU power limit of 80 W, the ROG Zephyrus G14 GA402XY is among the fastest laptops built around the 7940HS that we know of. It can be about 15% faster in CPU-bound workloads than the slowest system featuring the same chip in our database, as of August 2023. \nGraphics \nThe Radeon 780M has 12 CUs (768 shaders) running at up to 2,800 MHz. This is a very fast iGPU, as of late 2023. It will let you use up to 4 monitors with resolutions as high as SUHD 4320p, and it is also capable of HW-encoding and HW-decoding most video codecs including AVC, HEVC and AV1, but more importantly it is fast enough for proper 1080p gaming as long as one is fine with low to medium detail settings. \nYour mileage may vary depending on how high the CPU power limits are, how competent the cooling solution of the system is, how fast the RAM of the system is (there is no dedicated VRAM). \nPower consumption \nThis Ryzen 9 series chip has a long-term power limit (default TDP) of 35 W to 54 W, giving laptop makers a choice between longer battery life and higher performance. Either way, an active cooling solution is a must for a system powered by this chip. \nThe 7940HS is built with TSMC's 4 nm process for high, as of late 2023, energy efficiency.

The Intel Core i7-12650H is a high-end mobile CPU for laptops based on the Alder Lake architecture. It was announced in early 2022 and offers 6 performance cores (P-cores, Golden Cove architecture) and 4 of the 8 efficient cores (E-cores, Gracemont architecture). The P-cores support Hyper-Threading leading to 16 supported threads when combined with the E-cores. The clock rate ranges from 2.3 to 4.7 GHz on the performance cluster and 1.7 to 3.5 GHz on the efficient cluster. The performance of the E-cores should be similar to old Skylake cores (compare to the Core i7-6700HQ). All cores can use up to 24 MB L3 cache. Compared to the 12700H, the 12650H offers only 4 instead of 8 E-cores, a slower iGPU and no vPro features (for remote management). \nPerformance \nThe average 12650H in our database is in the same league as the Core i9-11950H, Ryzen 5 7640HS, Ryzen 9 5900HS, as far as multi-thread benchmark scores are concerned.

For AI tasks, the CPU also integrates GNA 3.0\u00a0and DL Boost (via AVX2). Quick Sync in version 8 is the same as in the Rocket Lake CPUs and supports MPEG-2, AVC, VC-1 decode, JPEG, VP8 decode, VP9, HEVC, and AV1 decode in hardware.

The AMD Ryzen 7 7840S is a fast high-end laptop processor of the Phoenix series. It offers 8 cores (octa core) based on the Zen 4 architecture that supports hyperthreading (16 threads). The cores clock from 3.8 (base) up to 5.1 GHz (single core boost). The processor includes 8 MB L2 cache and 16 MB L3 cache. The processor is exclusively available in Lenovo laptops but the specs are similar to the regular Ryzen 7 7840HS. \nThe performance of the R7 7840S is only slightly below the fastest model, the R9 7940HS, as the clock speed difference is only minimal (e.g. -100 MHz / 2% slower single core boost). Therefore, the CPU should also perform slightly higher than the old top model Ryzen 9 6980HX (8 Zen 3 cores with up to 4.9 GHz) at 54W TDP and Ryzen 9 6980HS at 35W TDP. Compared to the higher end Dragon Range series, the 7840HS should be similar to the Ryzen 7 7745HX (also 8 Zen 4 cores, max 5.1 GHz, 55W TDP, 32 MB L3). \nThe chip integrates a modern and fasts RDNA 3 graphics card (iGPU) called Radeon 780M with 12 CUs and up to 2.7 GHz clock speed. Furthermore, the Phoenix series include a video engine with AV1 de- and encoding, a new Xilinx FPGA based XDNA AI accelerator (Ryzen AI) that should be faster than the AI engine in the Apple M2 SOC and a dual-channel DDR5-5600 / LPDDR5x-7500 memory controller (with ECC support). The connectivity features includes 2 possible USB 4 (40 Gbps) ports and 20 PCIe 4.0 lanes for a GPU and SSDs. \nThe Phoenix series uses a single monolithic design (unlike the chiplet design of the 7045HX series) and is manufactured in the modern 4nm process at TSMC. The TDP can be configured between 35 and 45 Watt. The AMD Ryzen 7 7840S is a fast high-end laptop processor of the Phoenix series.
