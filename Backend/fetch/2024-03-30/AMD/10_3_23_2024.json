    "text": "Jo\u00e3o Silva \n1 week ago\nAPU, Featured Tech News  AMD has recently confirmed that the RDNA 3+ GPU architecture will power the upcoming Strix Point APUs, which are still set to launch in 2024. The announcement was made during an AI PC event in Beijing, China, where AMD's CEO is currently meeting with AI and PC partners to accelerate the release of the company's next-gen platforms. According to Wccftech, it's now confirmed that the next-gen Strix Point APUs will feature new CPU (Zen5), GPU (RDNA3+), and NPU (XDNA2) architectures, as previously rumoured. The new NPU is expected to increase Generative AI capabilities by threefold. As such, we can expect up to 48TOPs of AI performance (compared to Ryzen 8040 \u201cHawk Point\u201d APUs, which provide up to 16TOPs of performance).  Image credit: Wccftech The RDNA 3+ GPU architecture, which has been appearing in patches for a while now and is known as the RDNA 3.5 \u201cGFX115X\u201d series, will be used in the Strix Point APUs when they ship later this year. AMD has confirmed that the architecture optimises the current RDNA 3 GPUs found in Radeon RX 7000 GPUs and Ryzen 7040/8040 APUs. The Strix Point APUs are expected to be launched in H2 2024, with the first APU shipments to OEMs beginning the following year. Discuss on our Facebook page, HERE.
