    "text": "XFX has lowered the price for its flagship AMD GPU.  The MERC 310 version of the Radeon RX 7900 XTX from XFX\u2019s Speedster series is now available at a reduced price of $799, over $170 cheaper than its current official list price. The card released was launched on December 2022 at $1,199, but has already been seen at $892 in November. The new price is no doubt much lower. UPDATE: The deal has ended Amazon (affiliate link) The RX 7900 XTX presently holds the title of the fastest SKU in AMD\u2019s lineup, boasting a full Navi 31 GPU and 24GB of memory. This particular model finds itself in competition with NVIDIA\u2019s GeForce RTX 4080 graphics card, which is expected to be succeeded by a SUPER variant by the end of this month, promising slightly improved performance.

The promotion currently available on Amazon might be a time-limited offer, as it has not been mirrored by other retailers at this time. However, this could potentially signal the impending price reductions for the Radeon RX7900 XTX series across various retailers. If you are into high-end GPUs, definitely keep checking Radeon prices in the near future. Source: Amazon We may earn an affiliate commission through Amazon and Newegg links.
