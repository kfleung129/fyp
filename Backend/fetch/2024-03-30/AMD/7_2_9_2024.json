Nvidia RTX 4070 Ti is now at an all-time low price \u2013 but AMD still has it beat Nvidia\u2019s RTX 4070 Ti is the latest graphics card to witness a price cut among a flurry of discounting activity of late in the mid-range to higher-tier GPU space. VideoCardz was eagle-eyed enough to catch that Newegg in the US has now reduced the price of a couple of MSI versions of the RTX 4070 Ti, one of the older GPUs in the Lovelace line-up \u2013 and rumored to be discontinued now that the 4070 Ti Super has been launched (last month). The real bargain here is the MSI Ventus 2X RTX 4070 Ti which is priced at $749.99 but has a promo code at checkout to knock off $50, meaning the actual price you\u2019ll pay is $699.99. This marks the first time the 4070 Ti has fallen under the $700 mark (just \u2013 that\u2019s around \u00a3550, AU$1,070) in the US. This is marked as a limited offer, so if stock shifts off the shelves at anything like a rate of knots, it may not be active for that long. To illustrate the point, VideoCardz also flags up the MSI Ventus 2X White edition (the same graphics card, but colored white as you might guess) at $704.99, with a $25 off checkout code, but it\u2019s actually $729.99 now (around \u00a3580, AU$1,120), having just been notched up a bit evidently. All pricing is correct at the time of writing (as it was when VideoCardz published its article of course), and so you might find different price tags by the time you read this. We\u2019ve previously talked about the great GPU price war of 2024 beginning, and while we\u2019re not there yet, this is yet another piece of evidence \u2013 among a good number of recent discounts, as mentioned \u2013 that the market is definitely becoming more competitive. At least in this mid-to-upper-range space, anyway, which is clearly great news for consumers looking for a powerful graphics card that doesn\u2019t hit their wallet too hard (but might still wind it somewhat, let\u2019s face it). Get the hottest deals available in your inbox plus news, reviews, opinion, analysis and more from the TechRadar team. All this has been sparked off by Nvidia launching new RTX Super graphics cards last month, and as we already touched on, one of those \u2013 the middle member of the fresh introductions \u2013 was the RTX 4070 Ti Super. Rumor has it that this replaces the RTX 4070 Ti entirely, hence stock is being cleared as theoretically this GPU is discontinued. Given that, and MSI suddenly coming in with much more competitive pricing \u2013 as noted, this is the lowest price ever seen in the US, $20 less than the previous drops we reported on only earlier this week \u2013 it\u2019s not a stretch to imagine other models of RTX 4070 Ti coming down in price, following in MSI\u2019s footsteps. After all, that 4070 Ti inventory needs shifting. Indeed, Nvidia\u2019s board making partners and the retailers they supply may need to do better than this with the RTX 4070 Ti, as the cheapest 7900 XT is the same price (at Newegg) as this new low for the 4070 Ti. And we\u2019d clearly give the nod to the AMD GPU for pure gaming performance (ray tracing aside, mind you, where Nvidia obviously has the advantage \u2013 and with DLSS 3, too). Don\u2019t forget we\u2019ve been seeing plenty of movement with AMD\u2019s mid-range RDNA 3 GPUs, with price cuts on the RX 7800 XT before both 7900 XT and 7700 XT models were reduced. It\u2019s certainly an interesting time when it comes to jostling for position on the best GPU rankings and grabbing the attention of consumers.
