    "text": "Four new SKUs and some with Ryzen AI AMD has unveiled its Ryzen 8000G APU lineup at CES 2024, announcing four new SKUs based on 4nm Hawk Point and Phoenix 2 architecture and featuring Zen 4 CPU and RDNA 3 GPUs. All four SKUs, including the Ryzen 7 8700G, Ryzen 5 8600G, Ryzen 5 8500G, and the Ryzen 3 8300G, will be available on January 31st. The Ryzen 7 8700G leads the pack, and this is an 8-core/16-thread 65W SKU that works at up to 5.1GHz max boost and 24MB of cache. This is the only SKU that will feature AMD Radeon 780M graphics. It also features Ryzen AI with AMD Ryzen AI XDNA NPU, reaching a combined 39 TFLOPs of combined processing power. According to AMD, this should be enough to get you well over 60 FPS in plenty of games at 1080p resolution. Just a notch below is the Ryzen 5 8600G, a 6-core/12-thread SKU with 22MB of cache and a 5.0GHz maximum CPU boost. It comes with a Radeon 760M GPU, and also features AMD Ryzen AI, although you can expect slightly lower combined processing power, despite having the same NPU. Both the Ryzen 8500G and the Ryzen 8300G are using Phoenix 2 architecture, which means it has Zen 4c cores and lacks Ryzen AI. Strangely, both still have the same 65W TDP. The Ryzen 5 8500G is quite similar, as it is also a 6-core/12-thread SKU with 22MB of cache and a 5.0GHz maximum boost clock, but comes with a Radeon 740M GPU. The single Ryzen 3 8300G is a 4-core/8-thread SKU with 12MB of cache and the same Radeon 740M GPU, and this one will be only available to system builders. As said, the entire lineup will be available on January 31st with prices set at $329 for the Ryzen 7 8700G, $229 for the Ryzen 5 8600G, and $179 for the Ryzen 5 8500G.       "
