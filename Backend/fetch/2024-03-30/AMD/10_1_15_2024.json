    "text": "Intel launched its not-so-new 14th-Gen Core HX processors at CES 2024. A refresh of the existing 13th-Gen Core i9-13900HX, the Core i9-14900HX features 8 P-cores (Raptor Cove) and 16 E-cores (Gracemont). The performance (P) cores have a peak boost clock of 5.8GHz, up from 5.4GHz on the 13900HX. Meanwhile, the efficiency (E) cores have been scaled from 3.9GHz to 4.1GHz on the 14900HX. Unfortunately for Intel, this rather sizable bump in frequency isn\u2019t enough to match AMD\u2019s Ryzen 9 7945HX3D. Table of Contents Notebookcheck tested the Schenker XMG Neo 17 featuring the Core i9-14900HX (paired with an RTX 4090 mobile). Its most direct rival is the AMD Ryzen 9 7945HX3D, a 3D V-Cache CPU with 128MB of L3 cache (64MB 3D stacked), powering the ROG Scar 17 (we tested it a while back, here\u2019s the review). The Core i9-14900HX fares better than the 13900HX but is no match for the Ryzen 9 7945HX3D. AMD\u2019s 3D V-Cache flagship beats the 14900HX in nearly every game. Notable examples include well-optimized titles like Cyberpunk 2077 and Shadow of the Tomb Raider, where the Ryzen 9 7945HX3D is 16% and 28% faster than the 14900HX, respectively. Not only is the Ryzen 9 7945HX3D faster than the Core i9-14900HX, but it\u2019s also significantly more power efficient. In most games, the former doesn\u2019t sip over 50W of power, while the 14900HX draws nearly 90W in the Cinebench R23 1T benchmark. In the multi-threaded test, the 14900HX records a power consumption of 223W, up from just 158.5W on the 7945HX3D. "
