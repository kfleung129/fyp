Both Intel and AMD have had a fantastic year, bringing out some amazing offerings that showed the spark of innovation is alive and well in the world of tech. Even with so many good releases this year, CGMagazine sadly has to widdle down the selections to the absolute best CPUs of the year. From the Intel Core I9-14900K to the AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D, if you are a gamer or PC builder, this is your year to push your system as far as it can go. So read on and find out who won our Best CPU 2024 selection. Writer: Brendan Frye Headlining the 14th gen series is the i9-14900K, featuring a maximum turbo boost frequency of 6.0 GHz, a first for a mass-produced Intel CPU. This represents a 200 MHz increase over the previous i9-13900K. Intel is also bumping up the core counts on its i7 model, with the i7-14700K now featuring eight performance cores and 12 efficiency cores for a total of 20 cores. While not revolutionary, the i9-14900K succeeds in pushing desktop CPU limits. It remains the choice for enthusiasts who want the utmost speed. Coming from 12th Gen Alder Lake, there is a notable reason to jump over to 14th gen, pushing the limits on your system while potentially able to keep many of the same parts, but for people already sitting with a Raptor Lake CPU, the incremental upgrade is not worth the cost. While an incredibly powerful CPU, the Intel i9-14900K is not necessarily the right choice for everyone. The i9-14900K pushes the limits, but its incremental gains and thermal challenges make this a CPU reserved for enthusiasts chasing the bleeding edge. Writer: Brendan Frye The AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D CPU is a highly capable 8-core, 16-thread processor built with the TSMC 6nm process. It offers a base clock speed of 4.2 GHz and a boost clock speed of 5.0 GHz. What sets the 7800X3D CPU apart from most other chips in the Ryzen range\u2014except for the Ryzen 7950X3D\u2014is the inclusion of AMD\u2019s 3D V-Cache technology. This significantly increases the CPU\u2019s cache size to 104 MB (compared to the 144MB seen in the Ryzen 9 7950X3D), resulting in reduced latency and improved gaming performance compared to non-3D variants of the Ryzen family. For gamers, the $449 Ryzen 7 7800X3D is a tremendous value that pushes what is possible on a mid-range CPU. Paired with a solid GPU like an\u00a0Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080\u00a0or an\u00a0AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX, you have yourself a PC ready to take on any game you can throw at it. While it may have its quirks, the Ryzen 7 7800X3D is a CPU that delivers well beyond what its price may show. The AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D CPU, featuring 3D V-Cache, delivers impressive gaming performance at a lower cost, offering outstanding value for gamers seeking the best bang for their buck. Ryzen 9 7950X3D CPU Writer: Brendan Frye AMD\u2019s\u00a0Ryzen 9 7950X\u00a0has been the go-to choice for gamers who want the best performance, but it might have finally met its match in AMD\u2019s latest offering: The Ryzen 9 7950X3D CPU. Combining the impressive Ryzen 7000 series with the 3D V-Cache that made for one of the best AM4 chips you could buy only makes things more exciting for AMD buyers. Having taken the time to test out this new chip, I can safely say AMD has nailed it and managed to release the most powerful consumer gaming CPU you can buy. If you\u2019re looking for one processor that provides a balanced mix of gaming and productivity performance, then this is your best option. The Ryzen 9 7950X3D CPU may not be perfect at all tasks, but the increase in performance in gaming more than makes up for the slight dip compared to the competition in other tasks and considering how powerful all these CPUs truly are, that is saying something. In spite of some issues with setup and productivity performance, the Ryzen 9 7950X3D has managed to topple other CPUs to win the crown of fastest gaming CPU on the market.
