    "text": "A step by step guide on how to find a laptop with the best CPU for any user's needs. Choosing a laptop with a good laptop processor in 2024 can be an exercise in futility unless one knows what they want. Note that various users have different preferences and needs when picking a laptop with the best laptop processor. For instance, some people may require laptops with low power processors for portability and battery life, while others may prefer a laptop with robust processor for multitasking, video editing or gaming. As such, it is important to know use cases and needs before settling on a laptop processor. RELATED: Intel Core i7 13700K vs 12700K - Which CPU Should You Buy? Now, with endless options in the market, it can be a hard nut to crack to find the right one. From considering the cores to checking the laptop's clock speed, there are a number of factors to consider. Here is how to choose the a laptop with the best processor in 2024; Regarding laptop processors, users will most likely have to pick from the two most prominent manufacturers of processors, Intel, and AMD. Deciding between an Intel, AMD powered laptop can be overwhelming, as they all have various GPUs and CPUs for various budgets and needs. Nonetheless, for users who want optimum performance, particularly for gaming or video editing, Intel laptops might be the best bet. They usually feature better architecture, and higher clock speeds than AMDs. But they are also power hungry and more expensive, so a user may also have to pick one with a good power supply and cooling system. One of Game Rant's favorites is the ASUS ProArt Studiobook OLED laptop. It features an Intel Core i9-13980HX processor that has 8 performance cores combined by 16 efficiency cores. With a total of 32 threads plus higher boost clocks, it is faster in both games and productivity. For those who want a laptop with an entry level or mid-range processor that offers the best value, AMD can do the job. They usually have more threads, cache and cores than Intel's and are affordable. A good example is the AMD Ryzen 5 PRO 6650H. Users can find it in the Lenovo ThinkPad Z16 Gen 1 21D4001UUS 16\" Notebook It is fast and powerful thanks to its efficient architecture. Intel and AMD use similar terminologies for different generations of processors; hence, it is essential to understand the generations when buying a laptop with best processor. Since a family of processors belongs to the same generation, each family contains processors that can be differentiated by name and performance. The latest generation of processors from AMD includes AMD Ryzen 5000 series processors, and the latest Intel processors include Intel Core i5, Core i7, and Core i9. Like AMD, the higher the number, the better the computer's performance. Those looking for a laptop processor with the best processor should consider the processor's generation and family position before choosing one. Cores are individual small processors packed together on the same chip. While traditionally, cores can perform one task at a time, more cores make a processor better at multitasking. For those who have requirements such as watching movies, randomly browsing, or replying to emails, two cores are enough. But for better and faster performance, more than four cores is good. High cores are also suited for advanced programming, crunching large data sets, gaming, and running multiple applications simultaneously. Alongside these, they make it easy to perform tasks such as 3D rendering, video/audio editing, and VR. Threads refer to the number of tasks a processor can perform at any given time. Many modern processors currently offer multi-threading that lets them leverage additional tasks. That's why a CPU with eight cores can have 16 threads. Since these additional threads effectively leverage the processor's underused parts, they are slower than the cores themselves. However, having more cores than needed doesn't speed up the laptop beyond the limits of what its software can handle. Clocks are also another primary consideration when choosing a laptop with the best processor. Measured in megahertz (MHz) and gigahertz (GHz) ratings, these ratings represent the number of tasks a processor can perform per second, with the one with a higher clock speed performing better. Processors also have different instructions per clock (IPC) ratings, representing the number of tasks they can conduct per each clock cycle. While this might seem unclear, it shows the importance of reviewing the processor's reviews before settling on one. Putting them in comparable tests is also a great way to see their performance in the real world. While processors with higher clock speeds are faster at most tasks, a modern laptop with more cores is the best choice for productivity tasks. A processor's cache is a small memory pool of megabytes different from the computer's main memory (RAM). Providing a fast way to retrieve data helps the laptop's CPU manage its workflow. The cache also stores information that the process frequently needs to retrieve. By embedding the cache into chips, information can quickly be retrieved instead of fetching it directly from the system's RAM. While each processor core has its L2 cache, the L3 cache is shared among all cores. The more cache a laptop has, the higher the performance. All modern laptops come with integrated graphics that share the computer's RAM and processing power to deliver the image on the screen. Some laptops have dedicated graphics with their own RAM, making them 20x faster than laptops with integrated graphics, which are typically less powerful. Those who intend to use their laptops for video editing, gaming, or design work should choose laptops with graphic cards that include AMD Radeon cards, such as RX560X or NVIDIA's GeForce RTX. Users should decide whether they want to overclock or not. Since overlocking can be used to increase the clock speed, it's essential to check whether there is a \"K\" designation at the end of the name of the processor's name, which shows it can be overclocked. If there is the right hardware, such as a proper motherboard and cooling solution, users can enjoy faster clock speeds with an unlocked CPU. There are several cooling limitations for a laptop running on the i7 or i9 processor. For instance, putting on more heat can damage one or more components since you cannot add a cooling fan in the limited space. Overclocking is, therefore, one thing to avoid by those who are not professionals. Although users don't have to upgrade their laptops immediately, they might need to do so in the future. Every laptop's processor supports a certain amount of RAM, regardless of whether it's an AMD or an Intel. Since the capacity is fixed, it won't utilize more RAM than this limit. So, knowing the total amount of RAM a system can support is essential. High-end processors can accommodate up to 128 GB of memory, but a good one should be able to accommodate at least an additional 4 GB or 8 GB RAM module. There are also instances where your processor can't improve performance regardless of how much RAM you add. It's essential to read reviews from other users and experts and get the proper insight into different laptop processors' real-world performance, reliability, and value. Users can also check out the pros, cons, and recommendations of other users looking for something similar. While laptops use batteries, the consumption largely depends on the computer and the processor's performance. Laptops with modern processors tend to be powerful, but using a powerful processor can negatively affect the battery life. Those looking for a battery backup should choose one with a 'U' in their name. However, this depends on whether users seek raw performance or battery backup. The best thing to do is choose a processor that balances both to boost performance. It's also important that the processor remains cool to boost its performance. If it overheats, it can either slow down the laptop or severely destroy all the components. This is where CPU coolers come in handy. While often overlooked, these coolers are usually very important, especially for laptops that are used for long gaming sessions. These include custom loop coolers, air coolers, and all-in-one liquid coolers. While air coolers are the most common, custom loop coolers are expensive and can only be found in high-end machines where budget is not an issue. Air coolers are relatively cheap and easy to install but take up much space. On the other hand, all-in-one coolers depend on a liquid to transfer heat and have fans that dissipate the heat. Since they are much more efficient and suitable for CPUs that consume a lot of power, custom loops are probably the best option, but they are advanced and costly. Before buying the cooler, users should determine the TDP (Thermal Design Power) of the laptop's chip. This is the maximum amount of heat a chip generates. By knowing the amount of heat a chip can generate, users can ensure they have a \nCPU cooler\n that can handle that amount of heat produced. Also, a higher TDP usually means faster performance, although things like general architecture and processor node size are essential. Proper CPU selection generally means the laptop already has the best hardware to perform various functions. That said, it's essential to know how to check the computer's CPU to ensure that it can perform. Currently, there is the H series and the U series CPU. AMD & Intel both have the same naming rule to classify their CPU products by performance level. Shopping for a laptop with right processor for 2024 can be overwhelming, since there are many aspects that a buyer must consider, such as performance and power consumption. However, by following the tips in this guide, users can narrow down their options and find the ideal laptop for their needs.
