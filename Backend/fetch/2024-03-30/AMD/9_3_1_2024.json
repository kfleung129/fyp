    "text": "Advanced Micro Devices AMD stock is rising higher on Friday as shares of the semiconductor company continue to rise alongside artificial intelligence (AI) related names. This latest surge in price has resulted in AMD stock reaching a market valuation of $300 billion. That\u2019s a new record for the company and is furthering investor interest in Advanced Micro Devices. Stocks are also getting a boost on Friday from the latest personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index. This showed inflation increased by 0.4% for January and 2.8% year-over-year (YOY). This matches what Wall Street was expecting for the period. It\u2019s also worth mentioning that Nvidia NVDA has seen gains recently alongside other AI stocks. Considering it and AMD are both in the semiconductor space, it makes sense that the shares would rise in tandem with each other. AMD Stock Movement on Friday AMD shares are seeing a decent amount of trading on Friday morning with roughly 50 million units on the move as of this writing. To put that number in perspective, AMD stock\u2019s daily average trading volume is still higher at 74.5 million shares. AMD stock is up 3.3% as of Friday morning and NVDA shares are up 3.2% at that same time. Investors who want to learn even more about the biggest stock market stories today will want to stick around!
