Shop on Amazon Shop on Amazon Shop on Amazon This graphics card is a marked an upgrade to its predecessor, with an improved Navi 21 KXTX GPU variant, slightly different from the XTX in the 6900 XT. The upgrade brings faster core and memory frequencies, with the cost of higher energy consumption with a larger TBP. This also gives rise to some water-cooled solutions as seen in the RTX 3090 Ti. This GPU brought a notable price increase alongside it, with an MSRP of $1,099, although this has dropped a lot in the intervening time, and you can now pick up one for around the $600-$700 mark. Core Clock Speed 2,162 MHz game, 2,368 MHz boost Stream Processors 5,120 Memory Size 16GB GDDR6 Dimensions 340 x 139 x 57 mm PSU Required 850W TBP 335W A great model choice for the RX 6950 XT is the XFX Speedster MERC319. Offering up and overclock along with some simplicity to its design it enhances the base model\u2019s performance without all the unnecessary extras on top. This does offer you a higher performance without the extra cost on top. It uses a simple cooling solution, with a two-slot heatsink and three basic fans, along with a cut-out back plate made of metal that allows the airflow through and takes heat away from the card itself. In terms of the specs, with an 8% increase in the base clock up to 2,009 MHz, along with a 3% game clock increase to 2,162 MHz and a 3% boost increase to 2,368 MHz. Core Clock Speed 1,925MHz base, 2,454MHz boost, 2,244 game Stream Processors 5,120 Memory Size 16GB GDDR6 Dimensions 325 x 140 x 55 mm PSU Required 850W The MSI Gaming X Trio offers the best performance for an air-cooled RX 6950 XT. Although not as powerful as some of the water-cooled options it does still offer an improvement over the baseline. Although it does require a bigger solution that may be a harder fit. For the cooling solution, MSI has used Tri Frozr 2 design. It has three Torx 4.0 fans that alternately combined blades focusing the air into the heatsink. Which is a dual-slot combined with multiple heat pipes to spread the heat along with the whole heatsink. It has improved the game clock of the card by 6% up to 2,244 MHz. The boost clock was also up 6% to 2,454 MHz but without changing the base clock from 1,925 MHz. Give it a leg up on the base cards but not push it to the limits. It also features some RGB personalization and splashes of color across the card. But otherwise a rather simple and sharp design with black and silver. Core Clock Speed 2,100 MHz game, 2310 MHz boost Stream Processors 5,120 Memory Size 16GB GDDR6 Dimensions 267 x 120 x 50 mm PSU Required 850W TBP 335W The reference model is also an option when looking at the RX 6950 XT. It is the choice to go for when after a base model with nothing over to top as it comes in at the MSRP cost and base specs. It offers up a unique connector when considering displays as it offers up USB Type C, giving some flexibility to the options you consider that some models might not utilize. Where the design falls back though is on the cooling capabilities. Even without the extra power from it, the card can run hot and the design isn\u2019t as efficient and strong as the custom cards. But it still functions and works well if the extra heat doesn\u2019t bother you. Core Clock Speed 1925 MHz base, 2116 MHz game, 2324 MHz boost Stream Processors 5,120 Memory Size 16GB GDDR6 Dimensions 320 x 135 x 62 mm PSU Required 950W Although the card may not look too much it can still get the work done. With a large heatsink and striking design. With featurettes of RGB lighting, it does have some features that stand out. Along with a large cooler to keep the higher TBP under wraps. The cooling system has a large copper base plate for good transfer of heat from both die and VRAM. With a dual-slot heatsink that is also long for bigger thermal capacity. But also three fans to best remove the heat from the metal. Without any overclocking, with a base clock of 1,925 MHz. Whilst the game clock is set to 2,116 MHz and the boost clock at 2,324 MHz. Which is still plenty sufficient for 4k that the card aims for. Even though it falls behind the other choices it should cost you less than them. As usual, there are multiple factors affecting the choice of the few cards in the final selection. By reading reviews, results, and our own testing we can get an idea of what to recommend. Combining our expert knowledge of previous installments from brands and how well they work. Since AIB models are based on the same reference card, there are not a lot of changes between options. The main differences you may find are between the cooling solutions, clock frequency, and price. Although the MSRP is dictated by the main creator Nvidia it doesn\u2019t have to stay the same. As the extras on top can hitch up the price. So we make sure you get the best for your money and actually have the features you need. With the products in hand, we can make sure they perform as they should. With several stress tests, we can check the performance of the coolers to make sure they keep the die under thermal wraps to keep up the performance. Whilst performance tests can check they are on par or improved with what we\u2019d expect. Additionally, it allows us to feel the quality and build of the product itself. This lets us test if it lives up to the price they ask for. Along with making sure it lasts a long time to keep up the performance over time. Combining all of this gives us a good idea of what to recommend. Choosing only the top options that are the best for your money. Or finding the specific model that offers something more specific like software integration or RGB design. With so many varieties of options, it may be difficult to pick just one option. With many different companies offering a range of choices, it may be difficult to pick out just one. So to help there are a number of things to decide upon between the different models. One of the bigger factors for more powerful, cards with larger TBPs is the cooling. As to keep the integrity of the GPU die and prolong its life the card will throttle if it reaches a dangerous temperature. Resulting in lower performance which you shouldn\u2019t be losing out on with the cost of the card. Therefore, you want to make sure the cooling on the card is sufficient. If you don\u2019t need anything fancy and want simplicity air cooling is sufficient. However, with increased board power it may end up a thicker card for a bigger heatsink to keep it under wraps. So sometimes there is the choice of water cooling, which will decrease the size of the GPU but does add a radiator. You can be certain it will keep it cool with an AIO if you have the space for it. But it may also come at an extra cost. Another difference you can find that may be important to you is the physical size of the graphics card. Most of it will depend on the cooling solution provided on the product. So it will come down to what kind of build you are creating. If you have an ITX or limited space case you may not be able to fit every size. For higher TBPs you\u2019ll have larger air cooling solutions to accommodate it. So there is the option of water cooling. Each of which has its advantages and disadvantages. It comes down to where you have the extra space for cooling, underneath or elsewhere. To differentiate some models of graphics cards from each other, some AIBs create choices that go above the others. With an overclock, the cards have a higher frequency than the base factory clock of the card. These will then perform better than other options as they can squeeze out even more of the card for a few more FPS. But this does increase the cost over the standard offering which is already plenty powerful usually. A big deciding factor is the cost of the graphics card. It is the part that can go for the biggest range of prices and it\u2019s down to how much performance you need. Between one model there can be a bit of difference in price. As AIBs have differences to ask for a bigger price. The RX 6950 XT has an MSRP of $1,099 but there can be choices that have a higher asking price. Delivering different overclocked performances and cooling solutions can do that. But if you don\u2019t need the premium there will be a selection for you too. Overall, there isn\u2019t much change from the RX 6900 XT. No core changes just improved speeds for the memory and cores. Although coming at the cost of total board power. Altogether pushing the card in the 4k range and up against its Nvidia counterpart. It comes with a Navi 21 KXTX GPU variant on the RDNA 2.0 architecture. Which is still based on TSMCs 7nm process, creating a die 520mm\u00b2 in size. And nests 26.8 billion transistors inside of it. The core composition of the GPU is made up of 5,120 stream processors, 320 TMUs, 128 ROPs, and 80 ray accelerators. Supported by 128 MB of infinite cache. The core frequency of the reference card is set to a 1,925 MHz base clock. And a 2,116 MHz game clock and a 2,324 boost clock. VRAM of the GPU is 16GB of GDDR6 connected to a 256-bit memory bus. Which clocked at 18 Gbps creates a total bandwidth for the memory at 576 GB/s. Speeding up the clock from its predecessor by 2 Gbps. The faster speeds do also increase the total board power over the RX 6900 XT. With a 35W increase up to 335W. Upping the power consumption and heat output. Seeing all the terms sprawled out on the boxes or descriptions it can be confusing to know what it is. So there are some terms we go through to clear up their definitions. Overall, we have the best RX 6950 XT range. With options for air-cooled, water-cooled, or budget you\u2019ll be sure to find the right one for you. With the new flagship from AMD, you\u2019ll be getting the most out of this generation and be on top. But that has changed with the RTX 4000 series and RDNA 3 cards. The RX 6950 XT is the top end from AMD Radeon and the best-performing card from it. So it is worth it if you\u2019re happy with Team Red. But there are still some Nvidia cards that will perform better but maybe not for a better cost. The AMD Radeon RX 6950 XT came out on the 10th of May 2022. As part of the 6X50 XT refresh, it is now the lead GPU for the manufacturer. The Radeon RX 6950 XT can have a maximum of 16GB of GDDR6 memory. Clocked at 18 Gbps across a 256-bit memory bus it produces a bandwidth of 576 GB/s. If you\u2019re looking for an updated and newer version of the RX 6950 XT then there are the RDNA 3 cards to look to. And the closest equivalent is the RX 7900 XTX. Which is the flagship of the generation and capable of reaching great performance levels ahead of the pack.
