The new Ryzen 8000F processors offer a cheaper option for those who don't need an integrated GPU, while the new Ryzen 5000XT processors will offer higher clock speeds than their predecessors.\u00c2 HXL shared a photo from an event panel showing the new Ryzen 8000F and Ryzen 5000XT CPUs. Based on the Hawk Point series, the Ryzen 8000F series is expected to include an 8700F with 8x cores and 16x threads, comparable to the 8700G CPU. The other CPU is the Ryzen 5 8400F, which, due to its name, is more difficult to estimate as its model name falls between the 8500G and 8300G, both of which have significantly different configurations. However, it can be assumed that the 8400F will have 6x cores and 12x threads.

While specific details are still to be determined, we would expect these processors to be similar to the previous Ryzen 3000XT series, with higher clock speeds out of the box, while keeping other specs intact. The new processors were unveiled at a Chinese event, indicating that they might not be available on the global market, at least not during the initial launch phase. However, as with other AMD Ryzen SKUs, such as the Ryzen 7500F, they may be released worldwide, even if only via system integrators. Discuss on our Facebook page, HERE. KitGuru says: It looks like AMD isn't dropping support for the AM4 platform anytime soon. Hopefully, the AM5 platform will get the same extended support. Become a Patron!
