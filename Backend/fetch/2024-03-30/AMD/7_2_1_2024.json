Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) stock or \u2018AMD\u2019 has been a phenomenal investment recently. Over the last five years, the share price has risen about 600%. Here, I\u2019m going to look at where the chip stock could be in another five years. Let\u2019s crunch some numbers. Before I calculate a future stock price, it\u2019s worth briefly discussing what Advanced Micro Devices does. It\u2019s a semiconductor company that designs chips for a range of industries including cloud computing, data centres, video gaming, electric vehicles, and artificial intelligence (AI). Recently it has been getting attention due to its AI exposure. It has been developing high-powered chips (the MI300X) in an effort to go head to head with AI chip powerhouse Nvidia. It\u2019s worth pointing out, however, that there are key differences between the firms. Nvidia is the dominant player in the high-end chip market. And currently, it has an 80% market share in the AI chip space. By contrast, Advanced Micro Devices is a major player in the mid-range and budget chip markets. Many of its products are used for regular computing. So, even if it was to see strong growth from its AI chips in the years ahead, it may not grow at the same pace as Nvidia. To predict its future price, I\u2019m going to use a sales-multiple approach. This involves trying to predict what the company\u2019s sales will be in the future and then applying a multiple to get a market cap and share price. This approach has its flaws. For example, it\u2019s very simplistic in nature and one needs to make a lot of assumptions. But it\u2019s an easy-to-understand approach that could give us a rough indication of where the stock could get to. For 2024 and 2025, Advanced Micro Devices sales are forecast to come in at $26bn and $32.2bn (let\u2019s assume these forecasts are accurate). These figures would represent annual growth of 15% and 24%. I don\u2019t know if this kind of growth is sustainable all the way out to 2029. After all, the company operates in a cyclical industry. But let\u2019s say that the company was able to generate 15% growth per year between 2026 and 2029. That would take us to revenue of $56.3bn for 2029. Now, the forward-looking price-to-sales ratio is about 10.4 today. But that\u2019s at the higher end of the spectrum (in 2022 it fell to just three). So, let\u2019s apply a sales multiple of eight here. Multiplying $56.3bn by eight gives us a market cap of approximately $450bn, which is around 66% higher than today\u2019s share price. That translates to a share price of $279. I want to stress that there are many variables here and my forecasts could be way off the mark. For example, it could average 10% revenue growth over the next five years. Meanwhile, in five years\u2019 time, it could be trading at a price-to-sales ratio of five. All things considered, though, I\u2019m pretty bullish on the stock taking a long-term view. Having said that, I\u2019m not a buyer right now. In my view, the stock has got a little ahead of itself recently. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see a decent pullback in the near future. If we see one, I\u2019ll be buying.
