    "text": "By Dean Seal Regenxbio on Tuesday disclosed positive interim data from the Phase 2 trial of ABBV-RGX-314, its gene therapy treatment for wet age-related macular degeneration. The Rockville, Md.-based biotechnology company said that as of Nov. 6, the therapy was well tolerated across 106 patients from three dose levels, with no drug-related serious adverse events. All treatment emergent adverse events through six months were moderate or mild and included conjunctival hemorrhage, increased intraocular pressure, episcleritis, and conjunctival hyperemia, Regenxbio said. Mild inflammation was reported at similar rate in the first and second dose levels, with mild to moderate intraocular inflammation seen at the third dose level in two of the cohorts, but all intraocular inflammation resolved with topical corticosteroids. There were no cases of intraocular inflammation in dose level 3. Patients treated with the therapy continue to show stable best corrected visual acuity and central retinal thickness at six months, the company said.
