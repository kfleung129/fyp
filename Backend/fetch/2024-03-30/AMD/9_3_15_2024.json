You have to check out some essential features and points before choosing your next Motherboard. One of the most important things in your budget is use cases, upgrade paths, additional features, etc. We have mentioned the key points for sorting out the best Ryzen motherboards for gaming. CPU Support: Before making any decisions, it is better to check the CPU support list of the target motherboard. Currently, AM4 socket rooms Zen 1 to Zen 3 CPUs. They are marketed as Ryzen 1000 to 5000 series. The most updated ones are the 3000 and 5000 series. Almost all the B and X motherboards support up to 3000 CPUs. You have to check more carefully if the particular board supports the 5000 series and whether the older boards are provided with the latest BIOS updates. The sweet spot is choosing B450 or B550 motherboards. Form Factor: This is a very important factor that you have to keep in mind. Motherboards come in different sizes according to casing size and expansion availability. The three standard form factors are ATX, Micro-ATX, and mini-ITX. You have to choose according to your convenience. Most people go with full ATX boards as they tend to have more expansion slots, ports, and upgrade paths. mini-ITX motherboards are for a compact system. Moreover, a small system with mini-ITX motherboards gives the users superb flexibility. The Micro-ATX boards are best suited for all types of users.

PCIe/DIMM slots: Do not forget to check the number of PCIe slots available in the Motherboard. This depends on your use case scenario. For regular users, 1 PCIe x16 slot with an additional x1 slot is more than enough. Also, check the PCIe generation support. Currently, 3.0 and 4.0 are widely available. System memory slots or RAM slots are another very important thing. You will find 2 or 4 slots in most of the AM4 motherboards. For the Threadripper platform, you might find more than 4 slots. Furthermore, try to know the maximum RAM frequency supported by the target motherboard. Overclocking Support: This is not for everyone, but it is better to know if you want more performance from your chosen CPU and RAM. To overclock, you have to buy an unlocked and overclocking-supported processor too. Fortunately, most of the Ryzen CPUs are overclockable with superior memory scalability. Almost all the B and X series motherboards from AM4 socket supports some sort of overclocking. Moreover, you have to check whether the Motherboard\u2019s BIOS is OC-supported. Motherboards are available in most of the computer stores in the local market from all over the world. You will find the best AMD motherboards in online stores, e-commerce websites, authorized dealers, hardware vendors, etc. Moreover, many offers are available on Amazon, Walmart, micro center, eBay, NewEgg, etc. You should buy motherboards from renowned brands, such as MSI, ASUS, ASRock, Gigabyte, Biostar, etc. These manufacturers are known for using high-quality components and power phases on their gaming-grade motherboards.
