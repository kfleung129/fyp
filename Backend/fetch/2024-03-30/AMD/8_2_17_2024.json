    "text": "Now Available On Nexus Mods! Cyberpunk 2077 already supports FSR 3 thanks to a mod that uses DLSS 3 to enable this technology. However, a new mod improves on the concept, eliminating ghosting and improving performance in the game. This mod is now available to download from\u00a0Nexus Mods. From initial testing, it is shaping up to be the best mod for additional performance, making it a viable option for budget and mid-range gamers. Why it matters: Ghosting in games can be a deal breaker for gamers sensitive to this problem. Therefore, this mod will be useful for many PC gamers.  The mod helps minimize the ghosting when riding a bike in the first-person perspective and gets rid of the ghosting that is seen behind vehicles and motorcycles when driving in third-person mode. To do this, Frame Interpolation is essentially turned off in the regions behind the cars but left on for the remainder of the scene. While LukeFZ\u2019s mod was used for testing, other mods ought to function with the mod as well. The video shared by Neegzm demonstrates LukeFZ\u2019s mod. It shows that AMD FSR 3 can deliver four times the average FPS using the mod with a GeForce RTX 3080 at 1440p resolution. Latest Updates Although Cyberpunk 2077 is slated to officially support AMD FSR 3 Frame Generation eventually, the specific date of AMD\u2019s technology\u2019s implementation for the game is unknown. As a result, users must rely on such mods for the time being. Meanwhile, AMD continues to expand its list of officially FSR 3-supported games. This journey began with the likes of Forspoken, but recent releases like Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora and Modern Warfare 3 already include FSR 3 Frame Generation today.
