    "text": "The best CPU for video editing is needed for any content creators looking to push their content to the limits without compromise. This is especially true of rendering high-resolution projects at even higher frame rates. If you want to stand out with quality video on YouTube and other platforms, then keep these models firmly in mind. In order to stay cutting-edge, the best CPU for video editing must be able to utilize the full capabilities of the processor. This means that you\u2019re going to want to turn your attention to those chipsets that feature the highest clock speeds combined with the most cores. Things only get more intense when rendering the likes of 4K (2160p) video for extended periods, too.  Our selection is based on the latest and greatest from both Intel and AMD that are available in the closing months of 2022. At this present moment in time, that\u2019s the Ryzen 7000 series and Raptor Lake. We haven\u2019t just opted for the priciest models in the line-up either. That\u2019s why we have included both budget and premium options available. Fortunately, now both processor generations utilize DDR5 memory and PCIe 5.0 compliance. This means increased bandwidth for your CPU and other components, such as your graphics card, which can help with intensive rendering tasks. Below you\u2019ll find all our top picks to suit most budgets and preferences. If this guide to the best CPU for video editing isn\u2019t quite what you\u2019re after, check out our other guides. We\u2019ve got the lowdown on the best CPUs for the 7900 XT,\u00a0the best CPUs for the RTX 3070 Ti,\u00a0and the best CPUs for streaming, alongside many others.    The AMD Ryzen 7950X is our top choice for the best CPU for video editing. This is because of the 16 cores and 32 threads which comprise the flagship Zen 4 processor. What does this mean for you? Leading single-core and multi-threaded performance when hardware rendering. Simply put, though pricey, there\u2019s no CPU right now that performs as efficiently and confidently as the 7950X for the asking rate. Because the AMD Ryzen 7950X exclusively utilizes DDR5 RAM, you\u2019re getting the most available bandwidth here, too. Keep in mind that you\u2019ll need an AM5 motherboard and compatible memory to use this chipset, though. There\u2019s no backward compatibility here. However, given the leading performance on display, that could be a justifiable feat when all is said and done.   For those on the other side of the fence, the Intel Core i9-13900K is hard to argue against. The recently released flagship Raptor Lake model excels with its 24-cores and 32 threads. The new hyperthreaded E-cores mean that this chipset is able to overclock to 5.8 GHz, too. That\u2019s a feat we haven\u2019t previously seen from either company, excelling far passed the previous \u2018world\u2019s fastest processor\u2019 (the 12900KS) for a solid price. That\u2019s what makes the Intel Core i9-13900K the definitive alternative option for those with the budget to spare. Keep in mind that leading single-core and multi-core performance doesn\u2019t come cheap. This model carries an MSRP of $589. If you\u2019ve got the cash to spare then this option has it all.    Much has been said about the 13600K as it\u2019s somewhat of an anomaly with its price point of $339. That\u2019s because it\u2019s a 14-core (20 threads) processor which overclocks to 5.1 GHz, a previously unheard-of achievement at this price point. It goes to show the refinements made with Raptor Lake\u2019s newly revised E-cores. All those extra cores and threads over the competing Ryzen 5 7600X, 6-core and 12 threads is why this chipset makes the cut. and the latter doesn\u2019t. Having that extra overhead is going to help with rendering times and encoding for streaming and VOD content. At a touch over the $330 mark, that\u2019s a hard act to follow.   You can save yourself a little bit of money and get a similar performance with the AMD Ryzen 9 7900X. In essence, this 12 core 24 threads processor still hits a lot of the same notes as the leading R9 CPU, but with slightly less to work with. The trade-off with performance is represented in the pricing. Whereas the former will run you $699, this model can be yours for a more palatable $549. That\u2019s not to take away from what the high-end Zen 4 chipset is capable of. The AMD Ryzen 9 7900X blitzes any Intel equivalent right now, and this is largely down to the 5nm process. Team red is really going all in on the smaller silicon here. If you want insane performance with an easier price tag to swallow, you may be better served here.   Editing\u00a0video is incredibly intensive for even the most powerful\u00a0processor, especially in higher resolutions at high frame rates. Clock speeds of up to and over 5.0\u00a0GHz\u00a0allow for superior\u00a0single-core performance. Thankfully, the most recent chipset generations from both AMD and Intel are capable of reaching these speeds. Here are some factors to consider when selecting a CPU for\u00a0video editing: Video editing\u00a0benefits from CPUs with a higher\u00a0number of cores\u00a0and\u00a0threads, as video\u00a0rendering\u00a0and\u00a0encoding\u00a0can utilize multiple cores simultaneously. Look for CPU\u00a0architecture\u00a0with at least 6 cores and 12\u00a0threads, but higher core counts are even better for handling complex projects efficiently. While more cores are beneficial, clock speed (measured in\u00a0GHz) also matters. A balance between\u00a0high clock speeds\u00a0and multiple cores is ideal for smooth\u00a0editing\u00a0performance. So check both the base and\u00a0boost clock speed. Larger\u00a0cache\u00a0sizes can improve performance by providing quick access to frequently used data. Look for CPUs with larger L3\u00a0cache\u00a0sizes. Ensure the CPU you choose is compatible with your\u00a0motherboard\u2019s\u00a0socket\u00a0and chipset. Also, verify that your\u00a0motherboard\u2019s BIOS is updated to support the chosen CPU. Higher-end CPUs generate more heat. Make sure your\u00a0cooler\u00a0can handle the thermal demands of the CPU. Check the Thermal Design Power (TDP) rating to get an idea of the cooling requirements. Some CPUs can be overclocked to achieve higher clock speeds. If you\u2019re comfortable with\u00a0overclocking, this can provide additional performance gains. However, it may also require better cooling solutions. High-end CPUs\u00a0can be expensive. Consider your budget and balance the performance gains against the cost. Creative\u00a0professionals\u00a0may be more willing to splash out on the latest\u00a0gen. It\u2019s incredibly close between both AMD and Intel at the end of 2022. The flagship Zen 4 and Raptor Lake options are pretty much neck and neck, but things are more clear in the mainstream and mid-range. While the 13600K wins out against the 7600X, the 7700X does lead ahead of the 13700K. This is a short summary. For a deep dive, we\u2019ve got dedicated features. These are\u00a0Intel Core\u00a0i5-13600K vs\u00a0AMD Ryzen\u00a07600X,\u00a0Intel Core\u00a0i7-13700K vs\u00a0AMD Ryzen\u00a07700X, and\u00a0Intel Core\u00a0i9-13900K vs\u00a0AMD Ryzen\u00a09 7950X\u00a0for more. The i7 is more so tailored for enthusiasts and gamers, while the i9 is intended for beefier workloads. While the i7 can be utilized for video editing, it\u2019s not going to run the gamut of potential, whereas an i9 can handle most video editing workflows.   The AMD Ryzen 9 7950X is our number one pick for the best CPU for video editing. The raw performance capabilities of the highest-end Zen 4 architecture chipset stand head and shoulders above the competition. That\u2019s because of the 5nm process and shows that AMD shrinking the silicon has paid off effectively.
