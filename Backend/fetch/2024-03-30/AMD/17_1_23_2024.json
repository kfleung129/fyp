    "text": "The ThinkPad P14s's attraction is not limited to business customers. While its SmartCard slot and remote maintenance options for the Ryzen Pro processor make it almost predestined as a work fleet computer, the device's full focus on high computing power even for graphically demanding tasks, its practical long battery life and its robust build will appeal to a wide range of laptop users. A look at possible competitors yields the\u00a0ThinkPad T14s G4, which is somewhat more compact and otherwise very similar, and the\u00a0HP EliteBook 845 G10, which has also placed its bet on the efficiency of the powerful iGPU AMD Radeon 780M. Find out where the ThinkPad P14s performs better or worse and how big the difference is compared to Intel's aging iGPU Intel Iris.  The exterior of the ThinkPad P14s is fairly unspectacular. Its matte dark gray surface along with the lit-up dot on the i position it as a ThinkPad. Other than that, the main impression is that of a robust and high-quality chassis. The display will only warp minimally; the base unit not at all. The hinges are pleasantly tight at every opening angle; when closed, the lid is flush with the base unit and sits tightly. Everything looks as if it could withstand daily stress over a long period of time. The chassis is a fairly thick, especially when you know that it doesn't contain a dedicated GPU and the RAM and Wi-Fi modules are soldered on. Other than that, the ThinkPad P14s is compact and light, weighing only 1.3 kg. This is impressive considering the device's sturdiness. The\u00a0Samsung Galaxy Book3 Pro\u00a0may not be as robust, but it illustrates just how slim a 14-inch notebook can be. Everything important is there: USB-A ports on either side, two USB-C ports, two video outputs, and a LAN port. The network connector isn't self-evident for a 14-inch notebook, and the USB4 port ensures easy use of a docking station. Unlike the similarly positioned Intel laptops, however, our ThinkPad features only one fast USB-C port, which would usually be used to connect the docking station or the AC adaptor. The second USB-C port also supports charging and can output video. The high transfer rates of up to 40 Gbit/s are only available on one port. We would have also preferred seeing 10 Gbit/s for the USB-A ports, instead of only 5 Gbit/s - a speed many external SSDs can easily reach nowadays. Qualcomm's Wi-Fi module did not achieve optimum data throughput when sending data in our test. When receiving data, however, the module reached the expected level. With more than 1500 Mbit/s, wireless transmission with Wi-Fi 6 can clearly outperform the LAN port if the distance is short enough. Everything is prepared for a 5G/LTE module, with both the SIM card slot and the cables for antennas in place. The ThinkPad P14s's webcam is fully equipped. It has a high resolution and allows details to be recognized and transmitted during video conferences, for example. The manual shutter enables the user to reliably shut off the lens when not in use. Other features include the IR sensor for face recognition and a dual-array microphone. The color deviation and image noise reduce the overall image quality - but fortunately, this plays next to no role in video calls.\u00a0On the other hand, the good illumination of dark scenes, the level of detail and the excellently functioning microphone really come into their own. Voices are recorded clearly and at a consistent volume from different directions and distances. As is usual for a workstation laptop, all important security functions are integrated. Everything has been thought of, from the fingerprint scanner and facial recognition to the SmartCard reader and the Kensington lock. There are no other accessories apart from the 65-Watt USB-C power supply unit. It is worth mentioning that no unnecessary plastic was used for the packaging and all padding is made from recycled cardboard. Thanks to USB4, most docking stations with USB-C or Thunderbolt should be fully compatible. The screws in the base are easily accessible and can be loosened using standard tools. We recommend using a lifting tool to remove the base plate, but this is not necessary. The plastic clips can also be opened without tools and can be closed again later just as easily. Removing the base plate gives users access to the battery, the M.2 SSD and the optional WWAN card. The RAM and WLAN modules are soldered on and cannot be expanded. It would have been preferable to be able to replace or expand the RAM in particular. This is something a workstation laptop, especially one that is not particularly thin, should be able to offer. Lenovo grants one year of \"Premier Support\" through its own webshop. This includes on-site repairs on the next working day and can be extended to 3 years for a fee. The keyboard meets the expected high standard.\u00a0The slightly roughened and curved keys allow for precise and fast typing. The uniform backlight ensures optimum legibility at all times. The 1.5 mm travel (our measurement) may be too short for fast typers and the slight flexing of the keyboard frame is not ideal. But don't get us wrong: The keyboard is very good for a notebook - the small weaknesses are just not necessarily what you would expect from a ThinkPad. The touchpad and trackpoint show few weaknesses. Their input precision is impressive and the actuating pressure is well aligned with the keys. The display is perfectly suited for typical workstation laptop tasks. It has a decent resolution of 1920 x 1200 pixels with a 16:10 aspect ratio. The IPS panel displays colors accurately and has stable viewing angles - a feature not to be underestimated, especially when a group of people is viewing the ThinkPad P14s's screen from different angles. The matte surface and slightly above-average brightness ensure the laptop is easy to use outdoors. The black value is good and the high contrast ratio further improves the screen's legibility. We only noticed minimal backlight bleeding, mainly in the bottom right corner. The frame rate of only 60 Hz and below-average response rates should be irrelevant as most users will not require the fast-moving content to be displayed perfectly. * ... smaller is better The display covers the entire sRGB color space and is well-equipped to display multimedia content. Professional image processing would require a larger color space, but again, this will not be relevant to most ThinkPad P14s users. Colors are displayed well out of the box. Our measurements indicate that the color space deviation is just above what is perceptible. This mainly affects several gray tones and is hardly noteworthy even there. We were able to further improve the color display by calibrating the panel, although this won't be necessary for most users. Even trained eyes will not be able to see significant differences in the color display with or without calibration. In comparison: 53\u00a0% of all tested devices do not use PWM to dim the display. If PWM was detected, an average of 18015 (minimum: 5 - maximum: 3846000) Hz was measured. The high maximum brightness and good contrast ratio are put to good use when using the ThinkPad P14s outdoors. While seeing the sky reflected in the screen can be annoying, there is nothing to stop you from working outdoors as long as the light doesn't fall directly on the display. As expected from an IPS panel, colors and brightness remain stable even at inclined viewing angles. The ThinkPad P14s G4 is equipped with an\u00a0AMD Ryzen 7 Pro 7840U,\u00a0which includes the integrated GPU\u00a0AMD Radeon 780M. The CPU is characterized by high computing power, good graphics on par with a small dedicated graphics card and its Pro series support for remote maintenance. Another configuration is available with the slightly weaker\u00a0AMD Ryzen 5 Pro 7540U\u00a0and a\u00a0Radeon 740M. There are several RAM options available, ranging from 16, 32 to 64 GB of DDR5 RAM with 6400 MHz. Because the modules are soldered on, we would recommend choosing the more generous option if in doubt. The performance modes are managed through Windows. You can choose between \"Best Performance\", \"Balanced\" and \"Energy Saving\" modes in the energy tab of the settings. The Lenovo Commercial Vantage software is set to the highest performance as a standard. Overall, the changes to the CPU's power limits are minimal. This means that the notebook's performance is comparably high in balanced mode. While the loss in speed is measurable, users will hardly feel the difference in everyday use. The fan remains audible at full load, albeit at a lower level. Things are more relaxed in energy-saving mode, although the performance is still comparably high. The fan remains unobtrusive even during the stress test in this mode. The notebook automatically switches to balanced mode when you disconnect it from external power supply, but users can easily switch the performance mode back to their preferred setting. Our tests and benchmarks were all performed in best performance mode. The\u00a0AMD Ryzen 7 Pro 7840U\u00a0is a powerful CPU that also prioritizes efficiency. Thanks to its 8 cores and 16 threats, it provides sufficient computing power for complex applications and multitasking, while simultaneously limiting energy and cooling needs through a TDP of 28 W. The AMD Ryzen 7 7840U\u00a0has the same basic build and performance but lacks the additional security chip of the Pro series. This chip supports numerous remote functions including centralized updates and management functions. Our CPU beats Intel's 13th-generation mobile CPUs with ease. While the Intel Core i7-13700H has much better features on paper and achieves a similar performance to our test unit, it cannot offer the same efficiency, consuming between 20 and 30 percent more electricity than our ThinkPad P14s, depending on the laptop model. The ThinkPad P14s clearly fulfills its promise of performance and efficiency. You can find more benchmark comparisons in our\u00a0CPU benchmark list. * ... smaller is better * ... smaller is better The PCMark 10 results are remarkable and underline the ThinkPad P14s G4's good performance. It can easily beat the Schenker Vision 14 2023, whose integrated GPU cannot keep up when it comes to media creation. Running on battery in balanced mode limits performance by 20 percent. But even then, the delay when running, installing or uninstalling programs is only barely noticeable. The workstation laptop provides a decent performance at all times. * ... smaller is better * ... smaller is better The results of our LatencyMon test aren't quite as compelling. Users may have some difficulties when trying to process audio and video in real-time. This is largely due to the DirectX driver - something a future update may improve. A change in the driver configuration can always bring about major changes in either direction. * ... smaller is better The SK Hynix SSD is firmly glued onto a copper heat sink and offers a stable high performance even under continuous load. However, the results diminish when the SSD is charged with writing large volumes of data or has to handle parallel access. This has little to no influence on the normal use of programs - even demanding ones. * ... smaller is better The integrated graphics unit\u00a0AMD Radeon 780M\u00a0cannot perform miracles, but it does impressively illustrate how an iGPU can easily reach the level of a\u00a0Nvidia GeForce RTX 2050\u00a0- with a fraction of the power consumption. In the workstation segment, the graphics performance is particularly relevant for professional applications and CAD/CAM software. SPECviewperf can give a good idea of the GPU's suitability for these applications - and the integrated graphics unit performs well, coming close to dedicated GPUs such as the\u00a0RTX A1000, which are built for these professional tasks. The latter achieves 50 percent more performance with significantly greater effort. The performance of the Radeon 780M is also 30 percent higher than that of its predecessor, the\u00a0Radeon 680M. Comparing the\u00a0Intel Iris Xe Graphics 96EUs\u00a0with our Radeon 780M is particularly impressive: The\u00a0Samsung Galaxy Book3 Pro\u00a0with this iGPU only reaches half the amount of points across all 3DMark tests. More numbers, tests and assessments are available on our\u00a0GPU benchmark page. The good synthetic benchmark\u00a0results are reflected when playing current and particularly somewhat older games. Many titles can easily be played at medium or high settings and Full HD resolution. The GPU does reach its limits when playing very complex games such as Starfield, however, where the ThinkPad fails to display 30 FPS even at minimum settings.\u00a0Nevertheless, the game continues to run smoothly despite the low framerate. Our continuous Witcher 3 loop shows no abrupt jumps or spontaneous drops in performance. The slight drop is connected to the day and night rhythm in the game. This shows that the device's maximum performance remains stable even under long-term load. The Lenovo notebook remains almost entirely silent during everyday use. The fans slowly speed up when more performance is required, for example during a lengthy installation process or extensive rendering. The fan noise that results from that is best described as a clearly audible murmur. The user will rarely be bothered by the fan as the latter only reaches such a noise level in exceptional circumstances, as confirmed by the average value under load. While 31 dB(A) is audible, it is scarcely or not at all disturbing. The\u00a0Samsung Galaxy Book3 Pro 14 that we tested not so long ago was about twice as noisy at about 45 dB(A) which totally is annoying and can hamper your workflow. Those not ready to put up with noisy fans should give the\u00a0Lenovo ThinkPad T14 G4 a chance. The SKU we tested was notieably quiter than the P14s G4, despite being powered by the same AMD 7840U chip. The caveat? The P14s G4 lags behind the T14 G4 in CPU performance tests. This is due to the higher CPU power limits of the latter. Noise Level * ... smaller is better The low noise development has a detrimental effect on temperature development. The bottom of the base unit almost always heats up noticeably, reaching a maximum temperature of 48 \u00b0C. This is considerable, despite comparable devices reaching similar temperatures. The heat produced by the strong CPU has to go somewhere, after all. This surface temperature should not be a big issue when working at a desk, although the manufacturers could have put more effort into reducing temperatures on the keyboard, which can also reach over 40 \u00b0C at times. * ... smaller is better As promised, the CPU's maximum power consumption remains constant at 40 W for about 30 seconds. After that, the value drops to a stable 32 W. The measured temperatures usually remain below 70 \u00b0C, which indicates very effective heat transportation. The average capacity during the stress test, meanwhile, is almost always at 100%. The GPU can also be used at maximum capacity at the same time. To measure this, we activated FurMark after 10 minutes and deactivated it again before completing the stress test. The ThinkPad P14s does not show any signs of throttling or excessive heat generation. In other words, nothing stands in the way of continuous use. The speakers are decent but not good. Bass and lower mids are barely audible and the drivers lack power. The quality is good enough for video calls, the occasional video stream and for playing music in the background.\u00a0The sound is balanced and remains pleasant over time. Distortion can only be heard at very high frequencies, which is the case for most notebook speakers.

At full load, however, power consumption can increase to up to 60 W. This is an ideal situation for mobile devices. Very little energy is required during breaks or while browsing the web or reading a document, but when the system is under load, it has 60 W available,\u00a0which the 65-Watt power supply can also provide at any time. * ... smaller is better The remarkably low power consumption during less demanding tasks is reflected in the battery life. The laptop keeps going for over 11 hours in our web browsing test, which is longer than the average device. Increasing screen brightness does, however, have a significant impact on battery life. Still, our best value was reached at almost 70% brightness, which is usually sufficient when working at a desk. The battery life was equally good in our video test, reaching almost 10 hours. This is a satisfactory result, especially when you consider that the battery isn't very large at 52 Wh. Because the workstation notebook provides a lot of power even when running on battery, the battery life drops to just under 1 hour under load. As long as graphics don't play a major role, the Lenovo ThinkPad P14s G4 AMD offers outstanding characteristics for a portable workstation. Its CPU and GPU performance is impressive. The Radeon 780M can easily replace a small dedicated GPU. In addition, the device is highly efficient and its battery lasts an entire day. Countless security features, including face recognition, ensure the safety of your data. The robust construction and remote maintenance options add further protection. Somewhat bland with suboptimal ports but plenty of power, a strong iGPU and more-than-decent battery life:\u00a0Objectively speaking, the ThinkPad P14s is a very good choice. There is room for improvement in the area of connectivity. A strong webcam, all the main connectors and USB4 make the device versatile, with the option of adding 5G/LTE in addition to the already available LAN port. The presence of only one really fast USB port next to the two dated USB 3.0 connectors\u00a0slightly dampens the good impression. Comparable Intel notebooks have more to offer. And a workstation laptop really should allow users to replace and/or expand the RAM module. Nonetheless, the P14s G4 AMD is a superbly well-equipped device that does without fancy extras or a stylish appearance in favor of being affordable. Users looking for even more portability may consider the similarly equipped\u00a0ThinkPad T14 G4\u00a0a good alternative. The\u00a0HP ZBook Power G10, meanwhile, brings more power to the table, especially when it comes to graphics. Several configurations of the Lenovo ThinkPad P14s G4, including our test unit equipped with a Ryzen 7 PRO 7840U, are available from the Lenovo webshop.
