    "text": "Volchar asserts that it can make a name for itself on the EV charging market with its line of durable, waterproof yet compact outlets for home or work. Its latest model is for the former, and is for those with car power needs that can be served with a\u00a0Level 2 output. It is rated to boost interoperable charging options for those who drive cars from brands such as Ford, Audi, Jaguar and Chevrolet thanks to its J1772 charging plug (although Tesla owners will, of course, need an adapter). Volchar is confident that these EV users will appreciate the new charger's UX, with a handle finished in \"premium comfortable rubber\" connected to a 25-foot cable \"that stays flexible\" even in temperatures that drop to -30\u00b0C. The new Volchar charger is also touted to save the owner money, as it can be configured to charge in accordance with different \"plans\" that leverage the ideal electricity rates, if applicable. This can be done in its app, which can also act as a \"Smart Remote Control\" for the accessory. On the other hand, it has the NEMA 14-50 plug type, which means it is restricted to 40 amps (40A) of input. It is listed on volchar.com at its recommended price of $659\u00a0ahead of its release this week (starting March 4, 2024),\u00a0yet is also currently previewed on Walmart for $539.
