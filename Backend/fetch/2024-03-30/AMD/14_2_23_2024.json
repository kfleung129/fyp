    "text": "First, you should know what the Ryzen 3 laptops under 30000 are capable of doing: We know Rs 30000 is an entry-level segment, and you can\u2019t expect heavy performance, but that doesn\u2019t mean you won\u2019t get a satisfactory experience. So, if you are searching for the\u00a0best Ryzen 3 laptop under 30000, here are the best options available. These are our top recommended Ryzen 3 laptops under 30k. But how do these laptops perform in daily life? Read on further as we have covered all these laptops in detail. The Ryzen processors you will get at this price range are\u00a0Ryzen 3 3200U\u00a0and\u00a03250U. The 3200U is significantly older now, so most laptops come with 3250U. But how much of a difference does it make? Except for the L1 cache memory, both processors are exactly the same. (know about L1, L2, and L3 Cache) But technically, the Ryzen 3 3250U has a 900MHz higher GPU clock speed. It\u2019s 300MHz on 3200U and 1200MHz on 3250U. However, real-life usage doesn\u2019t make a significant difference. No matter which processor you choose,\u00a0both will perform almost the same. These processors are capable of doing daily tasks with ease, but keep in mind\u00a0that these are entry-level processors. So you have to limit your expectations. Luckily, you can also get a laptop with Ryzen 3 5300U CPU. Its performance is great as it has 4 Cores and 8 Threads. We have a laptop on our list with the same CPU. Without wasting much time, let\u2019s move to the list now. Main Highlights The reason for putting this laptop on the first spot is that the HP 15s is the\u00a0most value-for-money laptop under 30k. Most of the features that students or office users seek are present here. The build quality is plastic, as expected, but the texture gives it a unique feel. As it\u2019s a hard plastic laptop, there is no flex around the keyboard, and the whole laptop feels sturdy. Considering the price, the build quality is good and leaves nothing to complain about. The display quality is HD, but still, the\u00a0text and images look sharp and vivid. The colors are on the natural side and look good. Complimenting the display are the thin bezels, especially the side ones. It gives this laptop a modern look. It\u2019s an ideal display for everyday work or watching movies. Talking about everyday work, the Ryzen 3 3250U CPU handles all the basic tasks, like using MS Office, browsing, making notes, and attending classes, with ease. Can you game on it?\u00a0No, the CPU isn\u2019t capable of handling games. However, you can play 2D games like LIMBO without any problem. Because of the 8GB RAM, multitasking is a no-brainer for this laptop. Also, the 256GB NVMe SSD makes a significant difference in speed. Overall, the everyday performance is good for all the basic tasks. We also love the fact that\u00a0MS Office 2021 is bundled for free, and you don\u2019t have to pay anything extra to use it. However, there is no backlit keyboard or fingerprint scanner. Getting these two is not so common in this segment. Because of the HD display and not-so-power-hungry CPU, the 41 Wh battery lasts 4-5 hours, which is good, if not the best. When out of juice, the fast charging comes in handy. Verdict:\u00a0The HP 15s is a capable laptop under 30k. It might not have appealing specifications, but what it has is more than enough to offer a good everyday experience. Pros and Cons Is Acer Extensa 15 a worth buying budget laptop? Click here to know. Main Highlights Acer is a well-known brand in the industry that is known for providing some great laptops. The Acer Aspire 3 is their\u00a0entry-level laptop. It offers some decent specifications. The primary reason to pick this laptop is the display. It\u2019s an FHD display instead of just HD. So the text and images look sharper compared to the HP 15s. You might not notice a significant difference, but when looking closely, you will notice sharper content on Aspire 3. The display quality itself is good. The colors are natural and look decent while doing everyday tasks. This display won\u2019t surprise you, but it won\u2019t disappoint you either. Another area where this laptop won\u2019t disappoint you is performance. As expected from Ryzen 3 3250U, you can do all the basic tasks without noticing any lag. However, don\u2019t open too many apps or multiple tabs in the browser simultaneously because the laptop starts to hang in such conditions. The 256GB M.2 SSD helps to enhance the speed, but you should not expect high performance from this laptop. If you are a student, office user, Blogger, or Writer, then this laptop will serve you well. If you are thinking of playing games on it, then you will get utterly disappointed. This CPU can\u2019t handle games. However, like HP 15s, 2D games are playable without any problem. We don\u2019t like the fact that this particular variant doesn\u2019t come with Microsoft Office. You have to buy it separately, or better, go with another variant that has MS Office. The battery life is also average. 36.7 Wh battery lasts 3.5 hours with normal use and 2 hours with slightly heavy use. Verdict:\u00a0The overall performance of Acer Aspire 3 is good for day-to-day tasks. It\u2019s not the fastest laptop, but it will deliver reliable performance in everyday use. Pros and Cons Main Highlights The Lenovo V14 is another good Ryzen 3 laptop under 30000. Like other laptops on this list, it offers a very good user experience. Starting with the design, the Lenovo V14 has a\u00a0180-degree hinge\u00a0design, which means you can place it flat on the table. The laptop is completely made of hard plastic, which is hard enough to handle everyday use. Considering the price point, it has a very good build quality. The\u00a014 inches HD anti-glare\u00a0display produces slightly vibrant colors, which look pleasing in everyday use. Having a smaller display means more sharpness. Hence, despite only having an HD display, the text looks sharper. Powering the laptop is the AMD Ryzen 3 7320U,\u00a0which can handle regular tasks easily. Like other laptops, it\u2019s not an issue to run basic tasks. The performance is right on par with other good laptops. The older variant of Lenovo V14 had\u00a04GB RAM\u00a0and 1TB HDD, but the one listed here comes with 8GB DDR5 RAM and 512GB SSD storage. Having a smaller display has another benefit. It consumes less power. The company claims this laptop lasts\u00a05.5 hours\u00a0on a single charge, but during the working session, you can expect it to last\u00a04 hours. It\u2019s not that good, but above average. Dual 1.5W Dolby stereo speakers\u00a0produce rich sound for the price. It\u2019s not the loudest, but it\u2019s way better than a single speaker. Verdict:\u00a0Lenovo V14 is as good as other laptops on this list. It offers decent specifications for the price. If you are looking for a portable Ryzen 3 laptop, then this is a good option. Pros and Cons Main Highlights The primary reason to buy the Lenovo V15 G2 is its performance. It\u2019s the only laptop under 30k, which houses a\u00a0Ryzen 3 5300U\u00a0CPU. If you are unaware of it, then this CPU easily outperforms the Intel i5 10210U, be it a single-core or multi-core performance. There is no denying the fact that it\u2019s easily\u00a0the most powerful laptop under 30k. Now, what can you do on this CPU? As Ryzen 3 5300U has the power to beat the i5 10th gen CPU, you can perform all the tasks with ease. In addition to that, you can also play games to some extent. You can\u2019t play intensive games, but some light games are playable in lower settings. Doing basic everyday tasks is a no-brainer for this laptop.\u00a0It\u2019s ideal for students or office users. However, you should also know that the RAM is only 4GB. It\u2019s less for today\u2019s standard, and you have to upgrade it if you use multiple apps simultaneously. Fortunately, the RAM is upgradeable up to 12GB. The build quality is sturdy, and the laptop feels rigid. The entire body is made of plastic, but it doesn\u2019t feel cheap from any angle. Working or watching content is going to be a good experience as the display quality is very good. It\u2019s an FHD panel, so the texts and images look sharp. The colors on this display are slightly vivid, which looks nice in everyday use. There is no complaint regarding the display. Depending on your usage, the 38Wh battery can last 4-5 hours. It\u2019s not a full-day laptop, but still, it\u2019s better than other laptops. Remember that this laptop has DOS. So if you have never used it, then you have to install Windows OS. It won\u2019t take much time, but still, it\u2019s an extra task. Verdict:\u00a0If you can upgrade RAM and Install Windows, then Lenovo V15 G2 is an excellent laptop under 30k.
