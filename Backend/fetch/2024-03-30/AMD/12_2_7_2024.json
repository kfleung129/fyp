    "text": "ASUS has released an update for the ROG Ally handheld gaming device, following up on the improvements made in the December update that introduced gyroscope controls, joystick response curve, and some bug fixes. The latest update, identified as ACSE 1.4.10, further optimizing the device for gaming performance and usability. A key feature in this update is the addition of manual mode adjustments for power management, also known as a quick access TDP slider. It enables users to tailor their device\u2019s performance to specific gaming needs. Additionally, the update allows for the gyro enable feature to be assigned to multiple buttons, improving gameplay flexibility. We've released a new update to Armoury Crate SE, with a few small enhancements and a quick access TDP slider. To adjust TDP on the fly, put your Ally in Manual Mode and you\u2019ll be able to change the SPL, SPPT, and FPPT right from the Command Center. pic.twitter.com/jrmoX0EMSL A notable quality-of-life improvement is the introduction of a \u201cNever show again\u201d option for campaign pop-ups, aimed at reducing interruptions during use. Also, to prevent configuration conflicts, new game profiles will now start in an \u201cUnassigned\u201d operating mode. While the eagerly awaited AMD Fluid Motion Frames (AFMF) technology is not yet part of this update, ASUS indicates that it is in the final stages of testing. Once integrated, AFMF is expected to significantly improve the visual performance of games on the ROG Ally.
