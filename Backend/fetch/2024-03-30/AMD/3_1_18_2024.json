    "text": "MENU The product discontinuation notice AMD issued to distributors covers the XC9500XL, CoolRunner XPLA 3, CoolRunner II, Spartan II, and the five Spartan 3 CPLD product families that were acquired as part of the Xilinx deal in 2022. These are less complex than the high end FPGA devices and often used for interface designs. The discontinued ranges include the 3ADSP Commercial/ Industrial \u201cXC\u201d and Automotive \u201cXA\u201d product families due to declining run-rate and supplier sustainability reasons and there are hundreds of part numbers covered in the product discontinuation notice. It does not include the Spartan 6 and 7 ranges. The Spartan 3 family was launched back in 2011 and leaves AMD with a focus on the Artix low end FPGA and Zynq high end families.\u00a0The move has a certain irony as AMD sold its MACH series of CPLDs to Lattice Semiconductor back in 1999. Last Time Buy (LTB) final orders will be accepted until June 29th, 2024 as long as AMD and distributors have parts available. Customers are requested to place last-time-buy orders in a timely manner prior to the key dates listed above to avoid product availability issues says the company. An order remaining open on or after April 30th, 2024, will be deemed Non-Cancellable and Non-Returnable (NCNR) and final deliveries must occur on or before December 28th, 2024. Return Material Authorizations (RMA) for replacement devices due to quality issues will be accepted until June 27th, 2025.
