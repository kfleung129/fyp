In this case, the focus will be entirely on the math and specifically the math of the options market. You\u2019re going to expect me to lecture you on the virtues of virtual reality stocks to buy? I can do that if you\u2019d like. Some market research firm says this target, another says that target. Who cares, honestly? We\u2019re here because you want to get rich quick with equity market opportunities. We\u2019re going to do just that. Buckle up for a mind-blowing ride into virtual reality stocks to buy. News flash, neither Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) nor the other virtual reality stocks to buy on this list will get you rich if you peddle around with buying a few shares here and there. To make money, you need money \u2013 that\u2019s just the bottom line. And if you\u2019re a little short, that\u2019s what options are for. Specifically, I\u2019m looking at the META Jan 17 \u201925 40.00 Call. Even with the dramatic price increase on Thursday, the math looks compelling: Here\u2019s where things get really interesting. Currently, analysts project META stock to hit $528.54 over the next 12 months. Further, the high-side target lands at $575. Now, these targets presumably should materialize in February but let\u2019s push it up a month. If META hits the average analysts price, you\u2019re looking at $52,854 (from the $528.54 target multiplied by 100 shares). So, your profit would be $4,755. At the highest target, it would be $9,401. As a relevant but boring technology juggernaut, I typically don\u2019t get too excited about Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). However, I looked at the options market, did some math and I changed my mind. I\u2019m extremely excited about MSFT as one of the virtual reality stocks to buy. So, I\u2019m looking at the MSFT Jan 17 \u201925 200.00 Call. Yes, MSFT closed Thursday at $406.56 so we\u2019re going to pay a ridiculous premium for this contract. But let\u2019s walk through the math: So, let\u2019s get to the interesting part. Over the next 12 months, analysts project that on average, MSFT will reach $469.45. The high-side target calls for $600. And the lowest price target sits at a relatively high $440. Let\u2019s assume these targets come true in January 2025 than in February. If so, even at the lowest price, you would be profitable. At $440, your 100 shares would be worth $44,000. Subtract that from $41,368 and you have $2,632. Wow! To be sure, the options contracts of the top two virtual reality stocks to buy are mighty expensive. I\u2019m not going to sugarcoat this \u2013 so is Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). However, the cost savings are tremendous. Let\u2019s again look at January of next year, specifically the AMD Jan 17 \u201925 55.00 Call. Again, we\u2019re deep in the money, which seems unnecessarily risky. We just need to do the math: Okay, let\u2019s bring out the analysts\u2019 price targets! On average, Wall Street\u2019s experts are calling for AMD stock to reach $194.94. Moreover, the high-side target lands at $270. So, with the leverage of 100 shares, your gross investment value ranges between $19,494 and $27,000. Assuming the 12-month targets come true one month early, you\u2019re looking at a profit of $1,516 if the average hits or $9,022 if the optimists win out.
