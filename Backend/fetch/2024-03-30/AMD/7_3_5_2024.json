    "text": "Helldivers 2 is officially making its way to both PC and PS5 next month, in February 2024 after seeing a slight delay from 2023. Now, before its release, Arrowhead Game Studios have officially shared the PC version\u2019s technical details, including the Helldivers 2 System Requirements. Thankfully, like previous PlayStation PC ports, the developers have shared the target resolution, preset, and expected framerate. If you\u2019re looking to play the game at High settings at 1440p with a 60 FPS target, you\u2019ll need something like an RTX 3070 paired with a Ryzen 7 5800X3D. While not as demanding on the GPU front, it\u2019s clear that you need a reasonably powerful CPU for this title. If you\u2019re fine with playing at 30 FPS on 1080p, you can play the game at low settings on a GTX 1050 Ti paired with a Ryzen 5 1500X. We hope that this means that there is enough room for scalability on both ends. You can pre-order Helldrivers 2 now on PC through Steam. Make sure to read about the pre-order bonuses and its different editions here. Helldivers 2 is coming to PC and PS5 on 8th February 2024.
