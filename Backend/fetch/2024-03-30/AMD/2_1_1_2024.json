    "text": " AMD may not be able to gain share from Intel next year, causing AMD stock to underperform Advertisement Source: Pamela Marciano / Shutterstock.com Driven by large opportunities in artificial intelligence in particular and a general recovery of the chip market, AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) stock could very well outperform the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq in 2024. But on the other hand, the firm\u2019s valuation appears to bake in continued, large market share gains by AMD at Intel\u2019s (NASDAQ:INTC) expense, and that scenario may very well not materialize. Given these points, I rate AMD stock as a \u201chold\u201d at this point, and I view INTC as a much better alternative. This article will walk the reader through my thesis and comparison of AMD stock and its peers. On Dec. 22, Swiss bank UBS issued a bullish note on the chip market in general and AMD stock in particular. According to the bank, chip makers are heading into a \u201csweet spot\u2026 (as) inventory has peaked and started converting to revenue,\u201d Moreover, the firm thinks that AMD is well-positioned to benefit from data centers\u2019 expansion while the entire sector will get a lift from the incorporation of AI chips into smartphones and PCs. UBS named AMD and Micron (NASDAQ:MU) as its two top picks in the chip space. Meanwhile, on Dec. 6, AMD launched its \u201cnext-gen AMD Instinct\u00a0MI300 data center GPU accelerator family,\u201d another InvestorPlace columnist, Chris MacDonald, noted. CEO Lisa Su has asserted that these chips are \u201ccomparable to Nvidia\u2019s H100 chips in training (large language models)\u201d but are superior to NVDA\u2019s H100 chips on inference by 40% \u201cwhen working with Meta\u2019s Llama 2, a 70 billion parameter LLM,\u201d The Verge reported. Assuming that Su\u2019s assertions are at least close to accurate, the Instinct MI300 chips can accelerate AMD\u2019s top and bottom line growth by large amounts, given the huge demand for high-quality AI chips and Nvidia\u2019s inability to meet that demand. Trading at a forward price/earnings ratio of 40 and an Enterprise Value/EBITDA ratio of 58, AMD stock is pricey. Tech enthusiast Jackson Luca asserts that \u201cmost bullish forecasts for AMD assume continued share grabs against Intel across PCs and the cloud data center.\u00a0\u201d Given Luca\u2019s statement and the high valuation for AMD stock, I believe the shares will probably bake in continued major share gains by AMD at Intel\u2019s expense. But with Intel appearing to have greatly improved the quality of its offerings, those gains may not come to pass. Specifically, the firm has started incorporating \u2018neural processing units\u2019 into its computer processing unit chips, enabling its CPUs to handle \u201cAI workloads without needing an external GPU,\u201d Luca noted. And, although the benchmark score of Intel\u2019s upcoming Gaudi 3 AI chips is meaningfully lower than that of AMD\u2019s MI300, Gaudi 3 does beat AMD\u2019s offering regarding transistor count. Also importantly, the Gaudi 3 offers double the memory capacity of the MI300, even though the chips are the same size. Moreover, as I reported in a previous column, Intel cannot make the Gaudi 2 (Gaudi 3\u2019s predecessor) quickly enough to meet demand. Of course, that indicates that firms are enthusiastic about Gaudi 2 and will like Gaudi 3 even more. Also noteworthy is that Luca\u2019s \u201cbase case\u201d scenario involves AMD losing \u201cmarginal..(market) share\u201d to Intel, causing AMD stock to stay \u201crangebound\u201d for some time going forward. I believe that\u2019s a very realistic prediction. I view Intel as a better choice than AMD for investors. With a forward price-earnings ratio of 28, Intel has a huge opportunity in AI and, over the longer term,  looks poised to generate a great deal of revenue by manufacturing chips for other companies.
