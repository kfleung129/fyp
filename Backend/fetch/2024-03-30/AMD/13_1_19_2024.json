They\u2019re up roughly 65% since October, handily beating both Nvidia and the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index in that period. AMD has surged roughly 12% this week, outpacing a nearly 6% leap for Nvidia, which is also climbing Friday and set an all-time high Thursday. Investors see huge growth potential for chips and expect that Nvidia \u201cwon\u2019t be the sole winner,\u201d said David Wagner, a portfolio manager at Aptus Capital Advisors. \u201cInvestors are looking for a catch-up trade\u201d after Nvidia\u2019s stellar performance in the past year, he said. Semiconductor shares got a boost overall on Thursday from better-than-expected fourth quarter results from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. The main chipmaker for Apple Inc. and Nvidia said it expects revenue growth of at least 20% for the year, after a slump in 2023.

Of those three, Barclays now has the highest target at $200 per share, raising it from $120 on the potential for artificial intelligence as a driver. The stock traded as high as $167 on Friday. More than 70% of analysts covering AMD have a buy-equivalent rating, data compiled by Bloomberg show.

Some of that gap is due to AMD\u2019s recent rally - the stock price only overtook the average analyst price target in December after months below the level. Analysts can also be slow to update target prices and ratings, especially in the weeks before an earnings release. Both AMD and Nvidia have upcoming earnings reports that will give investors a sense of their growth outlook for the year ahead. AMD releases results on Jan. 30, and Nvidia in late February. The reason Nvidia has surged so much and continues to be a favorite is its booming revenue growth, which gives it a cheaper valuation than many peers. Nvidia trades at about 28 times forward earnings, a premium to the semiconductor share benchmark at about 23. AMD trades at a multiple of more than 40. \u201cThose stocks are more than fully valued at this point, especially AMD,\u201d said Alec Young, chief investment strategist at MAPsignals, adding that AMD has more to prove because earnings haven\u2019t come through yet. \u201cIt\u2019s not a good setup for the bulls right now.\u201d If the rally in chipmakers fades, it could present an opportunity to those who are bullish on AI\u2019s long-term prospects, Young said. \u201cThese are definitely stocks you want to buy on any weakness, but just tactically you probably don\u2019t want to chase them here today,\u201d he said. Still, the sector\u2019s strength to start the year shows that the enthusiasm around AI that propelled chipmaker shares and the tech sector in 2023 hasn\u2019t faded, even as a rally in the S&P 500 Index appears to have stalled. \u201cIf you believe in AI then you believe in the broadening of the opportunity \u2014 it\u2019s not just one or two companies that are going to take that share,\u201d said Will Rhind, chief executive officer of GraniteShares. \u201cThis is just reinforcing the narrative that AI has a lot more room to run.\u201d Tech Chart of the Day Another dismal week for Chinese equities saw grim milestones pile up. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Tech Index, which hosts the likes of Tencent Holdings Ltd., Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Xiaomi Corp., is already down 17% in 2024 after three straight years of losses. The index has seen about $1.8 trillion wiped out since a February 2021 peak. Top Tech News Apple Inc.\u2019s long-awaited Vision Pro mixed-reality headset will finally be available for preorders on Friday, giving the company its first real taste of consumer demand for the $3,499 device. Apple vowed to open up its coveted tap-to-pay technology on iPhones to rivals in a bid to sidestep potentially massive European Union antitrust fines. Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s proposed $1.4 billion acquisition of Roomba maker iRobot Corp. is expected to be blocked by the European Union\u2019s antitrust regulator over concerns that the deal will harm other robot vacuum makers. When fast fashion giant Shein firmed up plans for a US initial public offering late last year, the online retailer hoped that it wouldn\u2019t be subjected to regulatory review in China. Paytm trimmed losses in the latest quarter after the Indian fintech company cut costs and scaled up services to small merchants.
