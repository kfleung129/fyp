    "text": "In response to growing sanctions on tech products from US and its allies, China has unveiled new guidelines that effectively bans Intel and AMD products from computers on government operated networks and systems China has unveiled guidelines aimed at phasing out U.S. microprocessors from government personal computers and servers, as reported by the Financial Times on Sunday. The directive also aims to sideline Microsoft\u2019s Windows operating system and foreign-made database software in favour of domestic alternatives. According to the report, government agencies above the township level have been instructed to prioritize \u201csafe and reliable\u201d processors and operating systems in their procurement processes. China\u2019s industry ministry issued a statement in late December listing CPUs, operating systems, and centralized databases deemed \u201csafe and reliable\u201d for a three-year period, all sourced from Chinese companies, Reuters checks confirmed. The State Council Information Office, responsible for media queries for China\u2019s cabinet, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Neither did Intel nor AMD immediately respond to Reuters\u2019 requests for comment. This move comes amidst efforts by the US to boost domestic semiconductor production and reduce reliance on China and Taiwan, as outlined in the Biden administration\u2019s 2022 CHIPS and Science Act. The act aims to bolster US semiconductors and offers financial aid for domestic production, including subsidies for the manufacturing of advanced chips.
