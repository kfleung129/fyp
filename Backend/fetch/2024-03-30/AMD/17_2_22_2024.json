    "text": "The Constellation branded graphics card and gaming CPU are up for grabs again to celebrate the AMD FSR 3 performance update to Starfield. Niall Walsh Published: Feb 22, 2024 Don\u2019t worry, you\u2019re not suffering from deja vu,\u00a0Bethesda is once again giving away\u00a0a limited edition Starfield AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX and Ryzen 7 7800X3D.\u00a0This time, it\u2019s to celebrate the release of the latest game update, which introduces AMD FSR 3, and hopefully, much-improved PC performance. We consider the\u00a0AMD\u00a0Ryzen 7 7800X3D to be the best gaming CPU available right now, while the Radeon RX 7900 XTX is one of the best graphics cards too, if you\u2019re not so fussed about peak ray tracing performance. Plus, that card has been made all the better with the launch of AMD FSR 3, though the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 Super\u00a0and its ray-tracing superiority continue to make it the more tempting alternative for a similar MSRP. Regardless, this giveaway holds a ton of value, especially if you\u2019re still working with a dated gaming PC. Entering is simple, but you have less than a week to do so.  The rules state\u00a0you must be a resident of the US, Canada, United Kingdom, Mexico, Belgium, Luxembourg, or the Netherlands to win. To enter, you simply need to follow the Starfield Twitter (X) account and repost the competition to your page. Entry closes on Wednesday, February 28 at 12PM ET, after which time a random draw will take place and one lucky winner will be contacted to arrange delivery of their prize. If the selected winner is voided for any reason, the draw will be done again until a valid winner is selected. One way potential winners could get caught out is by having a private profile. Your Twitter (X) account needs to be public and viewable by those running the competition. Failure to meet this requirement will see you deemed an invalid entry. As good as the Radeon 7900 XTX is, it doesn\u2019t actually earn a place on our list\u00a0of the best graphics cards, but you can check out the choices that kept it from inclusion if you need some inspiration. Likewise, if you need help getting a new GPU into a rig, we can show you how to build a gaming PC with an easy step-by-step guide. Niall Walsh                 As one of PCGN\u2019s Hardware Editors, Niall is an expert in all things peripherals, meaning if you need to know what the best PC gaming headsets, controllers, keyboards, mice, or monitors are, he has you covered. Even if you just want to know which peripheral brand is better, Razer, Corsair,\u00a0Logitech, or any other he can help there too. You will also find his words on sites such as;\u00a0The Loadout, Wargamer, USA Today, MTG Rocks, GGRecon, and RealSport101. "
