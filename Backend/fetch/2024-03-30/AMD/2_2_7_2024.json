    "text": "For now, only in beta.  As promised, AMD and Bethesda are introducing FidelityFX Super Resolution 3 technology in Starfield. Despite AMD being a PC launch partner for this game and the fact that FSR3 was announced more than a year ago, the game did not support FSR3 at launch, to many gamers\u2019 disappointment. In fact, the game received support for DLSS3 with Frame Generation in November last year, with no sign of FSR3. The long wait is over, and FSR3 can now be enabled in the game, but only if you\u2019re using Steam and select the beta build manually. The game with FSR3 is supposed to launch for everyone later this month.

We are still waiting for many games, such as Cyberpunk 2077, Dying Light 2, Frost Punk 2, which were announced to support this technology at some point.
