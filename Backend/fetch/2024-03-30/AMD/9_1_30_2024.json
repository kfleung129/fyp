AMD announces that it has received UK Government Defence and Security Accelerator (DASA) funding within the new \u201cAffordable and Adaptable Unmanned Air Systems\u201d competition. 30 secondes Funded by the Army Research Innovation and Exploitation Laboratory (ARIEL), a part of the Army\u2019s Futures Directorate, the competition seeks novel low-cost and adaptable autonomous air systems to give the UK an advantage. The challenge for AMD is to use its existing low-cost radar absorbing technologies to help such autonomous air systems survive against evolving counter-air and counter-uncrewed air system threats. John Lee CEO of AMD says: \u201cWe are excited to be working within this program offering the UK Government an opportunity to exploit the existing AMD Radar absorbing technologies that have been developed over the last five years. We fully expect to be able to demonstrate that AMD materials will, without any other negative impact, provide a significant broadband reduction in the radar cross section of the platform.\u201d  Announcement Business Defence, Security & Ballistics Read this next Stay up to date with the latest composites news directly in your inbox.
