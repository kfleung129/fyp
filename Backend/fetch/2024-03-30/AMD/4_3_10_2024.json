    "text": "Whether you own a Zen 4-based Ryzen CPU or an Intel 14th gen chip, these micro-ATX motherboards are the answer to your needs. Motherboards come in various sizes, from small and compact mini-ITX boards, to unfathomably complex and larger boards like E-ATX and EE-ATX. Although the standard ATX motherboard is considered the most common and popular due to its mid-size and versatile layout, its younger sibling, the Micro-ATX motherboard (also known as m-ATX) is a form factor that is ideal for users who like compact builds but don't want to sacrifice much on features and internal headers. These boards are typically the same width as the standard ATX motherboards, just a few inches shorter in overall length, making them a great addition to some small form factor builds. Unlike the mini-ITX, m-ATX boards include more onboard features and are generally considered budget boards in comparison. This makes m-ATX motherboards a fantastic choice for building a mid-range system without sacrificing features. With the latest Intel Raptor Lake/Refresh and AMD Zen 4 lineup becoming the norm these days, it's fair to say that users who are looking for an m-ATX motherboard will settle with either an LGA 1700 or AM5 socket respectively. Fortunately, there are a couple of chipsets present for both platforms, and even though they aren't powerful enough to break world records, they surely offer plenty of ports and connectors for easy upgrades, a decently capable power delivery system, and satisfactory connectivity options. Power Delivery: Unlike ATX motherboards, m-ATX motherboards generally don't come with too many power phases. This is due to their compact design, but it's always recommended to check the VRM and its components, especially when overclocking is one of the primary goals. Component Compatibility: Always check for the type of RAM supported on the motherboard. It's important to understand that with the transition from DDR4 to DDR5, some users might mistakenly buy a DDR4 motherboard which results in slightly lower performance. One should also check for PCI-E Gen 5.0 support and if the motherboard doesn't lack M.2 connectors. Connectivity: Connectivity can be divided into two types: Wireless and wired. Wireless connectivity indicates the presence of Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, while wired connectivity indicates the presence of a sufficient number of ports for peripheral connection. Faster USB ports are always preferred, particularly the Type C Gen2x2, which offers 20Gbps of speed. Onboard Features: It can be difficult to find onboard troubleshooting features on m-ATX motherboards, but one should opt for the one that has Debug LEDs for easy troubleshooting. If the board also comes with power, CMOS reset, and BIOS flashback buttons, then it should be given priority over those that don't have them. Cooling: VRM and the chipset should come with a decently sized heatsink for heat dissipation. Some motherboards also come with an M.2 connector shield which is even better. Also, plenty of chassis fans and AIO headers will ensure all-around cooling of the build. Asus ROG STRIX Z690-G GAMING WIFI is a killer m-ATX motherboard with unparalleled support for high-end components. Its strong 15-power phase VRM allows overclocking without any worries and the big aluminum heatsink over it makes sure the CPU doesn't thermal throttles. Made with an 8-layer durable PCB, it's more reliable than most m-ATX boards out there and boasts beautiful RGB lights. Not only is it unparalleled in aesthetics, it is also more capable than any other m-ATX motherboard including all the latest chipsets in LGA 1700 and AM5 sockets. Featuring a solid 14+1 power phase design, it can allow overclocking mid-range CPUs like Core i5 14600K without breaking a sweat. While it is not meant for extreme overclocking, users can still experiment with the voltages and multipliers as the board comes with Debug LEDs to troubleshoot any malfunctions. The board has an excellent large heatsink over the VRM components, the M.2 connector, and the chipset. Moreover, they are equipped with RGB LEDs that can be controlled via any popular RGB software. There are plenty of connectivity options at the I/O and on the PCB itself, which lets users connect to several peripherals at the same time. There is also a Type C Gen 2x2 port that is blazing fast in transfer speed. Furthermore, the motherboard BIOS can be reset or upgraded through the buttons present in the I/O. Except for the absence of Gen 5.0 support for the M.2 connectors, there aren't any major complaints, particularly when the primary PCI-E x16 slot already supports Gen 5.0 bandwidth. Surely, it is a premium motherboard but will help future-proof the build for several years. MSI MAG B650M MORTAR WIFI brings a powerful delivery system with each power phase rated at 80A. The thermal solution is top-notch with dedicated heatsinks for each section. Plenty of USB ports are offered at the I/O along with WiFi 6E to make sure users can benefit from their high-speed internet. The B650M Mortar WiFi is the ultimate solution for Ryzen 7000 CPUs without breaking the bank. Offering plenty of connectivity options, the MAG B650M Mortar WiFi ensures no user goes without a wireless internet connection and Bluetooth support.

Whether users want to connect simple peripherals or fast USB devices, there are USB ports for every purpose, including USB 3.2 Gen 1, Gen 2, and Type C Gen 2x2 with 20Gbps speed. Furthermore, the onboard headers provide support for up to 7x USB ports, including a Type C connector for cases that come with a Type C port on the front panel. Moving towards the most crucial areas, its VRM has sufficient potential to overclock mid-range Ryzen CPUs. Thanks to the 12 VCore power phases where each phase is rated at 80A, stability at higher clock speeds won't be the issue. This is further enhanced through the two dedicated heatsinks on the VRM that are grooved for ample airflow. For the GPU, there are 2x PCI-E x16 slots with the primary one being strengthened using steel armor and, for the storage, users can either opt for the dual M.2 connectors or the SATA connectors. ASUS Prime Z790M-Plus belongs to the affordable Prime series but, despite that, it doesn't fail to impress. With a robust power design and good support for storage and expansion cards, it stands out in the mid-range category. Being compact in size doesn't stop it from providing ample connectors/ports for various devices and has a rich I/O for connectivity. The Asus Prime Z790M-Plus comes from the affordable Prime family but still provides support for overclocking. Even though it isn't capable of maxing out the sliders, it should be adequate for mild overclocking. With a 10+1 power phase VRM and big heatsinks on top, the motherboard will avoid dropping of the clock speed by eliminating thermal throttle. Of course, a good CPU cooler is mandatory for users who are thinking about overlocking their processors. However, the motherboard will play a good part in maintaining stable temperatures. There are plenty of USB ports on the I/O that are handy for connecting several input devices without the need for any USB hub. From USB 2.0 to 3.2 Gen 2x2, every port is available at the I/O. The only thing missing is the built-in WiFi adapter, which can be a dealbreaker for some.
