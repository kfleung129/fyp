Learn more With so many custom models out there, it can be hard to find the best RX 7800 XT graphics card available. We\u2019re here to try and cut through the noise. The RX 7800 XT is one of the latest cards we\u2019ve seen from AMD. With RDNA 3, brilliant 1440p performance and a tonne of VRAM, it is set up to be a high-quality, high-end card that doesn\u2019t retail for the eye-watering prices we\u2019ve seen for the latest generation of Nvidia GPUs. Not only does it save you money on purchase though, thanks to the breakthroughs in energy efficiency AMD made with this latest generation, it is also more affordable to run. Shop on Amazon Shop on Amazon Shop on Amazon If you know you want an RX 7800 XT but don\u2019t know exactly which version of the card to go for, you\u2019re in the right place. We\u2019ve got a range of options in different categories and are breaking down the strengths of each. Let\u2019s get started. Base clock 1620 MHz Boost clock 2565 MHz VRAM 16GB GDDR6 Dimensions 335 x 129 x 50 mm Recommended PSU 700 Base clock 2124MHz Boost clock 2430MHz VRAM 16GB GDDR6 Dimensions 302x130x56mm Recommended PSU 700W Base clock 2255MHz Boost clock 2565MHz VRAM 12GB GDDR6 Dimensions \u200e13.58 x 5.95 x 0.1 inches Recommended PSU 700W The RX 7800 XT is one of the most powerful cards on the market. That means it is very capable at 4K. However, it is actually primarily targeted at being one of the best GPUs for 1440p, and it certainly achieves that. This could prove a shrewd business move too, as 1440p gaming is actually more common than 4K, thanks to the fact that the best 4K gaming monitors cost an arm and a leg. Let\u2019s get into our top picks. Base clock 1620 MHz Boost clock 2565 MHz VRAM 16GB GDDR6 Dimensions 335 x 129 x 50 mm Recommended PSU 700 This card from XFX builds on the already impressive specs of the RX 7800 XT primarily thanks to its impressive design. This design manages to significantly improve cooling, while also maintaining a high build quality and great aesthetic, making this card one of the best GPUs out there at the moment. The Merc 319 is built to maximize ventilation and airflow. There\u2019s a large fin-stack heatsink, which, is not significantly blocked by the cooler shrowd or backplate. On top of that, there are 3 ventilation fans. The main body of the card is also built from aluminium, ensuring a sturdy and durable product. On top of that, XFX increased the base clock speed, cracking it up to 2254MHz compared to the 2124Mhz speed seen in the reference card. This makes for improved performance. And this higher performance doesn\u2019t actually set you back too much cash, with this GPU currently one of the best GPUs under $600. Base clock 2124MHz Boost clock 2430MHz VRAM 16GB GDDR6 Dimensions 302x130x56mm Recommended PSU 700W We should note that, if you are looking for the best budget GPU, the RX 7800 XT might not be the best card to go for. This is one of the best AMD GPUs we have ever seen, and, as a result, even in its cheaper iterations, it will still set you back a pretty penny. If you have your heart set on the RX 7800 XT (and who can blame you if you do?), it makes sense to check out the most affordable version of the card. The GIGABYTE Radeon RX 7800 XT Gaming OC manages to be one of the best GPUs under $500, while still packing a tonne of power. It has an out-of-the-box clock speed that rates among the fastest of any of the Navi 320-based GPUs, clocking in at a base speed of 2124MHz. On top of that, there is the sophisticated Windforce cooling system. This consists of three 90mm blade fans, which spin in alternate directions, as well as 7 copper heat pipes, 3D active fans and screen cooling. Taken together this ensures your card can run a full power without overheating. Base clock 2255MHz Boost clock 2565MHz VRAM 12GB GDDR6 Dimensions \u200e13.58 x 5.95 x 0.1 inches Recommended PSU 700W The PowerColor Red Devil RX 7800 XT\u00a0is a great card for the gaming enthusiast. Not only does it have juiced-up power specs but also a tonne of premium features for monitoring and altering your RX 7800 XT. PowerColor Hellhound boosts the RX 7800 XT\u2019s factory overclock, up from 2124MHz on the reference card, to 2214MHz. The clock speed of a graphic card, tells you how many processing cycles it can complete in a second, the higher the speed, the more calculations the card can complete in the same amount of time, and thus the more graphic power it can produce. The one downside of this is that it can increase your card\u2019s temperature. Fortunately PowerColor Hellhound has you covered there as well. There\u2019s a large triple-slot cooling solution coupled with three double ball-bearing, LED backlit fans. These are pretty simple to remove too, making for easier maintenance. On top of that, the card comes with DrMOS software compatibility, which allows you to digitally monitor your card\u2019s performance and temperature. Pair it with the best motherboard for gaming, and the best CPU for the RX 7800 XT and you\u2019ll have yourself a formidable gaming rig. Overall, the RX 7800 XT is an impressive top-end graphics card. If you already know you want this GPU, but are struggling to make a choice for exactly which AIB to go for, the main things to consider and clock speed, cooling and aesthetics. We\u2019ve broken down each of those in our descriptions, so have a think about which one is most important to you and pick based on that. When it comes to picking the best RX 7800 XT GPU, there are a few common questions that keep popping up. We\u2019ve done our best to answer some of them here. In terms of sheer power, the RX 7800 is essentially equivalent to the RTX 4070, with the RX 7800 XT actually tending to just edge the 4070. Yes, the RX 7800 XT is one of the most powerful GPUs for gaming currently available. This is thanks to its high specs and advanced RDNA 3 architecture.
