AMD Ryzen AM5 8000G desktop CPU (mockup), Credit: Expreview  Just a day after discussing the leak regarding the Ryzen 5 8600G, a midrange APU from the upcoming desktop series, we are now shown the performance of a faster Ryzen 7 8700G SKU. In contrast to the 8600G\u2019s configuration of 6 cores and 12 threads, the 8700G steps up with a full spec of 8 Zen4 cores and 16 threads. Tests conducted on ASUS TUF X670E-PLUS motherboards with the AM5 socket reveal the APU\u2019s capabilities when paired with 32GB of DDR5-4800 desktop memory. The Geekbench entry discloses a 4.2 GHz base clock and a 5.1 GHz boost clock for the APU. In other words, this means a boost of 400 to 500 MHz over the current fastest desktop APU still available in the market, the Ryzen 7 5700G, which features 8 Zen3 cores.   AMD Ryzen 7 8700G specs, Source: Geekbench  The Ryzen 8000G series brings more than just a CPU microarchitecture upgrade. In addition to the updates to CPU processing power, the integrated graphics subsystem is receiving a boost as well, transitioning from the dated Vega graphics to the latest RDNA3. This change, which skips two generations of RDNA, will make AMD desktop APUs much faster. Leaked details reveal that the Ryzen 7 8700G APU will feature Radeon 780M graphics with 12 Compute Units, boasting a boost clock of 2.9 GHz. The lower thermal and power constraints in the desktop form factor should make it easy to increase the frequency above 3.0 GHz, though. Benchmark results, conducted using Geekbench OpenCL and Vulkan APIs, show 29244 and 35427 points, respectively. In comparison to Phoenix-based mobile APUs using the same specs, performance is within the margin of error. It should also easily be twice as fast as Ryzen 7 5700G \u201cRX Vega 8\u201d integrated graphics, but it is worth keeping in mind that synthetic benchmarks may not reflect gaming performance. For those, it\u2019s best to wait for independent reviews to appear, which should hopefully happen soon.
