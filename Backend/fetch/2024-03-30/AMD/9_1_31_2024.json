While CEO Lisa Su said in December AMD\u2019s supply of AI chips for 2024 is \u201cwell above\u201d $2 billion worth, the company\u2019s share of the AI chip industry is miniscule in comparison to leader Nvidia\u2019s nearly 80% market share.\nThe market for programmable chips, which can be customized to perform a variety of functions, has also faltered in the past quarters as industries like automotive and industrial are being hit by a chip supply glut owing to weak end-market demand. \nRival Intel also flagged corrections in programmable chip inventories across industries on a post-earnings call, which it said are expected to last through the first half of the year. \nAMD expects revenue of $5.4 billion, plus or minus $300 million, for the current quarter, compared with analysts\u2019 average estimate of $5.73 billion, according to LSEG data.\nOn an adjusted basis, AMD forecast gross margin of about 52% for the first quarter, compared with the estimate of about 51.7%.\n\n (Reporting by Arsheeya Bajwa in Bengaluru; Editing by Shilpi Majumdar)\nDisclaimer: This report is auto generated from the Reuters news service.
