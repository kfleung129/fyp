But buying a graphics card that excels at all the above and sports a good-looking white theme is even harder. Whether it\u2019s the abysmal stock levels or the relatively lower demand for white GPUs, the situation isn\u2019t good. But I\u2019ve put together a list of the best white graphics cards on the market for every budget to slightly ease your purchase journey. FYI: fancy a GPU upgrade? We can show you what to look for when buying a new graphics card. Price: $1060 It may not look like a conventional white GPU, but the Sapphire Nitro+ AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX\u2019s wraparound shroud exudes a brilliant silvery sheen that can rival any white graphics card. Plus, its dual RGB light bars will perfectly complement your RGB setup. The card packs some serious graphical horsepower under its triple-fan cooling setup and is currently one of the most powerful consumer graphics cards. It includes a killer 4K GPU, a generous 24GB VRAM, and is a productivity workhorse. While it runs incredibly cool and silent, it still lags behind Nvidia\u2019s high-end RTX cards in ray tracing games. It was also one of the gaming PC parts that impressed me in 2023, due to its raw performance at a fantastic price. Price: $2380 If money\u2019s no object, and owning the most powerful, best-looking GPU in the world is your thing, the Asus ROG Strix GeForce RTX 4090 White OC Edition is the only GPU for the job. Leaps ahead of any other consumer graphics card on the market, the brilliant white shroud, coupled with the subtle RGB, illuminated ROG branding, and industrial backplate, make this card the showstopper of any enthusiast build. With 24GB of VRAM and the full might of Nvidia\u2019s ray tracing tech behind it, it\u2019s pretty much overkill for all but the most discerning users. Plus, the massive Strix heatsink is at the heart of the class-leading cooling and whisper-silent operation of this card. It costs a fortune but is the best for those who won\u2019t settle for less. Price: $1,400 If you want flagship performance at 4K resolution in ray tracing titles, the Gigabyte GeForce RTX 4080 Super AERO OC provides the best value for the price. Sure, the Gigabyte AERO variant costs a sweet premium, but the gorgeous white design and clean silver backplate can dazzle anyone. Plus, the card keeps it simple with no flashy RGB. The new RTX 4080 Super improves upon the RTX 4080 by bringing a minor performance bump to an already powerful card. You can easily max out the best gaming monitors at 4K resolution high settings and enjoy path tracing and ray tracing titles as they were meant to be experienced. This card strikes the perfect balance between flagship performance and premium ray tracing power. Price: $830 Even mainstream cards have sadly blown up to $800. However, to combine premium 1440p performance in modern titles with a striking all-white design, you\u2019ll have to shell out a lot for the Zotac Gaming GeForce RTX 4070 Ti Super Trinity OC White Edition. Yes, it\u2019s a mouthful, but its futuristic curvy design and RGB lighting more than make up for that. The brilliant triple-fan white design isn\u2019t just for show. It also packs a solid heatsink and backplate that provide a cool and silent operation, even during intense gaming sessions. About 15 percent slower than the RTX 4080 Super, this card can power all modern titles at 1440p max settings, and the DLSS 3.5 provides the extra boost in demanding ray tracing titles.

Price: $420 Budget graphics cards haven\u2019t been doing well as of late, but the Zotac Gaming GeForce RTX 4060 Ti 8GB Twin Edge OC White Edition proved to be a solid 1080p performer. It comes in a two-fan, all-white design that resembles a white chocolate candy bar. The Zotac RGB lighting is present as well, adding a lit pizzazz to your PC. Even in modern demanding titles like Cyberpunk 2077, Hogwarts Legacy, and The Last of Us Part 1, the Zotac Gaming GeForce can easily provide a 1080p 60+ FPS experience, obviously aided by DLSS. Even at 1440p, you\u2019ll be able to get 60 to 80 FPS in most titles, and even more than 100 FPS in some AAA titles. Overall, the RTX 4060 Ti has more power than it needs for premium 1080p gaming. Price: $290 The size and power requirements of GPUs have been getting out of hand. If you need a compact white graphics card for your budget PC or mini-ITX build, the Asus Dual GeForce RTX 3060 12GB White OC Edition is a great option. It has a gorgeous clean design and features a pleasing backplate, regardless of how you install this graphics card in your PC. The RTX 3060 is a popular GPU because it provides a decent level of performance, has 12GB of VRAM, doesn\u2019t require large cooling solutions, and is quite affordable. It\u2019s a last-gen Nvidia card, but you can still play modern titles at 1080p with medium-high settings. Plus, its compact form factor ensures that it\u2019s compatible with almost every PC case. The best white graphics cards can elevate the aesthetics of your white-themed build. For a premium over non-white models, you can grab some of the most powerful and good-looking GPUs in the world for your next PC build. Wondering whether an Intel Arc GPU is good for gaming? We have the answer. You can also watercool your existing GPU for better performance or undervolt your GPU to save power, depending on what you prefer.
