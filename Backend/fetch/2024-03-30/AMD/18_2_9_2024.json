    "text": "The cost of Nvidia GeForce and AMD Radeon GPUs alike are rapdily reducing, with some graphics cards now being sold for far below their MSRP. Samuel Willetts Published: Feb 9, 2024 A complaint lodged at both AMD and Nvidia graphics cards\u00a0over the past several years is that they\u2019re simply too expensive, with MSRPs increasing across the price spectrum. Thankfully, it appears that we may now be seeing some welcome adjustments, as the\u00a0prices of GPUs from both manufacturers appear to be tumbling downward. Separating the best graphics cards\u00a0from the rest of the pack requires performance and price to be taken into account, and the latter has been\u00a0a key factor\u00a0for both\u00a0AMD\u00a0and\u00a0Nvidia GPUs lately. Not only have MSRPs already been high, but high demand and short supply both from gamers and crypto miners in the past few years\u00a0caused prices to rocket for a while. Thankfully, some healthy competition in the GPU industry is reversing that situation in\u00a0plenty of places. Looking at both Amazon and Newegg, there are plenty of exciting price\u00a0drops\u00a0for current-generation graphics cards.\u00a0As I predicted in our RTX 4080 Super review, the launch of that GPU and its cheaper Super siblings are having a dramatic effect on the market. The biggest shift we\u2019ve spotted is the RX 7900 XT, which can now be had for $669.99 (Amazon). That\u2019s an all-time low in terms of pricing, and a whopping $220 below its MSRP. This\u00a0will\u00a0make it more competitive with the RTX 4070 Ti Super, which has also prompted the cost of\u00a0the RTX 4070 Ti to fall, with the GPU now available for $699.99 (Newegg). Deals for the more budget-conscious are aplenty too, with the RTX 4070 now dropping to $519.99 (Amazon) from its recently adjusted $549.99 MSRP following the release of the RTX 4070 Super. Meanwhile, the RX\u00a07700 XT is approaching the $400 mark (Amazon), a price more befitting the GPU and leaving the RTX 4060 Ti 8GB look like an even worse value offering than before. The situation is\u00a0a little less rosy on the high-end, sadly. While the RX 7900 XTX is now purchasable for just $919.99 (Newegg), a lack of MSRP stock is causing\u00a0RTX 4080 Super prices\u00a0to become inflated.\u00a0Worse still,\u00a0the cost of the RTX 4080 is yet to\u00a0fall enough to make buying one worthwhile. There\u2019s little movement on RX 7600 and RTX 4060 prices either, but it\u2019s\u00a0hopefully only a matter of time before we see discounts hit both these GPUs. There\u2019s no one-size-fits-all option when it comes to GPUs, so I strongly suggest checking out our best graphics card list, as well as our reviews, to help you determine which pixel pusher suits your needs.
