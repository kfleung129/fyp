    "text": "Advanced Micro Devices AMD shares have skyrocketed in price over the past twelve months. AMD stock has surged by 106.8% during this timeframe. Riding the AI wave has been profitable, but now may not be the right time to enter. Nor is it a good reason to \u201clet it ride,\u201d on the view that the runaway rally for the chip designer\u2019s shares will carry on in the months ahead. Although there\u2019s been just as much, if not more, substance, not hype driving the stock\u2019s convincing performance, after moving too far, too soon, shares could start to top off and risk a price correction. AMD Stock: In Bubble Territory, Despite Substance to AI Bull Case With some AI stocks, investor hype is clearly well over substance. A good example is C3.ai AI. C3.ai has ginned out a lot of excitement about its potential to capitalize on the generative AI mega-trend, but has yet to really do so (based on its latest earnings results) Again though, with AMD stock, one can say that there is a substantive AI bull case to be made. With December\u2019s unveiling of AMD\u2019s Instinct MI300 series of accelerators, the company is cashing in on the AI chip boom. Based on management\u2019s upwardly revised forecasts, AI chip sales could total $3.5 billion this year. Better yet, this forecast may be conservative. Per analysts at Citi, AI chip sales during 2024 could come in at $5 billion. In 2025, sales could hit $8 billion. Yet while this could have a dramatic impact on AMD\u2019s top and bottom lines, the issue is that investors have arguably priced-in these aggressive forecasts. Perhaps, too aggressively. It\u2019s the same situation with other AI stocks, including high-quality ones. Now \u201cpriced for perfection,\u201d and possibly in bubble territory right now, it may not take much to spark a price correction. The Next Wave of Turbulence As I argued last month, the AI stocks bubble, just like the dotcom and EV stock bubbles before it, will come to an end. This is poised to happen, even as the underlying trend that caused the bubble in the first place (the rise of generative AI) continues. Many things could lead to the bubble screeching to a halt. For instance, further sign from the Federal Reserve that it will be cautious in its lowering of interest rates. This could throw the market (anticipating a more rapid move to lower) in for a loop. Even if the current bubble continues for another year or so, ahead of the final few waves of investor exuberance, could come a few waves of turbulence. Over the next few months, AMD stock could hold steady. Shares may even keep inching higher. Come May 1, however, shares could once again make a big move, and not in a good way. That\u2019s when Advanced Micro Devices has its next quarterly earnings release. If AMD\u2019s initial AI chip sales fall short of \u201cperfection,\u201d it may elicit a negative reaction, in contrast to the mixed reaction to last month\u2019s earnings release. Bottom Line: Sell if You Own, \u2018Watch and Wait\u2019 if You\u2019ve Yet to Buy Don\u2019t get me wrong. In the coming years, the growth of the AI chip market, coupled with a comeback in demand for CPUs and GPUs for non-AI end user markets (like PCs and gaming), will likely result in steady earnings growth over the next few years. However, with the risk of Advanced Micro Devices shares, after their hot run in 2023 and in early 2024, delivering less-stellar (or even negative) returns in the near-term, a change in your approach is warranted. If you currently hold AMD in your portfolio, it\u2019s time to take some chips off the table. If you\u2019ve yet to add this top-performing AI chips play, resist the \u201cFOMO,\u201d and sit on the sidelines. Whether because of a deflating/bursting of the AI stocks bubble, or from this stock experiencing some post-earnings turbulence, a better AMD stock entry point may be just around the corner.
