Alongside all the new hardware you might pick up for your new gaming rig \u2013 choosing the best CPU for RX 7900 XTX & XT might be the most important choice for you to make. The RTX 4090 & RTX 4080 both demanded new CPUs due to their reliance on PCIe 5.0. Lovelace architecture in the RTX 40-series GPUs allows for double the data transfer between the GPU and processor due to PCIe 5.0\u2019s higher bandwidth versus PCIe 4.0. The innovation doesn\u2019t stop there either. Now that AMD Ryzen 9 7900X3D release date has been confirmed, a 3D cache CPU is not far away. Architecture Raptor Lake Core Count 24 Thread Count 32 Boost Speed 5.8GHz Cache 36MB Cores 16 Threads 24 Base speed 4.5GHz Boost speed 5.7GHz Cache 65MB TDP 170W Cores 10 Threads 16 Base Clock 3.7GHz Boost Clock 4.9GHz Cache 20MB TDP 125W Cores 8 Threads 16 Base Clock 3.4GHz Boost Clock 4.6GHz Cache 32MB TDP 65W So, with the release of the RDNA 3 in late 2022, and sales displaying healthy demand, an obvious question is do you need a new CPU for the RX 7900 XTX or RX 7900 XT? It\u2019s likely that if you\u2019re looking for the latest CPU for the RX 7900 XTX or RX 7900 XT, you\u2019re going to be on the lookout for the best new CPUs like the Ryzen 9 7900, Ryzen 9 7900x or Intel 13th Gen CPU. That being said, unlike the RTX 40-series, the RDNA 3 graphics cards should be fully compatible with older CPUs. This process of selection has gotten even harder now that Ryzen has announced their new \u2018Non-X\u2019 versions of their 7000 range. There is a chance that older processors with lower clock speeds and cache might throttle your new GPU slightly. Alongside that, something often overlooked in PC builds is the motherboard, of which we have suggested the best motherboard options here. To cover all bases, we\u2019re going to be offering a selection of processors that don\u2019t compromise on quality and price throughout each processor generation, whilst also offering high-end performance options for your gaming pc at various price points. Architecture Raptor Lake Core Count 24 Thread Count 32 Boost Speed 5.8GHz Cache 36MB We\u2019ve selected the Intel i9-13900K as the best Intel CPU for the RX 7900 XTX & RX 7900 XT. Released as Intel\u2019s flagship Raptor Lake CPU, the 13900K is a high-performing CPU is one of the best processors around, and will future-proof your gaming rig for generations of tech releases to come. Read now: AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D vs 9 7900X3D With a max frequency of 5.8GHz, you likely won\u2019t find a better CPU for gaming performance on the market at the moment. Alongside that, the specs showcase 24 cores and 32 threads, meaning that the interconnected relationship between CPU and GPU is going to be lightning-fast and efficient. The i9-13900K is rivaled by the Ryzen 9 7950X & Ryzen 9 7900X, both of which feature in our top picks for the best CPU for RX 7900 XTX & RX 7900 XT. Costing upwards of $600 from popular tech retailers, the 13900K will set you back a significant amount. However, if you can afford it \u2013 this might just be the best CPU for gaming at the moment, which CPU specialist, Jack Horworth, has dove into with his Intel Core i9-13900K review. If you do decide to take the plunge on this powerful CPU and are worried about it overheating, check out our article advising on the best cooler for i9-13900K. Cores 16 Threads 24 Base speed 4.5GHz Boost speed 5.7GHz Cache 65MB TDP 170W The Ryzen 9 7950X is the most offensive rival to the Intel i9-13900K, and is also vying for the top spot as the best CPU for RX 7900 XTX & XT. Built on Zen 4 architecture, the AM5 socket supports much higher data bandwidth, whilst also offering future-proofing for the latest hardware releases such as PCIe 5.0 and more. Aside from that, the RX 7900 XTX & XT will pair well with the Ryzen 9 7950X for gaming performance, and you won\u2019t have to worry about the 7950X throttling FPS or resolution as the CPU is proven as one of the best for gaming. Read now: What is a normal CPU temperature while gaming? The Ryzen 9 7950X is currently resting in a similar price range to the 13900K, so the decision between the two really depends on a few things: your current hardware, your end-game hardware, and how much you\u2019re willing to spend. Cores 10 Threads 16 Base Clock 3.7GHz Boost Clock 4.9GHz Cache 20MB TDP 125W The Intel i5-12600K is great for those looking for a CPU at a lower price point for RX 7900 XTX & RX 7900 XT graphics cards. Costing slightly more than the Ryzen 7 5700X, both options provide prices at varying ends of the budget CPU spectrum. The 12600K is loaded with an LGA 1700 socket and support for PCIe 5.0, making the processor future-proof and compatible with the latest and upcoming computer hardware.

Our personal recommendation is that this is a better overall budget CPU than the Ryzen 7 5700X, which we have covered in the section below. You will end up paying slightly higher for it, though it\u2019s completely worth the money. Cores 8 Threads 16 Base Clock 3.4GHz Boost Clock 4.6GHz Cache 32MB TDP 65W The Ryzen 7 5700X is a fantastic budget CPU available for as little as $200 at the moment, also making it likely to be the best budget CPU for RX 7900 XTX & XT. With clock speeds between 3.4 GHz and 4.6 GHz, your PC won\u2019t be lacking in cycle speed at any moment \u2013 making it even easier for the GPU to maintain consistent refresh rates while playing performance sensitive games such as Overwatch 2 and Valorant. Read now: AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D vs 9 7950X3D Compared to the 7000-series CPUs, the 5700X does lack in terms of cores and thread-speeds, and it\u2019s important to consider this when you\u2019re playing graphically intensive games in which level load times and waiting screens might not be as quick as the latest generation of hardware. That being said, the 5700X is a fantastic budget and entry level CPU for high-performance gaming that won\u2019t break the bank. The Intel i9-13900k is the best CPU for gaming with an RX 7900 XTX & RX 7900 XT. This is due to its superior performance in all aspects: gaming, workload processing and rendering. This makes it perfect for gamers, but also for graphics designers and data processors who are executing tasks that will be intensive on the CPU. Read more: Best CPU for RTX 4080 With the LGA 1700 socket, this is future-proof and compatible with all the latest hardware \u2013 making it without a doubt the best CPU for RX 7900 XTX & XT. Intel\u2019s 13th Gen CPUs were released in October, and they applied significant improvements over the previous generation. Jack Howarth\u2019s WePC Intel i9-13900k CPU review exemplifies the performance alongside the AMD Ryzen 9 7900X, with the results shown in the following graphic: With this in mind, the choice between Intel & Ryzen isn\u2019t easy, as the performance advantages are distributed evenly across the two generation\u2019s flagship processors. However, the price difference between the two is significant and should be considered.

Most CPUs dating as far back to the early 2010s will likely be compatible with the RX 7900 XTX & XT, however we don\u2019t recommend using CPUs dated before the Ryzen 3000 series or Intel 10th Gen as they may not be up to the task of working alongside such a powerful GPU. This is a common misconception, though if you\u2019re building your own PC with the latest graphics card you don\u2019t have to worry about pairing and Intel CPU with and AMD graphics card. They are designed for cross architecture support. Yes \u2013 Intel\u2019s chips are designed to be compatible with all the most popular GPUs, this means they are compatible with all of AMD\u2019s cards. Make sure that your CPU matches your graphics card power and performance. You\u2019ll need a high cache memory and the ability for your CPU to achieve high clock speeds. Though it\u2019s tempting to go for the highest-performing CPU, you should check that your GPU won\u2019t bottleneck first. The RX 7900 XT should perform about\u00a01.4 \u2013 1.6X better than the 6950 XT. It boasts\u00a010752 FP32\u00a0cores\u00a0and is helped by 5nm RDNA3 architecture. The 7900 XT GPU has a base clock of 1.5GHz and 2.4GHz boost. This is all while offering\u00a020GB of GDDR6 memory, to help cut costs.
