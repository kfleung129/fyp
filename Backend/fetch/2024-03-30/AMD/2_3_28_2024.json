The information came to light following a tweet from the user Momomo_US, who shared a photo of a shipping list that included details about the AMD Ryzen Granite Ridge Zen5 desktop CPUs.\u00a0The document specifies the core counts and categorizes each CPU within the Ryzen Desktop family, indicating the 8-core variant as potentially a higher-tier Ryzen 7 model and the 6-core variant as a mid-range Ryzen 5 model. The 6-core CPU is referred to as the A0 version, while the 8-core CPU is listed as the B0 version. The shipping list reveals two variants of the Granite Ridge CPUs: The first variant, identified as 100-000001404-01, features 8 cores and 16 threads, and is noted to have a Thermal Design Power (TDP) of 170W. This model is anticipated to be part of the Ryzen 7 series. The second variant, with the identifier 100-000001290-21, includes 6 cores and 12 threads, with a TDP of 105W. This CPU is expected to belong to the Ryzen 5 series. These CPUs are likely in the prototype stage, and the TDP values provided may not reflect the final specifications of the retail versions.
