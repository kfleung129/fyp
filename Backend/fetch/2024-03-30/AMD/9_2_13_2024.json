Improving upon the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080, but more importantly, decreasing the retail price as well. It offers up the great extent of the Ada generation without the biggest price tag on top even though it still may be a bit high for some. You can expect to play at 4K high settings but it\u2019s not like the 4090 that can reach hundreds in there. Unless you utilize DLSS 3 and frame generation, or at least turn down the settings a touch. But going down a resolution or two can provide an incredibly fast performance to match your high refresh rate monitor. Even though it may be equipped with the 16 power connector, it still offers up a slimmer card than some other choices.

Although there may be some drawbacks in ray tracing performance and encoding, for pure gaming and good value it is a great choice. Especially when paired with an AMD CPU as well, providing a fast and strong computing choice. Although focused on 1440p, it brings a high frame rate across the board even pushing in 4k. You can expect a strong choice for an all-round pick. Even if that\u2019s not enough you can have RSR enabled across the board to boost framerates in anything you play. Graphics RAM Type GDDR6 Video Output Interface DisplayPort, HDMI Chipset Brand NVIDIA Memory Speed 1807 MHz Graphics Card Ram Size 12 GB As for the lower-end choice of GPU, the RTX 3060 is the one to go for. Providing a good budget choice it does offer a great value to get into a strong performance. As it tops the Steam Hardware survey it is a well-respected choice for anyone out there especially to fulfill the range of 1080p gaming. You can still get great visuals without having to spend a fortune on top-tier performance. The video card provides a small and compact solution to getting a gaming rig going at even under $1000. The RTX Ampere still has plenty to offer even to this day and entry to a strong architecture for all you might need from it. For the basic requirement, you need a GPU with DX 11 and 1GB of VRAM. The suggested GPUs are the HD 7730 or GT 640. With the recommended jumping up to 4GB of VRAM, on the level of an R9 290 or GTX 970. Which is fairly low-end for the most recent choice of cards and the Apex Legends system requirements don\u2019t take too much to reach.

Capable of running hundreds of FPS you benefit from a better GPU, although you still want to ensure you have a good CPU as well so you don\u2019t throttle your graphics.
