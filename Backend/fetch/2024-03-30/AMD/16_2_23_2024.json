Nevertheless, the bottom bezel is sizable compared to others. The\u00a041W battery\u00a0can last up to\u00a04.5 hours\u00a0on regular office use. It\u2019s an average battery endurance because it\u2019s a notebook laptop and should last longer. The laptop runs on Windows 11, and the\u00a0MS Office\u00a0Home and Student 2019 is available with lifetime validity. HP has given a backlit keyboard, which is great for typing in the dark, but unfortunately, the fingerprint scanner is missing. Verdict:\u00a0The HP 15s is an excellent laptop for power users. Along with the performance, it also brings most features to the table, making it the best value for money Ryzen 5 laptop under 50k. Pros and Cons Main Highlights When it comes to raw power, the ASUS Vivobook 16X comes on top. From the above spec table, you already know that it comes with Ryzen 5 5600H CPU. But how good is this CPU? Well,\u00a0it\u2019s the most powerful CPU on a laptop under 50000. It used to power more expensive laptops, but as this CPU is aging, you can get it on laptops under 50k. Compared to Ryzen 5 5500U, the 5600H is around\u00a016% faster\u00a0in single-core and more than\u00a035% faster\u00a0in multi-core. The real-life difference isn\u2019t that significant until you push both these CPUs to the limits, but when you do, you will surely notice that 5600H is faster. This laptop can handle heavy tasks, too, and everyday tasks are nothing for it. What also makes this laptop stand out is the display. It\u2019s a\u00a016:10 display, which means you get more vertical screen area to work with. The quality of this display leaves nothing to desire. The colors are well-tuned and look great. For everyday use,\u00a0it\u2019s an excellent display. You will also love the design and build quality of this laptop. The laptop is slim and feels like an expensive notebook. It\u2019s a premium touch that Asus has given here. The build quality is as good as the design. It\u2019s made of plastic but feels sturdy when held in hands. It\u2019s nice to see that Asus hasn\u2019t skimped on the most useful features like a fingerprint scanner, backlit keyboard, Wifi 6, and USB Type-C port. Although the company claims 8 hours of battery life, on normal usage, you can get\u00a07 hours of battery\u00a0with ease. Using the laptop intensely will naturally reduce the battery life. Lastly, the output quality of dual speakers is also decent. It\u2019s loud, rich, and ideal for everyday media consumption. Verdict:\u00a0The ASUS Vivobook 16X is a complete package with the most powerful CPU, great display, premium design, and much more. We are confident enough to recommend this laptop. Pros and Cons Main Highlights Meet the\u00a0Lenovo Ideapad 3, a laptop that costs around 46k but brings everything you want. It\u2019s not only the most powerful laptop under 46k but also one of the most featured packed ones. So,\u00a0what\u2019s so impressive about Ideapad 3? Starting with the CPU itself, it\u2019s the\u00a0Ryzen 5 5500U CPU, which is the most powerful processor under 50k, without any doubt. Having\u00a06 Cores\u00a0and\u00a012 Threads\u00a0means this CPU can handle those heavy tasks that need more core and threads, like\u00a0video editing. 6-10 cores are recommended to perform more complex video editing. So this CPU is perfectly fine for that. What about gaming? Can we play games on Ideapad 3? Many games are playable in lower settings, but the lack of a dedicated GPU hurts. The integrated AMD Radeon isn\u2019t meant for gaming, so does the laptop itself. The day-to-day performance of this laptop is impressive, thanks to the\u00a08GB RAM\u00a0and\u00a0512GB SSD. Every task performed on this laptop doesn\u2019t take any time. It would have been great if the RAM could be upgradeable up to 16GB instead of 12GB. But at least you can expand it. The Lenovo Ideapad 3 is\u00a0visually attractive, thanks to the tiny bezels around the display. Talking of which, it\u2019s a good display under 50k. Yes, it\u2019s not as good as the OLED display laptops,\u00a0but compared to others, it\u2019s ahead of most. The colors are good, and the text looks sharp. You can choose the 14-inches model if you want smaller form factors. The build quality is also great. It\u2019s made of hard plastic, which feels solid. Also, this laptop doesn\u2019t go thick, and you can carry it easily. Where many laptops skimp useful features like a backlit keyboard and fingerprint scanner, the\u00a0Ideapad 3 has them all. Some additional features like\u00a0dual 1.5W speakers\u00a0go in favor of this laptop to make it stand out. Lastly, the battery life is also satisfactory. On a regular working day, this laptop can easily last for\u00a06-7 hours. Power-hungry tasks can reduce the battery life significantly. Note that the 15.6-inch model comes with Windows 11 out of the box, but you have to update to Windows 11 on the 14-inch model. Verdict:\u00a0The Lenovo Ideapad 3 is a perfect combination of power and features. For those who want the best performance under 50k with all other features, then this is the right laptop to buy. Pros and Cons Main Highlights When we see a big brand launching a great laptop at a competing price, we assume some features must have been skimped. Is it the same with the newly launched HP 14s-fq1092au? There are many things to talk about this laptop, but one thing we want to tell right away is\u00a0we are impressed. However, it doesn\u2019t mean that everything is perfect about this laptop. So let\u2019s start one by one. Similar to other laptops of this segment, the HP 14s-fq1092au is also made of plastic. But it has an aluminum finish that adds to the beauty. The build quality is satisfactory, and\u00a0we haven\u2019t noticed any major flex. Booting the laptop for the first time gives a glimpse of how powerful this laptop is going to be. No, it can\u2019t outperform expensive machines costing 1 lakh, but it can outperform machines of this segment. The\u00a0Ryzen 5-5500U\u00a0is doing its job pretty well, and performing daily tasks, including some heavy ones, was not a problem at all. Even at medium FHD video editing, the laptop doesn\u2019t sweat. But the 4k video editing takes much time to render. So, for basic video editing, this laptop won\u2019t disappoint you. Other apps fly on this laptop as it can handle all the apps easily. The overall performance of this laptop is impressive for the price. What\u2019s also impressive is the display. It\u2019s a good-quality IPS panel that produces great colors. Because it\u2019s a glossy display, the colors remain punchy and don\u2019t wash out like anti-glare ones. But it also has a problem of reflections, which get irritating at times. Things that contribute to making this laptop a complete package are: On the opposite note, HP should have worked on some features that would have made it an even better deal. There is no fingerprint scanner. The 41 Wh battery lasts for 5 hours with mixed usage. It would have been nicer to include a higher-capacity battery, but this is what it is. Verdict:\u00a0Is it worth buying HP 14s-fq1092au? Absolutely Yes. It\u2019s a powerful laptop that has done everything right. The skimped features aren\u2019t a deal-breaker, so it\u2019s a highly recommended Ryzen laptop under 50k. Pros and Cons Main Highlights Being last on this list doesn\u2019t mean that the Honor MagicBook 14 is the least impressive of all. The reality is quite the opposite, though. If your budget can\u2019t exceed the Rs 45000 mark, but still you want the best Ryzen 5 laptop, then there is no better option than Honor MagicBook 14. From the above specs sheet, you might get an idea of what features this laptop carries. Be it design, looks, build, or performance, everything is simply great on this laptop. So what is the reason for putting this laptop at last? Well, there is no particular reason for that. Still, if we have to point out, then it would be the after-sales service. It\u2019s a good brand, no doubt, but the after-sale service might bother you. Overlook that, and you will be treated with an all-rounder laptop. On holding it in hand, it doesn\u2019t feel like a 45k laptop. Instead, it feels like a premium laptop costing 60-70k. The super thin bezels add to the beauty of this machine. Its display produces very punchy colors, which looks appealing for sure. It doesn\u2019t hurt your eyes, as it comes with a Blue light filter. When combined with 16GB RAM, the Ryzen 5 5500U delivers fast performance. No matter what you do, except for 4K video editing or heavy gaming, this laptop can handle everything. The RAM is non-expandable, but we don\u2019t think you need to expand it as you already have 16GB on this particular variant. It has all the features, including a backlit keyboard, fingerprint scanner, Type-C charger, and WiFi 6. What\u2019s also impressive is the battery life.
