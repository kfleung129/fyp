The mandate was awarded following a multi-agency pitch, which involved two more agencies. The pitch was called in March. The agency has already begun working on its strategy to increase the brand\u2019s presence in the regional markets, and campaigns are on across Karnataka and Bangalore. ZenithOptimedia has recently won accounts such as Toshiba and Honda and successfully retained the media duties of big clients like Nestle, Reckitt Benckiser and Uninor. The agency has now instituted a company recognition awards called Shresht to reward its deserving candidates. At the first award ceremony, prizes were distributed across six categories, including best integrated campaign, best use of media-TV, best use of media-print, best use of media-radio, best use of media in outdoor and overall best ROI. switch switch  Subscribe To Our Newsletter 2023 @ Copyright Indiantelevision Dot Com Pvt Ltd.
