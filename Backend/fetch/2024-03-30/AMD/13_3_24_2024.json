It uses the same TU117 chip as the desktop version but for the mobile GPU all 1024 shaders are enabled.

The iGPU is based on the new RDNA3 architecture and has only 4 of the 12 CUs (= 256 shaders) clocked at up to 2.5 GHz (depending on the CPU model). The 740M\u00a0supports hardware raytracing, although the performance is too slow to use it in current games. \nDue to the reduced core count and clock speed, the performance is clearly below the Radeon 760M and 780M. \nThanks to the modern 4nm process and clever power-saving features, the power consumption is comparatively low (according to AMD). The whole chip of the first two models can be configured between 15 - 30 Watt TDP. The AMD Radeon 740M is an integrated GPU in the Ryzen 7040 series for laptops (Phoenix, e.g. Ryzen 5 7540U).

The Nvidia GeForce GTX 1650 Super for desktops is an entry-level gaming graphics card based on the Turing architecture. The chip, which has been named TU116, was introduced in November 2019. The GTX 1650 series does not offer ray tracing and tensor cores, unlike the more powerful RTX 2000 cards (e.g.\u00a0RTX 2060). Performance is slightly better than with the GeForce GTX 1650 and comparable with the AMD Radeon RX 5500 XT.There have also been significant improvements in the\u00a0Turing architecture\u00a0in terms of the CUDA cores. Float and INT operations can now be executed simultaneously, the cache has been unified and improved, and Adaptive Shading has been introduced. As a result, Nvidia speaks of an up to 50% higher performance per core compared to Pascal.The new entry-level card benefits from the advantages of the TU116 chip, since the newer NVENC video encoding delivers more performance compared to Pascal.Nvidia specifies a power consumption of 100 watts TGP (Total Graphics Power) for the graphics card. The TU11 chip is manufactured by TSMC in a 12 nm FFN process. The Nvidia GeForce GTX 1650 Super for desktops is an entry-level gaming graphics card based on the Turing architecture.
