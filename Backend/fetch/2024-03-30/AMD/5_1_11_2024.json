In this article, we\u2019ll share everything there is to know about the new model, including release dates, specs, and pricing. We also aim to see how close those rumored details were to the eventual product and what users can expect in the future.

Anyway, let\u2019s break down the newly confirmed AMD Ryzen 7 5700 X3D. The AMD Ryzen 7 5700 X3D will be available for purchase on January 31, 2024, after being announced at CES 2024. Following the success of its predecessors, the Ryzen 7 7800 X3D and the powerful 7900 X3D, AMD is now enriching its AM4 platform lineup further. After being teased by renowned leaker chi11eddog months ago, much of the speculation and rumors were confirmed officially by AMD. Though we lacked concrete details initially, the official announcements from AMD solidified the introduction of more AM4-compatible CPUs. Overall, aligning with AMD\u2019s current market intentions. With many users still not ready to make the transition to the AM5 platform and its associated DDR5 technology, this upcoming release is an appealing option for those wanting to upgrade within the AM4 ecosystem. The AMD Ryzen 7 5700 X3D is shaping up to be an intriguing addition to the Ryzen 5000 series, especially for users looking for high-end performance with the innovative 3D V-Cache technology. The Ryzen 7 5700 X3D maintains the 8-core, 16-thread configuration, similar to the Ryzen 7 5800X3D, ensuring it has ample processing power for demanding applications and multitasking. However, where it differentiates itself is in its clock speeds, as the 5700 X3D has a base clock speed of 3.0 GHz and a boost clock of 4.1 GHz. Despite the lower clock speeds, the Ryzen 7 5700 X3D will feature an impressive 100MB cache. This large cache size is one of the key advantages of the 3D V-Cache technology, allowing for faster data access and improved overall performance, particularly in scenarios like gaming and heavy computational tasks where quick data retrieval is crucial. Another noteworthy aspect of the Ryzen 7 5700 X3D is its TDP, which stands at 105 watts. This TDP indicates that, despite its powerful specs, the CPU should manage heat generation effectively, maintaining a balance between performance and energy efficiency. It\u2019s worth noting that the 5700 X3D\u2019s clock speeds are approximately 400 MHz lower than the 5800 X3D. Pricing is a crucial factor in the conversation about the Ryzen 7 5700 X3D, and AMD has finally confirmed its initial retail price. As of January 31, the AMD Ryzen 7 5700 X3D will hit the market for $249. Initially considered to be within the $300 range, this price is a welcome sight for many looking to purchase this new model upon release. This approach by AMD is in line with their recognition of the current market scenario, where a segment of users is reluctant to switch to the pricier AM5 platforms. Such a price point makes an attractive option for users seeking to upgrade their PCs affordably, and would also ensure the Ryzen 7 5700 X3D\u2019s competitive stance against similar-performing processors. So, the AMD Ryzen 7 5700 XD has finally been announced at CES 2024. Released on January 31, with an initial price of $249, users will finally see the extension of X3D from the Ryzen 5800. So, if you\u2019re a gamer looking to get your hands on the X3D technology at a more affordable price, you are in luck. At PC Guide, we\u2019ll certainly be sure to keep our eyes peeled following this release and report on any updates and further announcements from AMD.
