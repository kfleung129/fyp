    "text": "FullHD monitors now require a 144Hz refresh rate AMD has updated its FreeSync hardware requirements, raising hardware requirements for those FreeSync tier badges. According to an updated list, AMD is keeping the specifications for laptops where they were. In order to get the FreeSync Premium badge, laptops will need to have a maximum refresh rate of at least 120Hz. For monitors and TVs, these requirements got a bit higher, as now FHD monitors (or those sub-3440) and TVs will need a maximum refresh rate of at least 144Hz to get the FreeSync badge. For the FreeSync Premium badge, those same monitors and TVs will have to have at least a 200Hz refresh rate. For monitors and TVs with 2K and 4K resolution, AMD wants at least a 120Hz refresh rate for the FreeSync Premium badge. To get the FreeSync Premium Pro badge, those same monitors and TVs will have to have FreeSync HDR on top of those FreeSync Premium requirements.  The update was implemented as of September 2023, according to Videocardz.com, but AMD is only reporting on it now, so some of those new monitors with updated FreeSync badges should already fit under those requirements.
