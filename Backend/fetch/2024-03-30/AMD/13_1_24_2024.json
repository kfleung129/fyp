    "text": " Today, AMD released their Radeon RX 7600 XT graphics card with an UK MSRP of \u00c2\u00a3329.99. We\u2019ve reviewed this graphics card in its PowerColor, XFX, and Sapphire forms. You can read our review of these graphics cards here. Starting today, AMD\u2019s new 16GB Radeon GPU is now available to the masses, and we are here to make sure that you get your new graphics card for the best price. We have checked every major UK GPU retailer and have found that none of them have 7600 XT stock in hand. Scan, Overclockers UK, and Ebuyer all have stock on the way. These three sites have opened up pre-orders for AMD\u2019s latest RDNA 3 GPU. Sadly, this means that UK gamers may need to wait a while for their new GPUs to arrive.  The good news today is that many Radeon RX 7600 XT GPUs that are selling for AMD\u2019s MSRP of \u00c2\u00a3329.99. These are Sapphire\u2019s Radeon RX 7600 XT Pulse and XFX\u2019s Radeon RX 7600 XT Speedster SWIFT 210. That said, some retailers are selling Sapphire\u2019s Pulse model at higher prices. Right now, Ebuyer are selling the most 7600 XT GPUs at AMD\u2019s MSRP price. That said, models like XFX\u2019s Speedster QICK 309 and ASUS\u2019 TUF Gaming commanding more premium pricing.  Over the next few weeks, we expect more stock of AMD\u2019s 16GB 7600 XT to arrive in the UK. After that, we can expect the GPU to be in stock and available at a broader selection of UK retailers. Honestly, this makes us feel like AMD has rushed this particular GPU launch. There was nothing stopping AMD from waiting a few more days or another week to ensure that stock was available. Yes, AMD are undermining Nvidia\u2019s 16GB RTX 4070 Ti SUPER launch with this vastly cheaper GPU, but did AMD really need to do that?  With pre-order pricing of \u00c2\u00a3349.98 at Ebuyer, XFX\u2019s 7600 XT Speedster QICK 309 model is our favourite 7600 XT model that we have tested. It feels more premium than a GPU that\u2019s \u00c2\u00a320 over MSRP should. It\u2019s large heatsink allows this GPU to fill ATX cases in a satisfying way. Beyond that this GPU\u2019s large heatsink keeps it very quiet under load. To us, this makes XFX\u2019s Speedster QICK model the 7600 XT model to buy.
