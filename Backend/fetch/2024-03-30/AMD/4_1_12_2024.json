Barring some odd quirk, you\u2019ll be well aware of AMD and Intel\u2019s tussle when it comes to processors. For better or worse, the retail space is dominated by the two chip powerhouses, limiting the choice of which streaming-fit CPU to one of the two. It\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing, but choosing one camp over the other can very much feel like picking sides. While we aren\u2019t here to side with one or the other, they each have their strong points, and arguably the race has never been so closely fought after years of Intel leading the charge. A few years ago, the thrifty builder invariably veered towards AMD\u2019s more competitively priced products, while those eager for all-out performance threw their cash at Intel. Intel\u2019s dominance, especially when it comes to gaming performance, isn\u2019t what it once was with AMD products now more or less on par, if not better (looking at you multithreading). Before we get to the technical stuff, we\u2019ll need to consider what size motherboard you\u2019re after. There are currently four main form factors availabl Next on the agenda is the socket. You\u2019ll need to be mindful of the right ones for your build. While Intel has made use of the LGA 1700 socket for Alder Lake, Raptor Lake and Raptor Lake Refresh, this allows you options including Z690, Z790, B760 and B660. For the AMD CPUs and boards on this list, you\u2019re looking at the AM5 socket. AM4 is the socket for the Ryzen 5000 series. Do you want your motherboard to connect up to your network wirelessly? It\u2019s a really great feature, but unfortunately, it\u2019s not a universal one, so be wary when making your decision. Motherboards without integrated wifi connectivity rely on a LAN Ethernet connection. In the absence of wifi, you should take stock of LAN proficiency. Ethernet connections come with vastly different bandwidths, so it makes sense to shop around for the best one. Ideally, your motherboard will feature gigabit LAN, a port capable of 1000MBps transfer speeds. The power design of your motherboard refers to the VRM (voltage regulator module). It\u2019s the VRM that transforms the power from your outlet into energy suitable for powering your CPU. What\u2019s the VRM made up of? Power phases. What are power phases? A basic power phase is a mechanism made up of a capacitor, two transistors, and a choke. Component quality does come into play in a big way but generally speaking, the more power phases your motherboard has, the more stable the CPU voltage becomes. This is because the more power phases there are, the less each one has to work. The burden never falls too heavily on any of them, enabling them to work cooler. In light of this, if you\u2019re interested in overclocking your Ryzen 5 2600, we recommend a more expansive power design or at least one that uses high-quality components. We know what you\u2019re thinking\u2026motherboards don\u2019t come with RAM, right? Well, no, unless you got some kind of sweet, all-inclusive, second-hand deal, motherboards don\u2019t come with any integrated or additional memory. They do; however, come with memory capacities. That\u2019s right, folks. You can\u2019t just load your motherboard up with any old RAM. It can only support a certain memory capacity and speed. If you\u00a0do\u00a0try and use more or faster RAM than your board is designed to utilize, it simply won\u2019t do anything with the excess, and you\u2019ll have wasted your money. You really should double-check if your CPU supports a software TPM, you might not need to worry at all about getting a TPM. We\u2019ve covered this before, but you should check what motherboard you currently have or what your case can fit as buying the wrong motherboard for your case will be a really bad (and often expensive) mistake to make.  Sure can! Once you\u2019ve replaced the motherboard refit everything into its slot and off you go! Make sure your parts match specification, don\u2019t be putting DDR3 RAM in DDR4 slots, and make sure you have a Windows 11 supported CPU going back in too.  Our preferred pick of the best cpu motherboard combo, the GIGABYTE Z790 AORUS Elite AX and Intel Core i5-13600K, stands out for its balance of price and performance, making it an ideal choice for users seeking a robust setup without breaking the bank. The Intel Core i5-13600K, with its impressive multi-core performance, is perfectly complemented by the AORUS Elite\u2019s extensive feature set, proving that high performance doesn\u2019t always come with a high price tag. Other noteworthy mentions include the ASUS ROG Strix X670E-E Gaming WiFi paired with AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D for those seeking top-tier AMD performance, especially in gaming. For budget-conscious buyers, the MSI PRO B650M-P Pro and AMD Ryzen 5 7600X offer a solid, cost-effective solution. Finally, for users demanding the ultimate in performance, the ASUS ROG Maximus Z790 Hero with Intel Core i9-13900K is an unbeatable combo, although it comes with a premium price.
