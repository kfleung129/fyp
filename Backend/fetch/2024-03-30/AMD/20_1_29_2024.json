Mainboard and processor  Graphics Cards Integrated Memory 2x16 GB DDR5 6400 MHz CL38 MHz OS related Software Windows 11 64-bit (latest patches & updates\u00a0installed)\u00a0DirectX 9/10/11/12 latest End-User Runtime\u00a0\u00a0(Download)Nvidia GeForce drivers (latest WHQL) (Download) A Word About \"FPS\" What are we looking for in gaming, performance-wise? First off, obviously Guru3D tends to think that all games should be played at the best image quality (IQ) possible. There's a dilemma though, IQ often interferes with the performance of a graphics card. We measure this in FPS, the number of frames a graphics card can render per second, the higher it is the more fluid your game will display itself. A game's frames per second (FPS) is a measured average of a series of tests. That test is often a time demo, a recorded part of the game which is a 1:1 representation of the actual game and its gameplay experience. After forcing the same image quality settings; this time-demo is then used for all graphics cards so that the actual measuring is as objective as can be.   Monitor Setup  Before playing games, setting up your monitor's contrast & brightness levels is a very important thing to do. I realized recently that a lot of you guys have set up your monitor improperly. How do we know this? Because we receive a couple of emails every now and then telling us\u00a0that a reader can't distinguish between the benchmark charts (colors) in our reviews. We realized, if that happens, your monitor is not properly set up.     Looking at the above graph, what are you looking for? You should be able to distinguish all small differences, only then you monitor is setup properly contrast and saturation wise.
