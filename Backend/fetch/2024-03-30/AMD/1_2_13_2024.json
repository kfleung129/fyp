    "text": "Please choose your local Vodafone website Vodafone, together with Samsung and AMD, announced the successful demonstration of their first end-to-end data call using AMD\u2019s new general-purpose processor on an Open RAN platform. In addition to proving that the technology works well, it also reinforces Vodafone\u2019s aim to introduce new silicon partners to the Open RAN eco-system, driving both innovation and more competition. A stronger Open RAN ecosystem gives network operators greater choice of software and hardware whilst strengthening the vendor supply chain. In order to deliver improved services to customers, fully open and flexible radio access network platforms need higher performing and more efficient general-purpose processors, capable of conducting the most advanced tasks. This joint achievement underlines the companies\u2019 technical leadership in the development, functionality, and testing of silicon chips, combined with leading software, optimised to power Open RANs. Conducted in Samsung\u2019s R&D lab in Korea, the first call was completed using Samsung\u2019s Open RAN-compliant, virtualized RAN (vRAN) software, integrated with AMD\u2019s latest generation General Purpose Processor (GPP) EPYC\u2122 8004 on Supermicro\u2019s latest Edge servers, supported by Wind River\u2019s cloud-based platform. The companies showed how the new platform can meet Vodafone\u2019s technology objectives and verified key metrics such as performance and energy efficiency, while demonstrating successful interoperability between partners\u2019 products. Nadia Benabdallah, Network Strategy and Engineering Director at Vodafone Group said: \u201cVodafone, together with Samsung and AMD, are pioneering the development of purpose-built silicon to power the next generation mobile networks. Through greater industry collaboration, we can create a vibrant Open RAN ecosystem to stay ahead of customer demand for faster connectivity without compromising reliability.\u201d \u201cThis collective effort marks a key milestone for the mobile network industry to steer Open RAN forward, by embracing multiple providers at every layer of the network stack. The demonstration illustrates Samsung\u2019s commitment to delivering the full potential of mobile networks by embracing openness,\u201d said June Moon, Executive Vice President & Head of R&D, Networks Business at Samsung Electronics. Today\u2019s news complements the work Vodafone engineers are undertaking at its R&D centre in M\u00e1laga, Spain, to test and propel the development of new silicon chip solutions, which will feature on Vodafone\u2019s stand (Hall 3, stand 3E11) at Mobile World Congress (MWC) 24, 26 \u2013 29 February 2024. In addition to testing new electronic processors, Vodafone also has one eye on the future. It is exploring the potential of silicon photonic chips which use light instead of electricity to compute mathematical operations and the computation time is measured by how long it takes the light to cross the microchip. As a result, photonic chips promise to be far faster, more efficient, and reliable than today\u2019s electronic equivalent found in most devices and networks. Meanwhile, Vodafone\u2019s work with vendors such as Samsung and AMD will continue to enhance the performance of today\u2019s microprocessors when used to power Open RAN for many years to come.
