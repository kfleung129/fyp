    "text": "The Nvidia GeForce GTX 1650 for desktop PCs is a graphics card that is based on the Turing architecture (TU117 chip). Compared to the faster RTX 2000 GPUs (e.g.\u00a0RTX 2060), the 1650 integrates no Raytracing or Tensor cores. The performance should be slightly faster than the old GeForce GTX 1050 Ti. Although, the mobile variant of the GTX1650 uses the same name, it is a bit slower due to lower clock rates.The\u00a0Turing\u00a0generation did not only introduce raytracing for the RTX cards, but also optimized the architecture of the cores and caches. According to Nvidia the CUDA cores offer now a concurrent execution of floating point and integer operations for increased performance in compute-heavy workloads of modern games. Furthermore, the caches were reworked (new unified memory architecture with twice the cache compared to Pascal). This leads to 50% more instructions per clock and a 40% more power efficient usage compared to Pascal. \nCompared to the bigger Turing chips (like the TU116 of the GTX 1660 Ti and the RTX lineup), the TU117 does not include the new NVENC encoder but an older one similar to the one used in Pascal and Volta. \nThe power consumption of the 1650 is specified at 75 Watt TGP (Total Graphics Power) by Nvidia.

The AMD Radeon 740M is an integrated GPU in the Ryzen 7040 series for laptops (Phoenix, e.g. Ryzen 5 7540U). The iGPU is based on the new RDNA3 architecture and has only 4 of the 12 CUs (= 256 shaders) clocked at up to 2.5 GHz (depending on the CPU model). The 740M\u00a0supports hardware raytracing, although the performance is too slow to use it in current games. \nDue to the reduced core count and clock speed, the performance is clearly below the Radeon 760M and 780M. \nThanks to the modern 4nm process and clever power-saving features, the power consumption is comparatively low (according to AMD). The whole chip of the first two models can be configured between 15 - 30 Watt TDP. The AMD Radeon 740M is an integrated GPU in the Ryzen 7040 series for laptops (Phoenix, e.g. Ryzen 5 7540U).

The performance depends on the used graphics memory, clock rate, processor, system settings, drivers, and operating systems. So the results don't have to be representative for all laptops with this GPU. For detailed information on the benchmark results, click on the fps number.
