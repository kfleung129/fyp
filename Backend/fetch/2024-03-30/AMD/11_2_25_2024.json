    "text": "The 2024 Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 is finally available for purchase. This new version of the lightweight gaming laptop comes with the latest AMD Ryzen 8040HS APU. More specifically, all the configurations the brand\u00a0announced at CES 2024\u00a0pack the top-of-the-line Ryzen 9 8945HS, a Zen 4 APU\u00a0with 8 cores and 16 threads. For the GPU, the new ROG Zephyrus G14 line offers a good number of options. The base variant features the\u00a0Nvidia RTX 4050, a mid-range GPU, while the top-end variant boasts the more capable\u00a0RTX 4070. However, the two configs that are currently available on Best Buy feature the\u00a0RTX 4060\u00a0(curr.\u00a0$1,599.99) and RTX 4070 (curr.\u00a0$1,999.99). While the previous models of the ROG Zephyrus G14 shipped with LCD screens, Asus upgraded it to an OLED display for the 2024 variant. This 14-inch OLED comes with a 3K resolution, has a\u00a0DCI-P3 coverage\u00a0of 100%, and features a refresh rate of 120 Hz, making the gaming laptop great for content creation besides gaming. In addition, Asus upgraded the audio setup of the 2024 Zephyrus G14 gaming laptop. The predecessors came with a 4-speaker system, while the new version has a 6-speaker system with two dedicated tweeters and four woofers. However, the new model did see a downgrade in user upgradability. It has the RAM soldered onto the mainboard. So, it\u2019s better to purchase the config with the highest available memory. You can learn more about the laptop from our preview video attached below and our\u00a0in-depth review found in this link. Best Buy (linked above) via: Liliputing "
