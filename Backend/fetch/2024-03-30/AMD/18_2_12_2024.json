    "text": "AMD reached a new record in overall x86 CPU market share against Intel last year, mainly thanks to gains it made in the PC and server segments. The chip designer\u2019s CPU share grew a half point to 31.1 percent in 2023 while Intel\u2019s decreased as much to 68.9 percent when counting total CPU shipments between both companies last year, according to CPU-tracking firm Mercury Research. Mercury President Dean McCarron told CRN that AMD achieved an all-time high in overall CPU share last year because, in a down market for both companies, it experienced a smaller decline in CPU shipments for servers, PCs and embedded/IoT than Intel did in those segments. However, AMD and Intel ended 2024 on a high note, with both companies seeing increases in CPU shipments for servers and PCs in the fourth quarter after partners, in prior periods, sold through excess inventories that had built up due to a slowdown in demand. In the fourth quarter, AMD\u2019s overall CPU share declined 2.1 points sequentially and 2.7 points year-over-year to 28.6 percent while Intel\u2019s grew as much to 71.4 percent, according to Mercury\u2019s latest report. But this share drop was mainly due to a continued decline in shipments of AMD\u2019s semi-custom chips for video game consoles such as Sony\u2019s PlayStation 5. When not counting the semi-custom, embedded or IoT segments, AMD\u2019s overall CPU share grew by 0.7 points to 20.4 percent in 2023\u2019s fourth quarter against Intel\u2019s 79.6 percent. This put AMD\u2019s share 3.2 points higher than it was in the fourth quarter of 2022. AMD grew its overall CPU share in the fourth quarter because it managed to increase CPU shipments for PCs faster than Intel did, according to McCarron. This resulted in the company growing PC CPU share for the period by 0.8 points sequentially and 3 points year-over-year to 20.2 percent against Intel\u2019s 79.8 percent. When it came to CPU share for laptops and other mobile devices in the fourth quarter, Intel\u2019s rival grew share by 0.9 points sequentially and 3.9 points year-over-year to 20.3 percent against the semiconductor giant\u2019s 79.7 percent. McCarron attributed AMD\u2019s share grab in the mobile segment to strong growth in shipments of the company\u2019s Ryzen 7040 processors\u2014the first to include its neural processing unit (NPU) for the emerging categories of AI PCs\u2014as well as the lower-end Ryzen/Athlon 7020 chips. He said Intel also experienced ample growth for its 13th-generation Core processors as well as the Intel Processor N100 and N200 chips. For desktop PCs, AMD grew CPU share by 0.6 points to 19.8 percent against Intel\u2019s 80.2 percent. This amounted to a 1.2-point year-over-year increase for AMD. What drove this was a strong uptick in shipments of AMD\u2019s Ryzen 7000 processors as well as its Ryzen 5000 processors, the latter of which McCarron considered a surprising development because the lineup is an older generation of CPUs. The server segment was a different story: Intel managed to eke out a tiny share gain of 0.2 points sequentially to 76.9 against AMD\u2019s 23.1 percent. McCarron noted that this was \u201cthe first time Intel has had an on-quarter share gain in nearly five years.\u201d But Intel\u2019s return to sequential share growth barely did anything to offset the server gains AMD made in the prior quarters, resulting in the rival increasing its slice of the segment in the fourth quarter by 5.4 points from the same period a year ago. The fact that CPU share barely moved in the server segment reflected how both AMD and Intel \u201csaw significant growth in conventional data center CPU products,\u201d according to McCarron. These products included Intel\u2019s fourth-generation Xeon Scalable processors as well as AMD\u2019s fourth-generation EPYC \u201cGenoa\u201d and \u201cBergamo\u201d chips. What helped Intel get ahead in the server market were CPUs like Xeon D and Atom that are not designed for data centers but rather networking and storage appliances, McCarron said. A veteran executive at a high-performance computing systems integrator told CRN US that Mercury\u2019s latest server CPU figures fall in line with what his company saw last year, with AMD continuing to garner major interest in part because of EPYC\u2019s higher core counts. \u201cOne of the universities that we just [spoke to], they've got what's referred to as \u2018embarrassingly parallel\u2019 projects in the HPC space. And they\u2019re just bringing in nodes that have as many cores as possible. And, of course, you look at AMD for that kind of thing,\u201d said Dominic Daninger, vice president of engineering at Burnsville, Minn.-based Nor-Tech. What has also helped AMD continue momentum is the fourth-gen EPYC lineup\u2019s addition of AVX-512 instructions, which can accelerate certain AI, HPC and analytics workloads and were previously only available in Intel\u2019s Xeon processors, according to Daninger. But to the HPC executive, Intel has made \u201cnice performance gains\u201d with fourth-gen Xeon processors, which has helped with customer conversations, especially those who have used the chipmaker\u2019s CPUs \u201cfor a long time\u201d and would prefer to keep it that way. \u201cSome people will move across to AMD [\u2026] But Intel can get pretty aggressive too,\u201d he said. What\u2019s \u201creally seeing a lot of interest,\u201d however, are Nvidia GPUs, according to Daninger. While Nvidia\u2019s GPUs don\u2019t compete directly with CPUs, businesses have started to spend substantially more money on GPUs than CPUs for AI and other demanding workloads. \u201cI can't believe the number of conversations I had with potential customers just in the last week here. Really substantial investments we're talking about,\u201d he said. "
