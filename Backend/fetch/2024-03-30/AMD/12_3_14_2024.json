    "text": "Gets you similar gaming performance as the Core i9-13900K The sub-$400 desktop market is getting pretty crowded these days, and now, Intel's Core i7-14700K has seen a price drop down to $389 in some retail/e-tail shops. With AMD selling its Ryzen 9 7900X3D 12-core/24-thread CPU with 3D V-cache for the same price of $389, this part of the CPU market segment is certainly getting crowded. The aforementioned Core i7-14700K Raptor Lake Refresh CPU features an 8P+12E core configuration, clocked at 5.6GHz for P-cores and up to 4.3GHz for E-cores. It packs 33MB of L3 cache and has a 125W TDP. Performance-wise, the Core i7-14700K provides comparable gaming performance to the Core i9-13900K, and can even handle its own against AMD's Ryzen 9 7900X3D, at least in some cases. The Core i7-14700K is currently listed at Newegg.com for $399.99 with $10 off with a promo code. As pointed out by Tomshardware.com, the Core i7-14700KF, which is an identical processor but does not include integrated graphics, is selling for $10 less at B&H Photo shop.   "
