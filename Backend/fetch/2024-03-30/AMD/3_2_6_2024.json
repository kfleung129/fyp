Home \u203a Knowledge Base \u203a Program Issues  Sophie Luo The legendary fighting game franchise, Tekken 8, is back, and it\u2019s gained very positive among gamers. But it\u2019s not perfect: some gamers are reporting that their Tekken 8 is not launching on PC for them. Fortunately, many kind, generous players are sharing fixes that solve the Tekken 8 not launching problem on Reddit and the Steam community. If Tekken 8 is also not launching for you, feel free to try these fixes below to see if they do wonders for you too. You don\u2019t have to try all the following fixes: simply work your way down the list until you find the one that does the trick to fix the Tekken 8 not launching problem for you. When your Tekken 8 isn\u2019t launching, the first thing you need to check is whether your computer meets the minimum system requirements for the game. If your machine is below or just at the requirements, you may need to upgrade your hardware for Tekken 8 to run smoothly. Here are the requirements for Tekken 8 for your reference: If you\u2019re not sure how to check your computer specs, you can press the\u00a0Windows\u00a0key and the\u00a0R\u00a0key on your computer at the same time, then type\u00a0msinfo32\u00a0to check your system specs in detail: Generally speaking, Tekken 8 has rather high requirements for your computer hardware, especially when compared to other games. So if you see that your processor or graphics card is not powerful enough to run the game, please consider upgrading your hardware. When you\u2019re sure that your machine meets the system requirements to run the game, but Tekken 8 still refuses to launch, please move on to the other fixes below. Updating Windows ensures that your overall system environment is solid and sound, and it can sometimes help to fix minor issues like the game not launching. To make sure that you have the latest available updates installed: Then try your Tekken 8 again to see if it launches well. If the problem remains, please move on to the next fix. This is suggested by a Reddit user (and has since won many upvotes from other gamers): running Tekken 8 as admin and in compatibility mode for Windows 8 helps to fix the Tekken 8 not launching problem. To see if this does the trick for you: Now open Tekken 8 again to see if it launches well. If the problem remains, please move on to the next fix. This is mentioned by a few gamers that their antivirus program (one mentioned Avast) is listing Polaris-Win64-Shipping.exe as a quarantine file and suggesting a delete. This is probably why your Tekken 8 is not launching: your third-party antivirus program is stopping the execution file from running in the very first place. To see if this is your case, you can add Polaris-Win64-Shipping.exe to your antivirus exclusion list so it won\u2019t be scanned when launching, and see if this helps Tekken 8 to launch properly. If you\u2019re not sure how to do it, please seek help from your antivirus support. If adding Polaris-Win64-Shipping.exe to your antivirus exclusion list doesn\u2019t help to fix the Tekken 8 not launching problem, please move on. An outdated or incorrect display card driver could also be the culprit to your Tekken 8 not launching problem, so if the above methods don\u2019t help Tekken 8 to launch, it\u2019s likely that you have a corrupted or outdated graphics driver. So you should update your drivers to see if it helps. There are mainly 2 ways you can update your graphics driver: manually or automatically. If you\u2019re a tech-savvy gamer, you can spend some time updating your GPU driver manually. To do so, first visit the website of your GPU manufacturer: Then search for your GPU model. Note that you should only download the latest driver installer that\u2019s compatible with your operating system. Once downloaded, open the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to update. If you don\u2019t have the time, patience or skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with Driver Easy. Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don\u2019t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don\u2019t need to be troubled by the wrong driver you would be downloading, and you don\u2019t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.\u00a0Driver Easy handles it all. You can update your drivers automatically with either the\u00a0FREE\u00a0or the\u00a0Pro version\u00a0of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 steps (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee): Try to run Tekken 8 again and see if the latest graphics driver helps it to launch. If this fix doesn\u2019t work for you, try the next fix, below. Some users suggested that running Steam in windowed mode from within Steam helps Tekken 8 to launch well. This is probably because the windowed mode is less resource-consuming than the fullscreen mode, and therefore reduces the possibility of game problems like not launching or crashing. To see if this does the wonders for you: See if Tekken 8 launches well now when it\u2019s in windowed mode. If the problem remains, please move on. Even though Tekken 8 requires that the FPS (frames per second) rate above 60 should be guaranteed when the game first launches, users are reporting that capping the max FPS helps the game to launch well. To see if this helps to fix the game not launching problem for you: When the FPS rate is set, try to run Tekken 8 again to see if it launches well. If so, please move on. If you are facing persistent issues with Tekken 8 and none of the previous solutions have proven effective, it\u2019s possible that your corrupted system files are to blame. To rectify this, repairing the system files becomes crucial. The System File Checker (SFC) tool can assist you in this process. By executing the \u201csfc /scannow\u201d command, you can initiate a scan that identifies problems and repairs missing or corrupted system files. However, it is important to note that\u00a0the SFC tool primarily focuses on scanning major files and may overlook minor issues. In situations where the SFC tool falls short, a more powerful and specialized Windows repair tool is recommended.\u00a0Fortect\u00a0is an automated Windows repair tool that excels in identifying problematic files and replacing malfunctioning ones. By scanning your PC comprehensively, Fortect can provide a more comprehensive and effective solution for repairing your Windows system. Thank you for reading the post.
