    "text": "Semiconductor companies have started to reap the benefits of the immense demand from clients like AMD and NVIDIA, as the market records \"all-time\" high profits in a decade. According to a report from Bloomberg, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index witnessed a tremendous rise this year, seeing an annual increase of over 65%, which is the biggest in a decade. The semiconductor industry experienced an \"explosive\" year, with client demand reaching out of the roof, and next-gen developments coming at a \"pivotal\" stage. Among the companies that exploited the immense growth, NVIDIA and AMD are leading the bandwagon, with yet again shocking figures. For a recap, 2023 was the year when Team Green entered the \"trillion-dollar\" club, the first-ever chipmaker to do so. This was a result of the \"enormous\" demand globally due to the generative AI wave, which prompted companies to upscale their computing resources, resulting in firms like NVIDIA and AMD seeing explosive sales\u00a0growth in the data center segment. Team Green's H100 AI GPUs were known to be at the top of the list when it comes to popularity in the markets since they have reportedly reached 3.5 million units in sales this year. However, things don't look to stop just year, since NVIDIA plans on generating a \"whopping\" $300 billion in AI-driven sales by 2027, hence the upcoming years are going to be more aggressive than the previous ones in terms of product releases and advancements. Apart from NVIDIA, things at Team Red's camp are solid as well, since the company has recently unveiled new entrants in its Instinct lineup of GPUs, which have showcased solid performance gains that were well applauded in the industry. The year 2023 was seen as one of the best for the semiconductor and the tech industry as a whole so it will be real interesting to see how 2024 turns out as the AI craze is seeing no end and demand for high-performance computing just keeps on climbing.
