    "text": "OODA Loop Understand tomorrow, today. News Briefs, Technology / March 8, 2024 by OODA Analyst Investors have been treating Broadcom like the next Nvidia. They forgot about the iPhone. Broadcom\u2019s market value has more than doubled over the past year, and its stock has been the third-biggest gainer on the PHLX Semiconductor Index in that time behind Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices AMD. Surging demand for systems to power generative artificial intelligence services has driven sales for Broadcom\u2019s networking chips, which are used for things like connecting Nvidia\u2019s popular GPU chips together in data centers to form what are effectively AI supercomputers. That is quickly becoming a big business for Broadcom. The company told analysts during its fiscal first quarter earnings call Thursday afternoon that revenue from AI chips totaled $2.3 billion in the January-ending quarter\u2014a 53% jump from the previous quarter. Chief Executive Officer Hock Tan also added that the company now expects AI revenue to top $10 billion in its current fiscal year, which is more than double the $4.2 billion from those products during the previous year. But, unlike Nvidia, which is now drawing the vast majority of its overall revenue from AI processors used in data centers, Broadcom is now a well diversified tech giant spanning both the semiconductor and software markets. Most of them aren\u2019t growing anything like AI\u2014with some not growing at all. Broadcom\u2019s wireless segment, which primarily supplies radio-frequency chips to Apple for the iPhone, saw revenue slip 4% year-over-year to about $2 billion. Other parts of the company\u2019s chip business, such as server storage and broadband connectivity, are faring even worse. Thus, Broadcom\u2019s overall semiconductor segment grew revenue just 4% year-over-year to $7.4 billion during the most recent quarter\u2014basically matching Wall Street\u2019s estimates.
