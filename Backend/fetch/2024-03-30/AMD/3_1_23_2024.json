Ben Hardwidge Published: Jan 23, 2024 In this guide, we\u2019ll show you\u00a0how to enable resizable BAR\u00a0on your graphics card, which is a great way to improve your frame rate in\u00a0many of today\u2019s PC games for free, including a lot of the Assassin\u2019s Creed games. How does it work? AMD and\u00a0Nvidia GPUs have recently added the ability for the CPU to access your graphics card\u2019s entire frame buffer, instead of smaller chunks of up to 256MB, and this headroom enables you to boost performance in some situations with compatible hardware and games. First introduced by AMD on its RDNA 2 graphics card range,\u00a0this tech was originally christened AMD Smart Access Memory, but it\u2019s since been adopted by both Intel and Nvidia as well. It offers a simple way to boost performance that doesn\u2019t have the side effects you might expect with overclocking, and often just needs one or two settings enabled in the EFI. We\u2019ve seen a big boost in frame rates in games such as Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla with resizable BAR enabled, and the latest Intel Arc GPU models heavily rely on it to get the best performance. Your first step is to run\u00a0GPU-Z\u00a0and see if resizable BAR is enabled or disabled in the bottom right box. If it\u2019s enabled, then you don\u2019t have to do anything else \u2013 your PC is already set up properly. If it\u2019s disabled, then you\u2019ll need to follow a few steps to enable it.  The BAR option is usually located in the PCI subsystem settings of your motherboard\u2019s EFI (this is where you\u2019ll find it on Asus motherboards, as in the screenshot below). You can enter your motherboard\u2019s EFI, or BIOS, by tapping the Delete key as soon as your system powers up.  Its location may differ between manufacturers. For example, on\u00a0the Gigabyte motherboard EFI screenshot below, it\u2019s in the Settings menu when you enter Advanced mode. You\u2019ll also want to enable Above 4G decoding in order to access the resizable BAR option. On some motherboards, you only get the option for \u2018Auto\u2019 rather than \u2018Enabled\u2019, but this option will enable it if your setup is compatible.  If the Compatibility Support Module (CSM) is enabled in the Boot section of your motherboard EFI, you\u2019ll also need to disable this setting.\u00a0Once you\u2019ve made these changes, save your settings and exit the EFI, then head back into GPU-Z when your PC boots up Windows.  At this point, you should see a friendly \u2018Enabled\u2019 in the box. If not, and it\u2019s still showing as Disabled, you may have hit a\u00a0compatibility problem with your Windows installation.\u00a0This will also be the case if your PC no longer boots into Windows after enabling resizable BAR (if you need to get back into Windows, re-enable CSM). Your Windows install drive will need to have a GUID partition table (GPT), rather than the older master boot record (MBR) partition table, for resizable BAR to work. There are ways to convert your partition table, which are beyond the scope of this guide, but reinstalling Windows is your safest bet here. Make sure you fully erase your drive, then install Windows with your motherboard\u00a0boot setting on UEFI,\u00a0again making sure that CSM is disabled. That\u2019s it for our guide on how to enable resizable BAR. We hope you enjoy your extra frame rates, and that you didn\u2019t have to go through too much hassle to get it working.
