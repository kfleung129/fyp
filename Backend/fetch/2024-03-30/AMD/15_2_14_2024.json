    "text": "The latest ROCm platform will now support RX 7900 GRE and PRO W7800.  AMD keeps improving its ROCm platform by supporting new AI algorithms and machine learning models. The recent update to version 6.0 introduces improved hardware and software support as well. This update follows the ROCm 5.7 release from November last year, which introduced support for Radeon RX 7900 XT and PyTorch.    ROCm 6.0, Source: AMD  The company has announced the compatibility of ROCm 6.0 with ONNX Runtime.\u00a0ONNX serves as an open standard for machine learning algorithms and software tools, providing developers with a seamless way to convert AI models between different frameworks. As a result, users can now perform inference on a wider range of source data on local AMD hardware. This also adds INT8 via MIGraphX \u2013 AMD\u2019s own graph inference engine \u2013 to the available data types (including FP32 and FP16). \u2014 AMD on ONNX support On the hardware front, the ROCm 6.0 update brings support for both the Radeon PRO W7800 and Radeon RX 7900 GRE. This update means that ROCm 6.0 now fully supports the desktop gaming and workstation portfolio of the Navi 31 GPU series. However, there is no update at this time regarding support for Radeon RX 7800 XT and lower SKUs. Source: AMD We may earn an affiliate commission through Amazon and Newegg links.
