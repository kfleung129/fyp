Under the new Ryzen 8000G lineup, codenamed Hawk Point, the Ryzen 5 8500G will be AMD\u2019s exciting entry-level offering in the sea of various processor options, and gamers can enjoy high-performance integrated graphics with this upcoming Ryzen 5 8500G APU. \n\n\n\nThe X (formerly Twitter) user @Olrak29 first spotted this benchmark leak. The Ryzen 5 8500G has been tested in Geekbench 5, providing us with its synthetic CPU performance results. A score of 1965 pts in Single-Core and 8768 pts in Multi-Core was revealed here. Moreover, AMD\u2019s upcoming Ryzen 5 8500G processor specifications have also been detailed.\n\n\n\nSource: Geekbench\nAccording to the CPU information mentioned in this Geekbench result, the Ryzen 5 8500G features a core configuration of 6 cores and 12 threads. The maximum CPU frequency has been mentioned at 4999MHz, so it should have a boost clock speed of 5.0GHz. \n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tRecommended Articles\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAMD Reaffirms AM5 Socket Support Beyond 2025; Check Details\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSatyam Kumar\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDec 21, 2023\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAMD to Launch Radeon RX 7600 XT in 2024; Details Here\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSatyam Kumar\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDec 28, 2023\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\nThe base clock was mentioned at 3.55 GHz, and the processor was tested with 32GB memory on a Maxsun B650M motherboard.
