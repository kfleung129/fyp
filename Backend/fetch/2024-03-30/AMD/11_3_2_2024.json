    "text": "GPD is rolling out an update to its Win Mini handheld gaming device for 2024, featuring AMD\u2019s Ryzen 8000 series APUs. The latest Win Mini comes with either a Ryzen 7 8840U or a Ryzen 5 8640U processor, stepping up to 8 Zen4 cores. This means faster speeds and more power for playing games and doing other tasks. The inclusion of AMD\u2019s XDNA AI-core technology is expected to improve performance, especially in computing tasks. One of the big improvements in the new model is the display. It now has a 7-inch, 1080p LTPS screen that can refresh at 120 Hz and supports FreeSync Premium and Variable Refresh Rate (VRR), all behind Gorilla Glass 6. However, the 2024 model has dropped the OCuLink port, which was present in the previous version, for connecting external GPUs. Now, it relies on USB4 connections. The device also boasts better performance in emulating PlayStation 3 games, aiming for 60 FPS. It supports AVX-512 instructions, which is said to help with this. The Win Mini 2024 will be launched through a crowdfunding campaign, with prices beginning at $879 for the base configuration with the Ryzen 7 8840U processor, 32 GB of RAM, and options for either 512 GB or 2 TB of SSD storage.
