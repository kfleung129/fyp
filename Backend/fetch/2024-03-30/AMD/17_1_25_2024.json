    "text": "IP Chair Michael Renaud spoke to Law360\u00a0on the US International Trade Commission\u2019s ruling that several companies, primarily Chinese, violated an AMD-held US patent by importing digital televisions and components, leading to import bans and cease-and desist orders. Mike commented that the firm was \u201cpleased that the ITC has decided to implement remedial orders with the ITC\u2019s standard enforcement provisions and that the ITC has decided not to delay these orders for any public interest reasons. Mintz is gratified that the ITC recognized AMD\u2019s patented semiconductor processor technology in its decision, including for the patent that was the subject of the ITC\u2019s ruling.\u201d Source Law360 Boston Get\u00a0our latest thought leadership Review Cookie Management Center \u00a9 2024 Mintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky and Popeo, P.C.
