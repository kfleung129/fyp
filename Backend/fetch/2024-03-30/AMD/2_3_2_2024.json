The effects, discovered on Geekbench listed here and listed here, counsel that Huawei\u2019s chip technology may perhaps not be considerably at the rear of major CPU companies, AMD and Intel. As Tom\u2019s Hardware reviews, the Taishan V120 core, from Huawei\u2019s HiSilicon subsidiary, was initially spotted in Huawei\u2019s Kirin 9000s smartphone chip. The new Geekbench 6 outcomes, which were being uploaded a couple of times ago, show that the Taishan V120 main is very likely created on the second-generation 7nm node, as is the situation with the Kirin 9000s chips. The precise CPU product tested continues to be a secret having said that, with the only clue becoming \u201cHuawei Cloud OpenStack Nova\u201d on the benchmark internet pages. This suggests it could be a Kunpeng server CPU, potentially the Kunpeng 930, specified its large solitary-core general performance. The Kunpeng 930 has been relatively elusive considering that its announcement in 2019. A 2021 report speculated a launch that year on TSMC\u2019s 5nm, with the Kunpeng 950 next in 2023 on TSMC\u2019s 3nm node. On the other hand, these options were being probably deserted thanks to Huawei\u2019s ban from production at TSMC. The benchmarks have been operate on a one main, implying that the chip could have been analyzed on a digital device or a related configuration. For that reason, the multi-main rating may not accurately mirror the chip\u2019s in general overall performance. In the one-core rating benchmark, the Taishan V120 CPU scored 1,527, a little at the rear of AMD\u2019s Epyc 7413 at 1,538 and Intel\u2019s Xeon E-2136 at 1,553. It was considerably outperformed by the Epyc 9554, which scored 1,957, and the Xeon w9-3495X, which led the pack with a score of 2,087. As Tom\u2019s Components factors out, with out details on multi-threaded effectiveness, ability intake, and effectiveness, it really is really hard to gauge the competitiveness of Taishan V120 cores. Irrespective of velocity, superior electrical power intake could prevent opportunity users because of to the price tag of energy.
