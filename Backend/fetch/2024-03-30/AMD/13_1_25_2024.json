    "text": "MINISFORUM has announced a new Neptune Series mini-PC, building on the HX77G and HX99G that it already sells. This time, the company has presented the HX100G, an identical-looking model that contains a more powerful processor than the\u00a0HX77G\u00a0or\u00a0HX99G. Thus, the HX100G is to the Neptune Series as the NAB7 is to the Venus Series that arrived earlier this week. Specifically, the HX100G features the Ryzen 7 7840HS, one of the most powerful options in AMD's Pheonix-HS series after the Ryzen 9 7940HS and its PRO derivative. With its 8 Zen 4 CPU cores and 4 nm manufacturing process, the\u00a0Ryzen 7 7840HS\u00a0averages about 15% better performance than the Ryzen 9 6900HX in our benchmarks and 13% more than the Ryzen 7 7735HS. Additionally, the\u00a0Ryzen 7 7840HS\u00a0contains a more powerful iGPU that AMD markets as the Radeon 780M. On top of that, MINISFORUM complements the\u00a0Ryzen 7 7840HS\u00a0with the Radeon RX 6650M, a discrete GPU that has 28 Compute Units (CUs) and 8 GB of GDDR6 VRAM. The MINISFORUM HX100G starts at $719 as a barebones unit without RAM or storage. Alternatively, the mini-PC can be purchased with a 1 TB SSD and 32 GB or 64 GB of RAM for $905 and $995, respectively. As far as we can tell, all SKUs feature the same ports: Front Rear Purchase the MINISFORUM Neptune Series NAD9 on Amazon MINISFORUM "
