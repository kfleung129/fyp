    "text": " Need a quick, dirty way of increasing framerates? AMD\u2019s Fluid Motion Frames (AFMF) technology will soon launch, alongside the company\u2019s upcoming GPU release, the Radeon RX 7600 XT. The new feature will officially leave the testing phase and enter general availability \u2013 with Radeon RX 7000, 6000 series GPUs, and Radeon 700M series iGPUs set to support this feature. AFMF is a driver-level frame generation technology, which makes it a vastly different implementation compared to NVIDIA\u2019s DLSS3 (Frame Gen) tech. Team Green\u2019s solution involves active developer implementation, which means support is enabled on a per-game basis. AFMF, meanwhile, will support every DirectX 11 and DirectX 12 right out of the gate. This is not to be confused with the other frame-generation technology that AMD currently has, the FSR3, which functions in similar ways as DLSS3. The feature will also be included as part of the HYPR-RX performance boosting mode through AMD Software, which already includes FSR2 or Radeon Super Resolution (RSR), plus Radeon Boost, and Radeon Anti-Lag. The company believes that this is an advantage that NVIDIA does not have, but noted that Team Green may offer their implementation as a result. In an interview with PCGamer, AMD Radeon division\u2019s Senior Manager, Aaron Steinman said: \u201cI think what we\u2019re gonna start seeing, DLSS is only available on certain solutions, so either NVIDIA is going to have to benefit from our solution because we did make it open-source and cross-vendor, or they\u2019re probably going to need to do something similar.\u201d Source: Videocardz Pokdepinion: Cruicially, this is going to give the AMD laptop APUs a serious leg up in performance against Intel\u2019s new Core Ultra chips.
