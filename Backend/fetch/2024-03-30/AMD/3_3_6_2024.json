Learn more Pairing up your CPU is a necessity for a great gaming PC, that\u2019s why we bring you the best GPU for the Ryzen 7 7700X. That way you can make sure to get the most out of both your components and get a greatly functional system from the combination. With this CPU generation, AMD has moved to the AM5 platform. Moving the pins away from the processor to the motherboard and fitting many more in. Now the Ryzen 7 models offer middle-of-the-pack performance. With everything, a gamer might need without the extra pricing and unnecessary features on top. The processor has 8 cores and 16 threads in it. With a 105W TDP, it has a frequency of 4.5GHz and it can boost up to 5.4GHz. So what graphics card can utilize that potential? Shop on Amazon Shop on Amazon Shop on Amazon Core clock speed 2655 MHz boost CUDA count 8,448 Memory 16GB GDDR6X Dimensions 300 x 130 x 58mm PSU required 750W TGP 285W For the ultimate Nvidia pairing to the 7700X, look no further than the RTX 4070 Ti Super. Representing an upgrade over its predecessor, the Super variants elevate the value of Nvidia\u2019s Ada series, although many would argue they should have been introduced earlier. Nonetheless, better late than never, even if it might serve as a last-ditch effort before the release of the RTX 50 series. Positioned in the middle of the lineup, the 70 Ti Super presents a somewhat challenging choice among options but pairs well with the CPU. In our RTX 4070 Ti Super review, we observed consistently high frame rates across various games, even though its primary target is 1440p gaming, with 4K accessibility as well. By incorporating advanced technologies like frame generation and DLSS 3, it outshines its competitors, particularly in titles like Cyberpunk 2077 where it achieves a respectable 44 FPS on Ultra settings in our testing. However, achieving even higher performance may require additional optimizations. Overall, the specs include the AD103-275 GPU manufactured with TSMC\u2019s 5nm process, featuring 8,448 CUDA cores, 264 TMUs, 96 ROPs, 66 SMs, 264 Tensor cores, and 66 RT cores. Coming with 16GB of GDDR6X of memory with a 256-bit bus provides a bandwidth of 672GB/s. The total power in the package comes to 285W with the clock rate coming in at 2,340MHz and boosting up to 2,610MHz although overclocked models boost that even more. The Gigabyte model does come with a 300 x 130 x 58mm size and is a dense heavy option much like we saw in our Strix review. Core clock speed 2,565MHz boost, 2,254MHz game Stream processors 3,840 Memory 16GB GDDR6 Dimensions 319.8 x 150.9 x 59.2 mm PSU required 750W TBP 263W The RX 7800 XT emerges as an optimal choice for those aiming for 1440p performance and seamlessly complements the capabilities of the 7700X. This card, introduced later in the RDNA 3 life cycle as a more accessible tier option, arrived nearly a year after the initial release of the 7900 XTX. However, its game performance offers excellent value, albeit not positioned at the high end of the spectrum. Utilizing an MCM chip package, the RX 7800 XT combines TSMC\u2019s N5/N6 processes to create a unique architecture for its Navi 32 XT processor. Memory-wise, it incorporates 16GB of GDDR6 memory running through a 256-bit bus, clocked at 19.5Gbps, resulting in a bandwidth of 624GB/s. With 3,840 stream processors, 240 TMUs, 96 ROPs, 60 CUs, and 60 RT cores, this GPU offers robust performance. Looking at the 7800 XT benchmarks, we can see its great capabilities. Ity still is capable of averaging over 60 FPS at 4k so you can enjoy a good gameplay experience across the board as 1440p and 1080p still run in the three figures. Of course, being an AMD GPU does mean the ray tracing and rendering performance is not as effective. But for pure rasterization, you can still enjoy a great performance from it. Core Clock Speed 2,324 MHz base, 2,713 MHz boost, 2,633 game Stream Processors 2,560 Memory Size 12GB GDDR6 Dimensions 320 x 130 x 50 mm PSU Required 700W The RX 6750 XT stands out as the final top-tier GPU choice to pair with the Ryzen 7 7700X. This RDNA 2 GPU benefits from its status as a slightly older option, resulting in a reduced price without compromising its performance. It presents an excellent value proposition for users seeking a budget-friendly GPU, offering a seamless integration of AMD hardware within its ecosystem. Constructed on the Navi 22 KXT architecture and utilizing TSCM\u2019s 7nm process, the card boasts 2,560 stream processors, 160 TMUs, 64 ROPs, 40 CUs, and 40 RTs. It comes equipped with 12GB of GDDR6 memory featuring a 192-bit bus width and a bandwidth of 432 GB/s, thanks to its clock speed of 18 Gbps. Offering up a base clock of 2,150MHz, and a game clock of 2,495MHz, along with a boost of 2,600MHz. In our comprehensive RX 6750 XT review, the card demonstrates strong performance across various titles such as CSGO, Rainbow Six Siege, and Warzone, achieving high frame rates. The Radeon GPU does benefit from the drivers with upscaling built into it providing you with a longer-lasting performance. For the best option for the processor, the best GPU for the Ryzen 7 7700X is the RTX 4070 Ti Super, providing Nvidia\u2019s strong Ada architecture with plentiful features and outright performance. As for an AMD choice, there is the RX 7800 XT which is a strong value choice for power to pricing. As for a more budget-friendly choice then the 6750 XT from the previous generation is also a good alternative. As part of the new Raphael AM5 architecture, all the CPUs have integrated graphics. So yes the Ryzen 7 7700X has an iGPU which is based on Radeon graphics. It has a core count of 2 with a frequency of up to 2,200 MHz and a base of 400 MHz. It doesn\u2019t quite stack up against a discrete card but does provide a quick option for diagnosing problems.
