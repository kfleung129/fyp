In this article, I want to talk about perhaps the most famous and controversial Hungarian AK \u2013 AMD-65. AMD-65 was developed by Hungarian engineer Karoly Zala.\u00a0The first prototype was ready by March of 1965, and in September of the same year, the factory produced the first batch for trials. Mass production of the gun started in January 1967. The concept,\u00a0albeit simple, was much ahead of its time.\u00a0AMD-65 is the first compact AK that was ever designed. 10 years before AKS74U, commonly known in the US as Krink(ov), and almost 30 years before Russian engineers finally developed their own short 7.62\u00d739 Kalashnikov called AK 104. AMD-65, late production with darker plastic parts In fact, the idea of a shortened 7.62\u00d739 AK made so much sense that over time it created a myth of AKMSU which I dissected in one of my previous articles: The legend of AKMSU \u2013 a mysterious AK that never was. The name AMD stands for\u00a0Automata M\u00f3dos\u00edtott Desszant\u00a0(automatic modified desant). \u201cDesant\u201d is a word of Slavic origin that basically means \u201ctroops that are deployed via some unusual way\u201d and it is usually translated as \u201cairborne troops\u201d. However, during WW2, the Red Army used \u201ctank desant\u201d, when a bunch of soldiers sat on top of the tank and jumped from it when the time came. So whether you\u2019re airborne \u201cdesant\u201d, marine \u201cdesant\u201d or airborne \u201cdesant\u201d, AMD-65 was the right gun for you. Light and compact, easy to carry, but still very capable. Short guns have their cool factor, so it is not surprising that AMD-65 appeared in so many movies. Sylvester Stallone shooting AMD-65 in the movie Rambo III It was used by Rambo when he helped noble freedom fighters in Afghanistan to repel a foreign invasion (yeah, some movies don\u2019t age well), and by Dolph Lundgren in \u201cRed Scorpion\u201d where he played a Soviet Spectnaz officer. AMD-65 has a 12.7 inch (320 mm) barrel, and such a weird length is easy to explain \u2013 it was the shortest that could fit all the original components, so the factory didn\u2019t have to spend a dime on a new gas block or front sight. Apart from \u201cdesant\u201d, AMD was used by officers with a special compact 20-round magazine, almost as a PDW (personal defense weapon). In the 80s, the AMD-65 in the Hungarian army was replaced by the more conventional AK-63. It seemed that it was destined to spend its remaining time covered in cosmoline slowly decaying in military warehouses. But life had a different plan for those little guns. Dolph Lundgren in the movie \u201cRed Scorpion\u201d, wreaking havoc in the bar with his AMD-65 New life abroad for AMD-65 In 2005, the Hungarian government sold 45,000 to the Pentagon, so the US Government could arm the Afghan National police. The price was around $300 apiece. Later on, Hungary donated another 39,000 rifles to the US. What they didn\u2019t understand is that most Afghans are exquisite Kalashnikov connoisseurs and only want the best. The situation got so bad that the New York Times published an article by C.J. Chivers: \u201cOne Poor Choice in Arming the Afghans, and Its Repercussions\u201d explaining all the issues with AMD-65. He listed five main complaints: AMD-65, late production with darker plastic parts When I read this article, I dismissed those concerns thinking that \u201cthe rifle is fine\u201d and that Afghans just love to complain. A few years later I came to Afghanistan and actually learned a whole lot from Afgan armorers, realizing I was dead wrong on both points. In the next part of the article, I want to talk about my personal experiences with AMD-65 and how it was different from the opinions of Afghan police officers. P.S. For the information in this article I want to thank my friend Zolt\u00e1n Sz\u0151r\u00f6s, the author of the best website about Hungarian AKs\u00a0https://www.kalasnyikov.hu/ Vladimir Onokoy is a small arms subject matter expert and firearms instructor.
