    "text": "The AMD Ryzen 5 7600X is a fast mid-range desktop processor of the Raphael series. It offers 6 cores based on the Zen 4 architecture that supports hyperthreading (12 threads). The cores clock from 4.7 (base) up to 5.7 GHz (single core boost). When all 6 cores are fully loaded, 5.3 GHz is the max. clock speed.\u00a0 \nThe performance of the R5 7600X is clearly better than the old\u00a0Ryzen 5 5600X\u00a0thanks to the improved architecture and modern 5nm process. The single core performance is very good thanks to the high turbo clock speed (-400 MHz compared to the high end CPUs like the Ryzen 9 7950X). The multi-threaded performance is of course not that competitive due to only 6 cores. \nThe Raphael series still uses a chiplet design with two CCD-clusters (each with 8 possible cores) in 5nm and an IO-die (including the memory controller and the Radeon Graphics iGPU) in 6nm. \nThe R5 7600X is rated 105 Watt TDP and Raphael is rather power hungry compared to the 5000 series.

The Intel Xeon W-10855M\u00a0is a high-end processor for laptops with six cores based on the Comet Lake architecture (CML-H, 4th generation of Skylake). The processor clocks at between 2.8 and 4.8 GHz (probably 4.4 GHz with 6 cores) and can execute up to twelve threads simultaneously thanks to Hyper-Threading. The processor is still manufactured in the old 14nm (14nm++) process.\u00a0 \nThe Comet Lake architecture is similar to Coffee Lake and offers the same features and is produced in the same 14nm process. Other than the improved clock rates, the memory controller now also supports faster DDR4-2933 RAM.

Thanks to the 6 cores and high Turbo speeds, even demanding applications should run fine on the CPU.

As a\u00a0 low-end solution it will only run current games smoothly at reduced details - if at all. \nPower Consumption \nIntel specifies the TDP with 45 watts and therefore the i7 is only suited for big laptops with good cooling solutions. Using cTDP-down, the CPU can also be configured to 35 Watt resulting in a reduced performance.
