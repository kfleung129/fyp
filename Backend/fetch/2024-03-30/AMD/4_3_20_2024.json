    "text": " AMD is progressing with the development of its third-generation upscaling technology. The current iteration, FSR3, is being upgraded to version 3.1 and is expected to be available to game developers starting in the second quarter. The updated upscaling technology brings several improvements, including enhanced image quality, support for Vulkan and the Xbox Game Dev Kit, and a major innovation: decoupling frame generation technology from upscaling. This could practically allow game developers to combine frame generation with other upscaling techniques such as DLSS, XeSS, or TSR. If this works out the way we think, then NVIDIA DLSS users could benefit from frame generation tech powered by AMD software, while still being able to use NVIDIA upscaler. Introducing AMD FSR 3.1 with Improved Upscaling Quality Announced today at our GDC 2024 \u201cHigh Performance Rendering in Snowdrop Using AMD FidelityFX\u2122 Super Resolution 3 (FSR 3)\u201d presentation, AMD FSR 3.1 will have some significant improvements, new capabilities, and updates: The FSR 3.1 was revealed at GDC 2024, showcasing enhancements to temporal stability and ghosting in side-by-side animations. These improvements were demonstrated using game Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart, set to be one of the early adopters of FSR 3.1.
