Read more It seems that AMD has been in hot water recently since info regarding its graphics card was leaked online. While this is bad news for AMD, this info can be beneficial for reverse engineers. To learn how this affects AMD and the gaming community as a whole, keep on reading. It seems that an anonymous security researcher has released the AMD 4800S Main BIOS, Backup BIOS, ROM, and fuses according to the Wololo. As you may know, AMD 4800S is an APU with a deactivated GPU, and it is used in the Xbox Series X. PlayStation uses a similar hardware, but in the form of AMD 4700S. With this data released to the public, enthusiasts can learn more about firmware, explore hardware glitches, and learn more about CPU and by extension Xbox Series X. If any vulnerabilities are found, they might be replicated on Xbox, if the CPU on the console is using similar firmware, and this can be a serious problem for Microsoft. There\u2019s also a chance that these vulnerabilities can be replicated on PS5 and its 4700S CPU. At the time of writing, these dump files are still available, and we hope that the online community won\u2019t abuse this data for malicious purposes. This isn\u2019t the only bad news for AMD, and we already wrote about how Microsoft added only Intel chips to the Windows 11 CPU compatibility list while leaving AMD out.
