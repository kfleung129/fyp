Highly acclaimed by the press and gamers alike, this title sold more than 2.5 million copies in the first 24 hours since released and managed to break the 10 million threshold on February 4. During this year's D.I.C.E. Awards, Marvel's Spider-Man 2 grabbed six awards, ahead of the five wins that went to Baldur's Gate 3. While the awards won by Sony Interactive Entertainment's game (developed by Insomniac Games) doesn't include Game of the Year, which went to Baldur's Gate 3, Marvel's Spider-Man 2 returned home with the following titles: Action Game of the Year, Outstanding Technical Achievement, Outstanding Achievement in Animation, Outstanding Achievement in Character (for Miles Morales), Outstanding Achievement in Original Music Composition, and Outstanding Achievement in Audio Design. In addition to becoming THE game of last year, Baldur's Gate 3 was also crowned for Outstanding Achievement in Story, Outstanding Achievement in Game Direction, Outstanding Achievement in Game Design, and Role-Playing Game of the Year. Last but not the least, a game worth mentioning is Diablo IV, which received the Online Game of the Year award. Sadly, it was the only of its three nominations that resulted in a win. While the global event will return in February 2025, a smaller European event is scheduled for September 28 to October 2. D.I.C.E. Europe 2024 will take place in Lake Como, Italy. More details can be found on the event's official website, which currently doesn't show any registration information. Marvel, Epic Games Store "
