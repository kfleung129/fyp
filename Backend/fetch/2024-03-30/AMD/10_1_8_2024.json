PXD-01.3 An AMD Ryzen 7 8700G processor with integrated Radeon 780M graphics is projected to have the fastest integrated desktop processor graphics in the world. Performance projection by AMD engineering staff. Engineering projections are not a guarantee of final performance. Specific projections are based on reference design platforms and are subject to change when final products are released in market. PXD-024 Overclocking and/or Undervolting AMD processors and memory, including without limitation, altering clock frequencies / multipliers or memory timing / voltage, to operate outside of AMD\u2019s published specifications will void any applicable AMD product warranty, even when enabled via AMD hardware and/or software. This may also void warranties offered by the system manufacturer or retailer. Users assume all risks and liabilities that may arise out of overclocking / undervolting AMD processors, including, without limitation, failure of or damage to hardware, reduced system performance and/or data loss, corruption or vulnerability. GD-106.5 Precision Boost Overdrive requires an AMD Ryzen Threadripper, Ryzen 3000 Series (excluding Ryzen 3400G and 3200G) or newer desktop processor, or a Ryzen 9 7945HX3D mobile processor, and a compatible motherboard. Because using Precision Boost Overdrive enables operation of the processor outside of AMD\u2019s published specifications, use of the feature invalidates the AMD product warranty and may also void warranties offered by the system manufacturer or retailer. Availability of Precision Boost Overdrive in pre-built OEM systems will vary based on the PC manufacturer\u2019s settings. Check with the PC manufacturer prior to purchase. GD-179.6 Max boost for AMD Ryzen processors is the maximum frequency achievable by a single core on the processor running a bursty single-threaded workload. Max boost will vary based on several factors, including, but not limited to: thermal paste; system cooling; motherboard design and BIOS; the latest AMD chipset driver; and the latest OS updates.
