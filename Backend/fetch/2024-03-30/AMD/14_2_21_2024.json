    "text": "AMD Ryzen 7800X3D Is the fastest gaming CPU on offer for gamers to date. Here are some of the best GPUs that you can pair to get the most out of it. AMD's Ryzen 7 7800X3D is one of the best gaming CPUs ever released as it meets or exceeds the Ryzen 7 5800X3D's prowess in its heyday in the not-so-distant past. It does so by leveraging the newer Zen 4 cores that the Ryzen 7000 series offers in addition to taking a page out of its predecessor's book when it comes to a large, stacked (32MB 2D + 64MB 3D) 96MB of L3 Cache in play that allows it to become a potent CPU for gamers. Unlike the Ryzen 7 5800X3D, it can also be overclocked to a certain degree with a bit of effort. It might, however, be trickier to tweak outside of AMD's Precision Boost Overdrive (PBO) presets thanks to it being harder to account for the considerable amounts of heat the stacked L3 Cache generates for amateur overclockers. It also offers itself as one of the most efficient high-end gaming CPUs as the octa-core chip regularly pulls as little as 50W of power from the motherboard when under load, making it a relative breeze to power versus most of its competition from Intel which tends to draw a higher multiple of the same to stay competitive in similar titles. Note: The Game Rant team acknowledges that the AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D is what one can call a \"specialist\" gaming CPU with its key strengths being geared towards the fastest and most efficient gaming performance possible on a desktop. The choices below are therefore geared toward GPUs that offer the best gaming GPUs in a variety of settings, but ideally bottleneck as little of the 7800X3D's potential at various price points as possible. The TUF Bargain The\u00a0ASUS TUF Gaming GeForce RTX 4070 Ti Super OC is a factory-overclocked RTX 4070 Ti SUPER GPU offering an excellent tri-fan cooler with a vapor chamber.With a 10% bump in CUDA cores over its predecessor, high boost clocks, and the TUF gaming lineup's penchant for reliability in tow, the\u00a0ASUS TUF Gaming GeForce RTX 4070 Ti Super OC is the complete package for gamers looking to play games in 2K at a high refresh and occasionally dabble with 4K in some titles with ease. The ASUS TUF Gaming GeForce RTX 4070 Ti Super OC offers significant amounts of power in a large 3.25 slot form factor along with a cooler that delivers on its promise to keep things cooler and quieter than most of its competition. It makes for one of the most well-balanced GPUs to combine with the AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D thanks to its ability to handle titles at FHD, QHD (2K), and to a lesser extent UHD (4K) resolutions with high graphics presets. With 16GB of fast GDDR6X VRAM that offers a faster 256-bit bus compared to its predecessor's 12GB offering at a 192-bit memory bus, the ASUS TUF Gaming GeForce RTX 4070 Ti Super OC is also more future-proof as a result in a world where games get increasingly demanding thanks to a focus on high-fidelity textures and visuals with subsequent game releases. It trades at a sub-$50 price premium over stock versions of Nvidia's RTX 4070 Ti Super while offering an excellent overclock and arguably better availability than the non-OC TUF SKU of the same which matches the RTX 4070 Ti Super FE's MSRP. A Compelling Value Purchase The XFX Radeon RX 7900XT is based on AMD's latest and most powerful graphics chips. The AMD RX 7900 XT is powered by the new RDNA 3 architecture, which delivers AI acceleration, a new AMD Radiance display engine, and a Chiplet design. There's also an improved 2nd generation of ray-tracing and AMD Infinity Cache features.This specific XFX GPU features 20 gigabytes of graphics memory on a 320-bit memory interface, a clock speed of 2560 MHz, and a powerful triple fan cooling solution. For users looking to exact the highest amount of value in terms of raw performance in terms of brute-force rasterization, the XFX Speedster MERC310 RX 7900XT Black might make a more compelling case than Nvidia's sub-$800 GPU. This is because of where it is positioned in terms of pricing: it can be had for anywhere between $720 to $800 or higher versus Nvidia's newer refreshed-for-2024 RTX 4070 Ti SUPER that costs a minimum of $800 or more depending on the SKU in question. It also uses the older, tried, and tested 8-pin connectors that its predecessors do while throwing in an additional 4GB of VRAM, even as it ups the memory bus to 320-bit width, more than matching its pricier GDDR6X-based competition. At the same time, it does come up slightly short when it comes to Ray Tracing performance. It also consumes more power than Nvidia's considerably power-efficient architecture, which leverages its superior DLSS 3/3.5 solution to entice gamers to switch to Team Green instead. No Holds-Bared Ada Lovelace Power The ASUS ROG Strix GeForce RTX 4090 OC Edition may be one of its largest GPUs ever, but the patented design supports the most potent overclocking potential out of its peers.With a vapor chamber in tow, the ROG Strix comes in both black and white and does not disappoint in either looks or power. It is easily the most powerful 4090 out there, clocking at a stable 3120 MHz in Game Rant's in-house testing. For users looking to pair the best possible gaming CPU with the best possible gaming GPU, the undisputed performance king remains the RTX 4090. The ASUS ROG Strix GeForce RTX 4090 OC Edition takes things further, allowing for significant boost overclocks, well beyond the rated boost clocks that other models offer even as it offers higher power limits under the hood than its competition. What makes the Strix OC SKU significantly better is its die-cast design that incorporates one of the best GPU coolers in the business, excellent VRMs, and an aesthetic that is a significant upgrade over its predecessor replete with RGB for enthusiasts. With 24GB of GDDR6X memory on offer, in addition to the best DLSS 3/3.5 performance money can buy, the ASUS ROG Strix GeForce RTX 4090 OC Edition has users looking for a powerful GPU that can ease into most 4K titles. We recommend reading Game Rant's review of the ASUS ROG Strix GeForce RTX 4090 OC Edition to allow users to make a more informed choice. AMD's Fastest GPU Yet The Sapphire Nitro lineup is synonymous with the highest-end AMD 3rd-party GPU offerings in the market. The Nitro+ doubles down on this with the highest-in-market clocks and a vapor chamber that outperforms the stock design considerably while trading at a significant premium over competing 7900XTX-based products. The Sapphire AMD Radeon NITRO+ RX 7900 XTX Vapor-X is the best SKU money can buy for AMD's fastest GPU. If users plan to go for AMD's ultimate GPU to pair with their fastest gaming-grade CPU, the Nitro+ Vapor-X might be the only player in town that can push boundaries even further. It offers a custom vapor chamber design that considerably outperforms the stock option even as it offers unlocked clocks and power limits that users have already leveraged to eke out considerably more performance than other SKUs with relative ease. The RX 7900 XTX comes with 24GB of GDDR6 memory, a chip that can take on and often beat Nvidia's competing RTX 4080 SUPER SKU in gaming benchmarks. It does, however, continue to showcase the fact that Ray Tracing is still AMD's Achilles Heel as it struggles to close the gap with Nvidia's implementation, which is at least 1 generation ahead of its competition. The Vapor-X also happens to be one of the most expensive RX 7900 XTX models out there, making for a somewhat poor comparison to Nvidia's newly released RTX 4080 SUPER, which offers a sub-$200 price cut as it aims to deliver significantly better value to its consumers in 2024. The Reimagined Trio The\u00a0MSI RTX 4070 SUPER 12G Gaming X Slim is an excellent tri-fan take on Nvidia's newest RTX 4070 GPU that offers a high boost overclock, the new Tri-Frozr 3 cooler to keep temperatures low and a metal backplate.It also features a dual-slot design, making it an excellent GPU for gamers looking to fit one in their PC without covering the bulk of their motherboard or case area in addition to keeping temperatures low thanks to its tri-fan offerings. The MSI RTX 4070 SUPER 12G Gaming X Slim offers Nvidia's most impressive GPU upgrade in 2024 in a slimmer, low-profile design even as it clocks it considerably higher than the stock option with a tri-fan design in tow. This allows it to fit in cases that lack space versus some of its beefier alternatives from other AIBs even as it delivers similar, or in some cases, better performance at a competitive price point. The RTX 4070 S is also arguably the biggest upgrade Nvidia has unveiled in 2024, offering anywhere between 15 to 20% performance gains over its predecessor, making it arguably the best value purchase for gamers still on the fence for a new GPU in 2024. It offers excellent DLSS 3/3.5 performance, a powerful cooler, and a decent aesthetic as part of its offerings. Users might be concerned about the limitations of 12GB of GDDR6X memory as modern games continue to get more demanding as time goes on as well as the $50 premium MSI wants for its higher-end SKU. With that being said, if one is looking for a great mid-range GPU to pair with the AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D for gaming and is willing to shell out a small premium, it is hard to beat the well-endowed MSI RTX 4070 SUPER 12G Gaming X Slim that can also do well in many Small Form Factor (SFF) cases with ease. A Premium Take On A Budget GPU MSI GeForce RTX 4060 GAMING X 8G is a beautifully crafted GPU with high air pressure Torx fans and brings a dual fan cooler with an attractive black shroud.The Gaming X 8G is an RGB edition with an RGB MSI Dragon Logo on the top and is factory overclocked at a boost clock of 2595MHz. It is one of the best RTX 4060 GPUs in terms of thermals and is ultra-quiet as well. For gamers looking for an entry-level GPU relative to the AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D, the slightly higher-end RTX 4060 SKU from MSI does the trick at a price point that is just over the $300 MSRP. The MSI GeForce RTX 4060 GAMING X 8G offers a better cooler, higher boost clocks, RGB lighting and runs cooler than its competition all in the same package. For this, MSI does want an extra $30 over RTX 4060 which most gamers would be willing to pay compared to some higher-end RTX 4060 AIB alternatives. The great DLSS 3/3.5 performance does not disguise the limitations of the GPU however. The MSI GeForce RTX 4060 GAMING X 8G has less VRAM than its predecessor even as it is confined to a 128-bit memory bus. Unlike some of its higher-end alternatives in the RTX 4000 series, one would find themselves at a disadvantage in explaining to last-generation RTX 3060 owners why the RTX 4060 is a significant upgrade beyond being a placeholder for the same $300 price tag sans its agreeable DLSS 3 gains. For users building a new gaming PC however, there isn't much in terms of choices if one is looking at AMD or Nvidia's end. The RX 7600XT simply doesn't compare favorably and the RX 7600 is similarly crippled but has an even lower performance offering than the higher-clocked XT, making the RTX 4060 the de facto winner simply thanks to slim pickings in its price range currently. This does, however, make it a great entry-level choice versus the competition to pair with AMD's Ryzen 7 7800X3D. The AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D remains the fastest gaming CPU in 2024 by a considerable margin versus other Intel and AMD CPUs. We hope you like the items we recommend and discuss!
