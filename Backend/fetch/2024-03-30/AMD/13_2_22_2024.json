Stay tuned for further announcements. Computex Taipei (Taitra) AMD has officially confirmed that its Zen 5 chips and the corresponding Ryzen 9000 processors will launch in the second half of 2024. This falls in line with what was reported earlier this year. The chipmaker\u2019s official roadmap says the same. Looking back at AMD\u2019s previous launches, the Ryzen 5000 CPUs were launched in October 2020, while the Ryzen 7000 series landed in September 2022. Both lineups were announced at the preceding Computex events, followed by a retail launch in the fall. There\u2019s also the matter of the Radeon RX 8000 series GPUs. Although the RX 8900 XTX has (allegedly) been canceled, the RX 8800 XT is expected to land in the second half of this year. Rumors claim that the 8800 XT will offer comparable performance to the RX 7900 XT/XTX while costing nearly half as much. More recent claims suggest that engineering samples of the RDNA 4 GPUs are already being tested, and it won\u2019t be long before benchmarks start leaking out. Existing samples are supposedly boosting between 3GHz and 3.3GHz, and it\u2019s only a matter of time before they are tested on popular benchmarking platforms. "
