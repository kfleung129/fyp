There are so many different components to choose from and making sure they all work well together is crucial. That\u2019s where this bundle deal from AMD and MSI comes in \u2013 it takes the guesswork out by pairing one of AMD\u2019s latest powerful processors with a quality motherboard that\u2019s an ideal match. Amazon has this bundle up for grabs at $379.99 right now, which is a nice $40 saving off the regular combined price of $419.99 for these two components purchased separately. With the 7% discount, you\u2019re basically getting a free game or two along with your slick new AMD processor and motherboard combo. INLAND Micro Center AMD Ryzen 7 5700X 8-Core 16-Thread Best Deals This duo brings a ton of processing muscle and fully-loaded modern features to your new build. Here\u2019s a closer look at what makes this pairing such a great value. On the CPU side, we\u2019ve got AMD\u2019s Ryzen 7 5700X \u2013 an 8-core, 16-thread beast. It\u2019s basically like having 16 separate brain processors working together to demolish any task you throw its way. And with a max boost speed of 4.6GHz, it\u2019s wicked fast too. But a powerful brain needs an equally capable body, and that\u2019s where the MSI MAG X570S Tomahawk motherboard comes in. This bad boy is packed with all the latest goodies. It\u2019s rocking WiFi 6 and Bluetooth 5.2 for awesome wireless speeds and connectivity. It\u2019s got a bunch of USB ports to hook up all your gear. And it uses the speedy PCIe 4.0 standard for lightning-fast data zipping between your graphics card, storage drives, you name it. Now the cool part \u2013 both the processor and motherboard support overclocking out of the box. So if you\u2019re feeling adventurous, you can easily push the Ryzen chip beyond its factory settings for even more explosive performance. The motherboard\u2019s built tough to handle it. And you don\u2019t even need to buy an aftermarket CPU cooler right away, because AMD bundles in their Wraith Prism RGB cooler. It\u2019s got a slick color light show and does a solid job keeping the processor nice and chilled. As for memory, this motherboard is ready to roll with super-fast DDR4 RAM up to 3200MHz+. It\u2019s got four memory slots, so you can load it up with plenty of high-speed system memory for intense multitasking. This AMD processor and motherboard bundle just makes building a powerful new desktop PC straightforward. The Ryzen 7 5700X gives you 8 cores and 16 threads of serious processing muscle for gaming, video editing, 3D work and multitasking. While not the flagship, it\u2019s still an incredibly capable CPU. The real value is pairing it with MSI\u2019s well-built X570S Tomahawk WiFi motherboard. This board has all the latest connectivity like WiFi 6, Bluetooth 5.2, USB ports, and PCIe 4.0. It\u2019s a robust foundation from a trusted brand that\u2019s optimized for AMD\u2019s Ryzen chips. Having overclocking support, fast memory speeds, and even a decent RGB CPU cooler included elevates the package. And at the discounted $379 bundle price, you\u2019re just getting a ton of performance for less than buying these two quality components separately.
