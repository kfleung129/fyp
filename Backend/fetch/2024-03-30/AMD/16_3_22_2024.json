    "text": "By Colin Kellaher Outlook Therapeutics shares moved higher in premarket trading Friday after the European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use issued a positive opinion on approval of the company's ONS-5010 for the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration, or wet AMD. Shares of Outlook, which closed Thursday at $7.04, were recently up nearly 12% to $7.85 in light premarket trading. The Iselin, N.J., biopharmaceutical company said approval would make ONS-5010 the first and only on-label, ophthalmic formulation of bevacizumab for the treatment of wet AMD in the European Union. The European Commission, which generally follows CHMP's advice, is expected to make a decision within 67 days of the CHMP opinion. Outlook, which plans to market the drug as Lytenava, said it is assessing direct commercialization of the product and partnering in Europe on a country-by-country basis.
