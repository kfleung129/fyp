    "text": "There is mounting evidence that Intel\u2019s INTC new, critical chips compare very well with those of its top competitors, and the firm continues to make meaningful progress in its drive to become one of the world\u2019s leading producers of semiconductors. Given these points, along with the quite attractive valuation of INTC stock, I continue to recommend that investors buy the shares. Stacking Up Very Well With Its Top Competitors In recent tests performed by a company called Stability AI, Intel\u2019s Gaudi 2 AI chip was 56% faster than Nvidia\u2019s NVDA H100 offering and 2.43 times quicker than its A100 chip when it came to creating AI. And if the higher capacity of Intel\u2019s chip is factored in, its advantage widened to 2.1 times and 3.26 times, respectively. On the other hand, the A100 chips produced images \u201cup to 40% faster\u201d than the Gaudi 2 semiconductors. Still, wccftech, the respected publication that reported Stability AI\u2019s findings, stated that \u201cthe benchmarks show that Intel\u2019s solutions offer great value and can be seen as a respected alternative for customers who are eyeing a fast & readily available solution compared to Nvidia\u2019s offerings.\u201d Moreover, according to a well-known source on YouTube, Intel\u2019s upcoming Arrow Lake processor will be 25%-35% better than its current offering, Meteor Lake. Further, AMD\u2019s AMD upcoming Zen 5 chips will reportedly only be 15%-20% superior to its current offering, and Arrow Lake\u2019s \u201coverall raw performance\u201d is slated to top that of AMD\u2019s upcoming product. On the other hand, AMD is supposed to be able to use techniques soon after Zen 5\u2019s launch to eliminate the gap. However, since AMD has gained a significant amount of market share at Intel\u2019s expense in recent years due to the supposed superiority of AMD\u2019s offerings, eliminating the disparity should be very positive for Intel\u2019s financial results and INTC stock. Intel\u2019s Arrow Lake chips are due out in late 2024 or early 2025. Continuing to Make Meaningful Progress on the Chip Manufacturing Front Intel is meaningfully ahead of Samsung, the world\u2019s number two chip manufacturer, when it comes to the important criteria of miniaturizing its processors. Smaller chips are more efficient than larger ones. And now Intel is reportedly using that advantage to woo Samsung\u2019s South Korean customers. In a sign that Intel\u2019s efforts have a good chance of succeeding to a large extent, a number of leaders in South Korea\u2019s private sector are reportedly worried about Samsung\u2019s vulnerability to Intel\u2019s incursions. Moreover, as I pointed out in past columns, Intel has signed an impressive $15 billion of deals to make chips for other firms, and Microsoft MSFT recently agreed to buy chips from Intel. I theorized that MSFT\u2019s decision to obtain processors from Intel would convince many other tech firms to follow suit. Also noteworthy is that Intel expects its 1.8 nanometer chips, due out at the end of this year to be more efficient than those of the chip-manufacturing leader, TSMC TSM. Additionally, Intel has become the first company to place the wires on its chips to the back of the processors instead of the front. According to the firm, the change will make its offerings more efficient. Finally, on March 7, Bloomberg reported that the U.S. government could pay Intel $3.5 billion over three years to make chips\u00a0for military and intelligence programs, Bloomberg reported. Valuation and the Bottom Line on INTC Stock Intel\u2019s forward price-earnings ratio of33.8 times is quite low, given the firm\u2019s multiple, positive catalysts and vast potential.
