The iGPU is based on the new RDNA3 architecture and has 12 CUs (= 768 shaders) clocked at up to 3 GHz (depending on the CPU model). As the predecessor Radeon 680M, the 780M supports hardware raytracing, although the performance is too slow to use it in current games. \nThanks to the new architecture and higher clock speeds, the Radeon 780M should be clearly faster then the old\u00a0Radeon 680M. This means most demanding games should be playable in minimum graphics settings (like Cyberpunk 2077) and less demanding games like Fifa 23 can be played in higher settings and resolutions (1080p). In early 2023, the Radeon 780M is the fastest iGPU on the market. \nThanks to the modern 4nm process and clever power-saving features, the power consumption is comparatively low (according to AMD). The whole chip of the first two models can be configured between 15 - 54 Watt TDP. The AMD Radeon 780M is an integrated GPU in the Ryzen 7040 series for laptops (Phoenix, e.g. Ryzen 9 7940HS).

It uses the Navi 22 chip based on the new RDNA 2 architecture. It uses 1,792 of the 2,560 shaders (= 28 CUs), 112 TMUs, and 64 ROPs. The 128 Bit memory system connects 8 GB GDDR6 with 2 GHz memory clock. Furthermore, the RX6800S includes 32 MB Infinity Cache. AMD specified 1.9 GHz game clock for 7.9 TFLOPS theoretical FP32 performance at a TDP of 80 Watt. This means the GPU is in theory slower than a Radeon RX 6650M (8,85 TFLOPS). The 6700S is the power saving variant of the RX 6700M. \nThe gaming performance of the RX 6700S should be similar to the\u00a0Radeon RX 6650M. AMD specifies the performance\u00a0similar to a low power\u00a0RTX 3060. When Raytracing effects are activated, it falls behind the GeForce GPUs. \nThe Navi 22 chip is manufactured at TSMC in the modern 7nm process.

The performance depends on the used graphics memory, clock rate, processor, system settings, drivers, and operating systems. So the results don't have to be representative for all laptops with this GPU. For detailed information on the benchmark results, click on the fps number.
