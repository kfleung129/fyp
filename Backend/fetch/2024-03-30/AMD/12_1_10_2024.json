These new products are designed to provide users with enhanced gaming experiences, featuring up to 16GB memory and incorporating next-generation technologies like ray tracing and AI accelerator chips for AI workloads like Stable Diffusion. The Predator BiFrost AMD Radeon RX 7800 XT OC is set to launch in North America starting in February, with a starting price of $549.99, with the UK and Australia getting the card within Q1. The Nitro series, including the AMD Radeon RX 7800 XT OC, RX 7700 XT OC, and RX 7600 XT OC, will also be available in these regions around the same time, with prices starting from $509.99 in the US. The Predator BiFrost model features 60 unified AMD RDNA 3 compute units, paired with Predator FrostBlade 3.0 fans, promising high performance in 1440p and 4K gameplay.
