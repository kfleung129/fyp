    "text": "Last Epoch Mod, HDR, Ultrawide (21:9), Super Ultrawide (32:9), AMD FSR 3 & DLSS Support Details Eleventh Hour Games action-RPG \u2013 Last Epoch finally came out of early access and was officially released on February 21, 2024. The game\u2019s been receiving quite amazing reviews, with reviewers praising its deep character customization and fulfilling endgame. Suffice it to say, Last Epoch has turned out to be another great game of 2024. New players continue to join in on the fun, but many of them want to know if they will be able to play the game with mods, HDR, ultrawide, super ultrawide, AMD FSR 3, and DLSS. The action-RPG dungeon-crawling genre continues to be dominated by the Diablo and Path of Exile series. That\u2019s why it\u2019s nice to see a game like Last Epoch release and offer players another choice. But before trying out the game, a lot of players prefer knowing whether Last Epoch supports features like mods, HDR, ultrawide, super ultrawide, AMD FSR 3, and DLSS. So, does it? Well, let\u2019s go ahead and find out all about it. Starting with mod support, yes, you can play Last Epoch with mods. However, there\u2019s a caveat to this. The\u00a01.0 release of the game added a lot of new content to the game, along with an offline mode, controller support, and a whole lot of visual improvements. So, while you can enjoy mods in the game, it\u2019s going to be limited to offline mode only. Coming to the topic of HDR, unfortunately, the game doesn\u2019t have native HDR support. However, we do know that Windows 11\u2019s Auto HDR does work with the game. But it\u2019s honestly not that great. Well, anything\u2019s better than nothing, to say the least. While there might be no native HDR support, Last Epoch does have native ultrawide and super ultrawide support. And that\u2019s been the case since its early access days. And then there\u2019s AMD FSR3 and DLSS. Sadly, Last Epoch doesn\u2019t support either of them. Furthermore, the game doesn\u2019t even happen to have upscaling technology. Out of all the features mentioned here, this one is in demand the most. Unfortunately, because of the current version of the game engine, adding upscaling technology support isn\u2019t possible. However, the developers do have plans for adding in FSR and DLSS further down the line. For now, there\u2019s nothing else you can do except wait for developers at Eleventh Hour Games to introduce upscaling options in future updates. And when that happens, we will be sure to update our readers on it. Well, that\u2019s all the information we have on this currently. Additionally, you can also take a quick look here, if you want to know whether Le Mans Ultimate also has support for similar features.
