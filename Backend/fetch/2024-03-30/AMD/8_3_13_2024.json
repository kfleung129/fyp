    "text": "The AMD ATI Mobility Radeon HD 540v is a laptop graphics card based on the old Mobility Radeon HD 4500 series. Therefore, the GPU only features 80 shader cores (5-dimensional), DirectX 10.1 support and ist still manufactured in 55nm. The core clock rate is identical to the ATI Mobility Radeon HD 4550 but the memory speed is upped to the usual maximum of 800 MHz for DDR3. Therefore, the performance should be similar to the HD 4550. Compared to the HD545v, the HD540v offers a slower core clock. \nMore information on features and performance can be found on the ATI Mobility Radeon HD 4550 pages.

More information on features and performance can be found on the ATI Mobility Radeon HD 4550 pages. The following benchmarks stem from our benchmarks of review laptops. The performance depends on the used graphics memory, clock rate, processor, system settings, drivers, and operating systems. So the results don't have to be representative for all laptops with this GPU. For detailed information on the benchmark results, click on the fps number.
