AMD has hired a former Amazon Web Services analytics and AI product head to lead the chip designer\u2019s global commercial sales efforts in a newly created role. The Santa Clara, Calif.-based company confirmed to CRN that Archana Vemulapalli recently started her role as corporate vice president of global commercial sales and will report to Phil Guido, an IBM veteran who leads AMD\u2019s worldwide sales organization as chief commercial officer. She started in December, according to her LinkedIn profile.

The hire was made as AMD seeks to continue its momentum in taking server CPU market share away from Intel and challenge Nvidia in the AI computing space with its most powerful Instinct accelerators yet\u2014the MI300 series\u2014which the company launched in December. Vemulapalli was most recently head of product and global strategy for database, analytics, AI and machine learning, according to her LinkedIn profile. She got her start at AWS in 2021 as general manager and head of solutions architecture for the Americas. In the past year, Vemulapalli has been a spokesperson for AWS\u2019 generative AI efforts with enterprises, including the cloud giant\u2019s Bedrock managed service for foundation models. Prior to AWS, she was at IBM for nearly four years, most recently serving as general manager and global CTO of the company\u2019s $22 billion infrastructure services business. She started at IBM in 2017 as general manager of the company\u2019s global network services. Vemulapalli was previously the CTO for the government of Washington, D.C. A top executive at a major North American solution provider told CRN that she believes Vemulapalli will be \u201cintegral\u201d to her company\u2019s engagement with AMD and ISV partners on \u201cstrong\u201d generative AI use case for \u201cdifferent industries or different client situations.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s just showing a strong investment from AMD to hire somebody of that caliber to [oversee] those go-to-market [efforts],\u201d said Megan Amdahl, senior vice president of client experience and North America COO for Chandler, Ariz.-based Insight Enterprises, No. 16 on CRN\u2019s 2023 Solution Provider 500 list. Over the past few years, Insight has significantly ramped up its partnership with AMD, which not only resulted with the chip designer\u2019s CEO, Lisa Su, speaking at its annual Mastery conference last year but has also led to \u201csubstantial growth\u201d with the Intel rival\u2019s client and server processors, according to Amdahl. \u201cThey picked up several significant clients that are mutual enterprise clients,\u201d she said. To Amdahl, one important benefit Insight has received through its partnership with AMD are staff positions funded by the chip designer to focus on growing its business with the semiconductor company. These kinds of positions are often referred to as \u201cfunded heads.\u201d \u201cWhen you\u2019re working with a company as complex as Insight, you really need somebody or multiple people working within Insight funded by AMD to focus on their brand and their expansion. And they\u2019ve doubled down on their investment there with us. And what we see is when partners do that, then we become accretive to their growth,\u201d she said. AMD has made inroads with commercial channel partners over the past few years, which Su said in a December 2020 CRN magazine cover story has become an \u201cincredibly important\u201d part of the chip designer\u2019s strategy. Last year, AMD hired former Arrow Electronics leader Mark Taylor as its global channel chief after its previous partner leader, Terry Richardson, departed the company along with another top channel executive earlier in 2023.
