    "text": "3D V-Cache flexes its muscles in some games AMD officially launched its new Ryzen 5700X3D CPU yesterday, alongside the Ryzen 8000G series CPUs yesterday. The Ryzen 7 5700X3D is an interesting addition to AMD's AM4 lineup and at $249, it could be the best pick for an upgrade. In case you missed it, the Ryzen 7 5700X3D was announced last month as AMD's way of refreshing the AM4 platform, and it came alongside the Ryzen 7 5700, and a couple of Ryzen 5000GT series APU, all which launched yesterday. Among those, the Ryzen 7 5700X3D could become quite popular as this is an 8-core/16-thread Zen 3 CPU with a total of 100MB of cache (64MB of 3D vertical cache, 96MB of L3 cache, and 512KB of L2 cache per core). It has a slightly lower base and boost clocks compared to the Ryzen 7 5800X3D, but the $249.99 price tag makes it a great upgrade option.  The Ryzen 7 5700X3D is the third SKU in the Ryzen 5000X3D lineup, which also includes the Ryzen 5800X3D and the Ryzen 7 5600X3D (only available in a single shop). Unfortunately, as noted by Videocardz.com, there are no reviews as AMD did not send out samples to usual reviewers, but some sites from China managed to test it, showing that it has what it takes to compete closely with the likes of Intel Core i5-13600KF CPU. Of course, the improvements coming with 3D V-Cache depend on the game. The Ryzen 7 5700X3D should be available at all major retailers/e-tailers, with a price set at $249.
