    "text": "(Image source: Zed_Wang via Twitter.) It looks like all future AMD Ryzen processors will be shipping out with a slight change in the typography of its Integrated Heat Spreader (IHS): the words \u201cDiffused in Taiwan\u201d will not be visible on it and completely omitted. The changes to the labelling of its Ryzen CPUs have raised concerns that AMD is doing this as a way of pandering to the demands of Mainland China, where the country has insisted that products created in Taiwan be labeled as \u201cMade in China.\u201d To that end, other theories suggest that these newly labelled CPUs will only see shipment into China, while the rest of the world would still receive units that state its point of diffusion. Meanwhile, the Made in Malaysia labelling is still present. For those who don\u2019t know the difference between diffusion and its manufacturing point, Tom\u2019s Hardware provides an easy summary of the processes: \u201cDiffused\u2019 denotes the silicon die chipmaking process. (etching, masking, diffusion, etc.) AMD uses this term to note where the die was fabricated. The \u2018Made in\u2019 marking denotes the location where the die is placed into the chip package and then tested (OSAT) \u2014 i.e., mounted on a substrate (PCB) and then covered with the lid (IHS \u2013 Integrated Heat Spreader)\u201d AMD has denied any accusations that the move to remove its \u201cDiffused in Taiwan\u201d labelling from its Ryzen CPUs is in any way political. \u201cAMD removed the country of diffusion from all new CPU and APU products in 2023 to align with the product marking process for our other products,\u201d a spokesperson from the company said in a statement to Tom\u2019s Hardware. That statement isn\u2019t untrue either: if you take a close look at CPUs shipped to Malaysia, you\u2019ll notice that the recent shipments of Ryzen 7000 Series CPUs are devoid of any such labelling.
