    "text": "No white PC build is complete without a white motherboard, and we've rounded up some of the best ones Whether you\u2019re a novice or an enthusiast, building your own gaming PC can be a fun adventure. Your PC has many important components, but the motherboard is the backbone of it all. Choosing the best motherboard is one thing, but if you really want to enhance the looks of your build, there\u2019s nothing quite like a clean, pristine, all-white PC. If you want an all-white arctic aesthetic for your PC build, you can pair your white board with white PC cases and white GPUs to help your rig stand out. To get started, here are some of the best white motherboards for you to choose. The arctic theme makes it one of the coolest-looking boards. The Gigabyte Z790 Aorus Elite AX ICE is our best overall white motherboard for an Intel build. Supporting 13th Gen and 14th Gen Intel desktop CPUs, it features a rare white PCB along with off-white thermal shields for the VRM and the M.2 SSD slots. It boasts a DIY-friendly design with one-touch latches for securing the SSDs and the GPU. The Gigabyte Z790 Aorus Elite AX ICE is a solid choice if you\u2019re looking for a strong base for your Intel build. Its cousin was our best pick for Intel 14th Gen processors, which makes this white edition an easy winner. Beyond the white shrouds over the VRM and SSD areas, the entire PCB itself is white, which is not something that\u2019s very common. The overall arctic theme of this motherboard, coupled with the subtle pink LEDs, should make it a standout in any windowed case. This gaming motherboard boasts an all-digital VRM system with 16+1+2 phases. It\u2019s based on Intel\u2019s flagship Z790 chipset and can support any Intel CPU made for the LGA 1700 socket. You get four RAM slots for up to 192GB of DDR5 memory, a 2.5Gbps LAN port, and built-in Wi-Fi 6E. There are a total of four M.2 SSD slots and a PCIe 5.0 slot (along with two more PCIe x16 expansion slots) for a high-end graphics card. Gigabyte also claims that the board is rugged thanks to stainless steel shielding for the PCIe Gen 5 slot and the M.2 SSD slots. The board also boasts audiophile-grade capacitors for high-quality onboard audio and support for up to 7.1-channel playback. Pleasing design plus next-gen features MSI's X670E Gaming Plus WiFi comes packed with excellent features for your AM5 build, with white accents on the VRM, chipset, and M.2 heatsinks. This is an excellent motherboard for a premium AMD PC with a Gen5 NVMe slot, 17-phase VRM, and high-speed DDR5 support. If you're building a new AM5 build instead, the MSI X670E Gaming Plus WiFi is one of the best options on the market. While it doesn't feature an all-white PCB, it more than makes up for it with stylish white heatsinks on the VRM, chipset, and M.2 slots. Plus, the \"Gaming\" branding on the white accents isn't too aggressive. Whether you're planning to outfit your rig with blazing-fast DDR5 memory (up to 7,800 MT/s) or one of the best Gen5 NVMe SSDs, this board comes ready for it all. And thanks to the flagship X670E chipset, you can easily run any Ryzen 7000 processor and even overclock it to your heart's content. Built-in Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3 round up the feature set along with a DIY-friendly design thanks to screw-less M.2 clips. The X670E Gaming Plus Wifi also sports a 6-layert PCB and 17-phase VRM solution, so you're getting an all-around premium board for the price. For those who dare Calling the Asus ROG Maximus Z790 Formula an overkill board would be an understatement. It's well-made, features Aura Sync lighting, and has high-end features, like dual PCIe 5.0 x 16 slots, Wi-Fi 7 support, a water block, and a customizable OLED display. The breathtaking white design elevates the board to new heights. If you're a pro looking to build an enthusiast-grade gaming rig, the Asus ROG Maximus Z790 Formula offers every overkill feature you can think of. Top-tier water-cooled VRMs? Check. Abundant M.2 slots? Check. Bleeding edge Wi-Fi 7 and a 2-inch OLED screen? Double check. The ROG Maximus Z790 Formula is an improved version of the ROG Maximus Z790 Hero as it adds next-gen Wi-Fi 7 & 5Gb Ethernet, slightly more powerful VRMs, and a slew of quality-of-life enhancements. Support for high-speed DDR5 8000 MT/s+ RAM and dual PCIe 5.0 x 16 slots further amplify the overkill nature of this board. The Z790 Formula also keeps the DIY-friendly design intact with easy PCIe and M.2 release clips. The VRM heatsink has the ROG logo with Aura Sync lighting for RGB lovers, which complements the 2-inch customizable OLED display above the PCIe slot. You don't really \"need\" the Maximus Formula, but if you dare to stomach its price, it's one of the best-looking and most feature-packed options out there. Grey-themed & future-ready for a great price The Gigabyte B650 Eagle AX might not look like it initially, but it features white-grey accents to complement your white gaming PC. And with Gen5 NVMe support and a 16-phase VRM solution, it doesn't hold you back. For the price, it offers excellent value for anyone building an AM5 PC. It's typically hard to combine a beautiful white aesthetic with the necessary features for a modern AM5 build and come in on a budget. But the Gigabyte B650 Eagle AX makes a palatable compromise between value and feature with its its gray themed design and gray accents on the VRM and chipset heatsinks. With a white PC case, GPU, and other white components, this board will blend in nicely while also providing a subtle pop of color. You're getting a high-speed PCIe 5.0 M.2 slot and dual Gen4 slots for all the storage drives you want to install on this board. The 16-phase VRM design here is capable of slight CPU overclocking. Though you're not getting Wi-Fi 7, Wi-Fi 6E support rounds out the feature set for a more future-proof build at an affordable price. There is also a surprisingly decent array of ports \u2014 three ARGB headers, dual USB 3.2 Gen 2 ports, and 1Gb Ethernet. There's also a Q-Flash Plus button for BIOS fishing without a CPU. Small on size, relatively big on features The MPG series from MSI consist of fashion-focused products, and this MPG B760I Edge WiFi board is the perfect choice for a white Mini-ITX build. While the PCB is black, the large white and silver heatsinks give it a classy appearance. It fully supports Intel 14th Gen CPUs and even has a PCIe 5.0 GPU slot. There\u2019s built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, and a USB 3.2 (Gen2) Type-C port on the rear panel. The MSI MPG B760I Edge Wi-Fi is a stylish and compact motherboard for Mini-ITX builds. It features large white and silver heatsinks which cover most of the board area, so it will still complement an all-white build. It\u2019s based on Intel\u2019s B760 chipset, which means you get full support for the latest 14th Gen CPUs. The two DDR5 memory slots can accommodate an ample amount of RAM, and there\u2019s a PCIe 5.0 graphics card slot for no-compromise gaming. Despite the compact size, MSI has managed to squeeze in two M.2 SSD slots, but it\u2019s only PCIe 4.0 spec and not 5.0. There\u2019s built-in Wi-Fi 6E, 7.1-channel onboard audio output, and plenty of USB ports on the rear panel, including a Type-C (USB 3.2 Gen2) port. In terms of cooling, the extended heatsink over the VRMs promises better heat dissipation, and the eight-layer PCB with thickened copper should help this board last longer. Keeping it simple and neat The NZXT N7 B650E is a premium gaming motherboard featuring a white metal cover spanning the majority of the board\u2019s surface area. This gives it a clean and simplistic look, making it the perfect choice for a minimalistic white build. It supports AMD Ryzen 7000 series CPUs, and features integrated Wi-Fi 6E. NZXT's excellent cases are well-known but it also happens to have some of the best white motherboards. The NZXT N7 B650E features a black PCB, but most of it is covered by a white metal cover, giving it a very distinct appearance. Rather than going for an aggressive design, NZXT has kept it simple with subtle branding, which is what makes it so appealing. This is based on AMD\u2019s B650 chipset, so you don\u2019t get all the features found in the X670-based motherboards. Still, the N7 B650E features a 16+2+1 digital VRM solution and an integrated heat spreader under the white cover for more efficient heat dissipation. You get four DDR5 RAM slots, a PCIe 5.0 GPU slot, built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, and even a PCIe 5.0 M.2 slot. NZXT's CAM software makes it convenient to sync all of your RGB components together as well as control your system fans. It does cost more than some other white motherboards, but the singular design is unmatched elsewhere. You can also opt for the Z790 variant of this board but you'll have to let go of Gen5 M.2 connectivity. If you\u2019re looking to do something a bit different for your next DIY PC build, there\u2019s nothing cooler or classier than going all-white. Unlike some other components, white motherboards aren\u2019t very common. But the few that are available really elevate your rig. The Gigabyte Z790 AORUS Elite AX ICE is our favorite of the lot, mainly due to the balance of features and pricing. The rare white PCB and matching heatsinks make it look very cool. It\u2019s also feature-packed thanks to the top-end Z790 chipset, and comes with advanced cooling and overclocking options. If you really want to go crazy though and money is no object, it\u2019s hard to beat the Asus ROG Maximus Z790 Formula. You get dual PCIe 5.0 M.2 slots, top-of-the-line VRMs and cooling, and a customizable OLED display. The only downside is the very high price. If you\u2019re looking for subtlety in a compact form factor, our favorite is the MSI MPG B760I Edge Wi-Fi motherboard. Built for Mini-ITX cases, this compact motherboard from MSI features oversized white and silver heatsinks, and it doesn\u2019t compromise on features. It has built-in Wi-Fi and a PCIe 5.0 slot for the latest GPUs. The arctic theme makes it one of the coolest-looking boards. The Gigabyte Z790 AORUS Elite AX ICE is our best overall white motherboard for an Intel build. Supporting 13th Gen and14th Gen Intel desktop CPUs, it features a rare white PCB along with off-white thermal shields for the VRM and the M.2 SSD slots.
