    "text": "Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, has reclaimed its market cap to more than $1 trillion for the first time in two years. The crypto has surged past $52,000, gaining nearly 25% so far this year on the back of a fresh wave of investors\u2019 interest in tokens.With the digital asset rally, cryptocurrency stocks also surged. We have presented five top-performing stocks that have been leading the rally in the cryptocurrency space this year. These are CleanSpark CLSK, Nvidia NVDA, Advanced Micro Devices AMD, Marathon Digital Holdings MARA and Iris Energy IREN. The launch of Spot Bitcoin ETFs in January has been acting as the major catalyst for the bitcoin surge as it has made it easier for investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly owning the asset, thereby underscoring growth of cryptocurrency in mainstream investment platforms.In a milestone, data from CryptoQuant revealed that spot Bitcoin ETFs have accumulated $10 billion in assets under management (AUM) since their inception on Jan 10 this year, reflecting a strong investor interest. Outflows from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which previously dampened market sentiment, have significantly reduced, further fueling the upward trajectory. Notably, spot Bitcoin ETFs are a game changer for cryptocurrency investors.ARK Invest, renowned for its optimistic outlook, envisions Bitcoin as a successor to gold as a secure asset, forecasting continued value growth, driven by its increasing integration into the financial ecosystem. It argues that Bitcoin's resilience to economic uncertainties like inflation and interest rate hikes positions it favorably in the current economic environment.The anticipation of bitcoin's upcoming halving event in April is also influencing the cryptocurrency market. Halving, which reduces the reward for mining new blocks, has historically been seen as a catalyst for bitcoin's price. Moreover, the Lunar New Year holidays are contributing to a generally positive sentiment toward bitcoin, according to Fundstrat Global Advisors.
