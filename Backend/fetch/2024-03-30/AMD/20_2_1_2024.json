According to my AMD stock analysis, the chip maker\u2019s untapped potential the AI revolution and semiconductor market trends make AMD\u2019s stock a \u201cStrong Buy.\u201d Let\u2019s take a closer look. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM), the business behind the manufacturing of advanced silicon from AMD, Nvidia, and Apple, has consecutively provided the market with positive news. Last year, in their Q3 earnings report, TSM not only boosted revenue guidance but also predicted the \u201cchip slump\u201d was coming to an end. For those unaware, the \u201cchip slump\u201d refers to the period of weak demand and elevated inventory levels experienced by a variety of semiconductor companies since the last couple of years. Similarly, TSM\u2019s\u00a0Q4 earnings results, released in mid-January, are bolstering that sentiment. CEO C. C. Wei\u00a0mentioned\u00a0the company would return to growth in 2024, definitively marking the bottom of the chip maker slump. Statements from TSMC\u2019s management shed light on a possible uptick in demand for the CPU and GPU market in the coming quarters, and this would greatly benefit AMD\u2019s revenue growth and bottom line. Thiswill be the year AMD makes its long-awaited foray into the AI chip space, and demand for these kinds of chips remains high. The chip maker announced the MI300x GPU chipset almost a year ago in their second quarter 2023 earnings report. Investors wondered how AMD would commercialize its new GPUs. Some analysts were even\u00a0losing hope\u00a0as the year dragged on. However, in their third quarter earnings report, the chip maker announced it\u00a0expects to sell $2 billion in AI chips next year. In December 2023, AMD announced a new swath of AI chips: the Instinct MI300X accelerator and the Instinct M1300A accelerated processing unit. These work to train large-language models, and AMD CEO Lisa Su said these chips are comparable to Nvidia\u2019s H100 but are \u201cbetter on the inferenc[ing].\u201d The chip maker also announced the new Ryzen 8040, which the company claims offers 1.6 times more AI processing performance than previous models. Despite their initial skepticism on AMD\u2019s advanced AI chips, Wall Street analysts are overwhelmingly positive on the chip maker\u2019s share price appreciation potential. According to Koyfin, there are some 48 analysts covering AMD, and 33 of which have rated the company\u2019s shares either a \u201cBuy\u201d or a \u201cStong Buy.\u201d There has also been a series of analyst revisions to AMD\u2019s price target. In particular, analysts from Morgan Stanley, HSBC, and Bank of America to Susquehanna have increased their price targets for the chip maker. All of this means, while AMD shares have risen more than 136% over the past 12 months, there is still enough upside potential to get new investors interested.
