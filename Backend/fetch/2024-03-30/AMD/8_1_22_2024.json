    "text": "Last week, we detailed several upcoming ASRock gaming monitors, including a 34-inch curved OLED edition as well as 400 Hz and 520 Hz IPS-based options. Additionally, the company is preparing to release various new mini-PCs with various specifications. While its press release mentions the DeskMeet X600 and DeskMini X600, Tom's Hardware spotted ASRock also recently showcasing the Jupiter X600. To recap, ASRock announced the Jupiter 600 series almost a year ago with Intel Alder Lake and Raptor Lake processors. For reference, it sells the series as the Jupiter B660 and Jupiter H610 alongside lesser Jupiter A320 and Jupiter X300 models. Like the Jupiter X300, ASRock has based the Jupiter X600 around AMD Ryzen APUs. However, while the Jupiter X300 relies upon the older Socket AM4, the Jupiter X600 integrates AMD's latest Socket AM5 solution instead with the AMD X600 chipset. Thus, the upcoming mini-PC will be compatible with AMD Ryzen 7000 and Ryzen 8000 series APUs, with ASRock listing support for up to 65 W parts. In other words, it should be possible to drop in a Ryzen 7 7700 and Ryzen 9 7900 or the newer Ryzen 5 8600G and Ryzen 7 8700G. Moreover, the Jupiter X600 will ship with two SO-DIMM slots for up to 96 GB of DDR5 RAM, two M.2 2280 slots (PCIe 4.0 x4), a SATA (6 GB/s) port and an M.2 2230 slot for a Bluetooth/Wi-Fi module. Unfortunately, ASRock has not confirmed pricing or availability yet. With that being said, all Jupiter X600 SKUs will contain the following ports within 179 x 178 x 34 mm (1.1-litre) housings: Front: Rear Purchase the ASRock B650M-HDV motherboard (AMD Socket AM5) on Amazon ASRock via Liliputing & Tom's Hardware "
