    "text": "Amazon is currently offering the recently released XFX Radeon RX 7900 GRE 16GB graphics card for $549.99. That's retail pricing, but it's $50 cheaper than the GeForce RTX 4070 SUPER and just as powerful. The Radeon RX 7900 GRE is AMD's newest GPU release. Performance wise, it's sits right in between the RX 7800 XT and the 7900 XT. It's roughly 10%-15% faster than the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 GPU and is more comparable to the new RTX 4070 SUPER. The RTX 4070 SUPER has better ray tracing performance, although quite honestly, I wouldn't recommend turning on ray tracing at this price point even with a GeForce card. On the other hand, the RX 7900 GRE comes with 4GB of extra VRAM compared to the RTX 4070 SUPER, which comes in handy for games that can utilize the full 16GB (of which there are very few) or for VRAM hungry AI apps like Stable Diffusion. AMD Radeon cards are outstanding alternatives to the NVIDIA GeForce cards in terms of both price and availability. For most gamers who want to maximize their performance for their dollar, AMD GPUs are the way to go. However, if you're set on playing 4K games with ray tracing enabled, then you'll want to stick with NVIDIA. That's because the GeForce cards like the RTX 4070 SUPER perform better than their Radeon counterparts when it comes to ray tracing. Ray tracing is a form of rendering that allows for more realistic lighting effects. It makes light sources and shadows look better, but at the steep cost of GPU resources. "
