    "text": "AMD\u2019s next-generation desktop CPUs based on the Zen 5 architecture are expected to be released between April and June. The series, which could adorn the \u201cRyzen 9000\u201d moniker, packs a stunning IPC uplift per multiple leaks. Commenting on a new Zen 5 rumor, Paul Eccleston of RedGamingTech maintains that some of his sources are \u201cadamant\u201d that Zen 5 IPC gain is around 15-20% on average. However, Paul also mentions other reliable sources claiming an enormous IPC improvement of 35-40%. This is not new as he has been talking about Zen 5\u2019s IPC being up to 30% or better for a while now. Now digging into the latest purported Zen 5 performance, a Cinebench R23 Single-Core score of \u201c>= 2800\u201d of an AMD Zen 5 CPU has surfaced courtesy of @Swenersky on X. The score, if accurate, translates to a \u201c>= 40%\u201d increase per the leak. This is a giant leap in single-threaded performance when we consider Team Red\u2019s flagship Zen 4 CPU. Per our testing, the Ryzen 9 7950X has an average Cinebench R23 Single-Core score of 2,009. This puts the leaked Zen 5 single-threaded result a massive 39.3% ahead. Similarly, Zen 5 seemingly beats the Intel Core i9-14900K with a smaller but commendable lead of 19%. Alas, we have no way to verify the validity of the information. So, even though we\u2019d like to see Zen 5 bring an insane IPC improvement, it is important to remain skeptical until AMD officially reveals the Ryzen 9000 series. Buy the AMD Ryzen 9 7950X on Amazon RedGamingTech, @Swenersky on X "
