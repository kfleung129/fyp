    "text": " XFX is getting ready to reveal their first white RDNA 3 graphics card. This GPU is their RX 7800 XT Speedster QICK 319 White Edition, which has been listed by bermoresone.com. XFX are the latest GPU manufacturer to jump on the growing white GPU trend. Earlier this month, PowerColor revealed their White Edition RX 7900 XT Hellhound, and at CES 2024, Gigabyte revealed a range of new white hardware, which included a white GPU. Right now, XFX only appears to be making a White Edition version of their RX 7800 XT Speedster QICK 319. So far, not images of White Edition Radeon RX 7700 XT, RX 7900 XT, or RX 7900 XTX graphics cards have leaked. It also looks like XFX\u2019s higher-end Speedster MERC RX 7800XT will not be getting the White Edition treatment.  We expect XFX\u2019s new White Edition graphics card model to feature the same clock speeds and performance levels as its standard black counterpart. If this is the case, XFX\u2019s new QICK 319 GPU will ship with AMD\u2019s reference RX 7800 XT clock speeds. This will give the GPU a game clock speed of 2124 MHz and a boost frequency of 2430 MHz. XFX\u2019s RX 7800 XT Speedster Qick 319 is a 2.5-slot GPU that features a three fan cooling solution. The GPU features 16GB of GDDR6 memory, and 3840 stream processors. The graphics card also supports both DisplayPort 2.1 and HDMI 2.1. You can join the discussion on XFX\u2019s RX 7800 XT Speedster Qick White Edition graphics card on the OC3D Forums.
