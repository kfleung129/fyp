    "text": " It has long been known that there is a ' Researchers at ETH Zurich reverse engineered AMD's technology, which was previously thought to be less vulnerable, and found that bit flipping could also occur in DDR4 memory on devices with AMD Zen 2 and Zen 3 CPUs. I guessed that there was. When conducting attack tests based on this, it was successful on 7 out of 10 Zen 2-equipped devices and 6 out of 10 Zen 3-equipped devices. Furthermore, when they reverse engineered AMD Zen 4's DRAM functionality and tested the ZenHammer attack on 10 devices equipped with DDR5 memory, they were able to cause a bit flip on one device. This is said to be the first public report of bit flipping occurring in DDR5, but researchers admitted that they were unable to cause bit flipping in 9 out of 10 devices, indicating that DDR5 memory is vulnerable. We conclude that further research is needed to find out. The researchers said, ``These results prove that AMD systems are just as vulnerable to Rowhammer as Intel systems, and that AMD's market share in today's x86 desktop CPUs is approximately 36%.'' 'This significantly increases the attack surface. This poses a significant risk as unchecked DRAM cannot be easily remediated.' After receiving the report from the researchers, AMD said , ``We are reviewing the study and will update you once it is complete.''
