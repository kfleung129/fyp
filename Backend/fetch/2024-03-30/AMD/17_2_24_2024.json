    "text": "Only 23% Difference In GPU Performance Despite The Large Power Gap! German YouTuber GucksTV has tested an engineering sample of the Ryzen 7 8700GE that was leaked. Tests show that even with the 50% drop in maximum TDP, the unannounced chip only shows a 23% decrease in GPU performance. The AMD Ryzen 7 8700G is itself no slouch, performing well in light modern titles like Fortnite. However, it can run at 65 watts, while the Ryzen 7 8700GE is designed for lower-power devices and has a maximum TDP of only 35 watts. With its 8 Zen 4 cores and 12 RDNA 3 cores, the Ryzen 7 8700GE performed exceptionally well in several tests, making it a great option for small builds. In terms of performance, the 65-watt processor scored 17,430 on the Cinebench R23 test, compared to 14,600 on the more power-efficient chip. To achieve this score, the Ryzen 7 8700GE pulled only 40 watts. Meanwhile, the more power-hungry counterpart peaked at over 88 watts.\u00a0This is an incredible accomplishment since it equates to 84% of the performance at less than half the power consumption. When it comes to GPU performance, the RDNA 3-based 780M in the Ryzen 7 8700GE produces good outcomes as expected. It uses less than half the power and achieves 2,694 points in the 3DMark Time Spy test, which is around 18% lower than the Ryzen 7 8700G\u2019s 3,303 score. A number of GPU benchmarks conducted by GucksTV show that the Ryzen 7 8700GE and the Ryzen Z1 Extreme have a lot of similarities, including the utilization of the same 35-watt TDP and 12 RDNA 3 Compute Unit iGPU design. This implies that an entry-level Ryzen 8700GE-only PC system should still prove to be very feasible for desktop use and light-to-moderate gaming.
