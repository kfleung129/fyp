    "text": "Those who currently want to purchase a graphics card for 4K gaming need to have deep pockets. Even if AMD's current top model is already available for about 950 Euros (~$1,033), the graphics card in a high-end desktop PC is still the largest expense most of the time. The basic question is always whether it should be an AMD or an Nvidia graphics card for your system. Those who don't have any personal preference will base their decision on the price and performance. In this regard, AMD is able to impress with the Radeon RX 7900 XTX, which delivered an excellent gaming performance in our recent test.\u00a0If we disregard the raytracing performance, the XFX Speedster MERC 310 Radeon RX 7900 XTX Black Edition is able to compete with an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 Super, which usually costs about 150 Euros (~$163) more. However, AMD's Achilles heel is a raytracing performance that isn't comparable to that of the Nvidia model. But in our test with activated raytracing, the AMD graphics card still delivers an acceptable performance. Efficiency is also not one of the strengths of the XFX Speedster MERC 310 Radeon RX 7900 XTX Black Edition. Those who demand the full performance have to accept a high power consumption. Our test unit just by itself consumes slightly more than 400 watts, while the competitor consumes \"only\" 320 watts. You can find all the details on the XFX Speedster MERC 310 Radeon RX 7900 XTX Black Edition and its performance in current games in our review. AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX review "
