    "text": "Charging well over $8,000 for a single camera might seem like a protracted break from reality for many, yet is relatively routine for Leica, as is establishing and running physical stores for such premium equipment. These spaces are about to gain a new flagship, the 7th of its kind to be found in the United States. The new top-end Leica Store will join other centers of cultural and artistic aspiration such as the Whitney Museum and The Highline in New York City's Meatpacking District; on 13th Street,\u00a0to be precise. The premium imaging tech OEM will hold a formal opening event for this location on March 14, 2024. The space, laid out over 2 floors at\u00a0406 W 13th St, the top story of which will be \"reserved for inspiration\" and connection with photography (as well as other photographers, possibly) via the new Leica Library. It will also lead onto a studio, and outdoor rooftop for extra potential creativity. The main Store, on the other hand, is intended to spark investment in said inspiration with its displays of cameras such as the M11 or SL3, as well as Leica watches,\u00a0binoculars and the Cine 1 Laser TV. The Xiaomi 14 Ultra mght not make it to shelves in the new \"beacon for photography enthusiasts, art lovers, and tech innovators\", however; hopefully, the reportedly upcoming new Leitz Phone will have a better shot one day.
