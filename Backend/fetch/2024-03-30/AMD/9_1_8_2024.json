    "text": "In addition to revealing the \u2018ultimate all-in-one desktop processor\u2019 at CES 2024, the chip designer claims in new tests that its recently launched Ryzen 8040 laptop CPUs provide faster AI processing capabilities than Intel\u2019s new Core Ultra processors.  AMD said it\u2019s beating Intel to market with the first dedicated AI engine for desktop PCs by way of its forthcoming Ryzen 8000G processors among other chips revealed at CES 2024. The Santa Clara, Calif.-based company said that two of the four Ryzen 8000G processors will feature a neural processing unit (NPU) to \u201caccelerate AI software capabilities\u201d as part of a wider effort by chip designers, OEMs, ISVs and operating system vendors to enable a new category of computers called AI PCs, as CRN reported for AI PC Week in December. [Related: AMD\u2019s David McAfee On Why AI PCs Are \u2018Here To Stay\u2019 And Why ISVs Will Flock To The NPU] This is the same kind of NPU that goes inside AMD\u2019s Ryzen 7040 and Ryzen 8040 laptop processors, the latter of which launched last month and will go inside upcoming notebooks from HP Inc., Lenovo, Acer, Razer and Asus, the company said at CES Monday. The company said the Ryzen 8040 series provides faster AI processing capabilities than Intel\u2019s new Core Ultra processors, which also feature an NPU, based on internal tests. Intel\u2019s x86 CPU rival also revealed four new desktop processors in its four-year-old Ryzen 5000 series, which the company said extends the \u201cunprecedented longevity\u201d of the AM4 platform that debuted in 2016, a year before the Ryzen brand arrived. In addition to each processor featuring an NPU for AI workloads, the Ryzen 8000G CPUs come with the \u201cworld\u2019s most powerful built-in graphics,\u201d according to AMD. The inclusion of a dedicated AI engine and powerful integrated graphics, combined with up to eight cores and a 5.1GHz boost frequency, is why the chip designer is calling the Ryzen 8000G series the \u201cultimate all-in-one desktop processor.\u201d The CPU in the Ryzen 8000G series is based on AMD\u2019s Zen 4 architecture while the GPU is based on its RDNA 3 architecture and the NPU is based on the XDNA architecture. Combined, they provide a total of up 39 teraflops of processing power for AI workloads, AMD said. With each processor sporting a 65-watt thermal design power, the series is \u201coptimized for efficiency with lower power draw but doesn\u2019t sacrifice performance or responsiveness,\u201d AMD said. The chips are geared toward gamers and content creators, particularly those who don\u2019t want to pay for a discrete graphics card at first, saving them a few hundred dollars on a PC. Across several popular games, including \u201cCyberpunk 2077\u201d and \u201cGrand Theft Auto 5,\u201d AMD showed that the flagship Ryzen 8700G can provide more than 60 frames per second on average at a 1,080p resolution with low settings. The company said the Ryzen 8700G can provide similar or better gaming performance than an Intel Core i5-13400F paired with an Nvidia GeForce 1650, which, as of Jan. 3, cost roughly $70 more than the recommended pricing for AMD\u2019s new processor. AMD said that the Ryzen 8700G can also outperform an Intel Core i5-13400F paired with an Nvidia GeForce 1650 across several productivity benchmarks, ranging from a 10 percent boost for the 3dMark Phyics test to a 4.6X boost for the LAME MP3 encoding test. The company is also releasing four new desktop processors that will extend the life of the Ryzen 5000 series as well as the AM4 platform that debuted in 2016. The extended lineup includes the Ryzen 7 5700X3D, which uses AMD\u2019s 3-D chip packaging technology to increase its cache by five times to 100 MB. The company said this major cache expansion over a regular chip can provide a \u201cmassive boost in gaming performance.\u201d Like other chips in the lineup, the new Ryzen 5000 processors are based on the Zen 3 architecture, which the company debuted in 2020. They also support motherboards based on the same AM4 platform, giving channel partners with customers of older AM4-based computers an opportunity to upgrade their CPU. Unlike the Ryzen 8000G processors, the new Ryzen 5000 chips do not include an NPU. AMD said its recently launched Ryzen 8040 processors run AI workloads with their NPU and GPU faster than Intel\u2019s Core Ultra chips, which also arrived last month. In the realm of computer vision models that benefit from the NPU, AMD said its Ryzen 7 8840U processor is 4 percent faster on the MobileNetv3 model, 17 percent faster on the ESRGAN model, 43 percent faster on the Yolov8 model and 79 percent faster on the Deeplabv3 in comparison to Intel\u2019s Core Ultra 7 155H. As for AI-powered content creation workloads that benefit from the GPU, AMD said the same chip is 6 percent faster on the Stable Diffusion 1.5 model, 44 percent faster on the Procyon AI Bench test using the Float32 numerical format, 61 percent faster on Procyon AI Bench using Float16 and 85 percent faster on DaVinci Resolve HD to UHD video upscaling feature. AMD said the Ryzen 7 8840U is also faster than the Core Ultra 7 155H across several popular games, from a 2 percent boost for \u201cLeague of Legends\u201d to a 60 percent boost for \u201cFar Cry 6,\u201d as well as several standard benchmarks, from a 14 percent boost for the Puget Premiere Pro video editing benchmark to a 52 percent boost for the LAME MP3 encoding benchmark. For the Procyon Office Productivity benchmark suite, the processor is 76 percent faster than the competition while providing 81 percent higher performance per watt, the company added. "
