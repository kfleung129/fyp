    "text": "According to sources, AMD's upcoming Radeon RX 7600 XT graphics card may feature twice the VRAM as the current RX 7600 models. The latest graphics cards from AMD may feature 16GB of VRAM, according to sources that cited a recent SKU listing that made the rounds on social media. The listing stated that a version of the rumored Radeon RX 7600 XT graphics card, which has yet to be officially revealed by AMD at the time of writing, would be the one to receive this upgrade. In late December 2023, some SKU filings made the rounds on social media about AMD's graphics cards that could be in the works. In these filings, a China-based manufacturer called Artek was slated to be working on the Radeon RX 7600 XT, as well as non-XT versions of the RX 7700 and RX 7800 cards. Months prior, some 10GB and 12GB versions of the Radeon RX 7600 XT were filed but have yet to be manufactured in full. While it is unclear if AMD or its manufacturing partners will bring these graphics cards to the market, the fact that the tech giant has listed more potential midrange GPUs is something that PC builders may consider in 2024. Though all rumors should be taken with a pinch of salt, another late December listing may shed some light on them. In a posting to the Eurasian Economic Commission (EEC), peripheral manufacturer Gigabyte has filed SKU listings for the Radeon RX 7600 XT that include 16GB of VRAM. That is double the amount found in the RX 7600 GPU, which is targeted at budget-conscious PC gamers looking to play at a resolution of 1080p. Known for making motherboards and other peripherals under the Gigabyte Gaming X and Aorus brands, the Taiwan-based manufacturer has listed both a standard and an overclocked version of the Radeon RX 7600 XT in the EEC filing they made at the end of 2023. Some social media users pointed out the similarities between the Radeon RX 7600 XT and Nvidia's RTX 4060 Ti, which has both 8GB and 16GB SKUs. The latter version of the RTX 4060 Ti was discounted by Nvidia shortly after its release following a lukewarm reception from consumers who criticized its limited memory bandwidth despite its VRAM capacity. The memory bandwidth of the 7600 XT was not listed in Gigabyte's filing. Considering that the Radeon RX 7600 has sold for prices starting at $269, it stands to reason that the Radeon RX 7600 XT could target a similar price range. Should the 7600 XT reach the hands of consumers in 2024, it has the potential to be one of the top AMD cards for buyers to consider. The\u00a0Gigabyte Radeon RX 7600 Gaming OC is a triple-fan dual-slot graphics card that brings Gigabyte's effective WINDFORCE cooling technology. It has three 80mm fans with alternate spinning that work alongside the five composite copper heat pipes that directly touch the GPU. The GPU uses the highest-grade metal chokes, 2oz copper PCB, lower ESR solid capacitors, and lower RDS(on) MOSFETs, among other features. The\u00a0GIGABYTE Radeon RX 7700 XT GAMING OC 12G graphics card is a mid-tier offering in the Radeon 7000 series. Based on the Navi 32 platform, the graphics card comes with a boost clock speed of up to 2599 MHz and a game clock speed of up to 2276 MHz. The GIGABYTE Radeon RX 7700 XT GAMING OC 12G comes with a triple-fan cooler design, two 8-pin connectors, two DisplayPort 2.1, and two HDMI 2.1 ports.
