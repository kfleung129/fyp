    "text": "The Intel\u00a0Pentium 8505\u00a0is an entry-level mobile CPU for thin and light laptops based on the Alder Lake architecture. It was announced in early 2022 and offers one performance core (P-cores, Golden Cove architecture) and 4 efficient cores (E-cores, Gracemont architecture). The P-cores support Hyper-Threading leading to 6 supported threads when combined with the E-cores. The clock rate ranges from 1.2 to 4.4 GHz on the performance cluster and 0.9 to 3.3 GHz on the efficient cluster. The performance of the E-cores should be similar to old Skylake cores (compare to the Core i7-6700HQ). All cores can use up to 8 MB L3-cache. Compared to the faster Core i3-1215U, the Pentium offers one less P-core. \nPerformance \nThis is a fairly unpopular CPU, if the fact that we have not tested a single system built around it as of August 2023 is any indication. That said, we have tested a few systems featuring the Core i3-1215U, a chip with the same clock speeds and the same 4 E-cores but with 2 P-cores instead of 1. Based on that, expect the 8505 to be 10% to 20% behind the Ryzen 3 5300U and the Core i7-1185G7, as far as multi-thread benchmark scores are concerned. \nYour mileage may vary depending on how competent the cooling solution of your laptop is and how high the CPU power limits are. \nFeatures \nThe integrated memory controller supports various memory types up to DDR5-4800, DDR4-3200, LPDDR5-5200, and LPDDR4x-4267. The Thread Director (in hardware) can support the operating system to decide which thread to use on the performance or efficient cores for the best performance. For AI tasks, the CPU also integrates GNA 3.0\u00a0and DL Boost (via AVX2). Quick Sync in version 8 is the same as in the Rocket Lake CPUs and supports MPEG-2, AVC, VC-1 decode, JPEG, VP8 decode, VP9, HEVC, and AV1 decode in hardware. The CPU only supports PCIe 4.0 (x8 for a GPU and two x4 for SSDs). \nThe integrated graphics adapter is based on the Xe-architecture and offers 48 of the 96 EUs (Execution Units) operating at up to 1.1 GHz. \nPower consumption \nThe Pentium has a Base power consumption of 15 W, with 55 W being its maximum Intel-recommended Turbo power consumption. These values are fairly high; passive cooling solutions aren't really an option here. \nThe CPU is built with Intel's 3rd generation 10 nm process marketed as Intel 7 for decent, as of early 2023, energy efficiency.

The AMD Ryzen 5 5625C is a processor for Chromebooks based on the Cezanne generation. It is part of the \"Barcelo\" refresh in 2022 and offers 100 MHz higher boost clock for the CPU cores compared to the old Ryzen 5 5600U. The R5 5625C integrates six of the eight cores based on the Zen 3 microarchitecture and is the second fastest C-series processor at launch. The cores are clocked at 2.3 (guaranteed base clock) to 4.3 GHz (Turbo) and support SMT for a total of 12 threads. The chip is manufactured on the modern 7 nm TSMC process. \nThe performance of the Ryzen 5 5625C should be only slightly above the\u00a0Ryzen 5 5600U\u00a0and clearly lower than the new Ryzen 5 6600U (Zen 3+, 4.5 GHz). \nIn addition to the six CPU cores, the APU also integrates a Radeon RX Vega 7 integrated graphics card with 7 CUs at up to 1800 MHz. The dual channel memory controller supports DDR4-3200 and energy efficient LPDDR4-4266 RAM. Furthermore, 16 MB level 3 cache (up from 8 MB at the 4800U) can be found on the chip. \nThe TDP of the APU is specified at 15 Watt (default) and can be configured from 10 to 25 Watt by the laptop vendor (most chips are configured higher than 15 Watt). That means the chip is intended for thin and light laptops (but with fans). The AMD Ryzen 5 5625C is a processor for Chromebooks based on the Cezanne generation.

It is part of the second \"Barcelo\" refresh in early 2023 and offers 200 MHz higher clocked boost clock speed, but lower base clock speed compared to the old Ryzen 3 5425U. The R3 7330U integrates four of the eight cores based on the Zen 3 microarchitecture and is the slowest U-series processor of the Barcelo refresh at launch. The cores are clocked at 2.3 (guaranteed base clock) to 4.3 GHz (single core boost) and support SMT / Hyperthreading (8 threads). The chip is manufactured in 7 nm at TSMC. \nThe performance of the CPU part should be slightly better than the old Ryzen 3 5425U in the entry level.\u00a0 \nIn addition to the four CPU cores, the APU also integrates a Radeon RX Vega 6 integrated graphics card (called Radeon Graphics) with 6 CUs and up to 1800 MHz.

Furthermore, 8 MB level 3 cache (same as the old 4800U) can be found on the chip. \nPower consumption \nThis Ryzen 3 has a default TDP (also known as the long-term power limit) of 15 W and therefore also suited for thin and light laptops.
