The 3rd gen Ryzen lineup of CPUs brings multithreaded performance and high single-core clock speeds, unlocked motherboards and CPUs, high-quality cooling solutions out of the box, and overall better value. When you\u2019re shopping for a motherboard that\u2019s going to run high-frequency RAM and plan on overclocking your processor, it\u2019s important to shop for high-quality products. Good, gaming-designated motherboards have better power delivery, providing XMP profiles for your RAM (a technology which allows you to run your RAM at high frequencies with a few clicks), and allowing you to reach good, stable overclocks on your CPU and GPU. Ryzen\u2019s success wasn\u2019t a secret, yet until Gen 3 processors were launched, Intel still had superiority when it came to high-end, enthusiast-oriented products. The Ryzen 3000 series addressed these issues, AMD outperforms Intel\u2019s CPUs in both single and multicore tasks on both low and high-end chips. That being said, the only thing that\u2019s keeping you from switching your CPUs is your motherboard. While the aesthetic is a bit eccentric if you\u2019re going for the clean, business look, you should know that gaming-branded components are built using better materials and have more safety and utility features included, giving you a better user experience. Check price on Amazon MSI is a big name in the gaming industry. Their product line features motherboards with solid power delivery, a great industrial design with the Carbon series, GPUs with beefy heatsinks, copper tubing, and reliable fans, and more. With so much experience in the PC component segment, they\u2019re bound to manufacture high-quality motherboards. The MSI X570 Ace is a great choice for any PC enthusiast. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re planning on building a powerful battleship for dominating your online foes or you\u2019re speccing out a new workstation, the Ace motherboard has you covered. With 4 DIMMs, the Ace can house up to 128 GB of RAM, running at frequencies as high as 4600 MHz. The MSI Click Bios 5 allows you to configure your XMP profiles, ensuring that your RAM is stable and overclocked, gives you full command over the RGB lighting, gives you real-time info about your storage and fans, and allows you to configure all of these things with just a few clicks. You also have a flashback button on the back, ensuring that your motherboard doesn\u2019t get bricked when trying to update your BIOS. With support for both 2nd and 3rd generation Ryzen processors, it makes sense to buy this board no matter what AM4 CPU you\u2019re buying. The overall build quality is stellar, and as you can surmise from the feature section, it has a fully-fledged and plenty of expansion capabilities. The 2.5 Gbps LAN port and the high-speed Wifi give you access to ultra-high-speed internet, something you\u2019ll need to fill up your PCIe 4.0 M.2 SSDs. With support for both Crossfire and SLI, multi-GPU builds are possible and encouraged. Overclocking is also encouraged, the motherboard having good cooling solutions built-in, strong and stable power delivery, features that will get you on the leaderboards in any benchmarking software. With a black and gold finish, RGB lighting and support for MSI Mystic Light, the MEG X570 Ace motherboard can make your PC into a work of art. Pick out the right fans and peripherals and build a no-compromise build. What\u2019s stopping you? Check price on amazon From gaming laptops and desktops to high-quality video cards, ASUS has a reputation in the industry for producing sturdy and reliable systems and components. Their ROG brand is particularly known in the industry for its gaming-oriented marketing, aesthetic, and overall solid build quality. The ROG Crosshair Hero VIII is the latest iteration of the Republic of Gamers, gaming-oriented motherboards. This board is what a no-compromise mobo should look like: great-looking, fully-fledged powerhouse. USB Gen 2 Type C? You got it. High-speed LAN and WiFi? Sure! PCIe 4.0? No problem! It\u2019s kinda crazy if you think about it. Alright, so by now you can figure out that the ASUS ROG Crosshair Hero VIII is the real deal. It has the features, it\u2019s got the VRM, it\u2019s got the bling, it\u2019s staying. With PCIe 4.0 M.2 slots, high-speed LAN with surge protection, and a rear IO that would put any other motherboard to shame, it\u2019s easy to see why this is ASUS\u2019s flagship model. That being said, are you really going to use all 7 USB 3.2 Type-A ports? Are you really going to use that 3-way Crossfire? No, probably not. The only thing that\u2019s bad about this motherboard is that it doesn\u2019t know where it fits. You can pay the premium and go for a no-compromise build if money isn\u2019t an issue, but you\u2019ll rarely make use of all the available features. check price on amazon The Gaming Pro Carbon provides the user with a cool aesthetic, built-in wireless, and a robust build quality. Why\u2019s that important, you ask? Well, if you\u2019re planning on going 3rd Gen Ryzen, then you should know the switch is synonymous with overclocking. 3rd Gen Ryzen brings almost a full gigahertz over the previous generation of processors, higher clock speeds, and better-overclocking capabilities. The MPG X570 Gaming Pro Carbon has a decent VRM, meaning that it will keep more stable voltages when overclocking, ensuring that your components last longer and perform better. Overall, we think that the MPG X570 Gaming Pro Carbon Wifi is a solid choice. Good overclocking capabilities, good IO, solid materials, it\u2019s a no-brainer. check price on amazon TUF \u2013 The ultimate Force \u2013 ASUS\u2019s statement that nobody else on the market can produce a product as close to perfection as this one. How has their statement held up so far? Well, in all honesty, pretty well. The ASUS TUF GAMING X570-PLUS doesn\u2019t have the most attractive name for a motherboard, but what it lacks in musicality it makes up for in raw features. 2019 is the year of Ryzen 3000, and with a 3rd gen processors, users can reach 4400 MHz on their RAM and a whopping 64 Gbps transfer with PCIe 4.0 M.2 SSDs. A fine year for gamers. The ASUS TUF X570 motherboard features military-grade MOSFETs and capacitors, with 14 switches, giving you stable overclocking and long-term reliability. The heatsinks are also well-placed, all making a very cohesive motherboard. Now that we\u2019ve talked about hardware, the ASUS TUF X570 also comes with a lot of utility. The BIOS is easy to navigate, the RAM easy to overclock, and the board even comes with a BIOS flashback switch, in case you brick your motherboard during updates. In terms of aesthetics, it has some light RGB elements and an overall pleasing aesthetic. It\u2019s a pretty good board. Good job, ASUS. Unlike the ROG CrossHair Hero VIII, the TUF is really easy to use to its full potential. check price on amazon The MSI MPG X570 Gaming Plus is a good board in its own way. It\u2019s not pretentious, it has a few solid features, and it performs as you\u2019d expect. It\u2019d be a waste to talk extensively about the MPG X570, since it doesn\u2019t really have a ton of features. First off, the VRM isn\u2019t great. There aren\u2019t many switches, and the ones that are present aren\u2019t very high-quality. That doesn\u2019t mean that the motherboard is bad, it just means that overclocking to high frequencies will likely be hard, but we don\u2019t recommend pairing this with a high-end processor anyway. The I/O is good enough, with the lack of extra Gen 2 connectors being disappointing. To add insult to injury, MSI also added two USB 2.0 ports on the rear IO, something that\u2019s kind of obsolete in 2019. While it doesn\u2019t have the best features, it does feature two M.2 slots, PCIe 4.0, so it\u2019s going to get the job done. The only real drawback that this board has is the lacking IO and the average power delivery. Otherwise, it\u2019s fine for your run-of-the-mill PC. It\u2019s really hard to pick a favorite. This particular lineup of motherboards is very impressive, all of them being well-built and feature-packed, two essential qualities in a great motherboard. With plenty of ports and connectors, Flashback technologies, beefy heatsinks and well-designed VRMs, each and every one of these boards will enable you to overclock your RAM, CPU, and GPU with stable and reliable power delivery. In terms of features, you have RGB-sync software, WiFi, high-speed ethernet, you name it. All in all, it all boils down to which one will serve you best, and in our opinion, that\u2019s the TUF Gaming X570-PLUS. The great build-quality, complete feature set, and clean aesthetic make it a great choice for anyone who is building a gaming or productivity station. The superb VRM allows the user to overclock it to high frequencies and reach stable clocks easier. With this board and a water cooler, you\u2019re going to be ripping through the Cinebench leaderboards with ease.  Andrew is one of three co-founders of BGFG, the parent company of PC Guide.
