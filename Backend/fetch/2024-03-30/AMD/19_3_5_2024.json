    "text": "Gigabyte is one of the most reliable vendors when it comes to motherboards. These motherboards offer unparalleled features for every dollar spent. A motherboard can be likened to what is essentially the nervous system of a computer. It allows for connectivity between components and a variety of input and output devices, while allowing the sum of all parts to behave as what we now call the modern personal computer, or PC. Unlike previous times, when it was a more primitive interface between the sum of the parts it connected, modern motherboards pack features that can be leveraged to offer significant performance upgrades to enable better user experiences, offering future-proofing down the road as modern CPU sockets continue to mature. One of the major players in the motherboard industry is Gigabyte, which pushes towards a more value-centric approach to PC hardware, often offering features normally reserved for higher-end motherboards and peripherals in relatively budget-centric offerings. In the last decade, Gigabyte has gone from strength to strength, establishing itself as a great alternative for both aesthetic upgrades and powerful, yet well-priced internals as it competes with other Taiwan-based motherboard manufacturers across Intel and AMD platforms. The Gigabyte Z790 Aorus Master offers excellent I/O options, a well-designed VRM configuration (20+1+2) to support the demands of even the most taxing Intel Core i9 CPUs, and throws in plenty of USB ports into the mix to ensure PC gamers and enthusiasts alike are well-accounted for.With built-in support for Wi-Fi 6E, BT 5.3, and 10GB of Ethernet in play, the Z790 Aorus Master delivers extensively on connectivity even as it trades at a sizeable discount in 2024, making it an excellent alternative to most of its pricier siblings that accompanied Intel's 14th generation Raptor Lake Refresh CPUs. For the current generation of Intel Raptor Lake and its Refresh lineup, the Z790 Aorus Master offers almost everything for unmatched functionality and is one of the best motherboards to use with i9 14900K. With significantly better power delivery than most of its peers that compete in the same price bracket in addition to solid connectivity under the hood, the Aorus Master aims to deliver everything that one could need to build a high-end Intel-based PC in 2024. For overclockers and system tweakers, the Z790 Aorus Master offers plenty of leeway when it comes to performance. Gigabyte states that the motherboard can handle DDR5 RAM at clocks of up to 8000 MHz with ease when running them overclocked, even as the chipset allows for PCI-E 5.0 connectivity (albeit with shared bandwidth) via the CPU to both the GPU and a single M2 drive on its primary slot. It does offer a total of five PCI-E NVMe slots, making life easier for productivity users alongside support for both ECC and non-ECC RAM modules in a variety of configurations, making it a relatively appealing option compared to some of its more budget-centric peers. At the same time, given the price cuts on the Z790 Aorus Master X (which now trades at the same price as its 13th generation sibling above) users might want to grab Gigabyte's newer motherboard to benefit from both Wi-Fi 7 connectivity and better DDR5 overclocking support out of the box. Those looking for a motherboard that isn't extremely overpriced but should be able to pull all the functionalities within a fair budget should look no further than the Z790 Gaming X AX.With inbuilt WiFi connectivity, decent power delivery and plenty of connectors/slots, this motherboard is ready to uplift gaming performance. The availability of a Q-Flash button and Debug LEDs, this is going to do great with mid-range Intel CPUs. The Z790 Gaming X AX is Game Rant's pick for the best budget Intel gaming motherboard from Gigabyte. It comes ready out of the box with support for Intel's latest unlocked 14 series CPUs such as the 14700K and the 14900K. It comes with decent power delivery that should allow it to handle Intel's higher-end CPUs with decent tweaking functionality in tow. The board still looks great with the grayish-white accents on the heatsinks, even though it skips RGB lighting on-site, reserving that for Gigabyte's higher-end offerings. However, users are given both a singular RGB and an ARGB header, should they wish to connect motherboard-controlled lighting. For connectivity, Gigabyte offers a mix of USB 3, USB 2.0/1.1 ports, and a single Type-C port that can do up to 20GBPS. More connectivity is available to users via internal headers but will require a supporting case to utilize. For users on a budget, the Z790 Gaming X AX packs an impressive amount of value in a very small package, making it a great alternative to some of its more expensive options, many of which charge a significantly higher premium for similar functionality. The B760M DS3H AX is adequate for budget-centric who are looking for a feature-packed board for their Intel CPUs. Without compromising on functionality, the board offers multiple ports and slots for expansion while providing an appealing look with minimal accents on the PCB and heatsinks. Moreover, the built-in WiFi allows users to access wireless networks without investing in an adapter. Not everyone needs to have the Z790 chipset, which targets overclockers and enthusiasts. For users who boast a mid-range Intel Core processor, this budget gaming motherboard will be sufficient for most needs. With an entry-level digital VRM, limited PCI-E slots, and dual M.2 headers, it's ready to go on a mid-range or even a budget gaming machine. While it has limited support for on-board diagnosis thanks to a lack of debug LED offerings, users can utilize Gigabyte's Q-Flash utility to get the motherboard ready for newer 14th-generation Intel CPUs before assembling their PCs. There is also built-in Wi-Fi 6E support for wireless connectivity in addition to 2.5 gigabit ethernet in tow, making this an expensive, but functional choice for gamers and power users on a budget. Gigabyte's X670E Aorus Xtreme is Gigabyte's highest-end AMD motherboard, offering an X670E chipset with plenty of power, durability, and expansion potential.It offers an impressive 18+2+2 phase power delivery mechanism, Wi-Fi 6E, and 10 Gigabyte Ethernet in addition to dual PCI-E 5.0 M2 SSDs and a PCI-E 5.0 GPU.The motherboard packs plenty of on-board features and throws in large VRM heatsinks, plenty of USB ports and expansion headers as well as RGB lighting built onto the board. AMD's higher-end Ryzen 7000 series CPUs can pack a considerable punch as they throw 12 and 16-core configurations into the mix with higher clocks in play. This can result in overclockers often going for more demanding solutions from a variety of AIB manufacturers to meet their performance needs. The X670E Aorus Xtreme is Gigabyte's take on what a premium solution to AMD's highest-end CPU needs should be, without compromising on aesthetic and utility. It offers a significantly powerful 18+2+2 phase power delivery mechanism that allows tweakers and overclockers to easily push both their CPUs and RAM to higher limits. On the connectivity front, Gigabyte offers excellent Wi-Fi 6E and 10 gigabit ethernet support, adding plenty of PCI-E slots and USB ports into the mix. At the same time, the Gigabyte X670E Aorus Xtreme continues to trade at MSRP currently, making it a relatively costly purchase in 2024. In addition to this, users do claim to have stability issues when pushing clocks higher, some of which have been mitigated thanks to BIOS updates while others continue to make the X670E a good, but not great, offering for gamers in 2024. From several sub $300 boards, only the B650 Aorus Elite AX provides the most value for money. With an identical board layout to some pricier options , this comes with a satisfactory VRM, built-in Wifi, crazy good support for highly clocked memories, several onboard features, and a dozen USB ports at the I/O. For users looking to max out the potential of mid-range CPUs like Ryzen 7600X, this one is a no-brainer. When addressing user needs without compromising on hardware significantly, reviewers can often be hard-pressed to make recommendations in a variety of budget segments. One of the rare cases that this was not an issue was when the team at Game Rant recommended the Gigabyte B650 Aorus Elite AX as the de facto best budget motherboard for AMD CPUs for its blend of features, performance, and value for money. It offers excellent networking, a capable power delivery mechanism, and widespread support for all AM5-based CPUs to date, including the newer Ryzen 7 8700G and Ryzen 5 8600G CPUs. It does, however, skimp on PCI-E 5.0 support for future GPU upgrades, but retains it for its primary M2 slot. Given that PCI-E 5.0 storage already exists and PCI-E 5.0 GPUs are a distant possibility, at least from mainstream manufacturers such as AMD and Nvidia, this seems to be a safe and well-founded play to make for most gamers and enthusiasts looking for an otherwise capable socket AM5 motherboard at just under $200. Form Factor: It is important to get a good idea of what case size users are attempting to pair with their motherboard in 2024. This allows users to purchase one that can fit in their chosen PC case. To help pick an adequate case, the team at Game Rant has a dedicated guide available. Power Delivery: Power delivery is a crucial factor for overclockers and power users aiming to push or use their high-end CPUs to the maximum. With certain CPUs already pushing past 300W (or even 400W under load) regularly in terms of power draw thanks to higher core counts and clocks, one should pick a motherboard with adequate VRMs and power delivery to avoid stability issues or throttling down the line. Slots/Headers: A good rule of thumb is to decide on components one wants to add to their gaming PC ahead of choosing the motherboard. This allows a user to be more aware of what fulfills their needs and/or if a particular motherboard has adequate slots or connectors on board to meet their needs. Onboard Features: While most onboard features such as Debug LEDs and LCD/OLED displays do help system builders debug and better understand how things work on their PC, others such as better VRM, improved SSD heatsinks, and better Wi-Fi connectivity can essentially drive a better experience for end users. I/O Panel: As mentioned above for slots and headers, the same applies to the USB ports and connectors on the other side of the motherboard that face the user once a PC is assembled. A good rule of thumb again is to have plenty of USB ports in play to avoid creating additional clutter thanks to a shortage of USB ports or other connectivity options.  At the moment, for Intel's 12th, 13th, and 14th gen processors, Gigabyte Z790 Aorus Master takes the crown for bringing solid features under $500. For the AMD Ryzen 7000 lineup, Gigabyte's X670 Aorus Xtreme is the one gamers should opt for. The overkill power delivery, components support, onboard features, and distinguished aesthetics, all make these boards a solid choice for Intel CPUs. Yes, they are! not only are they ideal for gaming, but they are also perfect for high-end productivity builds as they bring premium features on a budget.
