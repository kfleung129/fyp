    "text": "Advanced Micro Devices Inc.\u2019s stock is closing in on its record closing high amid a sharp Tuesday surge that reflects growing optimism for the company\u2019s opportunities in artificial intelligence. The stock \n        AMD,\n        +0.50%\n       is up more than 7% in midday action to a recent $157.67. That puts it less than 3% away from its all-time closing high of $161.91 achieved Nov. 29, 2021. AMD\u2019s Tuesday stock rally comes amid a broader gains for chip stocks, with the PHLX Semiconductor Index \n        SOX\n       up 1% despite a slightly negative day so far for the Nasdaq Composite Index. Shares of Nvidia Corp. \n        NVDA,\n        +0.12%\n       are up 2.8%, while shares of Micron Technology Inc. \n        MU,\n        -1.05%\n       are up 2.3%. Opinion:\u00a0How Nvidia and AI changed the landscape of the chip industry, as rivals must now play catch-up KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst John Vinh recently chimed in with upbeat commentary on AMD\u2019s server business, dramatically boosting his expectations for the company\u2019s MI300X accelerator for AI applications. \u201cWe are seeing a pretty significant increase in demand for AMD\u2019s MI300X suggesting that the software performance issues late last year have largely been resolved,\u201d he wrote in a Tuesday note to clients. Vinh thinks that Microsoft Corp. \n        MSFT,\n        -0.17%\n       will ramp its use of the MI300X graphics processing unit in the first quarter, while other customers such as Meta Platforms Inc. \n        META,\n        -1.68%\n       and Oracle Corp. \n        ORCL,\n        +0.27%\n       could follow. \u201cCurrently, we believe there\u2019s demand for [500,000] MI300X GPUs, which would represent ~$8B in data center GPU revenues in 2024, which is significantly higher than our prior expectations of $3B-$4B,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAdditionally, supply chain partners indicate that AMD has increased its CoWoS [Chip-on-Wafer-on-Substrate packaging] capacity and has the ability to support further upside if additional demand materializes.\u201d See also: If Nvidia looked more like Salesforce, it might unlock billions more in cash, analyst says Vinh sees 24% upside for AMD shares, having raised his price target to $195 from $170. Elsewhere in the chip sector, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. shares \n        TSM,\n        -0.47%\n       are advancing 0.5% in Tuesday\u2019s session, gains that come on the heels of ruling-party candidate Lai Ching-te\u2019s victory in Taiwan\u2019s presidential election. \u201cWhile this year\u2019s Taiwan election has been closely watched by global financial markets amid elevated geopolitical concerns, the outcome for [Democratic Progressive Party\u2019s] victory is in line with general expectations,\u201d JPMorgan analyst Grace Ng wrote in a note to clients. Walgreens\u2019 stock seesawed around the flatline Thursday, after the drugstore chain swung to a large quarterly net loss and trimmed its full-year outlook, but also reported the biggest beat for quarterly adjusted profit in at least five years.
