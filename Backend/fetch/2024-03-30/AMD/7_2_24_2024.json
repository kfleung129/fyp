    "text": "The Intel Core i5-13400 and Ryzen 5 5600 are budget last-gen processors designed for sub-$1,000 rigs. The chips can be easily powered with the latest graphics cards like the RTX 3070 and 4060 Ti without losing a ton of performance to bottlenecks. Given they have been replaced by newer alternatives, both chips have been handsomely discounted, making them lucrative options for the latest titles. Choosing between the i5-13400 and Ryzen 5 5600 can be difficult. To help you choose the best CPU without major difficulties, we will review the on-paper specs and performance of the chips in this article. The Intel Core i5-13400 and Ryzen 5 5600 are based on wildly different architectures. While the Team Blue chip is part of the Raptor Lake family and is based on the monolithic design, the Ryzen chip is based on the Zen 3 architecture and utilizes a chipset-based design. Let's review the specs of the two chips to see what they bring to the table. The 13400 is based on a hybrid design. It bundles six high-performance P-rated cores, and the rest are efficient E-rated. The Ryzen chip, on the other hand, packs six high-performance cores. Besides this, the two cores differ slightly in total cache size and operating clock speeds. The P cores of the 13400 clock 200 MHz faster than the Ryzen 5 5600. Here is a brief overview of the chips: Although both chips have been discounted following the launch of the new Raptor Lake Refresh and Ryzen 7000 lineups, the 5600 is currently the cheaper option, coming in at just $149 compared to the $200 i5-13400. The performance differences between the two chips can be the final answer for many. The Core i5-13400 is significantly faster than the Ryzen processor thanks to its extra cores and improved architecture. In both single and multi-core performance metrics, the processor wins as compared to Team Red's offering. This makes it the better choice for gaming and multi-core heavy workloads like video editing, rendering, etc. Benchmark scores of the two chips in some popular testing software are as follows: Although the Ryzen 5 5600 is slower, it is also worth noting that the processor is significantly cheaper. At about $150, it offers significant value for cash-strapped gamers. Therefore, if you don't have the extra budget, opt for the cheaper Ryzen processor. We recommend, however, to spend slightly extra cash and get the Intel chip if you have an extra $70-80 spare.
