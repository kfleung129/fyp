    "text": "Welcome to ParadiZe Mod, HDR, Ultrawide (21:9), Super Ultrawide (32:9), AMD FSR 3 & DLSS Support Details Welcome to ParadiZe is the latest title from developer Eko Software of Warhammer: Chaosbane fame. With Nacon as publisher, Welcome to ParadiZe got its official launch on February 29, 2024, and so far, the reception to the game has been pretty mixed. Much of the criticism seems to be directed towards the base building and other gameplay elements. However, some fans have found the game fun and really want to know whether the game can be played with mods, HDR, ultrawide, super ultrawide, AMD FSR 3, and DLSS. With Welcome to ParadiZe being such a fresh release, it was only evident that players would want to know everything about it, including whether it supports the aforementioned features. After all, if someone is going to spend money and hours on the game, they would prefer to know if it can be played with whatever features they want to use. So, what\u2019s the case with Welcome to ParadiZe? Does it support mods, HDR, ultrawide, super ultrawide, AMD FSR 3, and DLSS? Well, let\u2019s go ahead and find out. At the time of writing this, Welcome to ParadiZe doesn\u2019t have mod support. And that\u2019s to be expected. Welcome to ParadiZe is a fairly new release, and as such, it\u2019s unlikely that it will get mod support this soon. For now, you will have to enjoy the game as it is and hope Eko Software introduces mod support in the upcoming updates. And just like mods, Welcome to ParadiZe also doesn\u2019t have native HDR support. However, you can try using third-party tools like Special K\u00a0or\u00a0autohdr_force\u00a0or even Windows 11\u2019s Auto-HDR feature and see if any of them are of help. The disappointment train doesn\u2019t end here. There\u2019s also no ultrawide and super ultrawide support in the game right now, which means you will have to play the WtP with those thick black bars in 21:9 and 32:9 aspect ratios. So what about AMD FSR 3 and DLSS? Well, there\u2019s good news and bad news. The good news is that there\u2019s indeed an upscaling option in the game, but the bad news is that it isn\u2019t either AMD FSR 3 or DLSS. In fact, currently, there\u2019s only one upscaling option in Welcome to ParadiZe, and it\u2019s FSR 2.2. A lot of players have requested DLSS be added to the game, but the developers haven\u2019t shared any information or stated anything in relation to that. If WtP does get another upscaling option, we will be sure to update our readers on it. Well, that\u2019s all the information we have on this. Additionally, you can also take a quick look here if you want to know whether Guild Wars 2 also supports similar features like mods, HDR, ultrawide, super ultrawide, AMD FSR 3, and DLSS.
