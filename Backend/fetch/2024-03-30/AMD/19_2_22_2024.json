For workstation graphics performance, the 8500G/8600G were still delivering much better performance and value. When it comes to the AI benchmarks, they were all carried out with the CPU cores. The Raptor Lake Refresh processors do not sport any NPU while the Ryzen 8000G series has the Ryzen AI support but with the Linux driver only recently published and currently very limited scope of software support. With the OpenVINO performance the Core i5 14500 was leading in some of the benchmarks thanks to its 20 threads while in other cases the 8000G APUs with AVX-512 support were delivering better performance. The Ryzen 8500G/8600G were performing at the top in a number of the benchmarks while typically having lower power consumption than the Raptor Lake Refresh processors in these multi-threaded tests.
