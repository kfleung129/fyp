The company's stock saw a significant share price rise of 73% in the past couple of months on the NASDAQGS. The company is now trading at yearly-high levels following the recent surge in its share price. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock\u2019s share price. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Today we will analyse the most recent data on Advanced Micro Devices\u2019s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists. View our latest analysis for Advanced Micro Devices According to our valuation model, the stock is currently overvalued by about 24%, trading at US$203 compared to our intrinsic value of $163.65. This means that the opportunity to buy Advanced Micro Devices at a good price has disappeared! If you like the stock, you may want to keep an eye out for a potential price decline in the future. Since Advanced Micro Devices\u2019s share price is quite volatile, this could mean it can sink lower (or rise even further) in the future, giving us another chance to invest.

Future outlook is an important aspect when you\u2019re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it\u2019s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Advanced Micro Devices' earnings over the next few years are expected to double, indicating a very optimistic future ahead. This should lead to stronger cash flows, feeding into a higher share value. Are you a shareholder? AMD\u2019s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading above its fair value. However, this brings up another question \u2013 is now the right time to sell? If you believe AMD should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards its real value can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed. Are you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping tabs on AMD for some time, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its true value, which means there\u2019s no upside from mispricing.
