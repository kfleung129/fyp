    "text": "The best AM4 chips still make for a potent upgrade. It\u2019s been a whole lot of fun hearing about readers\u2019 CPU choices in this week\u2019s QOTW. Turns out a lot of folk put their faith in AMD\u2019s Ryzen 5000 Series, and with good reason. Despite the launch of a newer generation, AM4 chips continue to offer excellent performance and rock-solid reliability on a tried-and-trusted platform. Falling prices only enhance that appeal, and after last year\u2019s scorching-hot deals, we\u2019re now starting to find select CPUs are returning to must-have territory. AMD Ryzen 9 5950X \u201c16 Cores. 0 Compromises. One processor that can game as well as it creates.\u201d We earn a commission if you make a purchase, at no additional cost to you. The pick of the bunch naturally has to be former flagship, AMD Ryzen 9 5950X. Despite having launched back in 2020, the 16-core, 32-thread chip remains a powerhouse by any meaningful metric. It is no coincidence Club386 employs this very CPU in our present test rigs, which are still going strong. Better yet, while the all-conquering Ryzen originally fetched $799, it\u2019s now on offer at Amazon for an all-time-low of $365 while stocks last. Comfortably better than half price and outstanding bang for buck. UK pricing of \u00a3369 is nearly as good as it gets, too. AMD Ryzen 9 5900X \u201cAMD Ryzen 9 5900X series desktop processors come with 12 cores to power through gaming, streaming and more.\u201d We earn a commission if you make a purchase, at no additional cost to you. Tempted to jump on one last upgrade for your trusty AM4 machine? 5950X is the all-singing, all-dancing choice, yet it\u2019s worth pointing out Ryzen 9 5900X as an alternative. AMD\u2019s 12-core, 24-thread part is no slouch and has dropped to \u00a3260 in the UK; that\u2019s very close to the lowest it has ever been. A worthy alternative to the popular 5800X3D, especially if you lean more towards productivity than gaming. Hard to argue with either choice and it\u2019s clear to see why AM4 remains such a strong proposition for DIY builders. Here\u2019s hoping AM5 longevity lives up to these lofty standards. We\u2019ll keep a close eye on any further CPU price drops in the months ahead, but don\u2019t expect Ryzen 5000 Series to go much lower.
