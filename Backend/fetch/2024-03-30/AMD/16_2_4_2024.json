    "text": "Chatreey has a new mini PC on offer with the AN2 Pro, which is being launched onto market at a relatively low price and supports the installation of multiple mass storage devices. The built-in processor is definitely not the latest, but the\u00a0AMD Ryzen 5 5625U is still a perfectly capable processor with six cores, which support the simultaneous processing of 12 threads. The installation of two DDR4 memory modules is possible, and the 114 x 106 millimeter and 52.4 millimeter high mini PC supports the use of up to 64 GB of RAM. Two M.2 slots are available for the installation of SSDs. Both the M.2 2280 and M.2 2242 slots are designed to allow data transfer via the NVMe protocol and therefore high-performance transfer of the stored data. The simultaneous connection of three monitors is possible. These monitors can be supplied with 4K material; in addition to HDMI, the AN2 Pro also has USB Type C, which supports image output via DisplayPort. There are also two USB 3.0 ports on the front of the PC, as well as two USB 2.0 ports, a jack socket and an Ethernet port on the rear. Power is supplied via a round plug and not via USB PD. WiFi 6 and Bluetooth 5 are supported. The AN2 Pro is currently priced at $185 for direct import as a barebone. This figure should include import taxes, but not the flat rate for expenses.
