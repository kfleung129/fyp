Prices subject to change.\u00a0Read More Last Updated on February 9, 2024 Originally priced at $449, the fast-processing AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D just received an even deeper price cut in China. Chinese retailer JD is currently offering the high-powered CPU as part of a bundle for as low as only $280! Of course, with the CPU market already being as competitive as it is, this latest discount begs the question: will worldwide pricing follow? Though local retailers have given no indication of emulating their Chinese counterparts (the same CPU is still priced at just below $400 on Amazon and Best Buy as of writing), it may not be long before they start offering similar discounts. After all, the Ryzen 7 7800X3D is already available for $370 on Microcenter. And with just a few more nudges (or one big shove), it\u2019ll be at the same price point or, at least, thereabouts. Now, you may be wondering why this is a big deal, considering the AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D had already reached similar prices through past deals. However, none of these previous discounts compare to Chinese retailer JD\u2019s ongoing promo. Their $280 bundle includes not only a Ryzen 7 7800X3D but also an ASUS B650M TUF gaming motherboard. If that\u2019s not good value, then we don\u2019t know what is. Before you head over to their product page, though, it\u2019s worth noting that the $280 price tag is only available if you get a box-less CPU. With the box, the bundle becomes significantly pricier at around $463. Box-less shipping hazards aside, this deal would still be difficult to pass up, especially since you practically get two parts for the price of one. Even at its typical price of $399.99, the Ryzen 7 7800X3D remains one of the most reliable and high-powered processors in the market. This rings especially true for avid gamers since it provides a stable average FPS when running CPU-intensive games. And with rare deals like JD\u2019s, its overall value undoubtedly makes it a must-have.  Nico is a Tech News Writer for PC Guide.
