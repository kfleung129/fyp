Last updated: January 6th, 2024 at 21:12 UTC+01:00 According to multiple leaks and rumors, AMD will announce the Ryzen 8000G series APU models at CES 2024. While there are only a few days for the event to kick off, one of the models in the lineup, the AMD Ryzen 5 8600G, has been spotted on Geekbench, which not only reveals its key specifications but also shows that its graphics performance can even beat one of the world\u2019s most popular graphics card. The benchmarking listing reveals that the 8600G has six CPU cores with a base frequency of 4.35GHz and the Radeon 760M GPU. With that, it has scored 30,770 points in Vulkan. In comparison, the Nvidia GTX 1060, which is the third most-used graphics card at the moment globally according to Steam, scored 30,186 points. It means that the Radeon 760M is slightly more powerful than the GTX 1060, at least in this scenario.  In OpenCL, however, the Radeon 760M couldn\u2019t quite match the performance of the GTX 1060. Here, the one from AMD scored 20,358 points and that from Nvidia achieved 34,507 points. Nonetheless, it shows that integrated graphics have come very far and they can now compete with discrete graphics cards, even if it is a seven-year-old mid-range model. It also shows that discrete graphics cards hold their ground very well.
