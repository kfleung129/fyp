    "text": "Fans have been waiting for Dragon\u2019s Dogma 2 for over a decade, but after finally getting their hands on it, they\u2019re suffering from issues that cause the game to crash. Here\u2019s how to fix CTD errors in DD2. There\u2019s nothing more frustrating than buying a new game, downloading it, opening it for the first time, and seeing it crash when you try to play. Unfortunately, that\u2019s what\u2019s happening for some Dragon\u2019s Dogma 2 players, and these performance issues have left them furious. If you are struggling, here are some helpful suggestions from Capcom that you can try to stop the crashes from happening. One of the first things you should try is updating your graphics card. Old drivers may not be compatible with the game or may limit performance. To update your driver: If a file has become corrupted during installation, you\u2019ll need to verify the game files in Steam to repair it. Steam will then scan every file in your download and redownload any that have been corrupted. It can also be worth running the game as an Administrator on Windows PCs because sometimes the game will not run if the account does not have that power. To do this: If nothing works, it\u2019s worth checking that your PC meets the recommended specs to run Dragon\u2019s Dogma 2. We have included the minimum and recommended specs below.
