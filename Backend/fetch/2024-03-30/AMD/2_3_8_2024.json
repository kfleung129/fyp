    "text": "The Thaumaturge Mod, HDR, Ultrawide (21:9), Super Ultrawide (32:9), AMD FSR 3 & DLSS Support Details March 2024 is already looking to be a great month for video games thanks to upcoming and already released titles like Unicorn Overlord, Dragon\u2019s Dogma: 2, Rise of the Ronin, and the subject of this article: The Thaumaturge. Developed by Fool\u2019s Theory, the Polish studio behind the upcoming The Witcher Remake, The Thaumaturge is a story-driven RPG set in early 20th-century Warsaw, where the world is filled with strange creatures called Salutors. You will be playing as Wiktor Szulski, a thaumaturge who possesses the ability to tame salutors. There are a lot of secrets to be discovered, powers to be gained, and a fun experience to be had. But before that, it seems like a lot of players want to know whether the game supports modding, HDR, ultrawide, super ultrawide, AMD FSR 3, and DLSS. For some, having beforehand knowledge of these types of things is preferable. After all, if someone is going to drop money and spend multiple hours on a game, then it\u2019s only evident that they would want to know whether the game has support for features they want to play the game with. So, does The Thaumaturge support modding, HDR, ultrawide, super ultrawide, AMD FSR3, and DLSS? Well, let\u2019s go ahead and find out. At the time of publishing this, there\u2019s no official mod support available for The Thaumaturge. Certainly, it is disappointing news but an understandable one since the game was just released. And even if the developers don\u2019t add mod support, we believe that players will be perfectly able to mod the game since it happens to be a single-player title. And like mod support, the game also doesn\u2019t have native HDR. But if you want, you can use Windows\u2019s Auto-HDR feature or tools like Special K\u00a0or\u00a0autohdr_force. On the other hand, if you really want to use native HDR, then you will need to wait for the developers to add it to the game. As for ultrawide and super ultrawide, publisher 11 Bit Studios has stated in the\u00a0FAQ that The Thaumaturge supports both. However, do note that during cutscenes, the screen will switch to a 16:9 aspect ratio. The developers are aware of this and have clarified that \u201cThey are there by design and currently there\u2019s no way to disable them\u201d. And at last, we come to the topic of AMD FSR 3 and DLSS support. Well, players should be happy to know that The Thaumaturge has native support for both DLSS (DLSS 3, to be specific) and AMD FSR 3. Not only that, it\u2019s also got Frame Generation in the settings. The game doesn\u2019t even have that much of a high-end system requirement in the first place. However, it\u2019s great to see that the developers have added both DLSS 3 and FSR 3 in the game, giving players more options to choose from. Well, that\u2019s all the information we have on this right now. You can also take a quick look here if you want to know whether Secrets of Grindea also supports the same features.
