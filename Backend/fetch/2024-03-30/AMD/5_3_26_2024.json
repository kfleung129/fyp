    "text": "We all know how important streaming has become to the gaming industry, in fact, live streaming platforms like Twitch are estimated to generate 355 billion minutes of content watched per day. As a cornerstone of the community, we felt it was important to discuss some of the behind-the-scenes mechanics of streaming and what you might need to join in on the fun. Well, as some of you will know, behind every great stream is a strong and fast graphics card. Luckily, we\u2019ve compiled our top picks below to find the best GPU for streaming in 2024. Let\u2019s dive in.  To select the best GPUs for streaming, we dive head-first into several important areas that require careful consideration. Firstly, we took into consideration our own reviews for each product in our line-up, meaning that each pick is authentic and reliable. Each review includes key specs, performance benchmarks, and price awareness. Secondly, we considered the wide range of needs and restrictions on streamers; these include stream quality and budget. Therefore, we picked a wide range of GPUs that encompass a variety of stream qualities and budgets \u2013 not just the four most powerful and high-end picks. Finally, we also looked at third-party reviews, public reception, and user reviews to determine which products are actually worth the money. It can be difficult to cut through all the noise when a new graphics card drops so picking the right one is essential. If you want to find our top overall graphics card pick for this year, be sure to look at our best graphics card buying guide.    Our top pick for the best GPU for streaming is the Nvidia RTX 4090. We will start by disclosing that this graphics card is on the high-end scale of GPUs and will deliver the best quality streaming performance on the market right now. The ASUS ROG Strix Nvidia RTX 4090 OC boasts cutting-edge features like DLSS3 for improved visuals, the efficient Ada Lovelace architecture, and full ray tracing for realistic lighting effects. The 4th generation Tensor cores deliver up to 4 times faster performance with DLSS3 compared to traditional rendering, while the 3rd generation RT cores double the speed of ray tracing. In terms of streaming, the Nvidia RTX 4090 can handle fast-paced gameplay and video output \u2013 making the entire process appear seamless and easy. For additional information on this model, be sure to check out our Nvidia RTX 4090 review. While this product remains the best in terms of performance and quality, the price of this GPU will take it out of the range of budget-conscious users. Furthermore, while its 4K performance is unmatched, many streamers who are satisfied with 1080p resolutions, will find this GPU to be overkill.   Much like its successor, the RTX 4070 graphics card offers a full range of the latest Nvidia tech. DLSS3, Ada Lovelace architecture, and full ray tracing deliver stunning visuals. The 4th gen Tensor Cores boost performance by up to 4 times with DLSS3, while 3rd gen RT Cores double the speed of ray tracing. Meanwhile, with clock speeds reaching 2505 MHz, smooth gameplay is albeit ensured. However, what truly separates this product from the RTX 4090 is its value for money. While not reaching the absolute peak performance of high-end models, this mid-range GPU will easily handle 1080p streaming, a streaming resolution that is the norm amongst most streamers on Twitch. While professional streamers may opt for high-end and max performance, we understand that expectation is not realistic for most users. Interested in finding out more? We have a dedicated Nvidia RTX 4070 review available now. However, those looking to push their streams to the visual peak may desire something a little more powerful and new to the market. In contrast, entry-level streamers may find that the RTX 4070 provides too big of a leap in terms of quality and price than may be necessary.   The RTX 3060 strikes a perfect balance for entry-level gamers. While handling lower resolutions with ease it is also able to handle most modern games at 1080p resolution \u2013 giving entry-level users a taste of what\u2019s to come when upgrading their streaming platform. With smooth frame rates and impressive visuals, entry-level streamers can showcase their gameplay live with no problem. This is especially attractive for those building their first gaming PC, as the RTX 3060 offers excellent performance without breaking the bank. Beyond just raw power, the RTX 3060 boasts features like DLSS, which uses AI to boost frame rates without sacrificing image quality, and NVENC, a hardware encoder that enables smooth 720p streaming. With all this packed into a reasonable price tag, the RTX 3060 is a compelling option for those entering the exciting world of PC gaming.   Our final pick for the best GPU for streaming is the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX. The RX 7900 XTX is another high-end pick and the best offer from AMD. This model offers exceptional specs and performance benchmarks, receiving critical praise from nearly all publications. To see our glowing take on this product, be sure to check out our AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX review. The AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX comes with a standard set of features regardless of the specific version you choose. This includes 24GB of GDDR6 memory and a high base clock speed for strong performance. Some versions offer overclocking capabilities that can push the boost clock even higher than the base of 2498 MHz. In a similar vein to the RTX 4090, the RX 7900 XTX is very much top of the range for streaming. If you are an entry-level streamer or a budget-conscious consumer then we would recommend a mid-range pick that should satisfy your needs sufficiently. Otherwise, you will find this product to be overkill and overpriced for what you need,   When considering a GPU for streaming, it is first important to decide which level of streaming you wish to participate in. As far as we are concerned, there are three levels to streaming content; lower resolution, 1080p/high quality, and 4K. Your GPU choice will depend heavily on this decision. As part of our guide, we have made sure to separate our choices to cover these categories in order to cater to a range of needs. If it is your first time attempting a live stream, you may not be aware of what software and hardware encoding is. Encoders are pretty essential, because if you don\u2019t have one then, unfortunately, you aren\u2019t streaming correctly. In short, encoders take raw analog or digital video and compress it into formats that a broadcastable. Although some streaming sites like Facebook Live provide their encoders, if you want to stream directly from your device then an encoder is a must. Software encoders are programs you install and run on your computer or laptop that capture both video and audio. Additionally, they tend to rely on your CPU, so a powerful CPU is needed alongside a decent GPU. \u00a0Hardware encoders are pieces of equipment where encoding is their sole purpose. This uses the GPU\u2019s dedicated encoder, freeing up CPU resources for the game. Look for NVENC for Nvidia and AMF for AMD. Some of the most popular encoder software are listed below. OBS Studio \u2013 Free, Top-choice XSplit \u2013 Professional streamers, high-end vMix \u2013 Windows users Streamlabs \u2013 Beginners, user-friendly GPUs can range significantly in price. Consider how much you\u2019re willing to spend and prioritize features based on your needs. We tend to look at GPUs in threefold categories; entry-level, mid-range, and high-end. These go hand-in-hand with the levels of streaming quality discussed earlier. For example, if you want to do 4K streaming then you require a high-end GPU, but if you are a beginner and lower resolution is what you are after, then an entry-level GPU will suffice. To get the best price for your GPU, we recommend checking out the price tracker application Camelcamelcamel. This will allow you to enter the Amazon link of your desired GPU to see how much it costs and how much it fluctuates \u2013 allowing you to pick the right time to purchase. Be on the lookout for seasonal holidays like Black Friday and the Spring Sale. These are the best times to pick up a GPU.  While the answer here depends on your streaming level, we do have some great options. If you are an experienced streamer, dependent on the best visuals (4K) then we recommend the Nvidia RTX 4090 or the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX. If a mid-range 1080p streaming GPU will suffice then be sure to look at the RTX 4070. Lastly, if you are just entering the streaming game and want to test the waters then be sure to take a look at older GPUs like the RTX 3060. The quality of a GPU can greatly determine the quality of your stream. In short, the better quality GPU, the better visual output on the stream. While most modern GPUs will be able to handle 1080p streaming with no problem, those searching for the peak 4K visual immersion may need to find a top-of-the-range graphics card with large amounts of memory and power.  Our top pick for the best GPU for streaming is the Nvidia RTX 4090. While largely interchangeable with the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX, both GPUs offer excellent streaming capabilities, with impressive visuals up to 4K, and ensure the smoothest gameplay imaginable. While these models offer the overall best performance, those seeking lower resolutions or lower prices may find satisfaction in our mid-range and entry-level picks; the RTX 4070 and RTX 3060 respectively.
