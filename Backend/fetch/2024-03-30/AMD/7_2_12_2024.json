Standing for Vector Neural Network Instructions, it's a big deal in our AI-centric world today.\u00a0The difference between AVX-VNNI and its big brother, AVX512-VNNI. Although they share some common ground in functionality, AVX512-VNNI pulls ahead with its 512-bit vectors and EVEX extensions, offering enhanced performance. With Zen 4 already supporting AVX512-VNNI, the addition of AVX-VNNI to Zen 5 might not seem like a headline at first glance. However, it's an important step, especially for consumer-level processors, reflecting a strategy Intel has also employed in the past.
