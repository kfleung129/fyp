Back when AMD introduced EPYC Naples, AI wasn't nearly as prolific as it is today... Running AI workloads on Zen 1 is simply embarrassing while now with Zen 4(C) the performance is terrific and often outpacing Intel's wares. The huge difference in these workloads is thanks to Zen 4(C) adding AVX-512 support.
