    "text": "Epson and Dangbei have reached a settlement regarding allegedly misleading brightness statistics. The original complaint made by Epson was related to the Dangbei Mars Pro projector, launched in 2022. The company stated that it felt Dangbei was deceiving customers with an incorrect white brightness measurement for the model. Dangbei had initially stated that the Mars Pro laser light source delivered a maximum brightness of 3,200 lumens. In the agreement following the Epson lawsuit, the company has agreed to downgrade this to 1,800 lumens, which both companies concur is accurate. Plus, Dangbei has said that it will use internationally recognized standards, like ISO 21118, for its future projectors. The ISO21118:2020 standard, defined by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), is specifically designed to measure the white brightness of projectors. Epson said that it had challenged Dangbei to make it easier for customers to understand the features of the devices they are purchasing. Mike Isgrig, a representative of Epson, said that \u201cWhen projector brands use the same, single internationally developed and published standards, it is consumers who are the winners\u201d. The company suggests that this case is part of a broader project to ensure standards are upheld across the industry. Epson was also keen to warn customers that other metrics such as lux, LED lumens and CVIA lumens could also be misleading. Whether Dangbei will amend the suggested brightness levels of other older models remains to be seen. Epson "
