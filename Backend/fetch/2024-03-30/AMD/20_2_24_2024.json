    "text": " If AMD is to have outsized success in 2024 it will be on the client side of AI Advertisement Source: Pamela Marciano / Shutterstock.com Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stock is right where it was 30 years ago, swimming in the eye of a growth hurricane. Today\u2019s hurricane, of course, is Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), whose blowout earnings February 21 turned the whole market around. The previous hurricane was Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), which doubled multiple times in the 1990s as half of the \u201cWinTel\u201d monopoly, alongside Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). I got off the AMD train recently, warning that you\u2019re paying steak prices for ground beef. An overnight bump has it opening close to where it was when that story was published. Where do we go from here? None of my bearishness should distract from the fact that AMD is a well-run company. It\u2019s still worth owning. AMD stock is just not the best play because Nvidia, led by its CUDA toolkit, is a better place to be. I\u2019m a reporter, not a guru. I was too pessimistic on Nvidia\u2019s earnings, just like everyone else. If you got out just before the bell Feb. 21, you\u2019re feeling stupid right now. I stayed in it. If its 31 analysts are right, however, AMD\u2019s business is about to accelerate.They see $5.4 billion in revenue this quarter, but $25.8 billion for the full year. Profits will also jump 50%, they think. The gain won\u2019t be over its continuing battle with Nvidia in graphics processing units, but in an older technology that\u2019s on your desk right now. That would be Zen5, a CPU (like the Intel chip in client PCs) due for delivery in the second half of the year. We can be fairly certain it\u2019s coming because CEO Lisa Su has agreed to keynote CompuTex, the Taiwanese computer show, this spring. If you still have AMD stock, you are doing OK. You\u2019ve doubled your money over the last year. You\u2019ve just got your money on the wrong horse. The right horse, of course, is Nvidia, up about 25% just since the start of 2024, and 215% over the last year. As I have written many times now, the key to Nvidia is its software. The design of any chip is software, but CUDA means Nvidia is the default operating system for AI. Its customers, especially Cloud Czars like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft and Amazon.Com (NASDAQ:AMZN), are desperate to change this.\u00a0 But developers\u2019 needs for CUDA means they can\u2019t. The work around is called ZLUDA, which lets someone run Nvidia code on AMD or Intel hardware. AMD funded it for a while, but recently backed away. The project is now open source. This means cost conscious developers, especially those who already use AMD Radeon GPUs, can develop using the open source ZLUDA code. But that\u2019s not where the market is. AMD\u2019s decision to drop it, like Intel\u2019s in 2021, means its future is uncertain. I have seen this movie before. There were many Windows workarounds in the early 1990s. You could even run OS/2 from IBM (NYSE:IBM). They all failed. Once the rocket takes off it\u2019s too late to get off. The rocket has taken off for Nvidia and CUDA. The latest quarter proves it. If you\u2019re to see outsized gains in AMD this year, it will come from its competition with Intel. Clients will need to be upgraded for AI just as servers have to be. If you can afford to take multiple positions in the chip space, owning AMD is practically a defensive play, even after its doubling over the last year. But that\u2019s not how aggressive investors, or retiring ones, will be playing it.
