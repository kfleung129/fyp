Samuel Willetts Published: Mar 18, 2024 If there\u2019s one thing we love more than a discount, it\u2019s free PC hardware, and right now you\u00a0can amazingly net both as part of an AMD Ryzen CPU deal over on Newegg. In addition to grabbing yourself a powerful new processor, you\u2019ll be able to bolster your system\u2019s storage with a complementary 1TB SSD. You\u2019ll need to pick up an AMD Ryzen 7 5700X or Ryzen 5 7600X to claim your free SSD,\u00a0with either option making for a great gaming CPU,\u00a0 depending on whether you\u2019re putting together a system with an AM4 or AM5 motherboard. Thankfully, both chips are available on the cheap for prices well below their MSRPs. Being the older processor, the Ryzen 7 5700X (link) naturally boasts the biggest discount of $90 (30%), bringing it down to $209 from its usual asking price of $299. Opting for a Ryzen 5 7600X (link) comes with its own sizeable saving of $70 (23%), reducing its cost to $229 from $299. The type of SSD you get as part of this deal depends on your choice of CPU. Those buying the Ryzen 5 7600X will receive a 1TB PCIe 3.0 NVMe SSD (worth $69.99) while purchasers of the Ryzen 7 5700X get a 1TB SATA SSD (worth $64.99), but both storage options are made by TeamGroup. While neither SSD is especially fast by the standards of today\u2019s PCIe 5.o drives, either\u00a0will serve you well as a secondary drive for extra games storage or for holding your\u00a0files,\u00a0whether it\u2019s\u00a0music, photos, videos, or whatever else. The real draw here is that either of these processors will serve you well as a gaming CPU, and you get loads of extra storage as a bonus. Just remember, you\u2019ll need to grab a cooler for either one of these processors, as neither option comes with one in the box.
