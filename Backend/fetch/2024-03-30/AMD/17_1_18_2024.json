    "text": "It's a long time coming, but AMD is finally rolling out improved performance with FSR 3 for Call of Duty: Warzone and Modern Warfare 3. Niall Walsh Published: Jan 18, 2024 AMD\u00a0is adding FSR 3 support for both Call of Duty: Warzone and Modern Warfare 3.\u00a0 The upscaling and frame generation tech is long overdue in Activision\u2019s leading shooters which was released in November last year. It\u2019s\u00a0a welcome addition for those who struggle to get the performance they desire on their current setups, provided they have a compatible GPU. As some of the most\u00a0competitive\u00a0FPS games around, Call of Duty\u2019s Warzone and Modern Warfare 3 rely heavily on PC performance to have the best experience. You don\u2019t need the best graphics card to get either game running, but with FSR 3, you can now enjoy a boost to performance with no legwork needed. AMD FSR 3 upscaling is possible on AMD Radeon RX 590 cards or above but is recommended for the RX 5000 series or above. For Nvidia cards, upscaling is supported on the GTX 10 series and above but is recommended for the RTX 20 series and above. It\u2019s always been notable that AMD FSR 3 isn\u2019t bound to its own graphics cards like Nvidia DLSS, but DLSS takes advantage of Tensor cores which are only found in Nvidia RTX cards. Full AMD FSR 3 support of both upscaling and frame generation is supported on the Radeon RX 5000 series cards and above but recommended for the RX 6000 series and above. On Team Green\u2019s cards, it\u2019s supported on the RTX 20 series and above but is recommended for the RTX 30 series and above. The addition of Warzone and Modern Warfare 3 brings the total number of FSR 3 games to seven. Other supported games include; Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, Forspoken, Immortals of Aveum, Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name, and MotorCubs RC. The list is quite short at the moment primarily because FSR 3 needs developers to integrate it into their games. With the arrival of Fluid Motion Frames later this month, AMD will be able to bring performance improvements without developer input, but this tech will be exclusive to AMD components.
