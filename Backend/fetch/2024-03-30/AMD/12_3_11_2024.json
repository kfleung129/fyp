    "text": "Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD shares are trading lower by 3.7% to $199.72 during Monday\u2019s session, despite a lack of company-specific news. The stock is falling, potentially amid profit-taking, after hitting a new 52-week and all-time high last week, in addition to overall market weakness Monday. Tuesday\u2019s February CPI report is possibly the week\u2019s most crucial economic indicator, potentially influencing the Fed\u2019s March 20 rate decision. If the CPI data shows a significant increase in inflation, it could raise concerns about rising costs for AMD in terms of materials, labor, and other operational expenses. This could potentially lead to higher production costs for AMD\u2019s products, impacting its profit margins and, consequently, its stock price. Shares of several semiconductor stocks are also trading lower Monday, with the move lower potentially being driven by recent weakness in NVIDIA Corp shares. It was reported that NVIDIA has been sued by three authors for allegedly using their copyrighted works without permission to train its AI platform. Is AMD A Good Stock To Buy?
