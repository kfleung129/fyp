    "text": "AMD has just announced FSR 3.1 which will come with improved upscaling quality. This new version of FSR promises to improve image stability and reduce ghosting. And below, you can find some examples of these improvements. Let\u2019s start with the comparisons. AMD shared these two GIFs. These comparisons are between FSR 2.2 and FSR 3.1 The top (left) images are with FSR 2.2, whereas the bottom (right) images are with FSR 3.1. In the first one, we get to see AMD FSR 3.1 producing a better and more stable image than before.   AMD says FSR 3.1 will make games more stable when you\u2019re still or moving. That means fewer flickers and shimmers, and less weirdness when things are in motion. Plus, it\u2019ll reduce ghosting and preserve more details than before. AMD FSR 3.1 also has another cool feature. With this new version, Frame Generation will work with all other upscaling techs. Finally, PC gamers will be able to use NVIDIA DLSS 2 or Intel XeSS alongside AMD FSR 3.1 Frame Generation. AMD has also revealed the first game that will support FSR 3.1. This game is Ratchet and Clank. And yes, alongside the visual improvements, Nixxes and AMD will decouple FSR 3.1 Frame Generation from upscaling. So yes, you will be able to use FSR 3.1 Frame Generation with DLSS 3 Super Resolution. This is a huge improvement to FSR. So, kudos to AMD for not only improving its Super Resolution tech but also allowing PC gamers to use Frame Generation with all the other upscaling techs. This is what most of us have been asking for. And at last, we\u2019ll finally get it. Hopefully, the game devs will update their games to support the new FSR version. Starfield, Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, and The Talos Principle 2 could greatly benefit from FSR 3.1. Enjoy and stay tuned for more!
