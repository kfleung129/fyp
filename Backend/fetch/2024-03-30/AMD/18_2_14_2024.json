    "text": "Jo\u00e3o Silva \nFebruary 14, 2024\nSoftware & Gaming  The Ryzen Master software has been very popular amongst enthusiasts that like to tinker with their hardware. The app allows users to maximise performance and efficiency using overclocking features. The downside to this software has been the need to restart your PC after changing settings. Now, a new update finally changes that. The most recent version (2.13.0.2908) included Ryzen 8000G desktop APU series support, making the software compatible with all current AM5 CPUs. Users may now alter clocks and power settings for desktop APUs, which previously showed a high overclocking potential.  Another noticeable improvement comes in the Curve Optimizer. This tool lets users fine-tune the voltage/frequency curve for the whole CPU or individual cores. These settings override the default settings and enable users to overvolt or undervolt their CPUs. Depending on the purpose, this might result in increased performance or improved power efficiency. This procedure should be more straightforward since the functionality no longer requires a system restart, allowing users to adjust these settings on the fly. Discuss on our Facebook page, HERE.
