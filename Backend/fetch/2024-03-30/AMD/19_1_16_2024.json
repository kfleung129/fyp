    "text": "AMD and Intel plan to launch their next-gen processors later this year. Team Red is prepping the Zen 5-based Ryzen 9000 CPUs (codenamed Granite Ridge) for a Q3 release, succeeding the Ryzen 7000 family launched in late September 2022. According to @Kepler_L2, the Ryzen 9000 processors are already in mass production and may land earlier than expected. Furthermore, the PROM21 chipset will be retained as the die powering AMD\u2019s next-generation motherboards. AMD will want to keep its board partners happy (profitable), so we\u2019ll likely see an updated variant of the PROM21 chipset power the 700-series motherboards. However, the X770 should remain a dual-die chipset, leveraging two PROM21 chips, twice as many as the B750 family. We\u2019ve learned a fair bit about the Ryzen 9000 processors in the last couple of months. The September leak from MLID gave us a first look at the finer details of the Zen 5 core and its capabilities. Codenamed \u201cNirvana,\u201d the upcoming iteration of the Zen architecture will focus on single-threaded performance, core interconnect, integer execution, and frontend bandwidth. You can go through our in-detail piece on the Zen 5-powered Ryzen 9000 CPUs. AMD has already confirmed that the existing 600-series motherboards will be fully compatible with the next-gen Zen 5 processors. These AM5 boards are expected to support at least three generations of Ryzen CPUs, including Zen 4 (H2 2022), Zen 5 (H2 2024), and Zen 6 (2026). In comparison, the 300-series chipsets introduced in 2017 supported up to four generations of Zen processors: Zen 1, Zen+, Zen 2, and Zen 3. "
