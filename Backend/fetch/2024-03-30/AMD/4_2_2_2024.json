    "text": "A new Sony PlayStation Portable or PS Vita hasn\u2019t arrived in quite some time, leading us to think that the portable PlayStation handheld is dead. However, fresh hope has come up as a new PlayStation handheld console is reportedly in development, and a custom AMD processor could power it. \n\n\n\nThe news comes via YouTuber Moore\u2019s Law is Dead, who claims through his sources that a new portable PlayStation handheld gaming console is in \u201cearly development.\u201d There is no design in mind for it yet, either. This is going to be super different from the recently unveiled PlayStation Portal Remote Player, which is just a cloud gaming device and does not actually run games natively.\n\n\n\nImage Courtesy: Moore\u2019s Law is Dead\nAccording to MLID, Sony has already given the chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) a green light to develop next-generation chips for new PlayStation gaming consoles. This includes the PlayStation 6 and the rumored portable PlayStation Handheld gaming console. \n\n\n\nWhen it comes to internal specifications for the next PS handheld, a next-generation AMD processor, which will be an APU (Advanced Processing Unit), is expected to power the upcoming handheld. It could come with 18 Compute Units (CUs). \n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tRecommended Articles\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPS5 Slim Pictured Next to the PS5; See Size Difference\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSatyam Kumar\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNov 3, 2023\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSteam Deck 2: Steam Deck 2: Speculated Release Date, Potential Specifications, and More\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSampad Banerjee\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJan 30, 2024\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\nThe GPU clock speed may run at 1.8GHz or lower, based on how the PS5\u2019s APU functions.

However, since the device might be in early development, it will naturally take some time. Do keep in mind that all these are very early rumors.
