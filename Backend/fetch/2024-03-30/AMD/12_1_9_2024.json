    "text": "(Image source: Razer.) Beside the new Blade 16, Razer is also updating its 14-inch powerhouse gaming laptop, the Blade 14. As with all refreshes, the new model will ship out with an updated AMD Ryzen CPU, among other new features. Specifically, the Blade 14 2024 will feature a Phoenix Point mobile CPU, the Ryzen 9 8945HS. Technically speaking, the CPU is a refresh of last year\u2019s 7945HS, just fortified with Ryzen AI for an improved \u201cAI accelerated performance\u201d. On that note, you\u2019re still looking at the same 8-cores, 16-threads configuration. As for the GPU, the top-specced Blade 14 tops out with an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070, although the Razer didn\u2019t state what the TGP of each GPU options are. We\u2019re just spitballing here, but we\u2019re guessing it would be anything between 80W and 125W. Like the Blade 16, the Blade 14\u2019s display also get the Calman Verified treatment, giving it a DCI-P3 accuracy of 100%, as well as retaining its 14-inch QHD+ resolution. As for the rest of the internal specifications, it\u2019s likely to be the same; the base model typically comes with 16GB RAM but with last year\u2019s model, Razer has doubled that memory amount and even given customers the option to further upgrade that amount to 64GB of DDR5-5600 RAM, which aren\u2019t soldered on to the board and can be swapped out. The Razer Blade 14 will be available for preorder starting 23 January, with the global availability still pending. Price-wise, it starts from US$2,199 (~RM10,225).
