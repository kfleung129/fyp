Even if you are familiar with the thermal demands of your CPU of choice, many other factors are crucial in the purchasing process. Here are some of the key factors I considered when selecting. Yes, you can use an AM4 cooler on an AM5 motherboard socket. The AM5 socket uses the same CPU cooler bracket as the AM4 socket, which means there is cross-compatibility between the two platforms regarding CPU coolers. Yes, many Intel and AMD CPUs can work with the same coolers if you install the appropriate brackets. Modern CPU coolers have a wide compatibility range, including Intel and AMD CPUs. Use the appropriate bracket for your particular CPU when installing the cooler. Yes, water cooling is certainly better than air cooling from a pure performance standpoint. However, many premium air coolers can match the performance of liquid coolers and can even do so at a more affordable price. It all comes down to preference and convenience factors. Yes, you can overclock some AM5 CPUs using an air cooler, but the results will vary. Of course, a high-end liquid cooler is more suited to manual overclocking with a premium Ryzen 7000 series CPU. Still, an air cooler can also provide some level of overclocking support. Recent Updates Looking for more options?
