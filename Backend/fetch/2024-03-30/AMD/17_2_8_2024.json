Learn more Striving for a world record in hardware overclocking may not be everyone\u2019s hobby of choice, but that\u2019s exactly what one enthusiast has done, with a budget-friendly motherboard no less. Using the former flagship (or non-3D flagship) Ryzen 9 7950X CPU and a B650 motherboard that\u2019s worth just $110. You\u2019d probably expect that all sorts of high-end hardware is required to set an overclocking world record, but it looks like even a cheap motherboard can get the job done. HWBot, a site that is all about overclocking, even hosting competitions, has a new world record in performance for a 16-core CPU and indeed the best score ever recorded for the 7950X. User SaltyCroissant on HWBot is the proud owner of this new world record, for however long it stands. They have recorded a score of 306,686 MIPS (millions of instructions per second) on the high-end AMD CPU, and it\u2019s not like they have other premium hardware to back it up. With the help of some liquid nitrogen cooling for a max core temperature of -49\u00b0C, they boosted the 16-core CPU higher than ever before to achieve this world record. Reaching a clock speed of 6.8GHz against the usual boost clock speed of 5.7GHz. The interesting part for us that they did it with a $110 B650 motherboard, specifically the B650M-HDV/M.2. Plenty of comments came through to congratulate their efforts, even one wondering if this is the best ever performance per dollar extracted from a motherboard. As this new world record shows, this processor is definitely a suitable choice if you want excellent overclocking performance. Unlike the flagship 7950X3D, you aren\u2019t limited in terms of overclock. Due the stacked V-Cache design of the 3D model, you can not manually overclock it like you can with the 7950X. It does offer some performance boosts via the included PBO and Curve Optimizer with constitutes as automatic overclocking, but not to the same level as you can push other CPUs.

Maybe you can even set a new world record in future, with the right equipment and technique \u2013 you don\u2019t even need a high-end mobo!
