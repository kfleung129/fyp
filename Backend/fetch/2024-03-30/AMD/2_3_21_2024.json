    "text": "The Intel Arc A310 is a dedicated entry-level graphics card from Intel for desktops. It is based on the ACM-G11 chip and offers 6 of the 8 Xe cores (96 ALUs), 6 of the 8 ray tracing units, 1.152 MB L1 cache and 4MB L2 cache. The memory interface is 64 bits wide and supports 4GB GDDR6 graphics memory with 15.5 Gbps. The TGP is between 40 and 75 watts depending on the model. \nThe A310 is similar to the mobile Arc A350Mexcept for the higher clock rates of the cores and memory. \nThe ACM-G11 chip is manufactured at TSMC in 6nm (N6 process) and offers 7.2 billion transistors and is 157 mm2 in size. It integrates two media engines for VP9, AVC, HEVC, AV1 8k60 12-bit HDR decoding and 8k 10-bit HDR encoding. The integrated 4 display pipes support 4x 4k120 HDR, HDMI 2.0B, DP 2.0 10G and Adaptive Sync. The Intel Arc A310 is a dedicated entry-level graphics card from Intel for desktops.

The\u00a0NVIDIA RTX A1000 Laptop GPU\u00a0or A1000 Mobile is a professional graphics card for mobile workstations. It is based on the GA107 Ampere chip and offers a slightly slower performance than the consumer GeForce RTX 3050 Laptop GPU. It offers 2,048 CUDA cores, 16 Raytracing and 64 Tensor cores paired with a 128 Bit memory bus.\u00a0 It is available in different variants from 35 - 95 Watt (TGP) with different clock speeds (and performance). The GPU supports eDP 1.4b to connect the internal monitor and DisplayPort 1.4 and HDMI 2.1 for external connections. \nThere is no more Max-Q variant (formerly used for the low power variants) but every OEM can choose to implement Max-Q technologies (Dynamic Boost, WhisperMode). \nThe raw performance should be sloghtly slower than\u00a0GeForce RTX 3050 for laptops\u00a0at the same TGP level. Both GPUs depend heavily on good cooling and a high TGP for good performance. At a similar power consumption level the RTX A1000 should be clearly faster than the old\u00a0Quadro T1200.\u00a0 \nThe GA107 chip offers 2.560 FP32 ALUs of which half can also execute INT32 instructions (i.e. 1,280 INT32 ALUs). With Ampere all shaders could still execute FP32 or INT32 instructions. The raytracing and tensor cores on the chip were also improved according to Nvidia. However, RTX A1000 can only use 2048 CUDA cores. The Ampere chips also include an improved 5th generation video encoder (NVENC for H.264 and H.265) and a 7th generation decoder (for\u00a0various formats\u00a0now including AV1). \nThe GA107 chip is manufactured by Samsung in 8nm (8N), which is not quite able to keep up with the 7nm node at TSMC (e.g. used by AMD and also for the professional GA100 Ampere chip). Depending on the TGP, the A1200 can also be used in thin and light laptops (with 35 Watt TGP e.g.).
