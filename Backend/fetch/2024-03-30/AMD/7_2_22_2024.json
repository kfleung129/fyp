Computex Taipei (Taitra) One of the biggest surprises and announcements of this year's Computex 2024 from AMD might be its next-generation Ryzen family based on the Zen 5 core architecture, codenamed Granite Ridge. AMD is seemingly prepping its next-gen chips for production and with a launch scheduled for the 2nd half of 2024, we could expect an unveil during Computex since AMD did the same during Computex 2022 where the Ryzen 7000 \"Zen 4\" CPUs and the subsequent AM5 platforms were revealed to the public. AMD has also finished completing its RDNA 3 GPU lineup so we might get an update on the new RDNA 4 lineup as well. The next-gen Radeon RX series is expected to enter the mainstream and high-end segment with a focus on better perf/$ and architectural-side improvements before the move to RDNA 5. AMD didn't reveal a lot at Computex 2023 besides demos of its Ryzen AI XDNA NPUs but this year, they'll make up for it with a proper product unveiling. We'll be at the Computex show floor like every year so expect live updates from our side when the event kicks off in June '24.
