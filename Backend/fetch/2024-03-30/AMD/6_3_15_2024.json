If you\u2019re looking to pick up a powerful laptop on the cheap, you\u2019ve come to the right place. Best Buy\u2019s selling the Asus Vivobook 16 for $499.99, which is a savings of $250. This machine comes loaded with AMD hardware and a spacious 16-inch 1080p display. The blue color scheme is also quite chic. According to one review on Best Buy, this laptop is lightweight and it\u2019s fast enough to run multiple tabs at the same time. Bootup times are blazing fast, too. Let\u2019s dive into the specs for a moment. The Asus Vivobook 16 is rocking an AMD Ryzen 7 5800H CPU, AMD Radeon graphics, 12GB of RAM, and 512GB of SSD storage. That\u2019s more than enough oomph (aka power) to handle office tasks, browsing the web, watching YouTube, and so on. The 16-inch display also has a resolution of 1920\u00d71080, which is fine for day-to-day use. As for connectivity options, you\u2019re getting one HDMI, one USB-A 2.0, two USB-A 3.0, and one USB-C 3.0. This is a good deal, but I don\u2019t expect it to last very long, so you better swoop in sooner rather than later.
