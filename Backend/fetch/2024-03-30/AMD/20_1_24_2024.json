AMD\u2019s latest Adrenalin driver has just been released and it\u2019s a doozy. In addition to explicit support for the Radeon RX 7600 XT card and new titles such as Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth and Tekken 8, the company\u2019s FPS-boosting Fluid Motion Frames technology is expanding to most recent cards. It\u2019s also available to \u201cany DirectX 11 and 12 game,\u201d which should mean pretty much anything released in the last decade or more. In ideal circumstances, it should be able to dramatically improve framerates. What exactly is AMD Fluid Motion Frames, abbreviated as the only-slightly-less-awkward \u201cAFMF?\u201d The company describes its interpolation tech as a \u201cframe generation technology designed to increase frame rates and smooth movement for game winning performance with minimal impact to image quality.\u201d The tech is available on any AMD card in the Radeon RX 6000 or 7000 family, mobile or desktop. It\u2019s similar to, but distinct from, AMD\u2019s FidelityFX Super Resolution, which competes with Nvidia DLSS. AMD makes some startling performance claims with this new driver-based technique. The notes for Adrenaline 24.1.1 say that in ideal circumstances it can boost framerates by \u201cup to 103 percent\u201d with AFMF and FSR 2 enabled at Quality Mode, tested versus baseline with the RX 7600 XT at 1440p resolution. AFMF only works with games in full screen mode and with v-sync disabled, and AMD does not recommend enabling it for fast-paced online multiplayer games, as it introduces additional visual latency. Other improvements in Adrenaline 24.1.1 include AMD\u2019s take on video upscaling, applying similar tech to low-resolution videos on the web and local files. This can boost video quality up to 4K for common applications like Chrome, Edge, Windows Media Player, etc (only available on RX 7000 cards). We\u2019ve seen similar, platform-agnostic tools from Microsoft, but this version should offload the task to your GPU.
