Tracked as\u00a0CVE-2023-4969, the security issue enables data recovery from vulnerable GPUs,\u00a0especially in the context of large language models (LLMs) and machine learning (ML) processes. LeftoverLocals was discovered by Trail of Bits researchers\u00a0Tyler Sorensen and Heidy Khlaaf, who reported it privately to the vendors before publishing a technical overview. The security flaw stems from the fact that some GPU frameworks do not isolate memory completely and one kernel running on the machine could read values in local memory written by another kernel. Trail of Bits researchers Tyler Sorensen and Heidy Khlaaf, who discovered and reported the vulnerability, explain\u00a0that an adversary only needs to run a GPU compute application (e.g. OpenCL, Vulkan, Metal)\u00a0to read data a user left in the GPU local memory. \"Using these, the attacker can read data that the victim has left in the GPU local memory simply by writing a GPU kernel that dumps uninitialized local memory\" - Trail of Bits LeftoverLocals lets attackers launch a 'listener' - a GPU kernel that reads from uninitialized local memory and can dump the data in a persistent location, such as the global memory. If the local memory is not cleared, the attacker can use the listener to read values left behind by the 'writer' - a program that stores values to local memory. The animation below shows how the writer and listener programs interact and how the latter can retrieve data from the former on affected GPUs.  The recovered data can reveal sensitive information about the victim's computations, including model inputs, outputs, weights, and intermediate computations. In a multi-tenant GPU context that run LLMs,\u00a0LeftoverLocals can be used to\u00a0listen in on other users' interactive sessions and recover from the GPU's local memory the data from the victim's \"writer\" process. The Trail of Bits researchers have created a proof of concept (PoC) to demonstrate\u00a0LeftoverLocals and showed that an adversary can recover 5.5MB of data per GPU invocation, depending on the GPU framework. On an AMD Radeon RX 7900 XT powering\u00a0the open-source\u00a0LLM llama.cpp, an attacker can get as much as 181MB per query, which is sufficient to reconstruct the LLM's responses with high accuracy. Trail of Bits researchers discovered CVE-2023-4969 in September 2023 and informed CERT/CC\u00a0to help coordinate the disclosure and patching efforts. Mitigation efforts are underway as some vendors already fixed it while others are still working on a way to develop and implement a defense mechanism. In the case of Apple, the latest iPhone 15 is unaffected and fixes became available for A17 and M3 processors\u00a0but the issue\u00a0persist on M2-powered computers. AMD informed that the following GPU models remain\u00a0vulnerable as its engineers investigate effective mitigation strategies. Qualcomm has released a patch via firmware v2.0.7 that fixes LeftoverLocals in some chips\u00a0but others remain vulnerable. Imagination released a fix in DDK v23.3 in December 2023. However, Google warned in January 2024 that some of the vendor's GPUs are still impacted. Intel, NVIDIA, and ARM GPUs have reported that the data leak problem doesn't impact their devices. Trail of Bits suggests that GPU vendors implement an automatic local memory clearing mechanism between kernel calls, ensuring isolation of sensitive data written by one process. While this approach might introduce some performance overhead, the researchers suggest that the trade-off is justified given the severity of the security implications. Other potential mitigations include avoiding multi-tenant GPU environments in security-critical scenarios and implementing user-level mitigations.

There's no way non-existent hardware could be affected to begin with since the problem doesn't appear to be in the generalized ISA from Arm. It's in the implementation details in GPUs grafted onto the Arm based processors that are faulty.\n\nThis is one of those vulnerabilities that is probably a lot less relevant to most users unless they're running some compute model in the cloud. Even less relevant because the majority of such instances are going to be running on Nvidia hardware with CUDA, not AMD's migraine inducing ROCm, and definitely not on phones and Macs which are primarily single user environments. Patch when offered, don't worry about it otherwise. Not a member yet?
