In addition to the fashion show, there was an exhibition of final theses from the Fashion & Design Management (BA), Fashion Journalism & Communication (BA) and Sustainability in Fashion & Creative Industries (MA) courses. Among the graduates of the Fashion & Design Management (BA) course was Jacob Langemeyer, who successfully runs the Berlin label SF1OG as Brand Manager & Founder together with the designer Rosa Marga Dahl. Julian Stamm\u2019s final collection plays with the familiar appeal of the forbidden as well as human curiosity for what is unknown to us. There are different legends and interpretations about what happens after death. Stamm\u2019s The Unknown incorporates these into six deconstructed fashion-driven looks, including one called Coffin and Cemation, which features a wooden coffin as the protagonist. Lonely in Gorgeous is about the Japanese \u201cHikikomori\u201d. These are people who withdraw heavily from society and stay at home for long periods of time. Divided into four acts and inspired by classical ballet, Vu\u2019s collection shows six women\u2019s fashion looks that playfully and femininely portray and reflect the different situations and individual dealings with self-isolation. With her final collection, Annemarie H\u00f6ltge wants to make one thing clear: you can be a child as an adult. Here she plays on the lightness and naivety that children carry within them and how you don\u2019t have to let go of this even as an adult. Too tight on the body and yet too wide on the shoulders, the six looks are reminiscent of children\u2019s clothing and, above all, disguises on adult models who have already outgrown them. Somewhat dark and with a deeper meaning, the clothing looks excessively uncomfortable on the so-called SHADOW CHILDREN. Clara Born retells the fairy tale Sounds My Linden by Astrid Lindgen using the six looks from her final collection. The focus is on the character Malin and especially her fate and social relationships. Asymmetrical, playful and unconventionally styled, the looks in this collection have an almost mystical, fairytale effect. The textiles vary from head to toe with the help of hood-like headgear and socks. Vintage lace is combined here with wool and fur as well as knitted and crocheted. Solitude & Sanctuary was created after Alica Braun\u2019s three-month stay in Seoul and, among other things, deals with the history of Korean comfort women during the Second World War. This final collection celebrates the elegance of black and white as well as simple, straight silhouettes. They are also strongly inspired by traditional Korean and Japanese clothing such as hanboks or kimonos. The graduate would like to draw attention to unheard voices of this time and, above all, injustices that happened to women back then and that continue to resonate today. Elmira Pashaei presents six simple looks in her final collection. Above all, they carry the essence of holy Christianity and divine femininity. Silhouettes known from Christianity flow into the designs and the gently falling fabrics create an elegant, feminine and graceful effect. The color palette consists of white, light pink and lilac and is reminiscent of idyllic sunrises. Mary Magdalene served primarily as the inspiration for A Love that Never Ends. Friederike K\u00f6psell\u2019s collection Fur!ia breaks norms and defends female rage, which is not nearly as accepted in our society as that of men. The inspiration for the collection was primarily the German story Aunt Jolanthe Ritter Annegret and the feminist Riot Grrrl movement, which wanted to create revolution through music in the hardcore punk scene of the 90s. K\u00f6psell\u2019s designs are intended to make women feel safe and empowered so that they can live out their anger, make fun of the male gaze, but also actively take action against the patriarchal system. Malte von Holtum\u2019s final collection appears dark and mysterious. The future takes place before the eyes of the past. unknown demise consists of six looks that consist of upcycling and reuse already used textiles. The different materials create textures like patterns on the clothing. In particular, the hoods that cover the head or even cover the face probably allude to our future or that of the earth and humanity as a whole. With her final collection, Noelle Tr\u00fceb presents Stereotypes & Prejudices in Fashion, as the name suggests, prejudices in fashion. The six looks look almost clich\u00e9d for fashion with fur, boots, wide trouser legs, different prints and patterns \u2013 everything is there and it looks like you\u2019re leafing through a fashion magazine \u2013 full of dynamism and inspiration. The final collection Blending Nature and Human Life on sustainable fashion is about climate change and our society. Inspired by Grandma\u2019s Manhattan Project, Bartsch\u2019s final collection is about a city built to be in harmony with nature and urban life. The six looks primarily focus on destructive, unique designs made from upcycled and deadstock materials. In order, they tell a story with an appeal to us as humanity. The sensational final collection Fie On Thee! Fie On Me! is about the uncomfortable feeling of sheer shame and its importance in society. Face-covering hoods evoke the desire to be invisible when one is ashamed. Overall, Pipal\u2019s designs explore the process from feeling ashamed to the point of making peace with it. With SENSE, Hannah Bentley investigates how clothing supports human well-being and the environment. In today\u2019s world and in the future, we are so affected by stress and pressure, as well as by climate change, that we desperately need clothing for comfort, but we also need to protect our environment from it. The graduate presented three meaningful looks with this goal in mind. She used different materials for the designs, such as recycled plastic bottles. Le Bal des Increvable is all about the mystical nature of vampires. In addition to the collection, Marchand created a 1-minute short film. The three looks serve as costumes and also represent pure art. The graduate came up with six vampire characters to tell an eerie story with her final collection with short films that is conceptually inspired by modern and contemporary art. Hayley Gare\u2019s collection includes seven feminine women\u2019s fashion looks with slim silhouettes and straight cuts, of which only 6 were presented in the show. It was not without reason that she was praised and chosen by the jury. Aphelion is about the contradiction between the romanticized fantasy of being alone and the reality of isolation, which can have a huge impact on mental health. The collection includes a delicate lace dress next to a modern tracksuit. What are you afraid of? examines the manipulative tactics used by members of destructive cult circles to enforce their ideologies and system structures. For this purpose, Fabian Kunert presents six destructive looks that are reminiscent of paparazzi photos and are inspired by cult and celebrity culture. With the help of extraordinarily large shoulder parts, the human body is given a strange silhouette and a hood over the face gives people greater anonymity.
