This study is the first case-control analysis to investigate the effect of metformin on the conversion to nAMD and the first to examine the protective effects of metformin dose and various hypoglycemic medications on nAMD, according to the researchers. However, the findings are too preliminary to have practice application, they noted. Dimitra Skondra, MD, PhD, with the University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine, is the study's corresponding author. The study was published in Retina. The study used diagnosis and treatment codes, which could not be verified. Claims-based data do not offer insight into appropriateness of care. Data on A1c and use of hypoglycemic medications other than metformin were lacking. The statistically significant OR may not be clinically relevant owing to the large sample size. The study authors have no relationships to disclose. Send comments and news tips to news@medscape.net. "
