    "text": "AMD\u2019s former senior vice president and general manager of Radeon has come out with some strong words against Nvidia. Scott Herkelman called Nvidia \u201cthe GPU cartel\u201d in response to a story from the Wall Street Journal in which Nvidia\u2019s customers claim that it delays GPU shipments in retaliation for those customers shopping with other suppliers. The accusation in question comes from Jonathan Ross, CEO of AI chip startup Groq, who said, \u201ca lot of people that we meet with say that if Nvidia were to hear that we were meeting, they would disavow it. The problem is you have to pay Nvidia a year in advance, and you may get your hardware in a year, or it may take longer, and it\u2019s, \u2018Aw shucks, you\u2019re buying from someone else, and I guess it\u2019s going to take a little longer.'\u201d Herkelman responded to Tom\u2019s Hardware\u2019s coverage of the story on X (formerly Twitter), saying, \u201cthis happens more than you expect, Nvidia does this with DC customers, [manufacturers], [add-in board partners], press, and resellers.\u201d This happens more than you expect, NVIDIA does this with DC customers, OEMs, AIBs, press, and resellers. They learned from GPP to not put it into writing. They just don&#39;t ship after a customer has ordered. They are the GPU cartel and they control all supply. &mdash; Scott Herkelman (@sherkelman) February 27, 2024 This behavior calls back to the GeForce Partner Program (GPP), as pointed out by Herkelman. Nvidia has canceled the GPP following backlash over it allegedly requiring Nvidia\u2019s partners to remove its gaming branding from all non-Nvidia GPUs. This isn\u2019t the first time Herkelman has come out against the GPP. He released a statement in 2018 shortly after the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and European Union Commission began responding to complaints about the program. \u201cThey learned from GPP to not put it into writing,\u201d Herkelman continued. \u201cThey just don\u2019t ship after a customer has ordered. They are the GPU cartel and they control all supply.\u201d Herkelman\u2019s claim about restricting units from press is particularly interesting, as we know about a clear example of that happening in the past. In late 2020, Hardware Unboxed, a YouTube channel dedicated to PC hardware reviews and analysis, received an email that it would no longer receive review units from Nvidia. It stated: \u201cOur Founders Edition boards and other Nvidia products are being allocated to media outlets that recognize the changing landscape of gaming and the features that are important to gamers and anyone buying a GPU today.\u201d Following pushback from larger YouTube channels like Linus Tech Tips and JayzTwoCents, Nvidia walked back its statement and issued an apology to Hardware Unboxed. In Nvidia\u2019s latest earnings called, CEO Jensen Huang said, \u201cWe allocate fairly. We do the best we can to allocate fairly, and to avoid allocating unnecessarily,\u201d as reported by Fortune. We\u2019ve reached out to Nvidia, and it declined to comment on the story.
