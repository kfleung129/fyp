    "text": "PFU America has launched three new laser projectors: the Ricoh PJ WUL5A40ST, the Ricoh PJ WUL6760 and the Ricoh PJ WUL5A50. The Ricoh-owned company has designed the latest models for professional settings ranging from conference rooms to entertainment venues. All three devices use 3LCD projection to generate WUXGA resolution images, with features like 1.6X zoom, automatic angle correction and a built-in 16W speaker. The Ricoh PJ WUL5A40ST is the first show throw projector from the brand with a 0.44 throw ratio for images up to 150-in (~381 cm) wide. The laser light source delivers a brightness of up to 4,500 lumens and is expected to last up to 20,000 hours. PFU suggests that the model could be used for presentations or digital signage. The PJ WUL5A50 is a compact projector with a greater peak brightness of 5,200 lumens and a larger maximum image size of 300-in (~762 cm). Based on these attributes, the model would suit a larger conference room or a small venue. The WUL6760 can also throw images up to 300-in (~762 cm) wide with a throw ratio of 1.2-2.0. The key difference is with the top brightness level, which is increased to 6,000 lumens. This model is suited to larger spaces like entertainment venues or an auditorium. You can currently buy the Ricoh PH WUL5A40ST and WUL5A50 short throw laser projector for the discounted prices of $2,420 and $2,248; the models have an RRP of $2,750 and $2,600, respectively. The cost of the high-end WUL6760 model is available on request. Buy the BenQ WXGA Business Projector (MW560) at Amazon PFU America, Business Wire "
