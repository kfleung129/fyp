    "text": "Posted by Jeremy Hellstrom | Jan 5, 2024 | General Tech | 0 AMD has some plans for 2024 which include APUs and FPGAs for automotive usage, as well as improving the Linux kernel\u2019s FPGA manager subsystem.\u00a0 The V2000A is based on Zen 2 with six cores, along with a Vega 7 iGPU.\u00a0 Those parts are certainly not new, but are inexpensive and reliable not to mention significantly more powerful that the chips currently being used in most cars.\u00a0 AMD is hoping this will attract auto makers looking to power the next generation of onboard infotainment displays. Along with the Zen chip are new FPGAs specifically designed to handle the cameras which are now standard on many cars, as well as LIDAR, automatic parallel parking and other features which cards now feature.\u00a0 They won\u2019t be up to competing with NVIDIA\u2019s AI chips, but that is not the market segment they are looking for.\u00a0 Instead they are looking to increase their share of the inexpensive components which power your car, by offering more powerful silicon than the competition. That is not the only trick AMD plans with their FPGA products, the AMD-Xilinx engineering team is also looking to make FPGAs work better on Linux.\u00a0 They want to add a user space interface to the kernel.\u00a0\u00a0 This would allow for driver probe/remove, bridges, and even Device Tree Overlay file support for re-programming FPGAs while the system is running.\u00a0 If adopted, it would certainly give far more effective control over FPGAs on Linux systems.\u00a0 You can see their proposal here.

Apart from the front page you might find him on the BOINC Forums or possibly the Fraggin' Frogs if he has the time.
