You follow Tale of the Tape - edit You follow Zacks Equity Research - edit Zacks Equity Research Tale of the Tape Advanced Micro Devices (AMD Quick QuoteAMD  -  Free Report)     has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term. Shares of this chipmaker have returned -0.2% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +5.2% change. The Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry, to which Advanced Micro belongs, has gained 9.9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term? Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision. Revisions to Earnings Estimates Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock. We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements. Advanced Micro is expected to post earnings of $0.60 per share for the current quarter, representing no change from the year-ago quarter. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -16.3%. The consensus earnings estimate of $3.47 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +30.9%. This estimate has changed -8% over the last 30 days. For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.03 indicates a change of +45.1% from what Advanced Micro is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +6.9%. Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Advanced Micro is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate: 12 Month EPS Revenue Growth Forecast Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial. In the case of Advanced Micro, the consensus sales estimate of $5.42 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +1.2%. The $25.34 billion and $30.8 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +11.7% and +21.6%, respectively. Last Reported Results and Surprise History Advanced Micro reported revenues of $6.17 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +10.2%. EPS of $0.77 for the same period compares with $0.69 a year ago. Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.11 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.88%. The EPS surprise was 0%. Over the last four quarters, Advanced Micro surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period. Valuation No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance. While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price. As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued. Advanced Micro is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here  to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.

This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1988 it has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +24.15%  per year. These returns cover a period from January 1, 1988 through March 4, 2024. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple, equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zacks Ranks stocks can, and often do, change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available, pricing information was not collected, or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations. Zacks may license the Zacks Mutual Fund rating provided herein to third parties, including but not limited to the issuer.
