    "text": "GPD has announced the upcoming release of its WIN Max 2 handheld, now powered by AMD\u2019s latest R7 8840U processor. This new model aims to deliver improved AI capabilities, as reported by IT Home. Featuring 32GB of memory, the new handheld meets the rising standards for AI-focused PCs, exceeding the 16GB minimum specified for such devices. It will operate on the Windows 11 22H2 version, with expectations to support the upcoming 23H2 version, signaling a commitment to leveraging the latest in AI technology. The core of this update is AMD\u2019s Ryzen 8040 series CPU, introduced last month. The R7 8840U is characterized by its 8 cores and 16 threads, a turbo frequency of 5.1GHz, and an enhanced Radeon 780M core display. Its AI performance, primarily driven by an improved NPU, is a step up from its predecessor, the R7 7840U. However, GPD\u2019s testing, as shown by CPU-Z scores, reveals that the performance of the 8840U is comparable to that of the 7840U in handheld versions. This suggests that the new model\u2019s advantage lies more in AI processing enhancements rather than a significant increase in general computing power. While details regarding the price and availability of the new WIN Max 2 model have not been released, it is expected to be priced slightly higher than the current R7 7840U model, which is priced at $1,370.
