    "text": "Microsoft has developed a new API to simplify super-resolution coding in PC gaming. The company\u2019s DirectSR, developed with hardware partners Nvidia, AMD and Intel, will provide a more streamlined tunnel for developers to tap into the companies\u2019 three distinct approaches to graphical upscaling in Windows games. The company describes DirectSR as enabling \u201cseamless integration of Super Resolution (SR)\u201d for Windows games. \u201cDirectSR is the missing link developers have been waiting for when approaching SR integration, providing a smoother, more efficient experience that scales across hardware,\u201d Microsoft program manager Joshua Tucker wrote in a company blog post. Super-resolution is a technology that enhances games\u2019 visual quality without pushing the graphics card too hard. It runs games internally in a lower resolution but uses machine learning (and other tricks) to upscale the resolution of what you see on the screen. The result is sharper graphics with only a minimal extra demand on the GPU. Microsoft says the DirectSR API opens the door to \u201cmulti-vendor\u201d super-resolution via \u201ca common set of inputs and outputs.\u201d Tucker wrote that a single code path would enable \u201ca variety of solutions\u201d through the companies\u2019 three (otherwise distinct) answers to super-resolution: Nvidia\u2019s DLSS, AMD\u2019s FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) and Intel\u2019s XeSS. The three GPU vendors\u2019 SR solutions differ. Nvidia\u2019s AI-powered DLSS appears to perform the best but requires an Nvidia graphics card. AMD\u2019s FidelityFX is more versatile, supporting competitors\u2019 hardware in addition to its own, while Intel\u2019s XeSS offers AI upscaling for Intel hardware while still providing limited support for non-Intel GPUs. Version 24H2 will have an AI \"Super Resolution\" feature, as previous reports mentioned. Here are some settings for it in Graphics settings - a default toggle and per-app options.

Although it isn\u2019t confirmed that it\u2019s the same thing, it sounds like it. The setting would allow you to \u201cUse Al to make supported games play more smoothly with enhanced details.\u201d The preview version offers the choice of using a universal / automatic upscaling approach or a per-game one. Initially speculated to be a rival super-resolution feature from Microsoft, it now appears \u201cAutomatic super resolution\u201d may end up as the consumer-facing version of the DirectSR API. Microsoft says DirectSR will arrive for developers \u201csoon\u201d in a public preview build of the Agility SDK (a component of DirectX 12). If you\u2019re a PC gaming developer, the company plans to go into more detail about the new API in its DirectX State of the Union on March 21 at GDC. "
