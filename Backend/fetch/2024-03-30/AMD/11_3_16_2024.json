    "text": "The ThinkPad X1 series is Lenovo's premier ThinkPad lineup. The newest members, the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 12 and X1 2-in-1 Gen 9, were announced in time for CES 2024. The clamshell X1 Carbon G12 came out directly after release, but only in limited form: Availability was limited to the USA, and only a small amount of configuration options were purchaseable. The X1 2-in-1, successor of the ThinkPad X1 Yoga G8 (available from Amazon) and a convertible laptop, was not made available, at least thus far. This is changing, as Lenovo has put the new X1 ThinkPads into the PSREF, which is the central location for the specifications of Lenovo products. This means that the general availability of the products is close. Of course, being the specifcation database, the PSREF pages also reveal more about the two laptops than we knew thus far. For example, we critiqued the ThinkPad X1 Carbon G12 in our review for the 1080p webcam. There is going to be a higher resolution option for the webcam, as the spec-sheet lists an UHD/8 MPix webcam. The camera upgrade is however limited to the 2.8K OLED Touchscreen or WUXGA PrivacyGuard display options. Also, there is a new WiFi 7 option in form of the Intel BE200, but individual buyers will not get to take advantage of the new WiFi solution, as it will be limited to special bid option - the largest corporate customers. Last but not least, the specifications reaffirm that the X1 2-in-1 will be limited to U series CPUs, unlike the clamshell model. Again, the general availability of these two products should not be far off, including all the configuration options like the new haptic Sensel touchpad. Lenovo PSREF (1, 2) "
