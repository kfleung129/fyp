    "text": "Although Horizon Forbidden West launched for PS5 in 2022, the PC version is finally on its way out. It\u2019s certainly been a long time coming, and now you can prepare for its release in a few ways. Now, Sony has listed all the PC requirements for Horizon Forbidden West. Nixxes and Guerrilla have provided the following requirements, including minimum, recommended, high, and very high graphics presets: According to the game\u2019s PlayStation Blog post, Horizon Forbidden West\u2019s PC specs cover almost any hardware, from very low to very high graphic presets. This also includes portable gaming devices, like the Steam Deck. While the highest preset produces the highest quality in graphics, the minimum is still excellent for those with less powerful PCs. The specs come at the cost of 150 GB, though, so it\u2019s best to clear some room for its substantial size. The Burning Shores DLC and downloadable content may require additional space, too. Anyone who purchases the Complete Edition earns exclusive outfits such as the Carja Behemoth Elite and Nora Thunder Elite. Plus, pre-purchases include the Blacktide Dye outfit and Sharpshot bow. Despite the Horizon Forbidden West PC requirements mentioned, Nixxes and Guerrilla suggest tinkering with a few settings on your own. For this, go to the in-game menus to change the field of view, shadows, motion blur, and more. "
