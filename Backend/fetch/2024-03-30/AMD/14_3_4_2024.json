    "text": "Published 2024-03-04 16:36 by Hilbert Hagedoorn Papermaster discussed AMD's strategic emphasis on AI integration across its product lines in 2024, including in cloud services, edge devices, PCs, embedded systems, and gaming consoles. This direction builds on AMD's previous efforts to support AI at the Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) level in its Ryzen 7000 desktop and EPYC \"Genoa\" server processors, and the launch of Ryzen 7040 and 8040 series mobile processors with Neural Processing Units (NPUs) for enhanced AI tasks. The Radeon RX 7000 series GPUs featuring AI accelerators and the introduction of the Ryzen AI stack for Windows PCs are part of AMD's broader initiative to incorporate AI into its offerings. In essence, AMD is advancing a new AI-integrated version of its FSR upscaling technology, signaling a strategic pivot towards broader AI integration within its hardware offerings, with key developments anticipated in 2024.
