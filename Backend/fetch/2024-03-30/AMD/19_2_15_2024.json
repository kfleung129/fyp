    "text": "BenQ has unveiled the LW650 WXGA Laser Projector. The model is designed for workspaces like a meeting room or a boardroom. Features of the relatively compact projector include SmartEco mode and an Eco Blank button to reduce power consumption and display modes to optimize presentations, spreadsheets and infographics. The LW650 is incredibly similar to the LH650, which arrived earlier this year. Key differences include the resolution: the new model has a native resolution of 1280x800 px WXGA, while the LH650 has a 1080p resolution. The aspect ratio is also different, with 16:10 offered by the LW650 and 16:9 for its predecessor. Another variation is the throw ratio, which is 1.21-1.57 for the WXGA projector and shorter at 1.15-1.5 for the 1080p model. Both models use a laser light source that delivers up to 4,000 ANSI lumens brightness and is expected to last for up to 20,000 hours. The projectors cover 90% of the Rec. 709 color space with 1.07 billion colors and a 3,000,000:1 contrast ratio. You can perfect the image with auto vertical and horizontal keystone correction tools and 1.3x zoom. Other tools include support for HDR10+, an integrated 10W speaker and ports including HDMI 2.0b/HDCP2.2, USB-A and USB-C with an 8.3 ms input lag. The pricing of the BenQ LW650 WXGA Laser Projector has yet to be announced. However, it will likely be cheaper than the BenQ LH650 Projector, priced at $1,199/\u00a31,206.45/\u20ac1,309.
