Every year, new graphics cards hit the market, each one promising better performance, higher frame rates, and an ever more immersive experience. AMD and NVIDIA have upped the ante this year in competition for Best GPU 2024, releasing GPUs packed with bleeding-edge tech that push gaming visuals further than ever before. From the affordable AMD Radeon RX 7600 that breezes through 1080p gaming to the mighty GeForce RTX 4080 that handles even the most demanding 4K titles with ease, we have covered it all this year. If you\u2019re looking to supercharge your gaming PC, these GPUs have everything you need this year, making up our Best GPU 2024 list. Writer: Brendan Frye NVIDIA never seems to stop pushing the boundaries of what a GPU can do, and the release of the RTX 4070 Founders Edition exemplifies this pursuit of excellence for the enthusiast gamer. Designed as a mid-range workhorse, this GPU delivers an uncompromised gaming experience at 1080p and 1440p resolutions, bringing all the latest NVIDIA features at a much more affordable price. While it may not be explicitly aimed at the hardcore 4K gaming crowd, a reasonable price and a host of impressive features make it an attractive proposition for everyone else. The GeForce RTX 4070 is easily one of the best-designed and most powerful GPUs available today, hitting a very competitive sweet spot for immersive and high-fidelity gaming. Investing in this GPU is worthwhile for those looking to enjoy the latest and greatest games without breaking the bank. The RTX 4070 Founders Edition revolutionizes mid-range gaming & creative performance, offering stunning visuals, cutting-edge features, and unmatched value. Writer: Joe Findlay The latest generation of GPUs has come out of the gate strong, and the ASUS TUF Gaming GeForce RTX 4070 OC Edition is no exception. To those who love gaming at high quality, you know you\u2019ll be able to do that. But if you are a content creator, congratulations. You\u2019ve opened up the door to top-notch encoding that will take your career as a streamer or an editor to the next level. At a price point of $679.99 USD, it is at the lower end of the 40 series GPUs and is a lot cheaper than I paid for my RTX 2060 during the pandemic, when supplies were so incredibly low. The performance for the cost is more than worth it, especially if you are doing more than JUST gaming. The ASUS TUF Gaming GeForce RTX 4070 OC Edition helps the avid gamer live their best life by keeping up with the evolution of video games, but where you get the full value of this GPU is when you use it for gaming AND to future-proof your content creation. Writer: Brendan Frye The RTX 4070 Ti GPU is here and ready to take on the competition. Slightly less powerful than other cards in the 40-series, the RTX 4070 Ti delivers where it counts, making it a mid-range card with teeth. While the launch has been somewhat overshadowed by reports of the cancelled 12GB 4080, the RTX 4070 Ti GPU stands as a formidable graphics card in NVIDIA\u2019s 40-series lineup. Despite some controversy surrounding the release of the GeForce RTX 4070 Ti, the new GPU offers impressive performance, coming in just behind the RX 7900 XT in synthetic benchmarks. However, when you sift through the data, the ASUS TUF Gaming GeForce RTX 4070 Ti OC Edition is the superior choice, given a GPU that is ready to take on a range of workloads and gaming tasks. Once you throw technology like DLSS into the mix, the choice is simple, for mid-range gaming, NVIDIA takes the crown with the RTX 4070 Ti. Hitting a much more attractive pricepoint while still delivering fantastic performance, the ASUS TUF RTX 4070 Ti is the GPU NVIDIA needed to give the public a reason to dive into the RTX 40 series. Writer: Brendan Frye The GPU market is getting very interesting, and AMD has just groped the gauntlet at NVIDIA\u2019s feet with the announcement of the AMD Radeon RX 7800 XT GPU at Gamescom. This new GPU is an intriguing addition to AMD\u2019s arsenal, filling a noticeable gap in the lineup based on the RDNA 3 architecture. Priced at $499 and set for a September 6, 2023, release, this card aims to go head-to-head with NVIDIA\u2019s GeForce RTX 4060 Ti and RTX 4070, and based on the specs, AMD seems to have pulled off a rather compelling proposition. The full RDNA 3 lineup has proven both powerful as well as aggressively priced to take on the competition. Considering the $499 price and the impressive numbers across the board, the Radeon RX 7800 XT managed to not only compare favourably to the more expensive RTX 4070 but even surpassed it in select tests. While AMD is still falling behind in ray tracing performance, Team Red has a solid offering in the Radeon RX 7800 XT, which stands as the best mid-range GPU you can currently buy. Given its aggressive pricing and impressive benchmark results, the Radeon RX 7800 XT becomes an almost automatic choice for gamers looking for high performance without breaking the bank.
