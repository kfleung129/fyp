Mark Zuckerberg this week published an update on Meta's artificial intelligence (AI) and the hardware that powers it in particular. By the end of the year Meta will have AI hardware with the performance equivalent to 600,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs. Apparently, Meta, which is known to be one of the major purchasers of Nvidia's H100 GPUs, buys many kinds AI processors, including AMD's Instinct MI300. A post shared by Mark Zuckerberg (@zuck) A photo posted by on \"We are currently training our next-gen model Llama 3, and we are building massive compute infrastructure to support our future roadmap, including 350,000 H100s by the end of this year \u2014 and overall almost 600,000 H100s equivalents of compute if you include other GPUs,\" Zuckerberg wrote in an\u00a0Instagram post. Based on data from Omdia,\u00a0Meta procured some 150,000 Nvidia GPUs in 2023\u00a0with only Microsoft being able to challenge it. Google, Amazon, Oracle, and Tencent could only get around 50,000 H100 GPUs each, based on the numbers from Omdia. As it turns out, Meta is now on track to buy and install hundreds of thousands of Nvidia H100 GPUs in the coming quarters. Whether Nvidia can fulfil the demand for its AI GPUs and AI-oriented Grace Hopper products is another question. Dylan Patel,\u00a0Chief Analyst\u00a0of\u00a0SemiAnalysis, models that Nvidia will be able to increase output of its Hopper-based products \u2014 the family that today includes\u00a0\u00a0H100, H200, GH100, GH200, and H20 \u2014 to 773,000 in Q1 2024 and then 811,000 in Q2 2024, which is an impressive growth considering the fact that the company shipped approximately\u00a0300,000 H100s in Q2 2023. What is interesting is that Zuckerberg notes that by the end of 2024 his company is going to have AI performance equivalent to 600,000 H100 GPUs. This probably indicates that Meta is going to add some all-new Nvidia Blackwell AI GPUs to its fleet (which is logical as its software is designed around CUDA-based processors) and then procure AI hardware from other suppliers. In fact, both Meta and Microsoft are procuring plenty of AMD's Instinct MI300 processors too, according to SemiAnalysis. \"While Nvidia has capacity to continue to grow in the 2nd half, the demand modeling we\u00a0have done indicates a fall off in Hopper demand as hyperscalers shift to looking towards Blackwell,\" Dylan Patel\u00a0told Tom's Hardware.\u00a0Meta and Microsoft are also buying significant MI300. Meta's longer-term goal is to build artificial general intelligence (AGI) that will be able not only to learn, generate, and respond, but also has\u00a0cognitive capabilities and\u00a0ability to\u00a0reason\u00a0its\u00a0decisions. To achieve this, Meta apparently brings its AGI and generative AI research efforts closer together. Meanwhile, Zuckerberg did not disclose whether existing hardware is enough to build working AGI models.
