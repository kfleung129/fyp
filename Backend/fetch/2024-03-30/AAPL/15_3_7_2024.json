(AP Photo/Kathy Willens, File) LONDON (AP) \u2014 European Union regulators said they want to question Apple over accusations that it blocked video game company Epic Games from setting up its own app store, in a possible violation of digital rules that took effect in the 27-nation bloc Thursday. It\u2019s a fresh escalation of the high-stakes battle between the two companies. Epic, maker of the popular game Fortnite, has spent years fighting Apple\u2019s exclusive control over the distribution of iPhone apps. Epic asserted Wednesday that Apple thwarted its attempt to set up its own iOS app marketplace to compete with Apple\u2019s App Store, calling it a breach of the EU\u2019s new Digital Markets Act. The sweeping set of rules, designed to stop big tech companies from cornering digital markets, have forced Apple to allow people in Europe to download iPhone apps from stores not operated by the U.S. tech giant \u2014 a move it\u2019s long resisted. The European Commission, the EU\u2019s top antitrust watchdog, said in a statement Thursday that it has \u201crequested further explanations on this from Apple under the DMA.\u201d The rules threaten penalties that could reach into the billions for violations. Apple has already been hit this week with a $2 billion EU antitrust fine for thwarting music streaming competition. The commission said it\u2019s \u201calso evaluating whether Apple\u2019s actions raise doubts on their compliance\u201d with other EU regulations including the Digital Services Act, a second set of regulations in the bloc\u2019s digital rulebook that prohibit tech companies from \u201darbitrary application\u201d of their terms and conditions.  Epic contended that Apple was brazenly violating the DMA by rejecting an alternative iPhone app store that it planned to set up in Sweden to serve European Union users. It accused Apple of retaliating for scathing critiques posted by CEO Tim Sweeney, who spearheaded a mostly unsuccessful antitrust case against the iPhone App Store in the U.S. Apple said its action was justified because of Epic\u2019s previous unlawful actions and litigation that resulted in the U.S. court decision in 2021. Apple ousted Epic from its App Store after it tried to get around restrictions that Apple says protect the security and privacy of iPhone users, while also helping recoup some of the investment that powers one of the world\u2019s most ubiquitous devices. \u201cEpic\u2019s egregious breach of its contractual obligations to Apple led courts to determine that Apple has the right to terminate \u2018any or all of Epic Games\u2019 wholly owned subsidiaries, affiliates, and/or other entities under Epic Games\u2019 control at any time and at Apple\u2019s sole discretion,\u2019\u201d Apple said in a statement. \u201cIn light of Epic\u2019s past and ongoing behavior, Apple chose to exercise that right.\u201d Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.
