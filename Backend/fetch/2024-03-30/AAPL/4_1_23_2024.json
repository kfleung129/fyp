    "text": "Like any other mainstream GPS app, Apple Maps does more than help you get from point A to point B. It also surfaces what\u2019s around you, whether you\u2019re on vacation, passing through an unfamiliar part of town, or settling into a new city. This facet of Apple Maps is vital to the survival of small businesses, which rely more than big chains on customers\u2019 ability to \u201cdiscover\u201d new places. If you don\u2019t know about a business, you can\u2019t spend your money there. But what happens when apps like Apple Maps represent those businesses incorrectly? Based on a recent example, they might lose thousands of dollars in lost patronage. According to Australia\u2019s ABC Sunshine Coast, a couple in Queensland found out through a regular that their Thai restaurant was labeled \u201cpermanently closed.\u201d \u201cWe have no idea when this change went through,\u201d co-owner Chris Pyatt told ABC. \u201cBut we have seen a sudden and drastic change in customer behavior towards the end of November and all of December. We've noted a significant downturn of around $12,000.\u201d (In US currency, that\u2019s about $7,877.) When Pyatt reached out to Apple to correct the listing, the company claimed it couldn\u2019t help Pyatt because he didn\u2019t own an Apple product. Pyatt was eventually able to open an Apple business account online, \u201cclaim\u201d his business, and then mark it as open. This resulted in the Pyatts\u2019 listing being moved to incorrect GPS coordinates, which had to be corrected. The Pyatts aren\u2019t the only business owners who have struggled with incorrect Apple Maps labels. Countless posts on Apple\u2019s Support Community forum claim businesses have switched to \u201cpermanently closed\u201d seemingly out of the blue, thus turning away customers who might have otherwise supported those businesses. \u201cThe clinic I work for is listed as permanently closed on Apple Maps, but we are open and fully operational with our regular hours,\u201d one post from 2021 reads. \u201cPeople are not showing up for appointments and when we call they say they saw that we were closed on Maps.\u00a0 It's hurting our business.\u201d Similar posts from 2023 reflect similar issues: incorrect labeling, lost customers, and difficulty correcting affected Apple Maps listings. It\u2019s unclear what causes businesses to be labeled as \u201cpermanently closed\u201d when they\u2019re fully operational. Business owners are supposed to be able to use Apple Business Connect to manage their organizations\u2019 listings. Still, some owners aren\u2019t aware of the program, and others find it difficult to use. One Redditor says their experience with Apple Business Connect is so poor that they rarely report issues with their listings anymore. Although they like the Apple Maps user experience more than Google Maps, the latter\u2019s business listing team usually responds to error reports within minutes.
