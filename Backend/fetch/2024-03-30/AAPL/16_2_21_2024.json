    "text": "Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Apple is taking an even bigger swing at sports. The company on Wednesday launched Apple Sports, a free app for the iPhone that delivers real-time scores, key statistics, and live betting odds. At launch, users will have access to live data from the NBA, NHL, and MLS, among other leagues. The app, Apple\u2019s first in the sports arena,\u00a0is being released ahead of March Madness,\u00a0offering\u00a0real-time data for both men\u2019s and women\u2019s NCAA basketball. Other leagues will be added over time, including the NFL and MLB. \u201cWe created Apple Sports to give sports fans what they want \u2014 an app that delivers incredibly fast access to scores and stats,\u201d said Eddy Cue, Apple\u2019s senior vice president of Services who oversees the app and was personally involved in its creation. The app, which will not include\u00a0advertising at its launch, represents Apple\u2019s latest dive into the world of sports, a multibillion-dollar business that technology companies have made recent entrants into, challenging the legacy media companies who have traditionally held the lucrative broadcast rights.\u00a0It also threatens to upend the mobile sports app space that has long been dominated by advertising-supported apps from ESPN and others. Apple has in recent years struck deals with various sports leagues, such as the MLB and MLS, to stream games on its Apple TV+ streaming service. Amazon, a chief rival in the technology and streaming industry,\u00a0has started exclusively airing \u201cThursday Night Football\u201d and an NFL\u00a0game on\u00a0Black Friday. While Apple Sports can alert users to where a game is being broadcast, it will not stream games directly inside the app, instead pointing users to the correct app to watch the action. Technology and media companies are increasingly eyeing sports rights to amass a paying audience for their streaming services. In recent months, the NFL playoffs and Super Bowl shattered ratings records and NBCUniversal\u2019s exclusive Peacock broadcast of a wild card game led to the biggest single day of streaming on record, according to Nielsen.
