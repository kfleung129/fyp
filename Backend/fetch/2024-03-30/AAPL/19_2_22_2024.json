This strong showing has fueled speculation that the stock could reach the coveted $2 trillion market cap, joining an elite group of tech giants. Rallying From Strength:\u00a0The stock\u2019s upward trajectory began in early 2023, capitalizing on Nvidia\u2019s early leadership in artificial intelligence (AI) technology. CEO\u00a0Jensen Huang\u00a0commented on the company\u2019s performance and outlook, stating, \u201cAccelerated computing and generative AI have hit the tipping point. Demand is surging worldwide across companies, industries and nations.\u201d Price Target Boost:\u00a0Following the impressive quarterly report,\u00a0KeyBanc Capital Markets\u00a0boosted Nvidia\u2019s price target. Analyst\u00a0John Vinh\u00a0maintained an Overweight rating and increased the target from $740 to $1,100, representing a significant 49% jump. This new target suggests the stock has roughly 63% upside potential from current levels. Thesis for Growth:\u00a0Vinh attributed Nvidia\u2019s success to several factors, including strong Data Center revenue driven by major \u201chyper scalers\u201d like\u00a0Alphabet\u00a0(Google),\u00a0Microsoft,\u00a0Amazon,\u00a0Meta,\u00a0Apple,\u00a0Alibaba,\u00a0Baidu, and\u00a0Huawei. He also highlighted improved chip supply in the quarter. Source: Y Charts See Also:\u00a0Best Artificial Intelligence Stocks Revenue and Earnings:\u00a0Nvidia\u2019s first-quarter revenue guidance of $24 billion (plus or minus 2%) exceeded the consensus of $22.2 billion. This translates to an expected earnings per share of $5.41, exceeding the $5 per share consensus. Vinh attributed this strong outlook to surging demand for the H100 platform and InfiniBand, resulting in a 409% year-over-year revenue growth in the Data Center business. Global Reach:\u00a0All regions except China witnessed strong performance, with the company starting alternative GPU shipments below export thresholds to address the Chinese market. Looking ahead, Vinh expects continued growth in the Data Center and Pro Viz segments, while Gaming revenue might decline compared to the previous quarter. The H200 AI chip is anticipated to ramp up in the second quarter, while initial demand for the B200 AI chip exceeded supply. See Also:\u00a0How To Buy Nvidia (NVDA) Stock Optimistic Outlook:\u00a0Vinh expressed enthusiasm for Nvidia\u2019s future, stating, \u201cWe\u2019re encouraged by these impressive results. We maintain our Overweight rating and view NVDA as best positioned in the semiconductor industry to benefit from Gen AI.\u201d Reaching $2 Trillion:\u00a0To reach the $2 trillion market cap, Nvidia\u2019s stock would need to reach $804, given its 2.49 million outstanding shares. This translates to a necessary increase of $129.28, or 19.16%, from Wednesday\u2019s closing price. Currently, only Microsoft, Apple, and\u00a0Saudi Aramco\u00a0boast valuations exceeding $2 trillion.
