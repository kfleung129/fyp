    "text": "Beats selected Atlanta United, Columbus Crew, Inter Miami, LAFC, Nashville SC, NYCFC, St. Louis City SC and Toronto FCBeats/MLS Apple-owned consumer audio brand Beats by Dr. Dre will produce custom headphones for players on eight MLS clubs this season as part of a new global marketing partnership with the league. Financial terms of the four-year deal were not disclosed, but both parties confirmed it is additive on top of the league\u2019s 10-year, $2.5B media partnership with Apple. The agreement makes Beats the league\u2019s official consumer audio products partner, a designation previously held by JLab Audio. Beats selected eight clubs -- Atlanta United, Columbus Crew, Inter Miami, LAFC, Nashville SC, NYCFC, St. Louis City SC and Toronto FC -- to provide with hand-painted headphones in 2024. Other clubs will follow throughout the partnership. Beats CMO Chris Thorne said that the brand has recently increased its efforts in the soccer space, including through a partnership with Manchester City F Erling Haaland, to resonate with the sport\u2019s younger fan base. \u201cWhat we love is so many of the fans appear to be the Gen Z youthful audience that Beats has forever resonated with since we started,\u201d Thorne said. \u201cA huge focus for us the past few years has been how do we continue to stay youthful, creating great products that audience loves and then how do we connect with them.\u201d RELATED:\u00a0MLS Season Preview: The Messi Effect MLS Exec VP/Apple Partnership, Properties, & Events Camilo Durana said the partnership with Beats is a natural extension of some of the initiatives the two companies have engaged in already around Apple Music, such as themed playlists. He believes highlighting the connection between soccer and music will deepen fans\u2019 connection with their favorite players and teams. \u201cBy allowing our players to wear Beats on the field as they warm up for games and go through their routines, we can start to think big and connect the dots between that visual, share player playlists with fans, further tell their stories of where they're from and why they're choosing certain music,\u201d Camilo said. RELATED:\u00a0SBJ Q&A: MLS Commissioner Don Garber Beats also plans to announce partnerships with several MLS players this year. Thorne wouldn\u2019t disclose whether that group will include Lionel Messi, but he noted that the brand received a massive amount of attention last season when it helped the Inter Miami star gift his new teammates custom Beats headphones. \u201cI had more requests for that headphone than any other that we\u2019ve made,\u201d Thorne said.
