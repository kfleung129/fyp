    "text": "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is not backing down in taking shots at Tim Cook and Apple. After taking potshots at the Apple Vision Pro, Zuckerberg is now asking advertisers to boycott Apple\u2019s iPhone, iOS and App Store businesses After taking shots at Apple\u2019s mixed reality headset, the Vision Pro, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has now trained his guns at Apple\u2019s iPhone, iOS and App Store businesses. The feud between the tech giants escalated when Meta Platforms released guidelines advising advertisers to use a workaround to evade a hefty 30 per cent service fee charged by Apple. This workaround is specifically targeted at \u201cboosted posts,\u201d a popular advertising feature offered by Meta for Facebook and Instagram, as per a report by The Wall Street Journal. Boosted posts, which allow users to enhance the visibility of their content by purchasing advertisements directly through their smartphones, generate substantial revenue for Meta, particularly from small businesses. Starting later this month, Meta plans to impose an additional 30 per cent surcharge on US advertisers who continue to purchase boosted posts through iPhone and iPad apps. Meta is planning to pass the burden of Apple\u2019s fees to its consumers, rather than paying it from their end. In response to Apple\u2019s mandate, Meta Platforms asserted in a blog post on Thursday, \u201cWe are compelled to either adhere to Apple\u2019s directives or remove boosted posts from our applications. We opt to retain the boosting feature to support small enterprises, ensuring their continued access to an effective promotional tool.\u201d To circumvent Apple\u2019s service charge, Meta is advising advertisers reliant on boosted posts to access the Facebook and Instagram websites via desktop or mobile web browsers. In contrast, Apple maintains that its App Store guidelines apply uniformly to all developers. A company spokesperson stated, \u201cApple collaborated with Meta for over a year to facilitate compliance with the revised policy.\u201d Additionally, Meta Platforms announced modifications to its pricing structure, stipulating that advertisers purchasing boosted posts through Apple devices must prepay for advertising campaigns. However, prepayment is not obligatory for advertisers utilizing Meta\u2019s websites, and those who prepay through Meta\u2019s platforms will be exempt from Apple\u2019s service fee when boosting posts within Facebook and Instagram iOS apps. The conflict between Meta Platforms and Apple extends beyond boosted posts. Notably, in 2021, Apple implemented privacy modifications to its mobile devices, which Meta estimated would result in a $10 billion revenue loss in 2022. Tensions have further heightened in 2024, with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg publicly criticizing Apple\u2019s recent initiatives, including its decision to permit third-party app stores on mobile devices to comply with European regulations. Meta had long been gearing up to launch its own app store for Apple\u2019s mobile devices. However, Zuckerberg expressed dismay after witnessing Apple\u2019s announcement, stating that their offering was overly burdensome and contradictory to the spirit of European law. He believed it would pose significant challenges for any company considering serious engagement with it. Zuckerberg\u2019s criticisms intensified as he assessed Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, comparing it unfavourably to Meta\u2019s Quest 3 device. In a video uploaded to his Instagram page, Zuckerberg expressed surprise at the Vision Pro\u2019s $3,500 price tag, limited app selection, discomfort, and wired battery pack, asserting that the Quest 3 offers superior functionality despite its lower cost.
