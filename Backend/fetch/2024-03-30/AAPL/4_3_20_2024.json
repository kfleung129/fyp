    "text": "STORY: Apple is set to be sued by the U.S. Department of Justice over alleged antitrust violations. That\u2019s according to reports Wednesday by Bloomberg. It says the legal action could come as soon as Thursday. The case would reportedly cover allegations that the firm blocked rivals from accessing hardware and software features on iPhones. More precise details aren\u2019t yet known. However, device makers such as smart-tracker firm Tile have complained that Apple restricts how they can work with its handsets. The tech giant went on to develop its own AirTag trackers some years after Tile's had hit the market. Apple has also faced criticism for restricting access to contactless payments. Credit cards can only be added using its own Apple Pay system. There was no immediate comment on the report from the company or DOJ officials. However, action against Big Tech has been one of the few ideas with bipartisan appeal in Washington over recent years. Now a new case against Apple would be the Justice Department\u2019s third in 14 years. But it would be the first to accuse the firm of illegally maintaining its dominant position. Apple is also in the midst of an antitrust-related tussle with Fortnite-maker Epic Games. Microsoft and other firms have joined Epic in claiming the iPhone-maker has made it hard for consumers to pay for content except through its own app store. "
