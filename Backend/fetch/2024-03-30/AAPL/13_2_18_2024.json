    "text": "Apple could face an antitrust fine of about 500 million Euros ($539 million) on grounds of an alleged breach of the competition law in the EU, according to Financial Times. EU commission's first-ever fine on Apple will reportedly be a part of a 2019 case that started post Spotify's formal complaint. Cupertino-based tech giant Apple is all set to face an antitrust fine of roughly 500 million Euros ($539 million) on grounds of an alleged breach of the competition law in the European Union, citing sources, Financial Times reported. The fine will likely be announced next month. For the unaware, in 2023, the European Commission accused the tech giant of thwarting competition in the music streaming space using the App Store rulebook and subdued developers from apprising users about alternative methods to subscribe to their service.  \nEU commission's first-ever fine on Apple could be a part of a 2019 case that started post Spotify's formal complaint. The point of tension was Apple's bottleneck to stop users from subscribing to streaming apps via methods beyond the App Store and bypassing the commission offered to Apple through in-app purchases. According to 9To5Mac, the practice is known as anti-steering provisions of the App Store. \n\nAlso Read:\u00a0iOS 17.4: Apple Set To Introduce Sideloading And Third-Party App Stores On iPhones In EU; All You Need To Know  \nWhile the provisions apply on a larger scale, in the EU's case, these concern the repercussions on music streaming services. With all the stated restrictions, Apple Music gets an unfair advantage over the apps of other developers, which sums up the EU's stand. The report noted that while the outcome won't push the company to allow alternative in-app payments, music streaming apps can add a link to subscribe to their services\u00a0(which may offer lower rates) and evade the commission offered to Apple. \n\nThe recent fine update comes amid Apple's announcement\u00a0to comply with the EU's Digital Markets Act.

For more controls on the promotion of subscription tiers, Spotify aims to add a link to its website. This comes in the backdrop of the new announcements from Apple with reference to the Digital Markets Act in the EU.  \nAlso Read:\u00a0Apple Will Face 'Strong Action' If App Store Alterations Fail To Meet DMA Regulations, Says EU's Industry Chief | Details \nWhile the tech giant will allow alternative payment methods, a commission of 17 per cent shall go inside Apple's purse if Spotify continues to mark an appearance on the App Store. Plus, a 'Core Technology Fee' worth 50 Euro cent per installation per year will apply too.
