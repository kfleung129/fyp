What Happened: Despite Apple\u2019s vigorous opposition, Oregon\u2019s Governor\u00a0Tina Kotek\u00a0signed SB 1596 into law on Wednesday. This legislation aims to facilitate consumer and third-party repairs. The\u00a0bill is the first of\u00a0its kind to prohibit parts pairing, a practice where specific\u00a0components, such as the screen\u00a0or battery, are matched with the original iPhone. This practice reportedly ensures the use of genuine parts and enhances device security during repairs. However, critics argue that part pairing restricts consumer choice, limits third-party repair options, and contributes to significant electronic waste.

Electronic waste is growing five times faster than our electronics recycling capacity, according to last week's\u00a0United Nations Global E-Waste Monitor\u00a0report. We need to cut down the insane cycle of churning through personal electronics\u2014and that starts by empowering repair,\u201d said Nathan Proctor, PIRG Right to Repair campaign senior director. He added, \u201cOregon's nation-leading Right to Repair law will keep devices working and off the scrap heap.\u201d The bill also mandates companies to provide\u00a0the same parts, tools, and\u00a0repair documents to owners as they do to repair shops without charging extra.\u00a0The law does not apply\u00a0to phones sold before July\u00a01, 2021, but covers\u00a0other consumer electronics sold after\u00a0July 1, 2015. Why It Matters: Apple\u2019s opposition to the right-to-repair movement has been a long-standing issue. The company\u2019s practices have faced criticism from various quarters, including its own co-founder,\u00a0Steve Wozniak, who\u00a0voiced support for the movement in 2021.

However, in 2023, California became the third state to pass a\u00a0Right to Repair bill, which was interestingly backed by Apple. Previously, AppleInsider noted that it may appear odd that Apple backs right-to-repair legislation in one state while opposing it in another. Still, it is important to note that Oregon\u2019s bill differs in a crucial aspect\u2014it imposes restrictions on parts pairing.
