    "text": "Published By:  S Aadeetya IANS Last Updated: February 25, 2024, 12:00 IST Delhi, India The big demand for iPhone means Apple is laughing its way into the country Apple\u2019s revenue in India rose nearly 42 percent (on-year) last year to $8.7 billion, foreign brokerage Morgan Stanley said in a report on Friday. According to the report, iPhone shipments grew about 39 percent to 9.2 million units last year. \u201cIn CY23, India represented 4 percent of iPhones shipments and revenue, up from 3 percent in CY22 and 1 percent 5 years ago,\u201d said analysts in the report. \u201cIf India continues to grow at the same trajectory while China iPhone shipments stay flat, India would be a bigger iPhone market than China by 2027,\u201d it added. TechCrunch was first to report on Apple India\u2019s 2023 revenue. Apple registered strong double-digit growth in the December quarter in India, reaching another quarter revenue record in the country, company\u2019s CEO Tim Cook said earlier this month. Responding to an analyst\u2019s questions, Cook said that the India market \u201chit a quarter revenue record\u201d. India\u2019s smartphone shipments remained flat in 2023 at 152 million units, but Apple reached the 10-million-unit mark in shipments and captured the top position in revenue in a calendar year for the first time. In a bid to further boost mobile manufacturing in the country, the government in January slashed import duty on parts used for manufacturing of mobile phones to 10 percent from 15 percent. The move will help companies like Apple to manufacture more of its high-end premium smartphones in the country. "
