Last week, Bloomberg  reported that the multibillion-dollar project had finally been scrapped. Reports about the electric vehicle never quite seemed real, but now we have many new details about the car that never was thanks to an excellent post-mortem from Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman.

Famed Apple designer Jony Ive thought the interior should be \u201ccovered in stainless steel, wood and white fabric,\u201d and that it should only come in one color: white. Since any actual mock-ups of the car, which Gurman says was sometimes referred to as the \u201cBread Loaf,\u201d are presumably locked deep inside a well-guarded Apple office, I did the next best thing and asked AI. The results are, actually, kind of cute? Copilot reallllly wanted it to have a steering wheel. AI stocks like Kinaxis (TSX:KXS) are rallying in the markets.
