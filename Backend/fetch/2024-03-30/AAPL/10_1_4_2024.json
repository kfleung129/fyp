    "text": " Apple (AAPL.US) shares have recently come under pressure after analysts at several Wall Street funds saw a threat to the company's further expansion. On Tuesday, Barclays and today Piper Sandler decided to change their rating from 'overweight' to 'neutral', lowering their target price by $15, to $205 per share. The giant's shares are losing 1% before the open. Will Apple be a company highly sensitive to a possible 'recession'? Apple will report Q4 2023 results on February 1, 2024. Looking at the chart of Apple shares, we see a bearish double peak formation above $200 per share, previous price reactions, the 23.6 Fibonacci retracement and the dynamics of the SMA200 moving average as well as the extent of the previous correction in the uptrend suggest that the stock may seek to test the $170 level. On the other hand, the RSI indicator at 33 points suggests an oversold condition. Source: xStation5 This content has been created by XTB S.A.
