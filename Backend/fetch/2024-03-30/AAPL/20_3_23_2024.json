    "text": "The United States has launched an antitrust lawsuit against tech giant Apple, alleging that the company has maneuvered to create a monopoly to cripple competitors and make it difficult for consumers to leave. Vittoria Elliot and Brian Barrett report at Wired, Claiming that Apple had established an \u201ciPhone monopoly,\u201d\u00a0the suit\u00a0argues that the company\u2019s allegedly anticompetitive behavior resounds well beyond smartphones themselves. It cites financial services, fitness, gaming, media, and more as industries affected by Apple\u2019s \u201cwalled garden\u201d\u00a0approach. Apple is resisting the suit strongly, claiming that it would undermine its ability to create products and services that make it unique, and that it would give the government dangerous precedent to control the technology that people use. The suit comes amid the debates in Congress on whether banning TikTok in the United States is a good idea. Many TikTok critics are applauding the bipartisan support for the ban, but others point out that banning one tech platform could give the government precedent to ban others for less obvious, and perhaps politically motivated, reasons. Apple has promised to fight the lawsuit, which may be the most aggressive it has yet to face.
