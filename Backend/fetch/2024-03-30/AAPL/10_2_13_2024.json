Republican FCC Commission Brendan Carr said the agency should investigate Apple over its move to block the \u201cBeeper Mini\u201d app that allowed Android users to access iMessage. Carr \u2013 a frequent critic of Apple and other Big Tech firms \u2013 expressed concern that the Cupertino, Calif.-based company had violated the Federal Communications Commission\u2019s Part 14 rules.\u201d The rules require that \u201cadvanced communications services\u201d must be accessible to people with disabilities. \u201cBeeper bridged the \u201cblue bubble-green bubble\u201d divide that Apple maintains as part of a broader set of walled garden practices that inhibit competition,\u201d Carr said Monday. \u201cApple\u2019s wider set of exclusionary practices warrant scrutiny by antitrust and competition agencies, but the FCC should also examine this particular incident through the lens of our Part 14 rules on accessibility, usability, and compatibility,\u201d the commissioner added. Apple has long limited access to its encrypted iMessage service to its own devices, with Android users appearing as a dreaded \u201cgreen bubble\u201d when they text iPhone users. Beeper Mini briefly allowed Android users to seamlessly interface with iMessage and gain access to in-app features such as emojis. Today, I called for the @FCC to investigate whether Apple violated our Part 14 rules by blocking Beeper Mini \u2013 an app that enabled interoperability between iOS & Android messaging.Beeper bridged the \u201cblue bubble \u2013 green bubble\u201d divide that Apple maintains as part of a broader\u2026 pic.twitter.com/vxefQZKDXb Apple changed iMessage\u2019s settings to block Beeper Mini\u2019s access in December. The company has argued that enabling third-party access would create user privacy and device security risks. Carr pointed to FCC rules which state that covered providers \u201cshall not install network features, functions, or capabilities that impede accessibility or usability.\u201d Apple and the FCC did not immediately return requests for comment. If it were to proceed, an FCC probe would mark yet another headache for Apple at a time of increased scrutiny over its business practices. Late last year, the US International Trade Commission forced Apple to stop selling some of its smartwatches after determining it had infringed on a patent for testing blood oxygen levels. Apple is appealing the decision. Carr is one of many policymakers who have expressed concern about Apple\u2019s conduct toward Beeper Mini. In December, a bipartisan group of four lawmakers \u2014 Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Mike Lee (R-Utah) and US Reps. Jerry Nadler (D-NY) and Ken Buck (R-Colo.) \u2013 asked the Justice Department to investigate whether Apple broke antitrust laws by blocking Beeper. \u201cWe also fear these types of tactics may more broadly chill future investment,\u201d\u00a0the lawmakers said. The DOJ could file an antitrust lawsuit against Apple by as soon as March, Bloomberg reported last month. The feds are reportedly set to argue that Apple engages in anticompetitive practices to ensure the continued dominance of its iPhone ecosystem. Advertisement "
