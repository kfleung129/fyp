    "text": "CUPERTINO: Apple agreed to pay $490 million to settle a class-action lawsuit that alleged Chief Executive Tim Cook defrauded shareholders by concealing falling demand for iPhones in China. A preliminary settlement was filed on Friday with the US District Court in Oakland, California, and requires approval by US District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers. It stemmed from Apple\u2019s unexpected announcement on Jan 2, 2019 that the iPhone maker would slash its quarterly revenue forecast by up to $9 billion, blaming US-China trade tensions. Cook had told investors on an Nov 1, 2018, analyst call that although Apple faced sales pressure in markets such as Brazil, India, Russia and Turkey, where currencies had weakened,  \u201cI would not put China in that category.\u201d  Apple told suppliers a few days later to curb production. The lowered revenue forecast was Apple\u2019s first since the iPhone\u2019s launch in 2007. Shares of Apple fell 10pc the next day, wiping out $74bn of market value. Apple and its lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the ruling. The Cupertino, Califor\u00adnia-based company denied liability, but settled to avoid the cost and distraction of litigation, court papers show. Shawn Williams, a partner at Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd representing the shareholders, called the settlement an  \u201coutstanding result\u201d for the class. The settlement covers investors who bought Apple shares in the two months between Cook\u2019s comments and the revenue forecast.
