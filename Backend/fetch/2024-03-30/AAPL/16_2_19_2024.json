You can set a full-screen picture of your contact and select a template you like. After selected, the Contact Poster will appear whenever you receive a call from those contacts. But some users complain that the Contact Posters are not working on their iPhones. If you are also facing the same, here are some working solutions to help you fix Contact Posters not working on iPhone. The first solution we recommend is checking whether Name and Photo Sharing is enabled for your contact card. This is when your Contact Poster is not visible to others while calling or you can\u2019t see someone\u2019s contact poster. Here\u2019s how to check and enable the same. Step 1: Open the Contacts app on your iPhone. Step 2: Tap on your Contact Card at the top. Step 3: Tap on Contact Photo and Poster. Step 4: Tap the toggle next to Name & Photo Sharing to enable the feature. Step 5: Ensure that the option of Share Automatically is selected to Contacts Only. Step 6: Go back and check if the problem is solved. If the Contact Photo and Poster are still disabled on your iPhone, you can delete and add the Contact Poster again. Here\u2019s how. Step 1: Open the Contacts app on your iPhone. Step 2: Select the contact name whose Contact Poster is not visible. Step 3: Tap on Contact Photo and Poster below the contact name. Step 4: Swipe up the selected Contact Poster design and tap the Delete icon to remove it. Step 5: Tap on Delete again at the bottom to confirm. Step 6: Tap the Plus icon at the bottom-right corner to add the Contact Poster again. Step 7: When added, tap on Done at the top-right corner to confirm. Check if the problem is solved. Another solution suggested by a few users is checking if iMessage is enabled on your iPhone. This is a solution that seems to have worked for some of those users who are facing the same issue. Here\u2019s how to check the same. Step 1: Open the Settings app on your iPhone. Step 2: Scroll down and tap on Messages. Step 3: Scroll down and check if iMessage has been enabled on your iPhone. If not, tap the toggle next to iMessage to enable it. Step 4: Close the Settings app and check if the problem is solved.
