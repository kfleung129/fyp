    "text": "The Tech Outlook - Daily Tech News, Interviews, Reviews and Updates Apple\u2019s electric car project known as Project Titan has been going on for years now and the company has also invested a lot of money in this decade-long project. The company was planning to introduce a fully autonomous electric vehicle but now surprisingly this project has been terminated by the company. It is said that the company had faced numerous challenges in this project and had finally decided to shut it down. This decision by Apple has received mixed reactions on social media platforms According to MacRumors some employees within the company have suspected this project and referred to the car as \u201cThe Titanic Disaster\u201d rather than \u201cProject Titan.\u201d Although it was expected that Apple\u2019s decision might also cause havoc in the stock market @mingchikuo revealed on the X platform that it might seem like a big deal, but no stock in the world has gone up or down after this decision. He also stated that this shows the stock markets have since long stopped caring whether Apple wants to make the Apple Car or not. As per reports, employees working on this project will be shifted to work on generative artificial intelligence. Apple has not officially commented anything on the shutdown of this decade-long project.
