Get features like Apple has been sued by the US Department of Justice and 15 states as it was alleged that the iPhone maker monopolized smartphone market, hurt smaller rivals and drove up prices. With this, Apple joins competitors sued by regulators, including Alphabet's, Google, Meta Platforms and Amazon.com. Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement, \u201cConsumers should not have to pay higher prices because companies violate the antitrust laws. If left unchallenged, Apple will only continue to strengthen its smartphone monopoly.\u201d The company is also said to be facing probes in Europe related to whether it is complying with the Digital Markets Act.

The company- which was once the world\u2019s most valuable firm at more than $3 trillion-has underperformed both the Nasdaq 100 and the S&P 500 in 2024. The US suit accuses Apple of blocking rivals from accessing hardware and software features on its popular devices while the possible investigations in Europe will focus on the firm\u2019s new fees, terms and conditions for app store developers.

The company also vowed to \u201cvigorously defend against it\" but did not respond to potential probes in Europe. \u201cAt Apple, we innovate every day to make technology people love \u2014 designing products that work seamlessly together, protect people\u2019s privacy and security, and create a magical experience for our users,\u201d the company said, adding, \u201cThis lawsuit threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets.\u201d Follow the latest breaking news and developments from India and around the world with Hindustan Times' newsdesk.
