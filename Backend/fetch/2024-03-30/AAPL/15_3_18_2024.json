Apple made plans to integrate Google\u2019s Gemini AI engine into its smartphones, a deal that could make iPhones sharper than ever before. What does this mean? Apple\u2019s investors have been hoping for an AI breakthrough worthy of the company\u2019s signature launch events. So far, though, the firm hasn\u2019t revealed anything worth lining up for \u2013 and now, it\u2019s considering fitting out iPhones with Gemini. Apple will be hoping investors respect the innovation, no matter whose name is on the patent: the stock\u2019s down over 6% this year, its worst performance against the Nasdaq 100 index at this time of year in over a decade. Google\u2019s investors won\u2019t mind the collaboration, of course. The deal would be Gemini\u2019s highest-profile partnership to date \u2013 so long as Apple doesn\u2019t sidle up to another competitor like OpenAI before signing the dotted line. Why should I care? For markets: Stick to the status quo. David Ricardo\u2019s \u201ccomparative advantage\u201d theory argues that firms should focus on what they do best and delegate the rest. If you buy that, Apple\u2019s move is more shrewd than sluggish. So sure, Apple has problems: iPhone sales are losing their pace, electric vehicle blueprints are essentially in the trash, and regulators are donning their reading glasses. But with a spotless record of keeping profit in check and innovating when it\u2019s least expected, it\u2019ll probably take a lot more bad news for top investors to ditch their Apple a day. The bigger picture: Forget the headlines. AI-obsessed investors have sent Magnificent Seven stocks to the front of the pack. So now that the obvious picks have quite the price tags, Goldman Sachs\u2019 best advice is to check out companies that are expected to use AI to better their books, rather than the ones churning out new high-tech products. That means pulling your eyes away from the likes of Nvidia and Meta, and taking a look at less flashy options like Walmart, Kohl\u2019s, or Accenture. ai alphabet apple information technology magnificent seven tech stocks us adobe ads dividends stocks Disclaimer: These articles are provided for information purposes only.
