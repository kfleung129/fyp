All three versions of the Apple AirPods are now on sale at Amazon. The retailer has the wildly popular (and newest) Apple AirPods Pro for a special $234 price. Shoppers can also snag its other wireless Bluetooth earbuds at a discount, including the wired charging case model for $139 and the wireless charging version for $140 \u2014 its lowest Amazon price to date. Apple AirPods with Wired Charging Case, $139 (orig. $159) Apple AirPods with Wireless Charging Case, $139.98 (orig. $199) Apple AirPods Pro, $234 (orig. $249) While the brand\u2019s AirPods Pro are the best choice if you\u2019re after the latest features (like a noise-cancelling mode and sweat-resistant design), its wireless charging AirPods are the best deal thanks to their steep 30 percent discount \u2014 which is pretty much unheard of for Apple. You can save nearly $60 on the wireless charging version, making them just about the same price as the AirPods with a wired charging case. The $140 style has racked up 12,500 five-star reviews and comes with up to five hours of listening time on a single charge, plus an additional 24 hours of battery with the charging case. And just like Apple\u2019s other AirPods, the top-rated gadget offers fast and easy Bluetooth pairing as well as on-ear controls that allow you to take calls or skip songs without grabbing your phone. You really can\u2019t go wrong with any of these headphones, which have all earned thousands of perfect ratings and praise-filled reviews. But if you are after the incredible $140 deal on the wireless charging AirPods, you\u2019ll have to move fast. All three deals are at risk of selling out, especially the 30 percent off markdown, so be sure to grab the pair you\u2019re after while they\u2019re still in stock. Buy It!
