Invest Now The biggest challenge that the Department of Justice has in winning its antitrust case against Apple Inc is this: The iPhone is really, really awesome. I\u2019m not trying to be\u00a0droll. The iPhone\u2019s quality, and the way in which Apple continues to make it so, goes to the heart of the case filed against the company\u00a0on Thursday morning. And it makes any potential remedy a touchy subject. Levelling the playing field invariably\u00a0means adding complication, friction and insecurity to a device that became successful because Apple was able to engineer away all of those things. Unlike other recent antitrust cases filed against big technology companies, in which regulators have targeted\u00a0Google\u2019s search deal with Apple\u00a0andAmazon.com Inc\u2019s\u00a0tactics on price manipulation, this long-awaited filing against one of the richest US companies\u00a0seeks to draw strength from its breadth, focusing on several crucial parts of Apple\u2019s competitive \u201cmoat.\u201d After a five-year investigation, here are the chief\u00a0points the government\u00a0is\u00a0bringing to court: * It says the company prevents the existence of super apps \u2014 that is, apps that contain more apps within them, like a digital shopping mall. It means competitors must launch their apps in Apple\u2019s store\u00a0with its onerous controls and expensive fees. * It says the company blocks \u201ccloud streaming apps\u201d that would allow, for example, streaming of games over the cloud, something that would reduce\u00a0the need to have a more powerful smartphone \u2014 i.e the latest iPhone. * It goes after what users will know best as the \u201cgreen bubble effect,\u201d the clunky\u00a0experience of sending and receiving messages between the iPhone\u2019s iMessage app and smartphones that run\u00a0Google\u2019s Android operating system. Videos sent by Android users to the iPhone appear grainy and low quality \u2014 an artificial restriction concocted by Apple to benefit itself, regulators argue, creating a \u201csocial stigma.\u201d * It says Apple\u2019s tight integration between the Apple Watch and the iPhone prevents people from switching smartphones, accusing Apple of \u201chaving copied the idea of a smartwatch from third-party developers.\u201d * And it says Apple is blocking developers from creating their own digital wallets that can use the iPhone\u2019s near-field communication chip to use tap-to-pay. In sum, the complaint contends: \u201cApple reinforces the moat around its smartphone monopoly not by making its products more attractive to users, but by discouraging innovation that threatens Apple\u2019s smartphone monopoly or the disintermediation of the iPhone.\u201d I disagree with that framing. As any iPhone user knows, Apple clearly does both: It uses its maniacal control over the user experience on the iPhone to make it a\u00a0vastly\u00a0superior smartphone that is more attractive to consumers. But in doing so, it shuts out competitors in a manner that has anticompetitive side effects\u00a0because of the iPhone\u2019s scale. Attempts to remedy this situation could be painful, unpopular and have a high chance of failure. Just ask iPhone users in Europe, where regulators enforced their tough\u00a0new rules to increase mobile browser competition \u2014 and\u00a0all users\u00a0got was a\u00a0lousy menu. Hardly a tectonic shift in the competitive landscape. Apple\u2019s authoritarianism is what makes an iPhone an iPhone and not an Android. Fans of that competing platform will\u00a0eagerly say it can\u00a0do everything\u00a0an iPhone can do\u00a0while ignoring the fact that the user experience is a steaming hot mess \u2014 particularly for less tech savvy users who aren\u2019t as vigilant in keeping out nasty apps\u00a0or for whom too many separate apps doing similar things would be massively confusing. (It\u2019s no coincidence that when my father\u00a0calls with a tech support question, it\u2019s always about his Android phone, never his Apple iPad.) Forcing Apple to open up to competition\u00a0in the way the Justice Department is demanding would degrade the iPhone experience. Would it be better for users, for instance, if their\u00a0credit cards, plane tickets and IDs\u00a0were squirreled\u00a0away in different apps for banks, airlines and everything else? Or would they rather have them, as Apple currently forces, in a single wallet they knew was secure? (Or to put it another way: How many physical wallets does the typical person carry?) Would it be better for users if, instead of Apple deciding what apps are safe, individual companies could\u00a0make their own decisions through their own \u201cmini\u201d app stores? More democratic, maybe, but more open to abuse. The Apple Watch, meanwhile, finds its value in the software and hardware integration between it and the iPhone \u2014 including the secure monitoring and storing of health data. Could Apple make it compatible with Android? Yes, with trade-offs. But why should it? Shouldn\u2019t competition come from Google doing something similar with its Pixel phone and a wearable? Indeed, Google tried, acquiring fitness device-maker FitBit in 2021 for $2.1 billion; it has since run the once-competitive\u00a0brand and its products into the ground. Saying Apple \u201ccopied\u201d the smartwatch is like arguing Ferrari copied the Model T because Ford\u2019s car had four tires\u00a0and a steering wheel. The annoyance at the \u201cgreen bubble\u201d has some credibility \u2014\u00a0the limitations Apple has imposed are petty \u2014\u00a0but a remedy arguably already exists\u00a0in that users can already choose to use (free) interoperable services like Whatsapp or Signal. In fact, the US is\u00a0just about the only country\u00a0in which this is even an issue. More may come out during a trial, but there are no real smoking guns in the government\u2019s filing. One comment in particular, attributed to an unidentified\u00a0\u201cApple Manager,\u201d highlights the dichotomy. Allowing super apps, this manager wrote, would \u201clet the barbarians in at the gate,\u201d which is almost certainly true. It would also mean \u201ciOS stickiness goes down.\u201d Through examples like this, Apple will be able to credibly argue that the \u201canticompetitive\u201d move was first and foremost the right one for its users. Of all the recent legal actions against technology companies\u00a0emanating from the joint assaults of the\u00a0Federal Trade Commission and Justice Department, the case against Apple seems the most muddled and least convincing. It relies on a flimsy notion that Apple\u2019s success has throttled innovation at other companies, rather than compelled it,\u00a0without truly explaining\u00a0how. It certainly doesn\u2019t make a persuasive case that\u00a0ordering Apple to make\u00a0a worse iPhone would\u00a0change\u00a0anything for the better. Dave Lee is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist.
