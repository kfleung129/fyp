    "text": "Apple will launch the iPhone 16 lineup later this year with a boatload of changes oriented toward the standard and the 'Pro' models. The company has prototyped various designs to test the most feasible solution based on the feature set. While there are little details on the insides, Apple is potentially seeking a different design from the current iPhone 15 and 15 Pro models. A sketchy rumor showcases how Apple could amalgamate the camera housing on the back of the iPhone 16 Pro models. We have previously heard that Apple is planning a vertical camera layout for the standard iPhone 16 models. The cameras on the back will bring back an iPhone 12-like design but with some key differences. Past rumors only gave insights on the standard models of the iPhone 16, while the 'Pro' models were rumored to feature the same design as the iPhone 15 Pro models. However, the latest rumor suggests a new camera design for the iPhone 16 Pro, similar to the current models but with some key changes. According to images posted by tipster Majin Bu on X, the iPhone 16 Pro will feature a new design for the camera modules. Currently, we see different camera sensors in individual circular housings. However, the rumored design combines all the circular modules into a single unit. You can check out the design below for further details. While the design is new, it remains to be seen if it is specifically tied to the camera features. Apple has had the same camera layout on the 'Pro' models since the iPhone 11. It is likely the company could switch to a new design for the cameras, but it is too early to speculate. As mentioned, the company is testing a wide range of prototypes for the 'Pro' models, and the changes mentioned could be part of it. In a follow-up post, the tipster mentions that \"it may not represent an actual change to the camera module.\" This means that the final word rests with Apple, and the rumor should be taken with a grain of salt. Apple is testing various prototypes for the new capacitive Capture Button as well. It was recently reported that the Capture Button will handle the video recording capabilities of the iPhone 16 Pro. We are also expecting the company to introduce many new AI features for the iPhone 16. While iOS 18 will bring a 'slew of new AI features', according to Mark Gurman, some of them will be exclusive to the iPhone 16 lineup thanks to the upgraded Neural Engine and A18 chip. We will keep you guys posted as soon as more details are available on the design of the iPhone 16.
