View more search results Amid flat revenues and a challenging Chinese market, the tech giant's AI integration and upcoming VR headset launch are key focal points as Apple prepares to report its Q1 2024 earnings. Apple is scheduled to report its Q1 earnings on Friday, February 2 at 1.30am (GMT+4) Apple's Q4 2023 earnings, reported in early November, surpassed analysts' expectations for sales and earnings per share, but the company reported a 1% year-over-year decline in quarterly revenues. Tim Cook, Apple's CEO, stated, \"We now have our strongest lineup of products ever heading into the holiday season, including the iPhone 15 lineup and our first carbon-neutral Apple Watch models, a significant milestone in our efforts to make all Apple products carbon-neutral by 2030.\" Wall Street's expectations for the upcoming results are as follows: Of concern to shareholders, Apple's sales in Greater China, its third largest market, were flat on the year. Chinese government officials are banned from using Apple's devices in favour of homegrown products like Huawei. Outside of the public sector, the Chinese consumer remains cautious, as the Chinese economy remains tepid. In its Q4 Earnings call, CFO Luca Maestri guided that Apple expected December quarter revenue to be similar to last year's. After a recent broker upgrade, which helped spark a sharp move higher in the Apple share price, there will be interest in commentary around the following topics: Following an almost 48% gain in 2023, Apple's share price has shrugged off some New Year nerves to trade higher in January, just 2.5% below its $199.62 all-time high. Providing Apple's share price remains above a support band near $180.00/75, including the 200-day moving average at $181.45, recent lows in the $180 area, and uptrend support, we expect Apple's shares to break above resistance at $199 in the coming months, aiming for $220.00. It's essential to note that if Apple's share price experiences a sustained break below $180/75, it would signal a deeper pullback, initially toward the $165.57 low from last October.
