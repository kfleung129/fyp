    "text": "Once upon a time, believe it or not, no one particularly looked forward to Super Bowl ads. That all changed when Washington faced Los Angeles on Jan. 22, 1984, in Tampa, Fla. Those who tuned in to the big game on CBS \u2014 and hadn\u2019t fled to the kitchen for snacks \u2014 found themselves watching something completely different. In between ads for Gillette Foamy Gel and Northwestern Mutual insurance, a dystopian scene appeared on their TV sets: A line of men wearing faded gray apparel marched mindlessly into a theater, where a bespectacled face, \u201cBig Brother,\u201d addressed them on a massive screen. Extolling the virtues of groupthink, Big Brother celebrated freedom from \u201cpests of any contradictory true thoughts.\u201d Then, the camera cut to a striking blond athlete running in slow motion. Wearing a white tank top and red shorts \u2014 and played by British discus thrower and actress Anya Rajah (then Anya Major) \u2014 she strode into the theater, with guards in close pursuit. She spun and, with a shout, hurled a sledgehammer at Big Brother\u2019s face. As the screen exploded, large text appeared along with a voice narrating, \u201cOn January 24th, Apple Computer will introduce Macintosh. And you\u2019ll see why 1984 won\u2019t be like '1984.'\u201d Happy 40th to one of the greatest ads, Super Bowl or otherwise, of all time. Created by the ad agency Chiat/Day and Apple (AAPL), \u201c1984\u201d elevated Super Bowl ads to a whole new level. Today, tech historians, ad pros, and techies alike all look back at the commercial not only as a seminal moment in the democratization of personal computing and Super Bowl advertisements, but as a work of art containing themes that still resonate today. Though Rob Schwartz, an advertising industry leader who ran Chiat/Day from January 2015 to April 2021, was not at the agency when the ad was created, he still still remembers feeling inspired by it when it aired. \u201cIt marked the first time that the commercials in the Super Bowl were going to be something else to watch besides the game itself. This marked the moment,\u201d he told Yahoo Finance recently. \u201cIt was,\u201d he added, \u201cthe first time where the audience went, \u2018Wait, wait, wait, don't go to the bathroom. Let's stay and watch a few commercials before the game comes back.'\" But Apple, the Super Bowl aside, was in need of a boost. IBM = Big Brother? In the early 1980s, the company had established itself as a promising tech business with products like the Apple II.\u00a0In an attempt to make personal computers more accessible, it had then developed the Lisa,\u00a0named after Steve Jobs\u2019 daughter. Though innovative, the computer had sold poorly, especially compared to IBM\u2019s (IBM) PC, which was released in 1981. Meanwhile, Apple had begun working on the Macintosh, which was meant to accelerate the adoption of the personal computer by the masses. \u201cApple came into 1984 being walloped by IBM in the personal computing market, and needing a new big hit \u2026 the company had bet it all on the Macintosh, spending huge on its R&D, building a new state-of-the-art factory for it,\u201d said Margaret O'Mara, the Scott and Dorothy Bullitt chair of American History at the University of Washington. But then arose the question of how to advertise the revolutionary new product. Steve Hayden, now 76, then a copywriter at Chiat/Day, still remembers receiving the assignment from Steve Jobs directly. The young tech visionary reportedly wanted to \u201cstop the world in its tracks\u201d and entrusted the L.A.-based firm with the job. Along with art director Brent Thomas, Hayden began brainstorming. He rifled through old ad concepts he had worked on in San Francisco and found one with the headline \"Why 1984 won't be like '1984,'\" a line Hayden attributed to fellow Chiat/Day copywriter Gary Gussick. At first, Hayden and Thomas toyed with a comical conception of 1984 \u201clike the Jetsons.\u201d But the ad\u2019s director, a well-known talent by the name of Ridley Scott, had a better idea. \u201cHe came and looked at our initial board \u2026 he brought in this wonderful coffee table book about the making of Metropolis,\u00a0the movie, and the dramatic huge machines and the interface between humans and these kinds of overwhelming technologies,\u201d Hayden explained. \u201cAnd so the art direction took a really sharp turn at that point to meet that vision.\u201d The advertising experts had already come up with the Big Brother character and Scott insisted that they introduce another, a heroine who would contrast starkly with the all-male cast and \"break the spell,\" Hayden said. A new age The heroine symbolized more than simple rebellion against Big Brother. As historian O\u2019Mara pointed out, the ad aired during the height of the Cold War and year of the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. \u201cI think it's telling that she's dressed as a track athlete and dressed as if she's running for the United States,\" she said. The heroine also represented the Macintosh. While computers had previously been monopolized by experts \u2014 think mainframes and IBM \u2014\u00a0the Macintosh offered a revolutionary user interface that made personal computers accessible to the mass market. \u201cShe was supposed to represent freedom and the dawning of a new age, and therefore, Macintosh,\u201d Hayden said. Added Chiat/Day\u2019s Schwartz: \u201cYou have to remember that this was a time when computers were only used for business \u2026 When she throws that sledgehammer, she is all of us \u2026 and she represents all of us trying to destroy any kind of tyranny or dictatorship, even if it's just a dictator for a day, we don't want that. We want to be free. And I think the power of that is the reason why people talk about it, 40 years later.\u201d But there were some naysayers within the company. Apple's board of directors hated it and almost stopped it from airing. Meanwhile, Hayden himself felt unsure about his work. \u201cI had my own concerns that it might be too foreign in structure and content for an American audience,\u201d he said. \u201cIt didn't match the traditional advertising forms.\u201d But Jean-Louis Gass\u00e9e, now 79, who was then running Apple France, still recalls\u00a0the first time he saw the ad at a 1983\u00a0meeting to prepare for the January launch of the Macintosh. \u201cWe had never seen advertising like this ... it was absolutely stunning. And then the lights went up a little bit and from the top of the theater machinery, a Mac came down on a wire, and halfway through the descent it [was amplified by microphones],\u201d he told Yahoo Finance. \u201cSo we could hear what became the highly recognizable \u201cbong\u201d of the Mac starting. There was this hysteria in the room.\u201d Though Hayden and the rest of his team at Chiat/Day had never specifically intended \u201cBig Brother\u201d to represent IBM, Jobs quickly adopted that framing. After showing the ad, Jobs gave a \u201cfiery\u201d anti-IBM speech, \u201csaying that the Macintosh would change the world,\u201d according to Gass\u00e9e. \u201cIt was easy at the time to superimpose the Big Brother and the big IBM images.\u201d Holding up It is actually stunning to watch the ad today and see how it still holds up. Only this time, you can imagine Big Brother appearing on your screen as Tesla\u2019s (TSLA) Elon Musk, Meta\u2019s (META) Mark Zuckerberg, and the developers of ChatGPT and other artificial intelligence products. At least Jean-Louis Gass\u00e9e sees it that way. He asserted that the ad is still relevant as we grapple with the likes of AI and user privacy in the world of Facebook and Google. It serves as \u201ca good way to remind us of the necessary fight between established powers and upstarts.\u201d He added: \u201cI think the ad presents two views of technology. One that is Big Brother-like, oppressive, and one which is the Macintosh, a way to break through the domination of Big Brother technology.\u201d he said. \u201cSo this ad in 1983, 1984, presented a view of the conflict between usages of technology. I think that that conflict is still alive.\u201d Enjoy the Super Bowl. Dylan Croll is a Yahoo Finance reporter. Related Quotes "
