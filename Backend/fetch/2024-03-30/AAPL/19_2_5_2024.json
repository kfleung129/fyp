Image source: Getty Images Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares fell pretty dramatically last week after Apple stock came out with earnings results that showed weak China sales performance. The tech giant remains in the trillion-dollar market cap range at US$2.8-trillion as of writing, but the recent announcement brought shares down by 8% from 52-week highs. So is this your opportunity to get in? Perhaps, but for now I might consider this other growth stock instead. Investors really cared about China sales during Apple stock\u2019s recent release. China is the company\u2019s third-largest market, and one that continues to pose challenges with so many Chinese companies continuing to create competition. Add in cautious consumer spending and an economic slowdown, and Apple stock saw sales drop 13% in the quarter. This missed estimates of US$23.5 billion, bringing it down to US$20.8 billion instead. Shares dropped 3% after the news, and continued to fall on Friday as well. All this adds to the mounting pressure that Apple experiences in the world\u2019s largest smartphone market. Especially as Huawei continues its comeback with high-end smartphones. But Huawei wasn\u2019t alone, with other Android brands also edging in on Apple stock\u2019s market. What some analysts have identified as Apple stock\u2019s issue is providing that \u201cwow\u201d factor. Not just in China, but elsewhere as well. There has been a lack of innovation when it comes to the company\u2019s design aesthetic compared to others in recent years. That\u2019s especially the case when it comes to integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into these smartphones, something Android is already doing. While Apple stock hinted at AI news later this year, it hasn\u2019t happened yet. So for now, it might be time to look at other companies that are producing strong results, seeing shares climb instead of drop \u2013 ones with recurring revenue, rather than depending on consumer products that lack innovation. One option that investors may want to consider is OpenText (TSX:OTEX), after the cloud company delivered strong second quarter results last week. While the tech stock missed its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) margin estimates, it was still a solid quarter. Shares dropped 7% after the news, but are still up 26% in the last year alone. Revenue rose 71% year over year, beating out estimates, driven by a 58% rise in annual recurring revenue. OpenText continues to see strong deals and cloud bookings moving the company forward. In fact, it managed to increase its full-year cloud bookings guide as well. While full-year guidance remained largely unchanged, that guidance is certainly good enough for investors to consider the stock. Its acquisition of Micro Focus was a solid move, and the sale of its non-core assets provide a stronger portfolio. What investors are still waiting on, however, is getting that full integration of Micro Focus up and running. However, once it does, there is a lot for shareholders to look forward to in terms of growth through to 2025. So with shares offering recurring revenue, stable growth, and value with shares trading at 2.4 times sales, it looks like a great time to get into OpenText stock. Even over the Magnificent Seven Apple stock.
