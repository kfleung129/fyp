    "text": " It shouldn't be too long before AAPL stock gets un-stuck Advertisement Source: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.com Apple\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0is a \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d member, but this doesn\u2019t mean everybody likes the company all the time. Indeed, some investors and analysts have a pessimistic\u00a0AAPL stock outlook, but don\u2019t worry. The bull case remains intact and\u00a0Apple may redeem itself in the current quarter. Usually, Apple\u00a0is a darling of the financial markets. So, it\u2019s unusual to see this iconic company being criticized on Wall Street. However, I encourage investors to just be patient. A deep dive will surely reveal that Apple\u2019s issues aren\u2019t fatal to the company or its shareholders. It\u2019s undoubtedly frustrating to see Apple stock having trouble clearing the stubborn $200 resistance level. After a powerful share-price rally in 2023\u2019s first half, though, Apple\u2019s investors need to give the market time to digest those gains. Besides, even a market leader like Apple can\u2019t be a market darling every quarter. Analysts tend to take turns criticizing companies before they decide to favor them again. Currently, they\u2019re criticizing Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and, to a lesser degree, Apple. Apple\u2019s first-quarter fiscal 2024 results and guidance gave analysts a perfect excuse to criticize the company. First of all, Apple\u2019s quarterly revenue only grew 2% year over year, which isn\u2019t the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d result Wall Street had hoped for. Second, Apple\u2019s current Achilles\u2019 heel is the company\u2019s sales in China, which slumped 13% YOY to $20.8 billion. Analysts and investors also didn\u2019t seem to like Apple\u2019s current-quarter guidance. Per Barron\u2019s, Apple\u2019s outlook for the current quarter indicates iPhone revenue of $46.3 billion and total revenue of $89.8 billion. These figures fall short of Wall Street\u2019s call for iPhone revenue of $49.7 billion and total quarterly revenue of $95.6 billion. Not everyone is in the bearish camp, however. For example, Deepwater Asset Management co-founder and managing partner Gene Munster assured, \u201cI still think China\u2019s a big opportunity for Apple.\u201d Munster also predicted, \u201cI think this storm will pass.\u201d I tend to concur. In addition, I would claim it will be easier for Apple\u2019s storm to pass now that the bar has been set low for the company. After all, pessimism can often lead to positive surprises. CFRA analyst Angelo Zino also appears to be in the \u201cstorm will pass\u201d camp, as well as the \u201cglass half full\u201d camp. Zino contended, \u201cAlthough China\u2019s softness implies share loss, growth across the rest of Asia, installed base rise, and sustained +10% Services growth are good health indicators.\u201d In a similarly optimistic vein, Raymond James analyst Srini Pajjuri cited Apple\u2019s \u201cunparalleled ecosystem, double-digit Services growth, and solid margin execution.\u201d To all of that, I would add that Apple\u2019s 16% YOY first-quarter fiscal 2024 EPS growth represents a decent performance. Perhaps, then, the storm doesn\u2019t need to pass if the weather really isn\u2019t that bad in the first place. All things considered, the AAPL stock outlook calls for a near-term break above $200. This, ultimately, will be a stepping stone on the way to $250 before the year is finished. Then, the frustrating $200 resistance level will be just a faded memory. It\u2019s hard to see this clearly now, especially if you\u2019re letting some investors\u2019 and analysts\u2019 pessimism cloud your judgment. Apple stock has recovered from much worse circumstances than what\u2019s happening now. So, just hang in there, hold your shares and don\u2019t obsess over the seemingly stormy weather.
