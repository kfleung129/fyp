    "text": "It is difficult to fathom what sort of day nearly everyone would be living had Steve Jobs not founded Apple. As polarizing as the technology behemoth is, one cannot put up an argument that it did not change the face of multiple industries, including smartphones. Unfortunately, Jobs would not be able to witness the current position of the trillion-dollar company he founded with Steve Wozniak back in 1976, and had he been with us today, he would be celebrating his 69th birthday. Before Apple was known for the iPhone, and when its smartphone division brought in the lion\u2019s share of the revenue, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak started the company\u2019s journey with a desktop computer called the Macintosh. It launched in 1984, with the successor, the Macintosh II, unveiled shortly after. However, Jobs had a tumultuous relationship with Apple\u2019s board and its CEO, John Sculley.

Tim Cook succeeded Steve Jobs as CEO of Apple in 2011, and under his leadership, Cook reportedly doubled the company\u2019s revenue and profit, with its market value going from $348 billion to $1.9 trillion. Cook has shared a heartwarming message on X, honoring his friend, former boss, and mentor on the micro-blogging social media platform and remembering what could have been his 69th birthday.  Thinking of my friend Steve on his birthday \u2014 the lives he touched, the vision he shared, and the profound impact he had on our world. \u201cWe\u2019re here to put a dent in the universe.
