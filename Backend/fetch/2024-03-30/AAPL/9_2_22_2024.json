    "text": "Nikada/iStock Unreleased via Getty Images Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and other smartphone manufacturers saw U.S. sales in January slump as consumers held out for upgrades. Sales for the month were down 10% year-over-year and nearly half the volume of the 2017 peak, according to the Counterpoint Research US Weekly Smartphone Tracker. \u201cTough times in the volume-driven low end coupled with delayed upgrades in anticipation of new products drove the market lower,\u201d said Counterpoint senior analyst Maurice Klaehne. \u201cBut we are likely to see a rebound in February, especially as the Galaxy S24 series becomes available.\u201d Total smartphone units sold in the U.S. during January were down 45% from the all-time high set in 2017. Despite a dramatic decline in smartphone sales overall, Apple's iPhone models continue to gain market share. They accounted for 65% of all units sold during the month, according to Counterpoint, a global research firm specializing in technology, media and telecom industries. In contrast, iPhones only comprised 35% of the market share in 2017. Its share has continued to grow every year. The only year-over-year drop occurred from 2018 to 2019. \u201cWe continue to see strong promotions for the iPhone 15 series in postpaid, while there remains significant interest in older models like the iPhone 11 and iPhone 12 among cost-conscious consumers in prepaid,\" said Jeff Fieldhack, Counterpoint's research director. \"This combination is enabling Apple to maintain stability in a market experiencing double-digit declines. This is good for share gains and great for the iOS installed base.\u201d "
