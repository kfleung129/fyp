    "text": "Apple Inc. AAPL is reportedly set to release a series of new hardware, including Mac, iPad, Apple Pencil, and Magic Keyboard updates. However, the tech giant does not plan to host a launch event for these releases. What Happened: In his latest weekly \"Power On\" newsletter, Bloomberg columnist Mark Gurman said that Apple\u2019s new hardware, which is currently in production overseas, will be announced through the company\u2019s website, with a series of online videos and marketing campaigns. The new products are expected to be released in March or April, following the launch of a special version of iOS 17.4 with support for the new hardware at the end of the month.

The Mac lineup will also see the introduction of 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Airs with the faster M3 chip. Apple\u2019s marketing teams are reportedly preparing to announce these new products soon, with no full-blown event planned. All the attention, according to Gurman, will shift to the Worldwide Developers Conference, where Apple is expected to showcase its generative AI advances. In a separate post on X, formerly Twitter, Gurman also noted that Apple\u2019s retail stores are running low on MacBook Airs and iPad Pros, with plans for a minor refresh this week and a larger refresh early next week. A few additional points: retail stores are low on MacBook Airs and iPad Pros; Stores are planning a minor refresh for this week (I think it's a new accessory rather than a new product); Stores are planning a larger refresh early next week (which sounds more product-related). https://t.co/kUkeYjT4rK Check out more of Benzinga's Future Of Consumer Tech by following this link.
