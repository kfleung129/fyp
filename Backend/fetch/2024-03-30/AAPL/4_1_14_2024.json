    "text": "Ahead of Apple Vision Pro pre-orders beginning in just a few days, more details have emerged about what to expect. Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman has shared new information on the M2 chip inside Vision Pro, the virtual keyboard for visionOS, and more. The visionOS virtual keyboard Alongside the Vision Pro\u2019s announcement at WWDC 2023, Apple showed of a floating in-air keyboard for Vision Pro. According to Apple, this in-air keyboard even includes feedback via spatial sound effects. In a post on social media, however, Gurman described this virtual keyboard on Vision Pro as a \u201ccomplete write-off\u201d in visionOS 1.0. He suggests that most people will want a Bluetooth keyboard instead. \u201cThe Vision Pro virtual keyboard is a complete write-off at least in 1.0. You have to poke each key one finger at a time like you did before you learned how to type. There is no magical in-air typing. You can also look at a character and pinch. You\u2019ll want a Bluetooth keyboard.\u201d Vision Pro\u2019s M2 chip The Vision Pro is powered by an M2 chip paired with Apple\u2019s first R1 chip, which processes all the cameras and sensor inputs in real time. Apple itself, however, hasn\u2019t shared any additional details on the specifications of these chips. The base model M2 features 8 GPU cores and 8 CPU cores, but Vision Pro will apparently use a higher-end version of the chip. Gurman says that he\u2019s \u201chearing the M2 chip in the Vision Pro is the higher-end variant with 10 GPU cores and 8 CPU cores.\u201d Apple Card Monthly Installments If you\u2019re buying Vision Pro but don\u2019t want to shell out the $3,500 upfront, Gurman says that Apple Card Monthly Installments will indeed be an option. Apple Card Monthly Installments give users the option to spread a purchase out into equal monthly payments with no interest. There aren\u2019t any details on how long the payment plan for Vision Pro will be. Currently, iPhone purchases can be divided into 24 monthly payments. Payment plans for Macs, iPads, Apple Watches, and other devices are divided into 12 monthly payments. Apple hasn\u2019t yet updated its Apple Card Monthly Installments support webpage to acknowledge the existence of Vision Pro.
