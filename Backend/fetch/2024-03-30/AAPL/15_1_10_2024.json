While shares have only experienced a modest decline in price during this time, the question now is what lies ahead for this \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d stock. Some may believe that this pullback is temporary and now\u2019s the prime time to \u201cbuy the dip.\u201d Others may see it as a warning to exit positions or to avoid the stock. So, who\u2019s right, who\u2019s wrong, and most importantly, what\u2019s the best move? Let\u2019s take a closer look and find out. Uncertainty over macro improvements like lower inflation and interest rates may be causing some minor turbulence for the broad market, but that\u2019s not the key factor behind the recent Apple stock pullback. Instead, factors more directly related to AAPL stock are driving the latest slide for shares. In the last trading days of 2023, shares were rattled by news of a court-order import ban on Apple Watches, related to a patent dispute between the tech giant and medical technology company Masimo. Shares, already trending lower before this news, fell on the news. Even though the import ban was temporarily lifted soon after, AAPL experienced little in the way of a rebound. Since the start of the calendar year, additional negative developments have weighed on AAPL. Specifically, those developments were the issuance of not one, not two, but three sell-side downgrades. Analysts from Barclays, Piper Sandler, and Redburn have all weighed in, pointing to weak iPhone demand, slowing services growth, and a rich valuation as factors that could affect AAPL\u2019s performance in 2024. Yet while what\u2019s driving the pullback should give those saying to \u201cbuy the dip\u201d some pause, and gives credence to the more cautious, don\u2019t assume \u201cstay away\u201d is the clear takeaway here. While it\u2019s possible that the market quickly absorbs the negative news surrounding AAPL stock, it\u2019s also possible that these concerns linger, leading to continued poor performance for shares in the short-term. But while the near-term could remain stormy, the market\u2019s response to these downgrades could still in time prove to be an overreaction. In the months ahead, sentiment for shares could swing back in a big way. At least, that\u2019s the view of analysts at Morgan Stanley. Amid the spate of analyst downgrades discussed above, Morgan Stanley has reiterated its \u201coverweight\u201d rating and $220 per share price target on AAPL. Per the analysts, progress with Apple\u2019s \u201cEdge AI\u201d efforts could bode well for shares later this year. That\u2019s not to say that AAPL is going to benefit from a high level of \u201cAI mania\u201d in 2024, as seen with other major tech stocks. It may be something that gives shares support before consumer spending bounces back. Then, if said demand rebound happens between now and December? Shares could really start to make an exit from their recent slump. Later this year, increased appreciation of Apple\u2019s potential to capitalize on the generative AI trend, plus an improving consumer spending picture, could enable AAPL to climb back toward $200 per share. Prices north of $200 per share may also be within reach. That\u2019s not all. In the years ahead, AI-related innovations, plus other long-term catalysts (like iPhone sales growth in India and other non-China emerging markets) will drive the level of earnings growth needed to sustain (or even expand) this stock\u2019s so-called \u201crich\u201d forward earnings multiple (around 28). With this, here\u2019s the true takeaway. If you\u2019ve been holding this stock for the long haul, there\u2019s no need to change your stance. If you\u2019ve yet to buy AAPL stock, feel free to consider it, whether at current prices, or in the event shares experience a further short-term decline in price. AAPL stock earns a B rating in Portfolio Grader.
