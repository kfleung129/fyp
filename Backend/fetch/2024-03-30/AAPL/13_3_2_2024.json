Did Warren Buffett sell 10,000,382 shares in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) at the end of last year? It\u2019s a nice headline, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s actually the case. Berkshire Hathaway reported a reduction in its Apple stake at the end of 2023, but when Buffett sold the stock in 2020, he later admitted it was \u201cprobably a mistake\u201c. I think there\u2019s a better explanation. One of Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s subsidiaries is General Reinsurance (Gen Re). And within Gen Re is a company called New England Asset Management (NEAM). Until last year, Gen Re\u2019s stock investments were reported by NEAM, which files its own quarterly reports. As of May 2023 though, these have been part of the Berkshire update. As part of that move, around 20,424,207 shares appeared on Berkshire\u2019s filing in May. But these were owned by Gen Re, not (directly) by Berkshire itself. Importantly, the Gen Re portfolio isn\u2019t run by Buffett. So the moves made in that part of the company might not represent the Oracle of Omaha\u2019s latest thoughts. My guess is that the 10,000,382 shares that were sold came out of Gen Re\u2019s portfolio \u2013 and therefore weren\u2019t sold by Buffett. And this probably isn\u2019t the first time something like this has happened. Over the last few years, NEAM (which included Gen Re at the time) has reported several moves that would have been surprising for Berkshire. These include: That\u2019s not to say these are bad ideas \u2013 different tax implications might well be significant. But it\u2019s fair to say not every move made by a Berkshire subsidiary is signed off by Buffett. I suspect Berkshire\u2019s recent sale of Apple stock is a move like this. I can\u2019t know for certain, but I\u2019d guess the 10,000,382 shares the company sold came from the 20,427,207 it inherited last year. Like Buffett, I own Apple shares in my portfolio. And with the price having fallen back to its December 2021 levels, might there be a further buying opportunity for me here? There are a few reasons why there might be, the most notable of which is difficulties in China, where revenues fell 13% during the last quarter. This is a risk both from a sales and a manufacturing perspective. Strong growth in the company\u2019s services division is boosting profitability through higher margins though. And the emergence of India helps reduce Apple\u2019s risk both in production and sales growth. With the stock at $182, it\u2019s firmly on my list to keep an eye on. A retreat to $160 might well see me adding to my existing investment in the company. Apple accounts for around 50% of Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s total stock portfolio. And I think the recent reduction is likely to have been a Gen Re sale, not a Buffett one. I own both stocks in my portfolio. I\u2019m intending to keep them for many years to come, and keeping an eye out for buying opportunities in either.
