The company told Quartz this week that the Department of Justice\u2019s big antitrust lawsuit \u2014 which guns for basically everything about Apple\u2019s ubiquitous iPhone \u2014 is misleading. The DOJ said in its lawsuit filed last week that Apple created a monopoly in the smartphone market and hindered both its direct competitors and developers of apps and super apps, smartwatches, and digital wallets. The complaint laid out 210 allegations against the tech behemoth. It said Apple \u201crepeatedly chooses to make its products worse for consumers to prevent competition from emerging,\u201d all to protect its smartphone monopoly \u201cand the extraordinary profits that monopoly generates.\u201d But Apple told Quartz on Thursday that some of the facts as laid out by the DOJ simply aren\u2019t true. Here\u2019s a rundown of the company\u2019s rebuttals. A big part of the DOJ\u2019s argument is the claim that Apple has a 70% share in the \u201cperformance\u201d smartphone market, which it defines as \u201ca more expensive segment of the broader smartphone market.\u201d The complaint said Apple has a 65% market share in the overall U.S. smartphone market.

Apple said its market share by units is less than half of the U.S. market. Apple said it doesn\u2019t know what \u201cperformance\u201d smartphones are and that the DOJ used the term to inflate the company\u2019s market share. The DOJ lawsuit pointed to Apple charging a 30% commission as a way to limit developers\u2019 applications beyond the company\u2019s influential App Store. \u201cApple keenly understands that while a community of developers and accessory makers is indispensable to the success of the iPhone,\u201d the lawsuit said, \u201cthey also pose an existential threat to its extraordinary profits by empowering consumers to \u2018think different\u2019 and choose perfectly functional, less-expensive alternative smartphones.\u201d Apple said that because it only charges the commission on paid apps, 85% of developers pay no fee to the company. It also noted the majority of developers who do pay a commission are eligible for a discount. The DOJ argued that Apple\u2019s decision not to make iMessage available on other smartphones is an example of its monopoly. The DOJ said Apple suppresses rival messaging apps on its operating system by not allowing access to SMS (a more universal text messaging protocol). \u201cApple limits the reach of third-party messaging apps and reinforces network effects that benefit Apple,\u201d the lawsuit said. The result is a dynamic in which blue bubbles carry some cultural capital. In group text-message chats that include both iPhone users and Android users, for example, texts from the Android users show up in green bubbles instead of the iPhone blue bubbles \u2014 something that comes with stigma, especially for young users. Apple responded in a statement to Quartz that other messaging apps such as WhatsApp are very successful on iOS, proof of its openness to other companies\u2019 products. Apple also pointed out that WhatsApp and Signal don\u2019t support SMS even on Android phones. Google uses RCS, the progeny of SMS, and Apple has said it will adopt RCS starting this fall.
