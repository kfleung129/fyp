    "text": "Mumbai, March 24:\u00a0Apple reportedly cancelled its ambitious car project a few weeks ago after realising there was no need to make the car to control its software experience. Besides the car project, Apple was also reported to have halted its microLED display development project for its upcoming Apple Watches. Earlier, it was said the company was developing AI for its iPhone 16 and other products. However, it was reported that Apple was in conversation with Google about bringing Gemini AI to its phones. According to a\u00a0report\u00a0by\u00a0Times of India,\u00a0Apple cancelled its long-running project to develop microLED screens due to problems like high production costs and other technical challenges. The report highlighted that Apple's project took seven years to develop an in-house microLED display for its Apple Watches. The reports said that the company offered alternative solutions to the technology it is currently using and offered the required brightness and vibrant visuals.\u00a0Paytm Layoffs: Paytm\u2019s Parent Company One97 Denies Reports Suggesting 25\u201350% Job Cuts in Business Segments After Praveen Sharma Steps Down As SVP.

The report said Apple might plan to reorganise the teams capable of handling the \"display engineering\".

The report mentioned that the Apple electric car project affected some employees, and they were allowed to look for other roles within the company. Just like that, the\u00a0workers affected by the Apple microLED project could be given opportunities. However, the report highlighted that if Apple cannot find suitable jobs within the company, layoffs will begin, and they will be provided with severance.
