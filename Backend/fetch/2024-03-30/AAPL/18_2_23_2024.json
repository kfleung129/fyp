In each case, the buyers were told to wait 45 days for delivery of their iPhones, which then never came.\rSubsequently, there have been protesters picketing Tehran's police headquarters demanding action against the Kourosh Company. In the meantime, however, Sharifian reportedly left Iran many months ago. \rIranian police have announced that they have now found Sharifian. While they have not reported his location, they say that he will be extradited back to Iran through Interpol.\rFor his part, Sharifian has claimed that he owes his clients only the equivalent of around $2.7 million.\rEven the reported $35 million is a small proportion of the approximately $1 billion worth of iPhones that local media says has been imported over the last 10 months. Once bought, though, buyers face having to work around how Apple also restricts its services in the region.
