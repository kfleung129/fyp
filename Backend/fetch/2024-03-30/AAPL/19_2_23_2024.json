A story of celebrity endorsement, cheap iPhones, and thousands of unhappy customers. If you live in Iran and recently bought an especially cheap iPhone that never arrived, then you too might be the victim of a scam that has cost residents of the country millions of dollars. The Financial Times called the scam a \u201cmulti-million-dollar fraud\u201d that saw customers duped by a slick sales pitch, only to never receive the goods that they ordered. It\u2019s led to picketing outside police stations, scrutiny over the kind of services that Iranian celebrities endorse, and \u201crevealed the lengths that its consumers will go to get their hands on the prized mobile device.\u201d When Iranians, particularly young ones, saw the marketing from Kourosh Company, they were hooked. The promise of a cheap iPhone in a country where they\u2019re considered an \u201cAmerican Luxury item\u201d which tends to require not only more work to save up for but also to set up was too much for many to resist, and it\u2019s led to an estimated $35 million being stolen by the Kourosh company. Why were they duped so easily? The man behind the company, Amir Hossein Sharifian, used massive celebrity endorsements, including \u201cIranian sports figures and other celebrities\u201d. Sucked in by the marketing, buyers waited for the full shipping time to finish \u2014 only to end up distinctly iPhone-less. iPhones in Iran are expensive, desirable devices in a country with increasingly diminishing purchasing power. Not only that, but Tehran banned imports of the latest and best iPhone, the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro, further increasing the iPhone's luster. They are, just as everywhere else in the world, a fashionable item, albeit one that is harder to use as Apple restricts the use of the App Store and Apple IDs. Iranian users get around restrictions with foreign addresses, use gift cards to purchase apps and games, and import banned devices from Middle Eastern countries nearby. It\u2019s this image, and unusual difficulty in procurement, that made the cut-price iPhones so tempting to potential customers \u2014 and what made it so easy for Sharifan to steal so much money. Those affected by the scam have picketed the Tehran Police headquarters, demanding action against Sharifan and the Kourosh company. When the Police responded and went to find Sharifan, they discovered that he\u2019d already left the country. Since then, he\u2019s been located and Iranian officials say that he will be \u201cextradited through Interpol\u201d. iMore offers spot-on advice and guidance from our team of experts, with decades of Apple device experience to lean on.
