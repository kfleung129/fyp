    "text": "The electronics giant is now preparing to open company-owned iconic Apple stores in both Bengaluru and Pune. The move comes after the business was buoyed by the stupendous response the Cupertino-based company received for its first two India brick-and-mortar outlets that were launched last year in Mumbai and New Delhi. Last year, Apple debuted in India with its first two company-owned-and-operated brick-and-mortar outlets. The first store was opened in Mumbai\u2019s Bandra Kurla Complex in April 2023 and that was followed by one in New Delhi\u2019s Select Citywalk Mall three days later. Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive officer, had travelled to India for the store launches. India is increasingly becoming a star market for Apple with the Cupertino company generating Rs 49,321 crore in sales from the country in fiscal year 2023, up 48 per cent from financial year 2022 sales of Rs 33,381 crore. In 2023, Apple achieved a milestone of shipping 10 million iPhones to India, a 60 per cent jump from the previous year.
