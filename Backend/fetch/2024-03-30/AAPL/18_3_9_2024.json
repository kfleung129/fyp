If you own an Apple Card, you know managing your spending with a third-party app can be a challenge. While users could previously take advantage of Mint, the service is in the process of being shut down. Thankfully, with iOS 17.4, Apple has added a new FinanceKit framework so third-party developers can help you manage your Apple Card spending. Today is an exciting day as you can now sync your Apple Card, Apple Cash, and Savings accounts with financial management apps on the App Store leveraging our new framework, FinanceKit!Here are some great apps which have already implemented support for this new feature \ud83d\udc47 With that in mind, an Apple employee on the Apple Card team shared some of the best finance apps to help you manage your spending with the company\u2019s card: Monarch Money helps you manage your finances by collaborating with a partner or financial advisor. It works on the web, iOS, and Android. It supports multiple financial data aggregators, including the Apple Card now. Among the features that make this one of the best finance apps are that users can manage subscriptions and bills with one calendar displaying all of the user\u2019s recurring chargers and track investments, spending, income, and much more. The app is even taking 50% off for Mint users when they export their history and get a discount with the code MINT50. Another one of the best finance apps that can help you manage your Apple Card spending is Copilot. This one is a fan favorite of many iPhone and Mac users. With a privacy and safety-first approach, this all-in-one finance tracker helps you create realistic and adaptive budgets for your needs. It categorizes spending, tracks your subscriptions, and utilizes several of Apple\u2019s iOS features, such as widgets, dark mode, and so on. It was also Apple\u2019s 2023 App Store Awards finalist.

It also works for partners and families and helps you manage your loan payoff, expense tracking, credit card, and everything else you\u2019d expect from a finance app. It works with the iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch. As FinanceKit has just been made available, more finance apps may add the ability to track and manage your Apple Card expenses in the coming months.
