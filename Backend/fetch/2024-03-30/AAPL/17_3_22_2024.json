    "text": "Apple has dropped its plans to develop microLED displays in-house,\u00a0according to\u00a0Bloomberg\u2019s\u00a0Mark Gurman. Gurman\u2019s comments mark a reversal of his previous reports about Apple\u2019s development of the microLED technology. Apple had invested billions in the development of the microLED display, which the company had intended to use first on the Apple Watch Ultra. The technology turned out to be too complex and expensive for Apple to handle in-house, and the Cupertino company is now reorganizing its display engineering teams, which includes laying off employees in both Asia and the U.S. While some employees will likely move to other roles in the company, some will receive a severance package. This isn\u2019t the first report about Apple terminating the microLED project. In February, Apple supplier ams OSRAM on Wednesday\u00a0announced\u00a0it would \u201cre-assess its microLED strategy\u201d after a \u201ccornerstone project\u201d was \u201cunexpectedly cancelled\u201d that day. Following that announcement, the company\u2019s stock plunged precipitously (40%) While neither ams Osram nor Apple has ever publicly confirmed that the Austrian firm supplies microLED displays for the upcoming Apple Watch Ultra 3. However, past reports have linked the two companies. In 2023 it was reported that the company would see increased revenues in 2025, when the Apple Watch Ultra 3 with the technology was expected to debut. In March, Apple industry analyst Ming-Chi Kuo commented\u00a0on the situation, and confirmed that Apple had indeed canceled the project for the \u201cforeseeable future.\u201d The analyst said that microLED production costs are currently \u201ctoo high\u201d for the project to be \u201ceconomically viable.\u201d \u201cMy latest survey indicates that Apple has canceled the Micro LED Apple Watch projects because Apple thinks that Micro LED can\u2019t add significant value to this product, and the production costs are too high to make it economically viable,\u201d said Kuo. ams OSRAM was Apple\u2019s exclusive LED chip supplier for the project at the time it was canceled, says Kuo. He said Apple has \u201cno plans\u201d to mass-produce microLED devices for the \u201cforeseeable future.\u201d microLED display technology has several advantages over OLED displays, including higher brightness, decreased power consumption, improved contrast ratio, and other benefits. There is also much less risk of screen burn-in, and microLEDs have a longer potential lifetime. Gurman says Apple will use OLED display technology for the Apple Watch \u201cfor now,\u201d but that the company is \u201ceyeing microLED for other projects down the road,\u201d and is \u201cidentifying\u201d potential new suppliers and processes for microLED, but it \u201cwon\u2019t likely happen anytime soon.\u201d "
