    "text": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Microsoft\u2019s stock market value ended a trading session higher than Apple\u2019s for the first time since 2021 on Jan 12, making it the world\u2019s most valuable company as worries about demand hit the iPhone maker\u2019s shares. Apple crept up 0.2 per cent on Jan 12, while Microsoft added 1 per cent. With that, Microsoft\u2019s market capitalisation stood at US$2.887 trillion (S$3.8 trillion), its highest ever, according to LSEG data. Apple\u2019s market capitalisation was US$2.875 trillion, calculated with data in a filing on Jan 11. Worries about smartphone demand have pushed Apple\u2019s shares down 3 per cent so far in 2024 after rallying 48 per cent in 2023. Microsoft is up about 3 per cent in the year to date after surging 57 per cent in 2023 in a rally driven in part by its lead in generative artificial intelligence (AI) through an investment in ChatGPT-maker OpenAI. Apple\u2019s market capitalisation peaked at $3.081 trillion on Dec 14, according to LSEG. Microsoft has incorporated OpenAI\u2019s technology across its suite of productivity software, a move that helped spark a rebound in its cloud computing business in the July-to-September quarter. Its AI lead has also created an opportunity to challenge Google\u2019s dominance of Web search. Apple, meanwhile, has been grappling with tepid demand, including for the iPhone, its cash cow. Demand in China, a major market, has slumped as the country\u2019s economy makes a slow recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic and a resurgent Huawei erodes its market share. Sales of Apple\u2019s Vision Pro mixed-reality headset start on Feb 2 in the United States, marking Apple\u2019s biggest product launch since the iPhone in 2007. However, UBS in a report this week estimated that Vision Pro sales would be \u201crelatively immaterial\u201d to Apple\u2019s earnings per share in 2024. A handful of times since 2018, Microsoft has briefly taken the lead over Apple as the most valuable company, most recently in 2021, when concerns about supply chain shortages related to the pandemic hit the iPhone maker\u2019s stock price. Both tech stocks look relatively expensive in terms of price to their expected earnings, a common method of valuing publicly listed companies. Apple is trading at a forward price-to-earnings of 28, well above its average of 19 over the past 10 years, according to LSEG data. Microsoft is trading at around 32 times forward earnings, above its 10-year average of 24. In its most recent quarterly report in November 2023, Apple gave a sales forecast for the holiday quarter that missed Wall Street expectations, hurt by weak demand for iPads and wearables. On average, analysts see Apple posting a revenue up 0.7 per cent to US$117.9 billion for the December quarter, according to LSEG. This would mark its first year-on-year revenue increase in four quarters. Apple reports its results on Feb 1. Analysts see Microsoft reporting a 16 per cent increase in revenue to US$61.1 billion, lifted by ongoing growth in its cloud business when it reports in the coming weeks.
