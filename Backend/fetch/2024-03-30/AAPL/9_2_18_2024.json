    "text": "The expected move would be the European Commission\u2019s first fine against the US tech giant, the FT reports. Brussels will hit tech giant Apple with a \u20ac500 million fine for allegedly breaking EU law over access to its music streaming services, the Financial Times reported Sunday. The fine would be the EU's first ever against Apple and is expected to be announced early next month, according to the FT report. It is the result of a European Commission antitrust probe into whether Apple's \u201canti-steering\u201d requirements breach the bloc\u2019s abuse of dominance rules, harming music consumers \u201cwho may end up paying more\u201d for apps. The probe is investigating contractual restrictions that Apple imposed on app developers that prevent them from informing iPhone and iPad users of cheaper music subscription options. It was launched after Spotify made a formal complaint to regulators in 2019. The Commission will rule that Apple\u2019s actions are illegal and against EU competition rules, according to the report. The EU executive will ban Apple\u2019s practice of barring music services from letting users know of cheaper alternatives outside the App Store, according to the newspaper. The Commission declined to comment. EU executive\u2019s trade department is trying to turn countries against a hard-won deal on sustainable packaging. Brussels is going after excessive packaging in a bid to slash waste. Negotiators struck a deal that\u2019s far less ambitious than initially proposed. The EU executive suggests laxer rules for calculating recycled content in products, siding with the chemical industry. "
