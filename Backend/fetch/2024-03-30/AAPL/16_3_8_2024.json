    "text": "Update font size. Reset Nvidia is primed to overtake Apple as the world\u2019s second-most-valuable company, trailing behind Apple-rival Microsoft, as investors cannot get enough of the semiconductor maker whose chips power popular generative AI tools such as ChatGPT. Medha Singh for Reuters:\n \u200e An AI-induced jaw-dropping rally in Nvidia shares has taken the company\u2019s valuation from $1 trillion to more than $2 trillion in just nine months\u2026 Nvidia\u2019s market capitalization currently hovers around $2.38 trillion, lagging Apple by just about $230 billion and Microsoft by about $645 billion. The relentless rise in shares of Nvidia, which controls 80% of the high-end AI chip market, has been instrumental in pushing Wall Street to record levels this year, while giving the company a more than 5% weightage on the benchmark S&P 500 index. Meanwhile, Apple, which is grappling with slowing iPhone sales, ceded its position as the most valuable U.S. company to Microsoft for the first time since 2021 in January. \u200e\nMacDailyNews Take: Again, Apple was once led by a visionary who set the agenda for entire industries, now led by a reactive caretaker who heard somewhere that VR headsets and electric cars were the next big things (probably read it in Wired), so those are the tasks he directed the company to tackle, while completely missing artificial intelligence, especially generative AI, and now is scrambling to catch up to something Steve Jobs would have focused on long before anyone ever even heard of OpenAI. Steve Jobs bought Siri in April 2010. Steve Jobs would never have ignored Siri, basically let it rot, for well over a decade and counting. Steve Jobs would have made Siri the first conversational generative AI assistant years before anyone else. And the company would today be worth at least a trillion dollars more than it is currently. (Yes, we\u2019re lowballing that estimate.) Tim\u2019s not a product person, per se. \u2013 Steve Jobs See also:\n\u2022 Apple said to be spending \u2018millions of dollars a day\u2019 on generative AI to supercharge Siri \u2013 September 7, 2023\n\u2022 Apple\u2019s Siri turns ten, still acts like a two-year-old \u2013 October 4, 2021\n\u2022 Former Apple employees reflect on Siri\u2019s \u2018squandered lead\u2019 over Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant \u2013 March 14, 2018 Clearly, Apple is not as innovative as it was under Steve Jobs, but the company \u2014 thanks to Jobs\u2019 work and Cook\u2019s subsequent management of iterations of products and services conceived during Jobs\u2019 tenure \u2014 now has more than enough money to make up for the myopic Cook\u2019s lack of vision. When, not if, Apple catches up and has at least \u201cgood enough\u201d generative AI to tout, the bleeding will stop. Until it gets another visionary leader (fingers crossed; Apple\u2019s history has shown \u2013 cough, Sculley, Spindler, cough \u2013 that the next CEO could be far, far worse than the very competent caretaker Cook), Apple can afford to miss things like generative AI \u2013 which they clearly did \u2013 and then use its huge war chest to catch up \u2013 which they\u2019re doing right now (fun times and 80-hour weeks inside Apple Park!) \u2013 and, hopefully, surpass rivals (or at least be as good). Apple will very likely unveil their catch-up work within months (this June at WWDC 2024) in iPhones (and iPads, Apple Watches, etc.) with built-in on-device generative AI and other new AI-driven features. \u2013 MacDailyNews, February 14, 2024\n \u200e\nPlease help support MacDailyNews.

Scot Forstall ought to be brought back\u2026 Cook, Schiller, most of the board, Jackson and other DEI hires shown the door Scott Fourskin? Nah. you clearly know nothing John Snow Scott was seen by many as mini Steve and we need exactly that right the fck now Yes, been advocating for Scott to return going on a decade. Elon Musk another heavy contender who kicked Cook\u2019s ass in green vehicles\u2026 Agreed 1000%. Scott Forstall kicked butt and demanded excellence, which is why he was booted from this current regime. Ohhhh YES! He scared the bejesus out of timid Timmy, same as Elon Musk threatened Cook and ran from NEGOTIATIONS. Also SF bested Jony Ive in meeting arguments, so they ALL got rid of him to save their mediocre arses. Now it\u2019s clear who is mediocre and creatively BRAIN DEAD CURRENT Apple execs playing it safe. Not the same Apple as under Jobs and it\u2019s just a matter of time before the big broom comes in the room\u2026 Just wait for the revolutionary self-folding iPad. NVIDIA WAS primed to take over Apple as #2 \u2013 until the stock fell off the cliff this morning!   Was down close to $60, it\u2019s rebounded a little now, but still down close to $50.   I was this close to finally being a millionaire today! IF they overtake Apple it will last a day or two until their stock is unloaded in an unprecedented cash out. Then the Game(will)Stop\u2026 The present regime milked the innovations achieved under Steve Jobs, over a decade now. Which was enough time for the competitors to improve and improve over Apple. Their decision over the last few years specifically after Steve Jobs passed with respect to Mac Laptops and soldering memory and storage to the motherboard and making user upgrades next to impossible was idiotic. They should have had a good market share in desktop computing in the last decade, instead they just milked on their achievement under Steve Jobs. At this rate the tide will turn against Apple, its just a matter of time. so, the three main thrust here are- Cook\nmilked\nJobs got it\u2026. This site uses Akismet to reduce spam.
