    "text": " While it was\u00a0one of the first stocks\u00a0to reclaim an all-time high last year,\u00a0Apple Inc NASDAQ: AAPL\u00a0has found itself lagging the broader market in recent weeks. The divergence is rare and noteworthy as a result. To be sure, Apple stock experiences its fair share of down days, but these are usually in tandem with the rest of the market. However, when Apple shares\u00a0started to soften\u00a0in the week before Christmas, the benchmark S&P 500 index was inching upward towards a record close. Coming into this week, the gap was quite pronounced. Where the S&P 500 had managed to stay just about flat since the 18th of December, shares of Apple were down almost 10%. All that being said, though, we don\u2019t expect this divergence to become permanent and, in fact,\u00a0see a serious buying opportunity\u00a0in Apple shares opening up. It rarely happens, but when Apple\u2019s Relative Strength Index (RSI) hits 30 or below, it\u2019s almost always followed by a fresh rally. And the good news? Apple\u2019s RSI tagged 28 last Friday. A stock\u2019s RSI runs between 0 and 100 and essentially tells you in a quick and easy way if a stock is overbought or oversold. It typically takes into account the most recent 14 days of trading history and spits out a number. A reading of 30 or below points to shares being oversold and due for a bounce, while anything above 70 suggests they\u2019re getting quite heated and could be due to pullback. Taking a look at Apple\u2019s chart and its RSI, we can see how reliable it is as an indicator to buy when it's at 30 or below. Before last Friday, the most recent tag down there was seen towards the end of October, when Apple\u2019s RSI hit 30. That was the low for the stock, and within six weeks, that is, through the middle of December, Apple shares jumped 20%. Going back further, the RSI tagged 27 in the middle of August. This also marked a low, and within a fortnight, shares were up 10%. And to take one more example, let\u2019s look at the stock\u2019s RSI from December 2022. Apple shares had been trading softly all month as part of a broader 30% slide that had started the previous August. However, once the RSI broke below 30, the bears gave up, and the bulls stepped in. The stock set one more low the following day and then started a multi-month rally that\u2019s only recently taken a breath, gaining as much as 60% in the meantime. Indeed, this signal has become so reliable that we\u2019re already seeing investors acting on it. Yesterday, shares of Apple jumped more than 2%, a pop that also pulled the RSI up out of the danger zone. While some concerns have been raised recently as to Apple\u2019s valuation\u00a0and continued growth prospects heading into 2024, it remains one of the\u00a0hottest stocks to own\u00a0out there. MarketBeat\u2019s MarketRank forecast tool\u00a0has the stock ranked a Moderate Buy, and coupled with the fact it has a street-high price target of $250, we\u2019re inclined to think we may have just seen the low in Apple shares for the foreseeable future. Unless fresh doubts emerge about the company\u2019s ability to get through\u00a0the antitrust headwinds\u00a0forming in the distance, this is still a stock that\u2019s more likely to finish the year higher than where it started rather than lower. Look for shares to consolidate above the $180 mark, which is where the bears ran out of steam last week. While an RSI that screams oversold doesn\u2019t exactly guarantee that a recovery rally is about to form, based on recent history with Apple, it\u2019s a pretty safe bet.
