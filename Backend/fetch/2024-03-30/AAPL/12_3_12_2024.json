Reports suggest that Apple will emulate some of Google\u2019s advertiser-focused AI efforts by testing new tools to help customers buy App Store ads \u2013 as the iPhone-maker seeks to prove it has the AI chops to keep up with its big tech rivals while also underscoring its seriousness about the business opportunity from advertising. Apple is a big-deal brand, but it now also has its eye on becoming a big-deal advertising destination by boosting the targeting capabilities of its quietly successful App Store advertising products (this year it is expected to make $7bn from ads alone). Its ambitions are bigger and its increasing media properties \u2013 from its News, Maps, and Stocks apps to its Apple TV+ product featuring the Messi-hosting MLS \u2013 offer extensive opportunities it is now exploring. With content to advertise around, and an extensive user base, it\u2019s likely that an automated targeting product will unlock value across its properties. Apple is testing a tool, according to a report by Business Insider, to help a select group of advertisers automate the placement of ads on Apple\u2019s App Store. An enhanced ad placement system would build on the already considerable (but quiet) advertising business that Apple has established selling search ads in the App Store experience. Sources familiar with the testing tell BI that they expect the company to announce the product officially in the next few months. The new product is said to be similar to tools like Google\u2019s Performance Max and Meta\u2019s Advantage+, both of which use machine learning to optimise campaigns. Two placements are available: Advertisers can then automate placements based on the budget, cost-per-acquisition target, audiences and territories they enter. The news comes as Apple will be keen to attach the term AI to anything investors hear about the company. It follows recent questions about the company\u2019s plans in the space and Apple\u2019s own ambition to \u201cbreak new ground\u201d with AI this year. It will be aware of the emerging shape of advertising in 2024: non-endemic players developing huge advertising businesses, while artificial intelligence techniques are helping ad businesses like Meta to make up shortfalls in their targeting capabilities.
