    "text": " Apple is still a tech-gadget giant, but you don't have to go overboard with AAPL stock Advertisement Source: Yalcin Sonat / Shutterstock.com Will you settle for a pretty good year after a magnificent one? Apple\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0still deserves its designation as a member of the prestigious \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d club. AAPL stock\u00a0gets a \u201cB\u201d grade and shouldn\u2019t be expected to rally as sharply in 2024 as it did in 2023. To put this in perspective, the Apple\u00a0share price gained nearly 50% last year. Apple\u2019s forward price-to-earnings ratio was 28x, which isn\u2019t outlandishly high but might still raise valuation concerns. So, as we\u2019ll discuss in a moment, not every expert on Wall Street is bullish about Apple stock for the next 12 months. Like other \u201cMag-Seven\u201d members, Apple was a darling of the financial market in 2023. However, not every expert on Wall Street is extremely bullish about Apple stock. For example, according to Barron\u2019s, D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria warned that Apple \u201cneeds to get \u2018unstuck\u2019 on innovation to\u00a0improve growth\u00a0in its existing products and add new products.\u201d Luria\u2019s \u201cneutral\u201d rating and $166 price target (which implies downside from the current price) on AAPL stock certainly don\u2019t suggest that 2024 will offer another year of magnificent returns. What really caught the market\u2019s attention, however, was Barclays analyst Tim Long\u2019s surprising downgrade of Apple\u00a0stock from \u201cequal weight\u201d to \u201cunderweight.\u201d It\u2019s not very often that analysts assign Apple shares a \u201csell\u201d-equivalent rating. Furthermore, the Barclays analyst reduced his price target on the stock from $161 to $160. \u201cThe continued period of weak results coupled with multiple expansion is not sustainable,\u201d Long predicted. Perhaps he\u2019s referring to Apple\u2019s 1% year-over-year revenue decline in fiscal 2023\u2019s fourth quarter. Apple\u2019s sales decreased 3% in the company\u2019s most recently reported fiscal year. Don\u2019t get the wrong idea. Apple is still a redoubtable giant in the technology-gadget industry. The company will undoubtedly continue to generate billions of dollars in smartphone sales over the coming quarters. That\u2019s important, since Apple might need strong smartphone sales in order to offset potential softness in mixed-reality headset sales. Believe it or not, Apple\u2019s Vision Pro\u00a0headset will come with a starting price of $3,499. Many Millennials and Zoomers will cough up over $1,000 for an iPhone, but will they pay $3,499 or more for a mixed-reality headset? Apple may generate a decent amount of revenue per headset sale, but at that price point, the company might not end up selling a lot of Vision Pro\u00a0headsets. Basically, the company is wagering on the strength of the Apple brand spilling over into new products. Frankly, the anticipated explosive growth of the metaverse and mixed-reality headset market hasn\u2019t panned out yet. Hence, it will be interesting to see if Apple can actually sell a large number of its hard-to-afford headsets. Can one magnificent year be followed by another one? Investors can certainly hold Apple stock in 2024 as the company is still a technology juggernaut. Yet, they should also have realistic expectations for the next 12 months. Looking ahead, AAPL stock may end up taking a breather for a while, so there\u2019s no need for investors to load up on Apple shares right now. Just be patient and continue to monitor Apple\u2019s sales data, including both the iPhone and the company\u2019s high-priced mixed-reality headset.
