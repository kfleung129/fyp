    "text": "Apple Inc. hasn\u2019t properly complied with a court order to open its App Store to allow outside payment options weeks after its bid to resist those changes hit a dead end, Epic Games Inc. told a judge. After the US Supreme Court refused Jan. 16 to wade into a three-year feud between the maker of the popular\u00a0Fortnite\u00a0game and the technology giant, Apple\u00a0said\u00a0it would let all third-party apps sold in the US include an outside link to a developer website to process payments for in-app purchases. Apple has followed through with that but is still asking developers to reimburse the company with a commission of up to 27% for purchases made outside the App Store. Epic said in a filing Tuesday that it \u201cdisputes Apple\u2019s compliance\u201d with previously ordered changes and said it will explain the \u201cnon-compliance\u201d in a forthcoming filing. Apple didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment. The high court decision left in place a 2023\u00a0appeals court ruling\u00a0that found Apple\u2019s business model didn\u2019t violate federal antitrust laws, but did flout California\u2019s Unfair Competition Law by limiting the ability of developers to communicate about alternate payment systems that may cost less. Apple has been making changes to the way the App Store operates to address developer concerns since Epic sued the company in 2020. The dispute began after Apple expelled the\u00a0Fortnite\u00a0game from the App Store because Epic created a workaround to paying a 30% fee on customers\u2019 in-app purchases. Epic Chief Executive Officer Tim Sweeney complained about Apple\u2019s \u201cbad-faith \u2018compliance\u2019\u201d in a Jan. 16\u00a0post\u00a0on the social network X. Meanwhile, the iPhone maker is seeking a court order that Epic reimburse it for $73 million in legal expenses for breaching their developer agreement. \u00a9 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.
