    "text": "Apple Inc.\u2019s stock is coming off a seven-session losing streak, and it\u2019s down 12% so far this year. The bad news? Apple shares \n        AAPL,\n        -1.06%\n       could remain under pressure through the company\u2019s WWDC developer event in June, according to a Citi Research analyst. Smartphone demand has been sluggish, though that event could become the \u201cAI catalyst to drive upside to 2025 AI smartphone demand,\u201d Citi\u2019s Atif Malik wrote Friday. See also: Apple\u2019s stock is in a \u2018funk.\u2019 Could Warren Buffett be selling more shares? While Malik kept his buy rating on Apple shares, he narrowly reduced his price target to $220 from $225 in his latest note to clients. He\u2019s concerned about a few data points related to China. For one, third-party data from Counterpoint Research suggested that iPhone unit sales plunged 24% in China during the first six weeks of the year. And Apple appears to be getting more aggressive with its discounting in order to drive sales. \u201cWe note that Apple started to offer up to ~$180 discount on the iPhone 15 series as part of the International Women\u2019s Day sale, which is a higher discount than the ~$120 discount last year on the iPhone 14 series,\u201d Malik wrote, in discussing the China market. Meanwhile, his analysis of U.S. third-party data found that foot traffic to a sampling of U.S. Apple Stores was off 6% in the first two months of 2024 relative to the same period a year before. Don\u2019t miss: Apple\u2019s stock has had a sour 2024. This bull sees \u2018a host of tailwinds\u2019 ahead. In light of all that, why does Malik continue to hold a positive view of the stock? He cheered \u201cstructural gross-margin expansion due to premiumization supported by AI smartphones and services growth\u201d in his latest note to clients. In other words, \u201cAI smartphones will be the next battle ground for smartphone makers,\u201d and Apple\u2019s WWDC event could hold clues about the company\u2019s plan to keep its grip on the market for expensive handsets. \u201cApple currently holds 75% market share in the premium phone market\u2026and we expect Apple to release [generative AI] features to maintain its position in the high-end market,\u201d Malik said. Those features could include AI tools that make coding easier. Carnival Corp.\u2019s stock dropped Wednesday after the cruise operator reported an narrower-than-expected fiscal first-quarter loss but also provided an estimate for what the collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore would cost it this year.
