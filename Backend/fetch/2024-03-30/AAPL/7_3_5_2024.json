Apple\u2019s iPhone sales were 24% lower in China during the first six weeks of this year versus last, after Huawei took more than one bite at the Apple. What does this mean? China\u2019s shoppers are usually a reliable crowd for luxury clothing stores, high-end potion and lotion makers, and tech companies. But now they need to watch their wallets, they\u2019ve ditched their souped-up nice-to-haves. The result: the Chinese smartphone market shrunk by 7% in the first six weeks of this year compared to the same time last year. That explains why Apple has struggled to shift its new iPhone 15, with the model selling a lot slower since its September debut than previous releases. It hasn\u2019t helped that Chinese brand Huawei is winning customers back onside, while other local firms like OPPO, Vivo, and Xiaomi have rolled out competitive deals for cost-conscious shoppers. Why should I care? For markets: Good job Apple loves a challenge. Apple\u2019s stock price has fallen 9% this year, handing the title of the world\u2019s most valuable company back to Microsoft. Goldman Sachs removed Apple from the list of its highest-conviction investments, too, not long after Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway trimmed its holding of the stock in the final quarter of last year. To make matters worse, the European Union slapped Apple with a \u20ac1.8 billion ($2 billion) penalty on Monday, alleging that was making it harder for customers to explore different music streaming services. The bigger picture: Hooray for Huawei. Even though Apple has resorted to rare discounts, the iPhone is still stuck as the fourth-most popular smartphone in China. Meanwhile, Huawei has nabbed second place. And when Huawei isn\u2019t tucking into Apple\u2019s dwindling market share, it\u2019s carrying China\u2019s chipmaking ambitions on its shoulders: last year, the Shenzhen-based firm designed and produced a semiconductor more advanced than the US thought was possible, only five years after the firm nearly crumbled at the hands of stateside sanctions. apple information technology semiconductors smartphones tech stocks china us apple consumer discretionary government bonds macroeconomics Disclaimer: These articles are provided for information purposes only.
