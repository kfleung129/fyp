    "text": "MyBroadband Regulators on both sides of the Atlantic are training their eyes on Apple Inc., unnerving investors with fears over fines and threatening its market dominance. In the US, the Justice Department and 16 attorneys general\u00a0are suing\u00a0the iPhone maker for violating antitrust laws. And in Europe, the company is said to be\u00a0facing probes\u00a0about whether it\u2019s complying with the region\u2019s Digital Markets Act. Shares of the company slid 4.1% Thursday, erasing about $113 billion in market value and taking their year-to-date loss back to 11%. Once the world\u2019s most valuable firm at more than $3 trillion, Apple has underperformed both the Nasdaq 100 and the S&P 500 in 2024. The American\u00a0suit, filed Thursday in New Jersey federal court, accuses Apple of blocking rivals from accessing hardware and software features on its popular devices. The potential investigations in Europe, which are also targeting some of Apple\u2019s rivals, will focus on the firm\u2019s new fees, terms and conditions for app store developers. \u201cThere comes a point in which the downpour of cases and scrutiny that comes with them become a real drag on how these companies operate,\u201d said Bill Kovacic, an antitrust professor at George Washington University Law School. \u201cEven if they win, in an important way they\u2019ve lost.\u201d Apple fired back at the US lawsuit by calling it \u201cwrong on the facts and the law.\u201d It warned that the action would \u201cset a dangerous precedent, empowering government to take a heavy hand in designing people\u2019s technology\u201d and vowed to \u201cvigorously defend against it.\u201d The company didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment on the potential European probes. The US lawsuit alleges that Apple has used its power over app distribution on the iPhone to thwart innovations that would have made it easier for consumers to switch phones. The company has refused to support cross-platform messaging apps, limited third-party digital wallets and non-Apple smartwatches, and blocked mobile cloud streaming services, according to the DOJ. It highlights five examples of technologies in which it says Apple suppresses competition: super apps, cloud streaming game apps, messaging apps, smartwatches and digital wallets. The company recently added support for cloud-based gaming services and said it would add RCS cross-platform messaging later this year. \u201cAt Apple, we innovate every day to make technology people love \u2014 designing products that work seamlessly together, protect people\u2019s privacy and security, and create a magical experience for our users,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cThis lawsuit threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets.\u201d The Digital Markets Act \u2014 which lays out a series of do\u2019s and don\u2019ts for some of the world\u2019s largest tech platforms \u2014 allows European Commission to levy hefty penalties of as much as 10% of a company\u2019s total annual worldwide revenue, and up to 20% for firms who repeatedly flout the rules. After starting formal investigations into Apple \u2014 as well as Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google \u2014 regulators aim to wrap up their final decisions within a period of 12 months. Apple, fresh from its \u20ac1.8 billion ($2 billion)\u00a0European Union fine\u00a0for blocking music streaming apps from informing users of cheaper deals, has been under heavy scrutiny since the DMA came into full effect on March 7. antitrust Apple big tech Department of Justice (DoJ) Digital Markets Act (DMA) European Commission European Union (EU) iphone most valuable companies Comments section policy: MyBroadband has a new article comments policy which aims to encourage constructive discussions.
