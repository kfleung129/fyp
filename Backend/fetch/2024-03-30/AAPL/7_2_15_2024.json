    "text": "Hubris is said to come before the fall, and the swagger with which Mark Zuckerberg dunked on Apple\u2019s $3,500 Vision Pro this week is giving critics an acute case of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. In an Instagram post, the Meta founder on Tuesday dismissed the premium mixed reality headset as inferior to his own Quest 3 mixed reality headset both in price and performance, calling the latter the \u201cbetter product, period.\u201d But Zuck\u2019s bravado is unflatteringly being compared to the overly hasty obituary for the iPhone written by rival Steve Ballmer when the revolutionary device first launched nearly 17 years ago. \u201cThere\u2019s no chance that the iPhone is going to get any significant market share,\u201d the ex\u2013Microsoft CEO\u00a0famously predicted\u00a0in 2007 in a quote that has since aged very poorly. Like Zuckerberg, Ballmer primarily took issue with the price tag of the phone, ignoring the potential value it could offer consumers through a thriving digital app economy. \u201cFive hundred dollars? Fully subsidized with a plan? I said that is the most expensive phone in the world!\u201d Ballmer said in a separate interview. \u201cAnd it doesn\u2019t appeal to business customers, because it doesn\u2019t have a keyboard\u2014which makes it not a very good email machine.\u201d The \"Steve Ballmer iPhone video\" is 16 years old. Worth watching the full 2-minute clip. I actually think it got worse as the video went on. Ballmer implied a Motorola Q could do everything an iPhone can do for just $99. Sounds familiar? pic.twitter.com/Rf2c7SmjA2 In Zuckerberg\u2019s recent criticism of Apple\u2019s headset, the Meta founder similarly trashed everything from the Vision Pro\u2019s design to its comfort and practicality in addition to its cost, at seven times the price of his Quest 3. \u201cIs Zuckerberg channeling Steve Ballmer by trying to dis Apple?\u201d asked Glen Kacher, founder and chief investment officer at Palo Alto\u2013based wealth manager Light Street Capital. Ballmer eventually went on to regret his lack of foresight, which he blamed on a deeply ingrained\u00a0cultural hostility\u00a0toward the company\u2019s expansion into the hardware space. Like watching a 2007 Nokia fan telling you iPhone is not that advanced because you can do the same with Symbian.He could\u2019ve just said nothing, taken the best things of visionOS, add eye tracking back and be a king. Now he\u2019s got his own Ballmer iPhone video. Surprising misstep https://t.co/Z4Ac4sR0Pl According to the former Microsoft boss, senior management\u2019s thinking at the time was very much anchored in the easily delineated business model that separated chips, system, and software makers from personal computers. The company didn\u2019t anticipate the shift toward end-to-end vertical integration that Apple popularized in the mobile space. The comparison with Ballmer isn\u2019t entirely accurate, though. While the Microsoft boss said his\u00a0biggest mistake\u00a0was limiting the company\u2019s focus to\u00a0Windows Mobile\u00a0rather than entering the handset business earlier with a true iPhone competitor, Zuckerberg\u2019s problem is just the opposite:\u00a0He already has the hardware\u2014it\u2019s just not catching on. A closer analogy is the possibility that Meta\u2019s Quest is the Nokia or BlackBerry of mixed reality headsets, a mass-market device that lacks enough compelling content and useful applications because it failed to keep pace with innovation in the tech industry. It was only with this month\u2019s arrival of the Apple Vision Pro that the technology suddenly gained broader pop culture prominence, in a blow to the Quest 3 that launched only four months earlier. Zuckerberg did receive\u00a0some moral support\u00a0in response to his Ballmer-esque video, though. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the most impressive CEOs there is,\u201d\u00a0wrote\u00a0Kaushik Subramanian, a partner at early stage investor EQT Ventures, who once worked for the Meta founder. \u201cDon\u2019t bet against Zuck!\u201d \u00a9 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.
