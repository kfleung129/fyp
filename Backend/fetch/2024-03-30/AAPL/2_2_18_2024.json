    "text": "Days after Meta chief Mark Zuckerberg ripped apart the Vision Pro on \u00a0social media, company CTO Andrew Bosworth has joined the bandwagon to \u00a0review the $3,500 Apple headset. (Photo Credits: Apple) Like Zuckerberg, Bosworth also has some good things and some bad things to say about the iPhone maker\u2019s debut \u201cspatial computer.\" (Photo Credits: Apple) Bosworth mentions that Apple\u2019s choice of build materials for the Vision \u00a0Pro are questionable accounting for the \u201cpoor\u201d weight distribution. (Photo Credits: Apple) \u201cAs soon as I put the headset on, I can see what trade-offs they made and why they made them. And, perhaps definitionally, those aren\u2019t the trade-offs I would have made,\u201d he said. (Photo Credits: Apple) \u201cIt\u2019s part of their design language, the metal and the glass. But metal and glass are not premium materials when they\u2019re on your face. When \u00a0they\u2019re in your hand, they feel nice and they react nicely. But on your face, lightness is the premium material,\" he added. (Photo Credits: Apple) While the Vision Pro has some \u201ctremendously great things\u201d to offer \u00a0including a super-high resolution screen (with little to no latency), Bosworth \u00a0isn\u2019t very impressed with how it handles motion blur. (Photo Credits: Apple) Bosworth noted that motion blur in Vision Pro could be distracting, particularly if you tend to look around a lot. (Photo Credits: Apple) The Meta CTO also took a dig at Apple\u2019s exorbitant pricing urging people to \u201cSave yourself $3,000.\u201d (Photo Credits: Apple) \u201cAm I being totally fair? I don\u2019t know. I am not here to be fair. I am being honest with you,\" he said, (Photo Credits: Apple) Zuckerberg recently released an almost three and a half minute long video review of Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset. (Photo Credits: Apple) \u201cI don\u2019t just think that Quest is the better value, I think Quest is the better product, period,\" Zuckerberg said. (Photo Credits: Apple) "
