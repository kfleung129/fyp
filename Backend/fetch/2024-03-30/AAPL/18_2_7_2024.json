While it's not the first spatial computing device, Apple is said to have sold nearly 180,000 units over the first weekend. However, the analysts at Deepwater Asset Management have sounded a slightly cautious note, tempering expectations given that it's a first-generation device and comes with its limitations. What Happened: Deepwater's Andrew Murphy likened Apple Vision Pro\u2019s launch to the iPhone\u2019s debut by Steve Jobs. The review recognized the device\u2019s first-generation limitations but also underscored its potential for future evolution. The review suggests that Apple Vision Pro\u2019s utility falls somewhere between the iPhone and the Apple Watch. Murphy anticipates that within the next decade, the Vision Pro product segment will surpass the Apple Watch, which currently contributes to 5% of Apple\u2019s revenue but will remain smaller than the iPhone, which accounts for about 50% of the company\u2019s revenue.

These include a limited app ecosystem and a user interface that requires the user to move their head to view certain apps in space physically. Despite these limitations, Murphy thinks the Vision Pro still offers a sneak peek into the future of spatial computing. He anticipates that the Vision Pro could become thinner, lighter, and more capable over time, with new use cases emerging and being adopted by more people. Why It Matters: The Vision Pro has been a hot topic since its launch, with users showcasing its revolutionary capabilities on social media. The device\u2019s real-time ability to scan objects and surfaces has been lauded for its potential in various fields, from learning piano to cooking. Former Apple CEO John Sculley has also compared the Vision Pro to the iPhone, praising the current Apple team for their work on the new product. However, not everyone shares this enthusiasm. Tech billionaire Elon Musk, for instance, has expressed skepticism about the device\u2019s positioning as a \u201cmoon shot\u201d attempt by Apple. AAPL Price Action: Apple shares closed at $190.3 on Tuesday, up by 0.53% in the last 24 hours. Check out more of Benzinga\u2019s Consumer Tech coverage by\u00a0following this link.
