    "text": " The consumer electronics giant continues to perform strongly and reward its stockholders Advertisement Source: Yalcin Sonat / Shutterstock.com Despite some ongoing concerns, according to my Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock forecast there are still plenty of reasons to buy. Questions continue to surround Apple, some of which were not answered by the company\u2019s recent fourth-quarter financial results. Sales of the company\u2019s legacy technology products, such as its iPhone and MacBook computer, remain tepid, and it\u2019s not yet known how its new augmented reality headset will fare with consumers. But these questions don\u2019t take away from the fact that Apple remains one of the best stocks investors can hold in their portfolio. There was a lot of nail-biting when Apple issued its Q4 2023 print. Analysts and media zeroed in on the fact that Apple\u2019s iPhone sales in China declined 13% in the October through December quarter. Home to its main iPhone manufacturing plant, and with 20% of its global iPhone sales coming from China, the nation of 1.4 billion people remains strategically important to Apple. However, all the handwringing over China obscured some very strong results from the company. Apple\u2019s revenue rose 2% year-over-year in Q4, ending four consecutive quarters in which the company\u2019s annual sales declined. Apple\u2019s gross margin came in at 45.9% versus 45.3% that was forecast. Despite a decrease in China, iPhone sales globally totaled $69.70 billion, beating Wall Street forecasts of $67.82 billion. It was the company\u2019s first full quarter of iPhone 15 sales. Revenue from the MacBook computer also came in ahead of estimates at $7.78 billion. In fact, Apple\u2019s consumer electronic devices showed sales growth in all regions of the world except for China, which is undergoing an economic slowdown and where Apple faces growing competition from domestic smartphone makers such as Huawei. But overall, Apple produced very strong results, beating analysts\u2019 estimates on both the top and bottom lines. Management said they expect iPhone sales in the current first quarter to be similar to last year\u2019s $51.33 billion, and that its services should grow 11%. The day after Apple\u2019s Q4 print, the company\u2019s new Vision Pro mixed-reality headset went on sale around the world. Reviews of the device have been positive. This is Apple\u2019s first entirely new electronics product since 2015, and pre-orders were so strong that Apple moved up the launch date to February from a previous schedule of late spring. While some analysts have taken issue with the Vision Pro\u2019s price of $3,499, reviewers seem to agree that the headset is worth the expense. The Vision Pro\u2019s global sales will be included in Apple\u2019s next earnings report and should help counter any slowdown in sales of its iPhone or other devices. In recent days it was reported that Apple\u2019s manufacturing facilities in China have increased production of the Vision Pro to meet growing demand. Apple is also working with software developers to create apps that can be used with the augmented reality headset. Analysts are forecasting 200,000 to one million unit sales of the device this year. Outside China, Apple\u2019s business continues to fire on all cylinders. But even in China, Apple is managing the situation as best it can. In mid-January, Apple announced discounts on its devices to spur sales, including knocking the equivalent of $70 off its iPhone 15. The company is also moving its manufacturing out of China and to low-cost centers such as India. Other U.S. companies ranging from Nike (NYSE:NKE) to Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) have also run into trouble in China and are pulling up stakes. At the same time, Apple continues to prioritize its shareholders. In Q4 2023, Apple spent nearly $27 billion on dividend payments and stock buybacks. The company continues to buyback more of its own shares than any other publicly traded company. It\u2019s also one of the few mega-cap technology companies that pays a dividend. And AAPL stock continues to appreciate, rising 25% in the last 12 months, bringing its five-year gain to 345%. Apple\u2019s future outlook and growth are being questioned, but its current problems are mainly in China. Outside that country, Apple remains a strong brand and continues to post strong sales. That its Vision Pro headset has just gone on sale should give the company\u2019s earnings a jolt going forward. There\u2019s no question that Apple continues to provide solid returns to investors with its share price gains, dividend payouts, and stock buybacks. Anyway you look at it, AAPL stock is a buy.
