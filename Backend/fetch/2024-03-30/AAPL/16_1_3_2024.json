    "text": "What a difference a year makes, even if it\u2019s just a few trading days. Investors opened up 2024 with selling almost across the board. Two of the three major indices finished lower in what will be another holiday-shortened trading week. The Nasdaq was the big loser Tuesday, dropping 1.6% for its worst day since October to close the session at 14,765.94. Barclay\u2019s downgrade of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) sent the shares tumbling almost 4%, as the firm cited weakening iPhone 15 sales as a potentially ominous sign for the iPhone 16 and overall hardware assumptions. Treasury yields also contributed to the sour mood across Wall Street as yields soared across the curve, especially on the longer maturities. The benchmark 10-year note took one of the biggest hits Tuesday, with the yield climbing eight basis points to finish at 3.94%; the shorter two-year paper closed at 4.32%. While the inversion between the two has narrowed, history says that it still signals the potential for a recession. Brent and West Texas Intermediate crude both started the year lower even though the cargo has been starting to move again through the Red Sea. Both benchmarks initially surged higher on the day. Analysts cited the possibility of China increasing purchases in the energy complex as a positive as well. Brent was last seen at $76.01, while WTI closed at $70.52. Natural gas closed up over 2% at $2.57. After some early session buying, the February gold contract closed modestly lower at $2,067.50. The dollar index and lower crude price put a kibosh on the buying by noon. Bitcoin has another big day, closing up 1.37% at $44,827.70. The hopes for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund have been the wind in the cryptocurrency sales since mid-October. Here are the top Wall Street upgrades and downgrades for Wednesday, January 3, 2024.
