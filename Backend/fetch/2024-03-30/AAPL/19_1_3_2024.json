    "text": "Court cases and regulators are stirring up uncertainty among Apple watchers about the prospects for its lucrative US$85 billion services business. The U.S. government\u2019s antitrust lawsuit against Google has produced anxiety about whether Apple will continue to rake in anywhere from $15 billion to $20 billion a year for making Google\u2019s search engine the default choice on the iPhone, iPad, and Mac. Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Justice is reportedly preparing a case that could loosen Apple\u2019s iron grip on its App Store operations, something it has been forced to do to some extent by the European Union\u2019s Digital Markets Act, which has a March deadline for compliance. To comply with that act, Apple has agreed to allow \u201csideloading\u201d in the EU, which allows iPhone users to download apps from outside the App Store. \u201cApple\u2019s financial performance has increasingly depended on services and, at some future point, the company may largely become a services company. So services are very important now and likely critically important to Apple\u2019s anticipated future,\u201d explained Rob Enderle, president and principal analyst at the Enderle Group, an advisory services firm in Bend, Ore. \u201cIf Google loses the antitrust case, Apple could take a large financial hit, and it may substantially set back Apple\u2019s apparent plan to transition into more of a services company,\u201d he told TechNewsWorld. With smartphone and other hardware sales slowing over the past few years, services income has played an increasingly crucial role in Apple\u2019s financial ecosystem, steadily gaining significance alongside hardware sales, added Mark N. Vena, president and principal analyst at SmartTech Research in San Jose, Calif. \u201cWith offerings like the App Store, Apple Music, iCloud, and more, services are contributing significantly to revenue diversification,\u201d he told TechNewsWorld. \u201cThe company\u2019s focus on expanding its services portfolio, including Apple TV+ and Arcade, suggests a growing emphasis on this revenue stream.\u201d \u201cAs the technology landscape evolves,\u201d he continued, \u201cApple\u2019s strategic pivot towards services is likely to intensify, making it increasingly vital for sustained financial success.\u201d Despite Apple\u2019s financial success \u2014 its market capitalization at the turn of the year was $2.89 trillion \u2014 the company has been a bit of a \u201cone trick pony,\u201d maintained Charles King, the principal analyst at Pund-IT, a technology advisory firm, in Hayward, Calif. \u201cWhile sales of secondary solutions, like the Apple Watch, continue to grow, the lion\u2019s share of the company\u2019s revenues and income still derive from the iPhone,\u201d he told TechNewsWorld. \u201cSo services offerings and revenues have acted to round out Apple as a company, both for its customers and investors. With no new \u2018killer\u2019 Apple solutions on the horizon, successful services are a crucial part of the company\u2019s portfolio.\u201d Ross Rubin, the principal analyst with Reticle Research, a consumer technology advisory firm in New York City, pointed out that Apple\u2019s services business is small compared to its iPhone sales. \u201cBut it\u2019s a growing part of the business, which is particularly important since growth in its devices business has been flat or down as the market becomes saturated and moves into a replacement cycle,\u201d he told TechNewsWorld. Because services have become so important to Apple, the outcome of the antitrust lawsuit against Google is casting a shadow on the Cupertino gang\u2019s services finances. \u201cGoogle is responsible for a significant amount of Apple\u2019s services revenue, and if Apple were to lose control of that default search experience, it might not be able to command the kind of fees it gets from Google now,\u201d Rubin reasoned. However, the ramifications of a Google loss in court could extend beyond the financial relationship between the companies. \u201cIf Google were to lose the antitrust lawsuit, the potential impacts on Apple could include increased regulatory scrutiny of its own practices,\u201d Vena said. \u201cApple might face a reevaluation of its App Store policies and business practices, potentially leading to changes in its competitive landscape,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt could also influence broader industry dynamics, affecting partnerships and collaborations.\u201d \u201cHowever,\u201d he added. \u201cThe specifics would depend on the nature of the antitrust allegations and the subsequent legal outcomes.\u201d \u201cThe connections between Apple and Google, and the latter\u2019s antitrust woes, make close scrutiny of Apple by regulators more or less inevitable,\u201d added King. \u201cAnd given the political uncertainties of a presidential election cycle, the DOJ may decide to move as quickly as possible if they determine that action against Apple is warranted.\u201d Rubin pointed out, though, that there could be an upside for Apple in a DOJ win over Google. \u201cThere have been rumors for many years that Apple has been developing its own search engine as a fallback if its relationship with Google soured,\u201d he said. \u201cThat could have a benefit for Apple because it could collect its own revenue from search and enforce its own privacy standards.\u201d Rubin added that if regulators forced Apple to loosen the reins that it has on the distribution of software through its App Store, consumers could see a broader set of offerings, such as cloud-gaming services that offer multiple games through a single app, programs to emulate hardware other than Apple devices, and greater integration with non-Apple services, like Spotify, Peloton, and Netflix. \u201cRegulatory changes to Apple\u2019s App Store business model could have far-reaching effects,\u201d Vena said. \u201cImplementing fair competition policies may stimulate innovation and provide users with more choices. Developers, too, may benefit from more equitable terms, fostering a diverse app ecosystem.\u201d \u201cHowever,\u201d he continued, \u201calterations might challenge Apple\u2019s control over app distribution, potentially impacting its revenue model.\u201d \u201cStriking the right balance will be crucial to ensuring competition without compromising Apple\u2019s ability to maintain a secure and user-friendly App Store environment,\u201d he added. Ultimately, though, regulation is likely to be another hit on Apple\u2019s revenues in the long run. \u201cApple derives substantial financial benefits from the 15% to 30% commission it charges on most App Store in-app purchases and paid downloads,\u201d King explained. \u201cThe company fought hard against, and lost to, the EU\u2019s new Digital Marketing Act, which requires vendors to allow customers to download apps from other companies. If similar regulations were adopted in the U.S., it could substantially reduce Apple\u2019s App Store commissions over time,\u201d he said. Regulation is a significant threat to Apple services, maintained Vijay Marolia, managing partner and chief investment officer of Regal Point Capital, an investment firm, in Orlando, Fla. \u201cApple\u2019s services business is a friggin\u2019 money tree,\u201d he declared. \u201cLawyers, regulators, and lobbyists are trying to shake that tree while it keeps getting bigger and the rest of Apple\u2019s revenues are stagnating.\u201d John P.
