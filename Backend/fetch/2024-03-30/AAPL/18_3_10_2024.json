In a fracas that has lasted years, Comyn has pushed for more competition and has told a parliamentary inquiry that customers should be able to decide which features they prefer in wallet apps. Apple, which is a partner and also a competitor for domestic banks, doesn\u2019t give access to the near field communication chip on its iPhones, and instead requires banks to send payments using Apple Pay. \u201cThey are very sophisticated companies who are playing a very deliberate game and it should be a very clear agenda item for government and policymakers,\u201d Comyn said, referring to the US technology giant. He was speaking at the AFR Business Summit in Sydney. Macquarie Group Ltd. Chief Executive Officer Shemara Wikramanayake, speaking on a panel at the same conference later in the day, said she won\u2019t buy into the regulation of the so-called Magnificent Seven, companies that do \u201can amazing job for the US and the world.\u201d \u201cThe US and the world does need to allow other competition to come in, but that\u2019s something for regulators to sort out,\u201d she said when asked whether the Australian government should place more attention on Apple\u2019s market power. \u201cBasically we take the world as we see it and work with it. They\u2019re contributing a lot and we\u2019re focusing on the positive in how we engage with them,\u201d she said. Comyn also reiterated his opinion on hybrid work, a policy which requires his staff to spend at least 50% of their time in the office. This contrasts with some US banks that have pushed workers back to the office up to five-days-a-week. \u201cHybrid is here to stay,\u201d he said.
