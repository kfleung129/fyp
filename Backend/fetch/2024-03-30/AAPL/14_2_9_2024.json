    "text": "Angela Ahrendts may have played one of the toughest games of hard-to-get ever with Apple CEO Tim Cook. In 2014 when Ahrendts was CEO of London-based luxury retail brand Burberry, Cook tried to persuade her several times to head up retail at the Cupertino, Calif.\u2013based tech giant. Ahrendts was steadfast in convincing Cook that she wasn\u2019t the right fit for the job. \u201cI\u2019m absolutely not a techie,\u201d she told Cook, according to a 2016 interview at the Fortune Most Powerful Women Summit. \u201cI\u2019m actually not even a great retailer.\u201d But Cook didn\u2019t take the bait, telling her that the company had plenty of tech-focused employees and had \u201cthe most productive stores in the world.\u201d What Apple didn\u2019t have, though, was Ahrendts\u2019s attention to community and ability to humanize a company that had become one of the world\u2019s most profitable. It was a 2011 TED Talk that Ahrendts had given that really caught Cook\u2019s attention\u2014one that was focused on the idea of human energy. Her thesis was that the more technologically advanced our society becomes, the more we need to go back to the basic fundamentals of human communication. \u201cTrust just takes all the barriers away,\u201d Ahrendts said. \u201cI think it\u2019s the same in a personal relationship or in a small business or a huge business.\u201d This wisdom that Ahrendts has preached since 2011 is what got her noticed by leaders and celebrities alike. It\u2019s what got her from a small town in Indiana to heading up Apple retail as a senior vice president\u2014and now serving as a senior operating adviser at Kim Kardashian\u2019s new private equity fund, SKKY Partners. It\u2019s those soft skills\u2014like earnest communication and building trust\u2014that can make non-techies attractive to the biggest players in the industry and encourage leaders to look beyond just a r\u00e9sum\u00e9. For Ahrendts, it wasn\u2019t the clout of the position or even the brand name of the company that made her eventually give in to Cook. It was the promise of being able to build something new and community-focused for a brand that she saw as having a major impact on the world. Ahrendts comes from humble beginnings. She was born and raised in New Palestine, Ind., with a population of just over 2,000, and was one of six children in her family. She played tennis, swam, and did gymnastics\u2014and had her first job as a server. She studied at Ball State University before stints at Donna Karan International (DKNY), Liz Claiborne, and Burberry. After Ahrendts became CEO of Burberry in 2006, she was featured on Fortune\u2019s magazine cover holding an iPad\u2014a symbol showing the company\u2019s commitment to equipping sales representatives with the technology they needed when working with consumers. Little did she know, though, that she\u2019d eventually become one of the top executives at the company that created the very device that made Burberry so successful. \u201cWe turned the company around because of Apple\u2014because of all that their technology enabled us to do all over the world,\u201d Ahrendts said. At the time, Ahrendts said that she had \u201cthe greatest job in the world,\u201d even to Cook when he first started trying to recruit her to join Apple. She also couldn\u2019t imagine leaving London, where she and her family had been living for almost a decade. But that started to change during a visit back to the States for the holidays. Apple caught wind that Ahrendts would be home for the holidays and offered to fly her out and meet with her again. \u201cI again admired everything he was doing at Apple, so I did [go], but my mission was to talk him out of me,\u201d Ahrendts said. At the time, Ahrendts still turned Cook down, but an email exchange later on is what locked her into a future with the company. After receiving an email from Cook following her visit, Ahrendts sent a \u201cgracious\u201d and \u201chumble\u201d email letting him down\u2014but with one caveat. If Apple would ever consider integrating its retail stores with its online business model, then she\u2019d consider it. \u201cAt Burberry, we did everything digital first,\u201d she said. \u201cI wanted to make sure that they did something even greater [where the company] played a more important role in the community.\u201d That alone sparked Cook\u2019s interest, and led to Apple\u2019s great retail redesign after she finally took the job in 2014. With a focus on community, Apple introduced more programming at its stores for adults and children alike, educating them in things like photography and tech features they wouldn\u2019t otherwise be able to learn. She heralded change at Apple retail stores, which she refers to as \u201ctown squares\u201d where the consumer experience is less about selling them a product and more about helping the customer discover all of the potential that they\u2014and their devices\u2014have. She was also behind the brand\u2019s illustrious gold watch launch and can be thanked for shorter lines at the Apple store owing to her focus on online retail. After a successful run with Apple, Ahrendts stepped down in 2019 and served on the boards of Airbnb, Ralph Lauren, and WPP. But in October 2023, she took on her new role as a senior operating adviser at Kardashian\u2019s private equity firm SKKY Partners, which was formed with PE industry veteran Jay Sammons. SKKY, which started in early 2023, landed its first deal in November when it acquired a minority stake in truffle-infused hot sauce and condiment brand Truff. In terms of advice for young women pursuing a path to leadership, her biggest advice is to be confident in what you know\u2014and what you don\u2019t know. \u201cIt\u2019s so easy along the way to become incredibly insecure about everything you don\u2019t know,\u201d she said in the 2016 interview. \u201cBe your best self.\u201d \u00a9 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.
