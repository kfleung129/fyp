Family Sharing on your Apple devices is a very useful feature, as long as it works. For those unaware, this allows you to share your Apple subscriptions with other family members who use an iPhone, iPad or anything else from the company. Once added, they can use Apple Arcade, Apple TV Plus, share your iCloud storage, and lots more. For this guide, however, Family Sharing with Apple Music has not been known to be a marriage made in heaven. With this in mind, we've rounded up the best troubleshooting recommendations to fix your plight with getting Family Sharing working with your Apple Music account.  Below, we've got four solutions that could help fix your issues with enabling Family Sharing on Apple Music. Family Sharing requires the devices of other family members to be logged in to their iCloud ID. For example, if you're the head of the household that's associated with jollybaxter@icloud.com, your family member's iPhone or iPad needs to be logged into\u00a0their\u00a0account, such as spice@icloud.com, not yours. Some users may share Apple Music accounts for purchased content \u2014 but to get Family Sharing to work, every account on the family member's device must be linked to that family member's account. You can't have a different Apple ID for Apple Music on the same device. Straight to the point \u2014 have a family member switch off their Apple Music account by going to Settings > Apple Music, then remove them from the Family Sharing screen if they're there. iMore offers spot-on advice and guidance from our team of experts, with decades of Apple device experience to lean on. Learn more with iMore! You can do this by going to Settings > iCloud > Family Sharing. Have them enable Apple Music, and once it's back on their device, try to add them back into Family Sharing. The apocalyptic option, but it can work \u2014 simply remove everyone from your Family Sharing settings. Have all of them delete the Music app on iPhone and iPad, and also have them log out of their Apple ID accounts. Once this is all done, do the opposite \u2014 log back in with their Apple ID accounts on their devices, enable Apple Music, then add them back into Family Sharing. If you've tried everything and nothing's working still,\u00a0talk to Apple. Hopefully someone in the team can help walk you through problems with your account and go from there.  It's only in the past couple of years that I've begun to see what Family Sharing is capable of. It's an impressive feature, especially for students who may want to share an Apple Music subscription. My wife and I share some services already \u2014 such as Amazon Prime, Netflix and PlayStation Plus, so Family Sharing was the natural step for us, as we only own iPhones, iPads and Apple Watches. I have, however, come across some issues in adding a couple of Apple's services to this \u2014 random errors would appear, simply refusing me to allow my wife to use Apple Music. After she signed out of her Apple ID and signed back in, everything worked, and, four months later, there's been no issues so far. If you're thinking of setting it up, don't worry about potential issues that may crop up \u2014 the above solutions will be able to help you out if needed.
