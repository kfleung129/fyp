Apple is finally opening up the iPhone to sideloading and alternative app stores \u2014 at least in the European Union. It\u2019s also allowing developers to use third-party payment processors in their apps. This is all part of Apple\u2019s efforts to comply with the EU\u2019s new Digital Markets Act (DMA), and at the surface, these changes make it seem like Apple is giving in to regulatory pressure. But some developers are already responding with criticism about Apple\u2019s new guidelines. Epic Games CEO (and part-time Apple critic) Tim Sweeney notably called out the changes as \u201chot garbage,\u201d even as Epic announced it would be launching its own app store through them. That\u2019s because Apple\u2019s new business terms come with some pretty big disadvantages \u2014 especially for larger developers. While the new rules would reduce the commission Apple takes, it would add a new \u20ac0.50 (~54 cents USD) Core Technology Fee for apps with over 1 million downloads. For successful apps, those fees add up. Nikita Bier, the founder of the Gas app that has since been acquired by Discord, used Apple\u2019s fee calculator to show just how much Apple will take from apps subject to the Core Technology Fee. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Bier details how an app with $10 million in sales and 10 million downloads using the App Store\u2019s payment processor will get charged a whopping $515,942 per month. That adds up to around $6.2 million paid to Apple per year \u2014 compared to $250,000 per month or about $3 million a year under the existing terms. \u201cThis poison pill is therefore explicitly designed to ensure that no second-party app store ever takes off.\u201d Additionally, critics point out that Apple will require a \u20ac1,000,000 letter of credit from an \u201cA-rated\u201d financial institution in order to establish an alternative app store in the EU. David Heinemeier Hansson, the creator of Ruby on Rails and co-founder of Basecamp, says the new guidelines will discourage developers of big apps like Meta from using alternative app stores. \u201cThis poison pill is therefore explicitly designed to ensure that no second-party app store ever takes off,\u201d Heinmeier Hansson writes in a post on his blog. \u201cWithout any of the big apps, there will be no draw, and there\u2019ll be no stores. All of the EU\u2019s efforts to create competition in the digital markets will be for nothing.\u201d The Coalition for App Fairness, a nonprofit organization spearheaded by Epic and focused on fostering mobile app competition, had a similar response. Executive director Rick VanMeter said the plan \u201cdoes not achieve the DMA\u2019s goal to increase competition and fairness in the digital market \u2014 it is not fair, reasonable, nor non-discriminatory,\u201d adding that the change forces developers \u201cto choose between two anticompetitive and illegal options. Either stick with the terrible status quo or opt into a new convoluted set of terms that are bad for developers and consumers alike.\u201d Other developers remain skeptical of the new changes as well. Paul Haddad, the co-founder of Tapbots, tells The Verge that \u201cany reduction in the, overly high, commissions that Apple charges is a benefit for developers.\u201d However, Haddad also notes that Apple\u2019s Core Technology Fee \u201cis likely unworkable\u201d for freemium apps, as well as those that offer demos. \u201cI\u2019m not interested in risking losing money on each and every app install/update in order to save a little money on folks that actually do subscribe to our app,\u201d Haddad says. Meanwhile, developer and author Maximiliano Firtman tells The Verge that the new policy is \u201cApple doing as many dirty tricks as possible to force developers to stay with current terms and not take advantage of the new terms that will impose an installation fee (on every store) apart from the money Apple will try to collect from your app\u2019s revenue even if App Store won\u2019t be involved in any process.\u201d Firtman also points out that Apple will \u201cstill have control\u201d over apps through its iOS notarization feature, which vets each app on alternative app stores, and can also dictate what alternative app stores and web browsers can and can\u2019t do. The potential downsides of Apple\u2019s new guidelines aren\u2019t stopping everyone from adopting them. AltStore, an app store that lets users on iOS sideload apps, already has plans to officially launch its app store in the EU. AltStore developer Riley Testut tells The Verge that it\u2019s working toward meeting Apple\u2019s requirements so it can allow users to download AltStore directly from their website. Testut says developers will be able to publish their apps for free on AltStore, and that they\u2019ve added \u201cdeep Patreon integration so that developers will be able to distribute Patreon-exclusive apps to just their patrons.\u201d AltStore doesn\u2019t plan to charge a commission on Patreon-exclusive apps, either. \u201cAs a whole, I view this as positive for the platform,\u201d Testut says. \u201cFor the first time ever, entirely new classes of apps can exist on iOS, which I believe will push the platform forward.\u201d As for the \u20ac1,000,000 letter of credit, Testut tells The Verge that it\u2019s a \u201creasonable\u201d ask from Apple. \u201cWhile it does significantly raise the barrier for entry, I\u2019ve learned first-hand that running an alternative marketplace comes with a strong responsibility to protect users,\u201d Testut says. \u201cBy requiring proof of credit, this ensures marketplaces are at least legitimate businesses, reducing the risk of \u2018scam\u2019 marketplaces taking everyone\u2019s money and leaving.\u201d It\u2019ll take some time to see whether other developers and alternative app stores choose to go along with Apple\u2019s new rules. But perhaps one of the biggest hurdles Apple might have to face in the coming days is whether the EU Commission will actually approve of the company\u2019s changes. The Commission will start evaluating companies\u2019 responses when the DMA goes into effect on March 7th, and Commissioner Thierry Breton has already warned: \u201cIf the proposed solutions are not good enough, we will not hesitate to take strong action.\u201d / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.
