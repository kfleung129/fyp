    "text": "Ahead of Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) earnings release at the beginning of February, Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring said they expect the release \"to serve as a clearing event.\" This will allow investors to refocus on the FY25 'Edge AI' opportunity and margin/Services resilience, according to the analyst who maintained an Overweight rating and $220 price target on the iPhone maker's shares. The bank expects AAPL to beat the December quarter consensus revenue and EPS estimates, driven by iPhone and Services. They now forecast $119 billion of revenue and $2.13 of EPS (1-2% ahead of Street expectations). \"However, we expect March quarter revenue guidance closer to MSe of $93B vs. Consensus at $96B (more in-line with buyside at $91-94B), and EPS of $1.54,\" wrote Woodring. \"Recent outperformance (2% off all-time highs) reflects excitement around Apple's [opportunity] in 'Edge AI', as well as expectations for gross margin/Services resilience,\" he added. The bank believes the key metrics to watch out for in the release are total revenue, Services growth, gross margin, China revenue, and Apple's updated device/iPhone installed base disclosures.
