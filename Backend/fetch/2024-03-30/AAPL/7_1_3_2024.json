(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) Apple stock fell 4% on January 2 after Barclays downgraded the tech giant\u2019s stock, according to a Forbes staff report. This raises a question: In light of Apple\u2019s negative earnings and profit growth, is $2.9 trillion too high a market capitalization for the company? My answer: Unless Apple\u2019s board replaces CEO Tim Cook with an executive who can revive the company\u2019s growth, I think the stock is heading down. To be fair, for years Apple stock \u2014 which gained 49% in 2023 \u2014 rose as its revenues slowed and shifted into reverse. Between 2010 and 2020, Apple revenue grew at a 15.5% average annual rate. During the pandemic, Apple enjoyed a surge in revenue \u2014 growing at a nearly 20% annual rate in 2021 and 2022. Sadly, since the end of 2022, Apple\u2019s revenue has declined every quarter. While the bulk of Apple\u2019s revenue came from iPhone sales in China \u2014 where its revenue fell 2.5% in the latest quarter to $15.1 billion, noted the Wall Street Journal \u2014 the company\u2019s services business grew and generated profits. To wit, Apple\u2019s services gross margin is \u201cdouble the margin Apple makes on all its hardware products,\u201d according to CNBC. That could come to an end. Barclays analyst Tim Long cited two concerns for downgrading Apple\u2019s stock:   Nothing clear on Apple\u2019s new product horizon is likely to accelerate its revenue growth enough to justify its high valuation. China is delivering Apple a one-two punch \u2014 limits on government employee use of iPhones and the success of local rivals. According to Bloomberg, the International Data Corp. cut its 2024 forecast for Apple\u2019s China sales. \u201cHuawei\u2019s success most significantly impacts Apple\u2019s growth in China,\u201d said IDC Research Director Nabila Popal. Huawei is rapidly gaining share against the iPhone. The Chinese company\u2019s high-end phone segment market share soared from 11% in 2022 to 24% during the third quarter of 2023, according to IDC. In 2020, then-President Donald Trump imposed export controls on TSMC \u2014 provider of the most advanced chips for smartphones \u2014 blocking Huawei from keeping up with Apple. Huawei ran out of TSMC chips and its market share plummeted in 2021 and 2022, noted Bloomberg. That has changed because SMIC, a Chinese chip maker, has begun to catch up with TSMC. Huawei can now buy chips from SMIC through a near-state-of-the-art 7 nm process technology that \u201cputs it a bit closer to parity with processes used by Apple,\u201d according to Bloomberg. Thanks to the SMIC chip, Huawei announced the Mate 60 Pro, a smartphone that\u2019s \u201croughly comparable to a top-of-the-line iPhone 15 Pro Max,\u201d noted Bloomberg. This could put more downward pressure on iPhone revenue. Moreover, since October, China has continued to restrict its government officials from purchasing iPhones. By December 2023, \u201cmultiple state-backed companies and government departments in at least eight provinces had instructed employees to use devices made by local brands,\u201d Bloomberg News reported. With 80 million potential customers working for government-owned companies, Apple\u2019s pain could become Huawei\u2019s gain. Regulation could cut billions of dollars out of Apple\u2019s $85 billion services business. \u201cApple\u2019s services business is a friggin\u2019 money tree,\u201d Vijay Marolia, managing partner and chief investment officer of Regal Point Capital, told TechNewsWorld. He added. \u201cLawyers, regulators, and lobbyists are trying to shake that tree while it keeps getting bigger and the rest of Apple\u2019s revenues are stagnating.\u201d Google pays Apple pulls an estimated $15 billion to $20 billion in revenue to make its search engine the default choice on the iPhone, iPad, and Mac. However, those payments could end if the U.S. government prevails in its antitrust lawsuit against Google, noted TechNewsWorld. Another lawsuit threatens Apple\u2019s App Store revenues. That\u2019s because the U.S. Department of Justice has filed an antitrust suit against Apple \u2014 which charges a 15% to 30% commission on most App Store in-app purchases and paid downloads, TechNewsWorld reported. In Europe, Apple has already lost a similar battle \u2014 requiring Apple to permit customers to download apps from outside the App Store. \u201cThe company fought hard against, and lost to, the EU\u2019s new Digital Marketing Act, which requires vendors to allow customers to download apps from other companies,\u201d Charles King, the principal analyst at Pund-IT, told TechNewsWorld. He added, \u201cIf similar regulations were adopted in the U.S., it could substantially reduce Apple\u2019s App Store commissions over time.\u201d If Apple suffers a further decline in iPhone sales and loses huge chunks of its services revenue, does the company have anything to pick up the slack? Apple clearly lags its largest peers when it comes to growth. According to the Wall Street Journal, Apple\u2019s revenue fell nearly 3% in the fiscal year ending September 2023 and FactSet notes Wall Street expects Apple to generate single-digit growth averaging 5% annually over the next three years. That is much slower than the 11% to 14% average annual growth expected from Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet over the next three years, the Journal notes. The hope for new growth at Apple requires an electron microscope to see. Apple intends to launch its Vision Pro mixed reality headset in early 2024 \u2014 at a starting price of $3,499. UBS analyst David Vogt expects Apple to sell 400,000 Vision Pros in the first year, reported the Journal, adding about \u201c$1.4 billion in revenue.\u201d That would amount to about half a percentage point of Apple\u2019s total revenue. Why is Apple trading at a higher trailing price-earnings ratio than Google? After Apple\u2019s revenue shrank 3% in 2023 while Google\u2019s revenue rose 12%, I think Apple\u2019s PE of 30.3 should not exceed Alphabet\u2019s 26.7. Beyond the Warren Buffett halo effect \u2014 Berkshire Hathaway\nBRK.B\n owned 915.5 million Apple shares as of September 2023, according to CNBC, almost 47% of its portfolio \u2014 there is little to keep the tech giant\u2019s stock from falling further. Either Cook keeps Buffett from selling his shares by raising Apple\u2019s dividend and buying back more shares, or you should get ahead of the crowd and unload your Apple stock.  "
