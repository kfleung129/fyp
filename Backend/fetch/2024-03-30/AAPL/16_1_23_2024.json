Americas+1 212 318 2000 EMEA+44 20 7330 7500 Asia Pacific+65 6212 1000 By Christopher Yasiejko While Apple Inc. pulled every available lever to fight an import ban of its flagship Apple Watch models, the company also has been working to stymie Masimo Corp.\u2019s looming launch of its Freedom watch. Masimo, a maker of medical technologies, calls the Freedom \u201ca more elegant smartwatch\u201d that includes the patented blood-oxygen measurement technology at the heart of the long-running patent and trade secrets fight between the companies. Apple ramped up the rhetoric in its own pending patent-infringement suits against its smaller rival before the Federal Circuit denied Apple\u2019s bid to pause enforcement of the US International Trade Commission\u2019s late-October orders banning imports of Apple Watches that infringe Masimo patents while an appeal plays out. \u201cWith the Freedom, Masimo is directly targeting Apple\u2019s customers,\u201d the Cupertino, Calif-based company said in its Jan. 3 opposition to Masimo\u2019s bid to pause a case that Apple filed in October 2022 in the US District Court for the District of Delaware. A redacted version was filed a week later. Masimo plans to broadly release the Freedom by this summer. Apple\u2019s \u201ctactical\u201d two-pronged approach is evidence it\u2019s \u201csimultaneously trying to mitigate the impact of the ITC\u2019s decision and subtly undermining Masimo\u2019s market presence,\u201d said Stacey Lee, a professor of practice in law and ethics at Johns Hopkins Carey Business School with a joint appointment at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. The tech giant\u2019s opposition to pausing the lawsuit \u201clays bare Apple\u2019s unease about the Apple Watch facing a true competitor,\u201d Lee said. The Freedom has the same medical-grade pulse oximeter as Masimo\u2019s W1 watch, which the US Food and Drug Administration cleared last November for both prescription and over-the-counter use. The Freedom has already been released in a pre-market release program where users provide feedback in exchange for a discount. Masimo\u2019s CEO, Joe Kiani, said the Freedom, \u201cmore elegant\u201d than the W1, should be available under a limited-market release program this quarter, with a full-market release in the first half of 2024. The Freedom also has other typical smartwatch features, such as cell phone connectivity, messaging, music, and a hardware privacy switch. Angela McIntyre, executive director of Stanford University\u2019s Wearable Electronics Initiative, said the legal actions \u201cseem typical of tech companies\u201d but \u201chave little to do with the market for wearables.\u201d Apple noted that Kiani said in an August 2022 earnings call that the Freedom \u201cshould command 100% market share.\u201d That\u2019s reason enough for the court to deny Masimo\u2019s request to pause Apple\u2019s lawsuit while administrative challenges to several patents\u2019 validity proceed, Apple argued. \u201cDelaying resolution of Apple\u2019s infringement claims will allow Masimo an opportunity to gain customers and build brand awareness on the back of Apple\u2019s patented technology,\u201d the filing said. At trial, Apple said, it would show that Masimo is the true culprit and \u201cshould not be permitted to publicly pitch its unfounded, one-sided narrative while delaying adjudication of Apple\u2019s claims showing that the opposite is true.\u201d Apple\u2019s emphasis on the accolades its devices\u2019 health-related features have received from the medical community, Lee said, shows it isn\u2019t just defending its products, but rather is \u201cunderscoring the strategic importance of these innovations in maintaining market supremacy.\u201d \u201cThis narrative isn\u2019t just a defensive legal maneuver,\u201d Lee said. It\u2019s \u201ca reflection of Apple\u2019s deeper concerns about preserving its edge in a health-tech market that\u2019s evolving at a breakneck pace.\u201d She called Masimo\u2019s entry as a potential Apple Watch challenger \u201csignificant.\u201d Apple\u2019s filing \u201cisn\u2019t out of left field; it\u2019s a consistent part\u201d of Apple\u2019s \u201cplaybook\u2014aggressively protecting their market territory\u201d through legal means. Apple brought two patent infringement suits against Masimo in Delaware federal court: one centered on design patents and one on utility patents. Masimo denied the allegations and lodged counterclaims in both cases, accusing Apple of antitrust violations, false advertising, deceptive trade practices, unfair competition, and patent infringement by the Apple Watch. The counterclaims in the utility patents case, which Apple denies, were put on hold in January 2023 because they involve five patents Masimo also asserted in its ITC case. Masimo\u2019s request to lift the stay as to three of the patents that weren\u2019t part of the ITC\u2019s decision and aren\u2019t at issue in Apple\u2019s appeal is pending. The two companies are also dueling at the US Patent and Trademark Office\u2019s Patent Trial and Appeal Board, where Masimo challenged the validity of four of Apple\u2019s six utility patents. On Dec. 20, Masimo asked the Delaware court to pause that suit until the PTAB issues its decisions. Apple responded earlier this month, urging the district court to \u201creject Masimo\u2019s attempt to create separate tracks for overlapping claims.\u201d A trial would likely occur \u201cmonths before\u201d the PTAB rules on the patents\u2019 validity, Apple said\u2014the board\u2019s first decision isn\u2019t due until Sept. 20, and the last on Oct. 16. Those dates don\u2019t account for potentially lengthy appeals. The utility-patents case, Apple argued, is at a late stage, so it would be harmed by a stay \u201cbecause of the unique circumstances of this case.\u201d Apple said \u201callowing Masimo to gain a foothold in the marketplace with an infringing product while Apple\u2019s claims are potentially stayed for years through appeals will irreparably harm Apple.\u201d Masimo, it said, \u201cis already engaging in a negative public relations campaign against Apple to promote the Freedom.\u201d \u201cThis case is not at \u2018an efficient stopping point,\u2019 as Masimo asserts,\u201d Apple said. \u201cThis case will not stop. Rather, the case, including potentially claims that Masimo told the court \u2018arise from the same transaction or occurrence\u2019 as Apple\u2019s utility patent claims, will proceed.\u201d Apple \u201cmade false claims that Masimo somehow copied Apple\u2019s technology,\u201d Kiani, the Masimo CEO, said in supporting his company\u2019s opposition to Apple\u2019s emergency motion to stay enforcement of the ITC\u2019s import ban. \u201cMasimo would never copy Apple\u2019s poorly performing product or release such a product to the public.\u201d Kiani said he \u201cessentially bet the company\u201d on the Apple dispute, which he said has cost Masimo about $100 million. The sprawling legal fight is largely centered on pulse-oximetry technology, and the rivals have clashed at the ITC, the PTAB, the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, and in Delaware and California federal courts. Apple\u2019s efforts to mitigate damage from the ITC ban also pulled a US customs agency into the mix. \u201cApple\u2014even though they took my people, they took our property, they took our patents\u2014their product is horrible,\u201d Kiani said during a Jan. 17 videoconference hosted by an inventors\u2019 advocacy group hours after the Federal Circuit rejected Apple\u2019s request to halt the import ban while the appeal is ongoing. He also said that although he doesn\u2019t want to work with Apple at this point, \u201cit may be better for everybody if we could help them improve their product.\u201d The olive branches he said he\u2019s offered haven\u2019t resolved the dispute. Three of Apple\u2019s asserted utility patents cover a wearable electronic device and expire in September 2035, Bloomberg Law estimates. Another is related to an embedded heart-rate monitor and also is at issue in Apple\u2019s California federal case against AliveCor\u2014claims regarding that patent, estimated to expire in April 2029, were stayed pending a PTAB validity review. A fifth covers \u201cdevices, methods, and graphical user interfaces for accessing notifications\u201d and is estimated to expire in September 2037. The case\u2019s other patent covers a wearable device \u201cfor sensing biological parameters\u201d and has the latest estimated expiration of the six: August 2038. \u201cI don\u2019t see it as mere legal posturing or brinkmanship,\u201d Lee, the Johns Hopkins professor, said of Apple\u2019s arguments. \u201cI think it\u2019s a calculated strategy by Apple to shield its market share and uphold its reputation in a sector where they\u2019ve not only participated but have been trailblazers.\u201d The Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health is supported by Michael Bloomberg.
