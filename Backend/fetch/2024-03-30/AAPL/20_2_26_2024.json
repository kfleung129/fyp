    "text": "PeskyMonkey/iStock Editorial via Getty Images Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) decision to remove access to certain applications bypassing its App Store has led to an investigation by the European Union, according to The Financial Times. The iPhone maker said it will disable access to \"progressive web apps\" in the EU in an effort to comply with elements of the Digital Markets Act, which go into effect March 7. However, the EU is now digging deeper into Apple's decision to disable these apps, The Financial Times reported. Progressive web apps allow companies to create apps that can be accessed as a webpage. Apple contends that cutting off PWAs is simply part of an effort to comply with the DMA, and helps shield its users to security and privacy risks not permitted under the law. The move by Apple also prevents developers from avoiding a 30% commission fee on purchases through the App Store. \u201cWe are indeed looking at the compliance packages of all gatekeepers, including Apple,\" the EU said in a statement to The Financial Times. \u201cIn that context, we\u2019re in particular looking into the issue of progressive web apps, and can confirm sending the requests for information to Apple and to app developers, who can provide useful information for our assessment.\u201d Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Seeking Alpha.
