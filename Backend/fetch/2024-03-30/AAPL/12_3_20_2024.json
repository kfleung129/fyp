Smart Bluetooth Trackers like Apple's AirTags are emerging as pivotal components in an era of technological advancements. The market is expected to experience an impressive cumulative annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12.6% during the forecast period of 2021 to 2030. It was valued at $583 million in 2021 and is expected to reach a market size of $1,655 million by 2030. It is worth noting that smart trackers are a part of the much larger Internet of Things (IoT) market. The IoT market, as a whole, is experiencing even higher growth and is expected to reach $2,703 billion by 2032. Its growth is driven by automation, big data demand, and advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). Some of the factors influencing the growth of smart trackers include the rising number of smartphone owners. However, growth will be primarily driven by high-end phone users such as those of Apple's iPhones and Samsung's flagship phones. AirTag was launched with the motive of preventing the stealing and misplacing of iPhones. It was introduced as an accessory that works with Apple's Find My app to help users keep track of and find things that are important to them. However, users have found various uses for AirTags and other Bluetooth smart trackers, including pet surveillance. While the smart tracker market is on a trajectory of growth, it has significant challenges ahead of it. There are concerns over privacy, data security, and technological obsolescence. A host of legal issues are being raised, which might shift the regulatory environment against them. More recently, an attempted class action lawsuit against Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:APPL) is being allowed to proceed because the judge was convinced that there are negligence issues surrounding the AirTags trackers. However, since leading tech companies have already invested quite alot in their smart trackers, they are ready to take proactive measures and innovations to address these challenges. Devices like Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:APPL)'s AirTags epitomize the fusion of innovation and utility. These Bluetooth smart trackers employ an array of technologies, including GPS, WiFi, RFID, and cellular networks to provide real-time or near-real-time monitoring and location tracking. Currently, the market is headed towards improving the ecosystem and app enhancement. Companies opening in the industry are building comprehensive ecosystems around their tracking devices, which go a mile or two beyond basic tracking. Creating and implementing a perfect ecosystem often involves the use of numerous technologies, including geofencing capabilities, crowd-sourced location tracking, and integration with other smartphone and IoT devices. Other trends prevalent in the market include a multi-technology approach and a focus on power efficiency and battery life. Most smart trackers today combine GPS, Bluetooth, and WiFI to ensure robust and efficient tracking solutions. In addition, manufacturers are now prioritizing extended battery life through efficient designs and optimized usage patterns. Some of the key players in the market include Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:APPL), Tile, and Samsung. Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:APPL)'s AirTags leads the market and are still the most popular type of tracking device. However, these can only be used with iPhones, which is why it is worth having a look at the best AirTag alternatives if you are an Android user. Tille is another prominent company that specializes in Bluetooth trackers for personal belongings. On the other hand, Samsung leverages its global presence to offer diverse smart tracking solutions. Before diving into the list of the best AirTag alternatives, it is worth knowing how smart trackers and AirTag work. These trackers utilize a blend of wireless technologies, including Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and Ultra-wideband (UWB) to track personal belongings. In the case of AirTag, it sends out a secure Bluetooth signal that nearby devices can detect within the Find My network. These devices then send the location of AirTag into the owner's iCloud. While this is a smart approach, it also has a drawback as an AirTag needs an iPhone nearby to function. With that backdrop, let's look at the 8 best Apple AirTag alternatives that are actually worth buying. To curate our list of the 8 best AppleAirtag alternatives that are actually worth buying, we devised an original methodology. First, we went to online forums to understand what people actually want in their smart trackers, and we boiled it down to the following factors: battery life, Bluetooth tracking range, affordability, and protection. After looking at several smart trackers and their features, we devised a point system. For battery life, we awarded 2 points to trackers that last a couple of days, 4 points to those that last a couple of weeks, and 5 points to those that last more than a month. For tracking range, we awarded 2 points for 10 meters or less, 3 points for 11 meters to 60 meters, 4 points for 61 to 100 meters, and 5 points for more than 100 meters range. For affordability, we awarded 3 points to trackers that cost more than $40, 4 points to those that cost less than $40 but more than $25, and 5 points to those that cost less than $25. For protection, we awarded 2 points to those that came with no protection, 3 points to weather resistant, 4 points to water resistant, and 5 points to waterproof trackers. Then, for each tracker, we summed the total and averaged it to arrive at the Insider Monkey Rating. The higher this rating, the higher the tracker ranked on our list. As tie breakers, we used tracking range, battery life, and affordability in order. For all the points awarded, we tried to refer to user experience rather than the company's claim. It is worth noting that one of the trackers in our list is a pet collar, which we included because AirTags are sometimes used for pet surveillance.
