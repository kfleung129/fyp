    "text": "Court: N.D. California Case: 4:19-cv-02033 Apple (AAPL) has agreed to settle $490M with investors to resolve claims that CEO Tim Cook hid declining iPhone demand in China. On November 1,\u00a02018, Cook said that while Apple was feeling sales pressure in countries like Brazil, India, Russia, and Turkey due to currency weakness, he didn't include China in that group. On January 2,\u00a02019 Apple suddenly revealed a $9B cut in revenue forecast due to U.S.-China trade tensions. This was the first revenue downgrade since the iPhone's launch in 2007. The next day, AAPL plummeted by 10%, causing a loss of $74B in market value. Based on these events, Apple and its leaders were accused of hiding or misleading about the following details: Apple has now decided to end all allegations related to the China sales and Tim Cook's comments about it by paying a $490M settlement to investors.
