    "text": "By\n                                Kenneth Araullo Berkshire Hathaway, the conglomerate led by Warren Buffett, reduced its holdings in Apple by approximately 1% during the final quarter of 2023, according to recent Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings. Following the sale, Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s stake in Apple now represents 5.9% of the tech behemoth, valued at around $176 billion. This constitutes more than half of Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s stock portfolio, which exceeds $300 billion in total value. As per a report from Quartz, the decision to trim its Apple investment, coupled with the company\u2019s significant reduction of its HP stake by 78%, is being interpreted by some market watchers as an indicator of challenging times ahead for technology firms focused on hardware. In contrast, Buffett\u2019s recent investment choices suggest a growing affinity for the energy sector. In the last quarter of 2023, the company raised its Chevron stake to over $18 billion and boosted its holdings in Occidental Petroleum to approximately $14.5 million. Additionally, Berkshire Hathaway expanded its investment in SiriusXM, with its stake now valued at about $220 million, highlighting a strategic diversification of its investment portfolio towards energy and media assets. Elsewhere, investment guru Buffett also made the list for the biggest charitable donations in 2023, giving away stocks valued at US$541.5 million. What are your thoughts on this story?
