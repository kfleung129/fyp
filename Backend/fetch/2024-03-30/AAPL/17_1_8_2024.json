The company has finally unveiled that its Vision Pro headset will launch on February 2, with pre-orders beginning the following week. Apple announced the Vision Pro last year at its WWDC 2023 event in June. After the initial unveiling, the company has been working with developers to create additional use cases for the headset. The company is also working with its software team to fix bugs and clear the headset of potential stutters and hiccups in visionOS. In the past few weeks, excitement regarding the headset started piling up for users looking to get their hands on the device. Vision Pro will finally launch on February 2, with pre-orders beginning a week after. The company announced the launch date for the Vision Pro in a press release today. The headset will launch in the United States and will be available from Apple's Online Store. In the press release, Tim Cook states: \u201cThe era of spatial computing has arrived,\u201d said Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s CEO. \u201cApple Vision Pro is the most advanced consumer electronics device ever created.
