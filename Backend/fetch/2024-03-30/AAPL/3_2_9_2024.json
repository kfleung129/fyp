    "text": "Technology giant Apple Inc AAPL is the presenting partner of this year\u2019s Super Bowl Halftime Show, a role it took over last year. The Cupertino, California-based company replaced PepsiCo, which held the role for over 10 years. Apple has a history with Super Bowls dating back decades. Recall how it aired a commercial during Super Bowl XVIII, which saw the Los Angeles Raiders defeat the Washington Redskins 38-9. It aired on CBS, and was watched by over 77 million people. A 30-second commercial at the time had a cost of $368,200. Today, 30 seconds of Super Bowl ad time costs $7 million. Apple used Super Bowl XVIII to promote the upcoming launch of the Macintosh computer. Directed by Ridley Scott, the ad referenced the George Orwell dystopian novel \"1984.\" Watch the commercial below. The commercial may have also poked fun at rival International Business Machine IBM and provided a warning that Apple was coming after them in the computer sector. Apple's commercial is considered by many to be one of the greatest ads of all time. It also helped boost the brand recognition of Apple nationally.
