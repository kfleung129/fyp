In today's big story, we have a release date for Apple's next big product. What's on deck: Markets: The economy is entering its first \"super cycle\" in 40 years. Tech: Carta is in hot water for secretly using client information. Business: Tiger Woods and Nike are splitting ways after nearly three decades. But first, can you try this headset on? If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Apple's new reality On the eve of the biggest tech conference, a company not officially in attendance had the day's biggest news. Apple, which typically avoids a large public presence at CES, announced the launch date of its Vision Pro, a mixed-reality headset it hopes will eventually be its biggest product since the iPhone. You can buy the Vision Pro online and in US Apple Store retail locations starting February 2, as long as you're willing to fork over at least $3,499. Business Insider's Sarah Jackson has all the details on Apple's big upcoming launch. The release of the Vision Pro has been a long time coming. We got our first look at it in June, but the rumors about Apple launching a VR-type product had swirled for a while. And with tech rival Meta having been in the space for a few years, it seemed natural Apple would enter the fray. But Apple doesn't launch a new product on a whim \u2014 its last big product launch was over eight years ago \u2014 so this release is a big deal. There has also been a level of mystery surrounding the Vision Pro. The initial reviews of the headset were good, but it was all very cloak and dagger. Journalists who tested it back in June could only do so in a private room, couldn't take photos or videos, and only had 30 minutes. The launch of the Vision Pro feels like a make-or-break moment for virtual reality. The concept of using some type of goggles to create a virtual reality has existed for decades. Old-school gamers will remember Nintendo's ill-fated Virtual Boy, which was one of the company's biggest failures. But in the almost 30 years since, now feels as good a time as any for the tech to finally take off. Add in the fact that a good chunk of employees are working partially from home, and there are real use cases for it. Beyond it feeling like a cultural turning point for the tech, there's also the fact that the most valuable company in the world really wants it to work. With a market cap nearing $3 trillion, Apple isn't hurting. But the company is facing its fair share of headwinds, from a ban on Apple watches to underperformance in China, one of its major markets, Apple could use a big win, and the Vision Pro could be just that. As BI's Julie Bort previously wrote, the headset could be at the core of creating a multi-billion dollar market for entertainment. A recession could still be possible.
