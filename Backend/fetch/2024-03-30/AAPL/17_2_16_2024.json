Apple reached a record 75.6 per cent market share in the fourth quarter of 2019 in India and the credit goes to the stellar performance of iPhone 11 and price drop on previous generation models. According to the International Data Corporation (IDC), in the premium ($500 or  \u20b936,000 and above) segment, Apple reached a record 75.6 per cent market share. According to Navkendar Singh, Research Director, IDC India, while the first half of 2019 was relatively slower for Apple, it managed to find growth in the second half. \"It happened on the back of price drops on previous generation iphone models (iPhone XR, 7, 8). This, along with affordability schemes like cashbacks, EMIs especially on the e-tailer platforms during festive quarter of Diwali, led to this growth,\" Singh told IANS. Buoyed by iPhone 11 sales primarily due to lower launch price and price drop on previous generation models, Apple registered double-digit growth in India for iPhones in the holiday quarter (October-December period), the company's CEO Tim Cook announced late last month. Apple also registered a good growth in wearables in India.
