And it\u2019s fair to say he didn\u2019t hold back. READ MORE: Meta reveal the impressive costs of Mark Zuckerberg jet Mark Zuckerberg decided to test Apple\u2019s newly-released VR headset because that\u2019s his competition. Through Meta, Zuckerberg sells one of Apple Vision Pro\u2019s main market rivals, Quest. And by the way, the video you see here was filmed using Quest. In the clip, Zuckerberg starts with the punchline. \u201cI expected that Quest would be the better value for most people since it\u2019s really good and it\u2019s like seven times less expensive,\u201d Zuck said. \u201cAfter using [Apple Vision Pro], I don\u2019t just think Quest is better value, it\u2019s a better product, period.\u201d For reference, Apple Vision Pro is priced at $3,499, while Quest starts at $499. Even though they\u2019re both VR headsets, their design isn\u2019t exactly the same. For starters, Quest is 120 grams lighter. This is probably a good selling point for Quest, because if there\u2019s one thing most Apple Vision Pro users agree on is, it\u2019s a bit too heavy. According to Zuckerberg, Quest\u2019s field of view is wider, and even though he concedes that Vision Pro has higher resolution, he believes that Quest\u2019s screen is brighter. And there\u2019s something else, too. Zuckerberg says that every generation of computing has an open and closed model. For smartphones, according to Zuckerberg, it\u2019s fair to say Apple\u2019s closed model won. But it\u2019s not always that way, and so he believes Apple\u2019s model won\u2019t win in the VR headset domain.
