Jim Cramer recently said in a program that the time has come for investors to take some profits on the Magnificent Seven group of stocks as the market begins to undergo a rotation. Cramer said \u201cit\u2019s a new market\u201d in 2024 and financial, healthcare and small-cap stocks which were put on the backburner by the Street amid recession fears are now in the spotlight. Cramer said that the market is favoring \u201cboring\u201d stocks with high yields as investors believe recession fears have been managed by the Federal Reserve and rates are expected to come down. Cramer said long-term interest rates peaked in October 2023 and since then high-yield dividend stocks have been \u201cflying\" while Magnificent Seven stocks are losing their leadership position when it comes to stock market gains. Cramer said that during most of 2023 Magnificent Seven stocks, which include major companies like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), among other tech leaders, led the stock market gains. But after October 2023, things have changed. Cramer shared a chart which showed S&P 500 performance trends on an equal-weighted basis. Data shows that an equal-weighted S&P 500 has beaten the Magnificent Seven index by 13.4% from October 2023 through January 3, 2024. Jim Cramer said that \u201call sorts of stocks\u201d are now showing strong performance and gains are no longer limited to the seven major tech stocks. Cramer mentioned some major banks and said financial stocks have been among the top performers in the current environment. Jim Cramer also highlighted that there\u2019s a broader money rotation going on in the market right now, with major tech stocks like Nvidia, Apple and Tesla acting as \u201csources of funds.\u201d That means money managers are taking profits from these stocks and putting these funds into other companies that have hitherto been ignored amid the macro economic backdrop. Methodology In this article we decided to evaluate the performance of Jim Cramer\u2019s predictions and analysis. Back in September we covered some stocks Jim Cramer was recommending investors to sell. In this article we took a look at the performance of those stocks to see whether Cramer\u2019s predictions and sell calls were right or wrong.

The list is ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge fund investors in these companies. Hedge funds\u2019 top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 2 Jim Cramer called Carl Icahn\u2019s Icahn Enterprises LP Common Stock (NASDAQ:IEP)\u00a0a \u201cmess\u201d in 2023 and said he was unable to understand how Icahn Enterprises LP Common Stock (NASDAQ:IEP)\u00a0makes money.

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 14 Jim Cramer in August 2023 called the Canadian telecom company Telus Corp (NYSE:TU)\u00a0a \u201closer\u201d as the analyst believes there are multiple companies in the market doing the same thing as Telus Corp (NYSE:TU).

The company in its Q3 earnings call talked about its business performance and guidance: \"Despite these changes in the timing of CapEx, we continue to target low-volume B samples in 2024 and higher-volume B samples in 2025. During Q3, our CapEx primarily went toward facility and equipment spend for our consolidated QS-0 pre-pilot line, including for our Raptor process. For the remainder of the year, our CapEx will continue to be predominantly allocated toward QS-0. During the quarter, we raised $300 million in gross proceeds from our public follow-on offering. We ended Q3 with over $1.1 billion in liquidity and continue to look for opportunities to optimize our spending and be prudent with our strong balance sheet. We now forecast our cash runway will extend into 2026. Any additional funds raised from capital markets activity, including under our ATM prospectus supplement, would further extend this cash runway. Longer term, our capital requirements will be a function of our industrialization business model, which we believe could reflect a mix of wholly owned production, joint venture, and licensing relationships. With that, I\u2019ll hand things over to Jagdeep for a final word on our strategic outlook.\" Read the entire earnings call transcript here. Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 18 In December 2022, Jim Cramer said the following about EV company Lucid Group Inc (NASDAQ:LCID): \u201cWe don\u2019t want to fool around with that. The thing just goes down and down. I see a trend. ... I think that one is just too dangerous.\u201d Fast forward to June 2023, Cramer\u2019s thoughts about Lucid Group Inc (NASDAQ:LCID) hadn\u2019t budged as he said, while answering a call about Rivian Automotive, that investors should sell Rivian and Lucid Group Inc (NASDAQ:LCID) because they were money-losing companies.

The company talked about its Q4 guidance in its Q3 earnings call: In the fourth quarter, we anticipate the revenue from our new ventures will surpass revenue from our traditional business for the first time as our electrolyzers and cryogenic businesses continue to grow. Finally, I\u2019d like to just like to reflect on the conversation I had yesterday morning with a European customer supplier and partner. He gets toward our facilities and remind me that no one has built hydrogen infrastructure on the scale we have. No one has our product set, no one has technical talent, no one has our customer relationships and no one has our real life experiences. It remains our belief and his there is the market for hydrogen fuel cell grows, no one is in a better position than Plug to take advantage of this opportunity. This is just a bump on the road.
