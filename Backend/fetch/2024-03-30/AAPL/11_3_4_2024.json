    "text": "Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani reiterated an Outperform rating and $220.00 price target on Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). The analyst comments \"AAPL reported upside to Dec-qtr with a print of $119.6B/$2.18 vs. street at $118B/$2.10, overall sales were up 2% y/y (adjusted for extra week LY was up +4%) \u2013 driven by strength across iPhones (+6%) and services (+11%) that was partially offset by weakness in iPad (-25%) and wearables (-10%). One of the concerns here is the softer Mar-qtr guide \u2013 that implies sales will be ~$90B (down 5% y/y) vs. street at $96B and EPS should be ~$1.50 (vs. street at 1.58). Worth noting for March-qtr, expectation is for iPhone revenues to be flat y/y (adjusted for $5B benefit they had last year, ~$46B range). Services should grow double digits (we think there could be upside here given price increases implemented). Rest of the hardware products (iPad, Wearables) should decline high single digits y/y in march. China revenues were down 12% y/y \u2013 though iPhone sales were down mid single digits in China (in constant currency). Weakness in China was more around wearables and iPads \u2013 reflecting a weaker consumer spending environment. Positively, AAPL continues to see gross-margins work higher and expects Mar-qtr gross-margins in the range of 46- 47% (street was at 45.5%) this is clearly dampening the impact of revenue miss to the bottom-line in March-qtr. In addition, we would note \u2013 a) Vision pro commentary is incrementally better with 600 new apps at launch and sizable interest from enterprises. b) Generative AI \u2013 AAPL expects to launch and discuss their Gen AI products \u2018later this year\u2019 and c) 2.2B iOS install base was up an impressive 10%. Net/Net: While we understand the disappointment around Mar-qtr guide we think iPhone units are largely flat excluding some 1x dynamics. More importantly, we see a host of tailwinds stacking up in AAPL\u2019s favor ranging from Gen AI product launches to Vision Pro adoption to sustained FCF generation/uptick to capital allocation.\" For an analyst ratings summary and ratings history on Apple click here.
