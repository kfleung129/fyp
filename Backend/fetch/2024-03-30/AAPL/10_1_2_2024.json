    "text": " Apple's revenue has dropped in recent quarters, while the valuation of AAPL stock has surged in the last year Advertisement Source: Eric Broder Van Dyke / Shutterstock.com British bank Barclays hit Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock with a downgrade this morning, lowering its rating on the iPhone maker to \u201cunderweight\u201d from \u201cequal weight.\u201d Barclays noted that the sales of Apple\u2019s flagship device have been weak, and the bank does not expect that situation to change anytime soon. AAPL stock is down about 3% in early morning trading. Calling the demand for Apple\u2019s most advanced iPhone model \u201clackluster,\u201d Barclays analyst Tim Long does not expect the situation to change when the tech giant introduces an upgraded version of the device later this year. \u201cWe see no features or upgrades that are likely to make the (upcoming iPhone) more compelling.\u201d Long wrote. What\u2019s more, the sales of Apple\u2019s other hardware offerings have not grown a great deal, and Long does not expect the company\u2019s revenue from its Services category to rise more than 10% in 2024. As a result of these points, the analyst expects AAPL stock to sink sharply this year, as he placed a $160 price target on the shares versus their current level of $188. Apple\u2019s last two quarterly reports have featured small top-line declines versus the same periods a year earlier. Specifically, in the quarter that ended in September, Apple\u2019s top line came in at $89.5 billion, down from $90.15 billion in the quarter that ended in September 2022. And in the quarter that ended in July, its sales came in at $81.8 billion, versus nearly $83 billion in the same quarter in 2022. Nonetheless, the forward price-earnings ratio of AAPL stock has jumped from 21.28 a year ago to 29.15 now.
