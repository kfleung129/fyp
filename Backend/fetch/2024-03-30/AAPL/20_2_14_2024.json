We continue to navigate through earnings season, seeing plenty of quarterly prints delivered daily. The period has been primarily positive so far, underpinned by a notably strong performance from several of the Mag 7 members and the technology sector overall. So far, we\u2019ve gotten plenty of positive results, with several companies, including Apple, Deckers Outdoor and Alphabet posting quarterly records across different metrics. What was there to like in each respective release? Let\u2019s take a closer look. Deckers Outdoor Deckers Outdoor, a current Zacks Rank #1 (Buy), is a leading designer, producer, and brand manager of innovative, niche footwear and accessories developed for outdoor sports and other lifestyle-related activities. Concerning headline figures, DECK posted a 32% beat relative to the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate and reported sales 8.5% ahead of expectations, reflecting growth rates of 44% and 16%, respectively. Impressively, EPS of $15.11 and revenue of $1.6 million reflected quarterly records, driven by strength across its brands. Notably, the company\u2019s UGG and HOKA brands were standout performers, with sales of each growing 15% and 22% from the year-ago period, respectively. Deckers provided bright guidance following the release, now expecting net sales of $4.15 billion and a gross margin of 54.5%. Analysts took their earnings expectations higher following the release, with the $26.59 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate for its current fiscal year suggesting 37% year-over-year growth. Apple Apple posted quarterly revenue of $119.6 billion and record EPS of $2.18, reflecting growth rates of 2% and 16%, respectively. EPS wasn\u2019t the only quarterly record, as Services revenue of $23.1 billion reached its highest mark yet and grew 11% year-over-year. While Services results were primarily positive, it\u2019s worth noting that the reported figure modestly fell short of the Zacks Consensus estimate. iPhone revenue positively surprised, reported at $69.7 billion and improving 6% from the year-ago period. Apple shares faced adverse price action following the release, particularly stemming from demand worries in China. Revenues in China totaled $20.8 billion, moving 13% lower year-over-year. Apple shares have slightly underperformed relative to the S&P 500 over the last year, adding 22% in value vs. a 24.4% gain. While the performance hasn\u2019t been as robust as that of other members of the Mag 7, shares have been a safe haven for investors seeking business stability in a somewhat cloudy economic environment, particularly thanks to Apple\u2019s cash-generating abilities. Alphabet Alphabet posted a 2.5% beat relative to the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate, reflecting the fourth consecutive period of exceeding bottom line expectations. Quarterly revenue totaled a mighty $86.3 billion, reflecting a quarterly record and growing 13% year-over-year. There were several notable highlights from the release, including YouTube ad revenue growing 15% year-over-year and Google Cloud operating income of $864 million well above the loss of -$186 million in the year-ago period. GOOGL shares aren\u2019t overly stretched regarding valuation, with the current 21.8X forward earnings multiple (F1) beneath the five-year median and comparing favorably to the Zacks Technology sector average of 27.4X. The company\u2019s earnings are forecasted to climb 16% in its current year (FY24) on 12% higher sales. Earnings season continues chugging along, delivering us surprises daily.
