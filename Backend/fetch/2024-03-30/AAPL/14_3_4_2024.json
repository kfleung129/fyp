    "text": "The\u00a0European Commission\u00a0has fined\u00a0Apple 1.8 billion euros ($1.95 billion) for abusing its place in the music streaming market. The record fine,\u00a0announced\u00a0by the commission (EC) Monday (Mar. 4), is the European Union\u2019s first antitrust levy against Apple and comes as the tech giant is dealing with competition issues on both sides of the Atlantic. Writing in a news release, the EC said it found that Apple had restricted app developers from telling iOS users about alternative and cheaper music subscription services \u2014 such as rival Spotify \u2014 something that is illegal under Europe\u2019s antitrust regulations. \u201cApple\u2019s conduct, which lasted for almost ten years, may have led many iOS users to pay significantly higher prices for music streaming subscriptions because of the high commission fee imposed by Apple on developers and passed on to consumers in the form of higher subscription prices for the same service on the Apple App Store,\u201d the EC said in a news release. In addition, Apple\u2019s \u201canti-steering provisions\u201d caused \u201cnon-monetary harm\u201d by degrading the iOS user experience, forcing them to engage in a \u201ccumbersome search\u201d before coming across relevant offers outside the app. In a statement on its website, Apple said it would\u00a0appeal the decision, while criticizing what it said was the EC\u2019s \u201cfailure to uncover any credible evidence of consumer harm.\u201d The iPhone maker also took aim at Spotify \u2014 whose complaints prompted the EC probe \u2014 saying that the company had met with the commission 65 times during the investigation. \u201cToday, Spotify has a 56 percent share of Europe\u2019s music streaming market \u2014 more than double their closest competitors \u2014 and pays Apple nothing for the services that have helped make them one of the most recognizable brands in the world,\u201d Apple said. \u201cA large part of their success is due to the App Store, along with all the tools and technology that Spotify uses to build, update, and share their app with Apple users around the world,\u201d the company added. For its part, Spotify said that it was pleased with the outcome of the case, but argued that the EC\u2019s fine \u201cdoes not solve Apple\u2019s bad behavior\u00a0towards developers\u00a0beyond music streaming in other markets around the world.\u201d Among those other markets is the U.S., where the Justice Department is preparing an antitrust suit against Apple, which it accuses of placing software and hardware limitations on its devices to\u00a0hamstring competition. Monday\u2019s fine puts Apple in the same company as Google, which was\u00a0fined $2.8 billion\u00a0in 2017 after the EC found that the company had abused its dominant position in the online ad space. We\u2019re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors. "
