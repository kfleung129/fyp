    "text": "A sketchy report claims that development of an Apple smart ring is accelerating, following a teaser by Samsung of its own upcoming Galaxy Ring (shown above). The Korean report is light on details, citing an unnamed source claiming that \u201cpre-development for commercialization is imminent\u201d \u2026 What seems to have prompted this latest report is Samsung last month teasing its own smart ring, the Galaxy Ring. At the end of its event this morning, Samsung dropped a very brief teaser for the \u201cGalaxy Ring,\u201d an upcoming smart health tracker that you wear on your finger. Samsung\u2019s teaser mentions the device will offer health tracking and use AI in some capacity, but there\u2019s no word on pricing or when the device will launch. This appears to be similar to the Oura Ring: ET News has more detail on the Galaxy Ring. Samsung Electronics is scheduled to unveil the Galaxy Ring at the unpacked event in the second half of July. It is expected to track and measure health and sleep-related information by being equipped with blood flow measurement and electrocardiogram functions, or support remote control of other devices, wireless payment, etc. But it builds on this to suggest Apple its accelerating its own work on a competing product. Apple is also speeding up the development of Apple Ring by registering patents related to smart rings one after another. In November of last year, it filed a patent for an electronic system applied to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). It is a technology that can install a near-field wireless communication circuit and work with other devices. It is estimated that it will be used to control smartphones, tablets, etc. \u201cAs Apple has been steadily releasing smart ring-related patents for years, it seems that pre-development for commercialization is imminent,\u201d an industry official said. This report seems to be based on nothing more than the opinion of one unnamed source, and we\u2019re definitely putting it on the \u2018sketchy\u2019 pile. We\u2019ve literally been hearing talk of an \u2018iRing\u2019 in one form or another for more than a decade now, with a couple of analysts in particular pushing the idea. Yes, it\u2019s true that Apple has patents in this area \u2013 but as we frequently note, Apple patents all kinds of things, only a tiny fraction of which ever make it to market. The idea that Samsung\u2019s launch would influence the timing of any Apple launch is especially silly: The Cupertino company always operates on its own timescale, launching as and when it thinks the technology is ready and the time is right. None of this is to say that an Apple Ring won\u2019t happen. Apple\u2019s patent history clearly indicates that the company has been at least exploring the idea, and there are definitely benefits to the form factor for those who want the health monitoring features of an Apple Watch in a more compact form factor with a longer battery-life. But this particular report really doesn\u2019t shed any light. Image: Samsung (Galaxy Ring teaser) FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links. More.
