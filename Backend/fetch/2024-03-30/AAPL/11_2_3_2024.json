    "text": "Every year, Fortune magazine compiles a corporate reputation ranking of the world's most respected companies. The year 2023 has passed, which means it's time to summarise its results. The Fortune list consists of 1500 companies, 1000 of which are based in the USA, and 500 - in other countries. All of them have revenues of at least $10 billion. The magazine then filtered out only the most profitable ones and reduced the list to 680. They were then rated by about 3,700 executives, directors and analysts. They gave their scores in various categories: investment value, management quality, social responsibility, etc. As a result, the leader of the ranking was Apple. The most interesting thing is that the company took the first place for the 17th consecutive year. It received the highest scores in such areas as social responsibility, financial sustainability, innovation and global competitiveness. Despite this, Apple's score of 8.19 was lower than last year's score of 8.65. Second place in the ranking went to Microsoft, which was recognised as the leader in the computer software industry. Dropping to third place was Amazon, which still had strong results in internet services and retail. Source: Fortune "
