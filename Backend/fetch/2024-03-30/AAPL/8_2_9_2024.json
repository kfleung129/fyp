LastPass, the app used by more than 30m users to store their passwords, is warning of a fake version of its app in the Apple App Store. The company issued an alert to its customers about the impersonating app, which copies LastPass\u2019s branding and logo but is actually called \u2018LassPass Password Manager\u2019 and lists Parvati Patel as the developer. \u201cWe are raising this to our customers\u2019 attention to avoid potential confusion and/or loss of personal data,\u201d the company said on its website. \u201cRest assured, LastPass is actively working to get this application taken down as soon as possible and will continue to monitor for fraudulent clones of our applications and/or infringements upon our intellectual property.\u201d As a password management application, the data entered into LastPass\u2019s app is extremely sensitive.

However, while sensitive data was stolen, the company said that the data was encrypted and it would be very difficult for the threat actor to attempt \u201cbrute force\u201d to guess master passwords.
