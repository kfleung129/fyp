    "text": "Shares of the technology giant fell 0.4 per cent on Friday to close at about US$181 after The New York Times reported that the US Justice Department is closer to filing an antitrust case against the company. The decline notched the fifth consecutive negative day for Apple, its longest losing streak since October. The Cupertino, California-based company has been the world\u2019s most valuable publicly-listed company since July 2022, but has seen about US$177 billion in market value erased so far this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. While the stock has suffered bigger percentage declines in the first week of January, the losses are the biggest market value destruction at the start of any year on record. \u201cInvestors realise how rare it is to have two people go negative,\u201d said Gene Munster, managing partner of Deepwater Asset Management. \u201cI\u2019ve been covering this company for a long time and I\u2019ve never seen two downgrades before an earnings report.\u201d Apple is also likely under pressure as investors rotate their portfolios at the start of the year. \u201cEverybody\u2019s selling their winners and buying losers,\u201d said Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management. \u201cThere\u2019s a big rebalance going on.\u201d The losses have pushed Apple\u2019s market value down to about US$2.8 trillion, nearing Microsoft\u2019s US$2.7 trillion. Shares of Microsoft fell less than 0.1 per cent Friday to close at about US$368. "
