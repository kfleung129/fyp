    "text": "Meta said it is giving advertisers a way to avoid Apple\u2019s 30% service charge. Businesses that use boosted posts on Meta\u2019s Facebook and Instagram platforms can go to Facebook.com and Instagram.com on mobile or desktop devices to boost their content and not pay the service charge, the company said in a Thursday (Feb. 15) announcement. \u201cThe Apple service charge is a result of updates Apple made to the App Store Review Guidelines,\u201d per the announcement. \u201cStarting later this month, when an advertiser uses the Facebook or Instagram iOS app to boost a post, they will be billed through Apple, which retains a 30% service charge on the total ad payment, before any applicable taxes. This service charge is retained by Apple, not Meta.\u201d Meta said in the announcement that it is required to either comply with Apple\u2019s rules or remove boosted posts from its apps. Boosted posts let a company quickly promote content without needing to launch a full ad campaign in Meta\u2019s Ads Manager. The feature is especially popular with small businesses, for whom boosted posts are their only form of advertising on Meta. A Thursday report by Bloomberg included a statement from Apple that said treating boosts as an in-app purchase is consistent with its App Store strategy. \u201cWe have always required that purchases of digital goods and services within apps must use in-app purchase,\u201d Apple said in a statement, per the report. \u201cBoosting, which allows an individual or organization to pay to increase the reach of a post or profile, is a digital service \u2014 so of course in-app purchase is required. This has always been the case, and there are many examples of apps that do it successfully.\u201d As PYMNTS wrote last month, small- to medium-sized businesses (SMBs) are already facing challenges when trying to sell their products online, including those related to marketing. The PYMNTS Intelligence study \u201cMain Street Health Q4 2023: eCommerce Protects Main Street SMBs\u2019 Bottom Line in a Cooling Market\u201d found that 40% of SMBs said marketing costs are a key obstacle when selling their products and services online. \u201cThis factor is more challenging than others, such as shipping and delivery or providing effective customer support,\u201d PYMNTS wrote. \u201cThe study also found that 55% of SMBs think digital marketing guidance is crucial to drive their business.\u201d We\u2019re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.
