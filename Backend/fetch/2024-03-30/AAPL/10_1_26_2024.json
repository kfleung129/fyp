    "text": "Wachiwit Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) changes to the App Store to comply with European Union's regulations shouldn't make a huge difference to the company's financial results, according to analysts. The changes \u2014 which include allowing the downloading of apps from outside the App Store \u2014 will likely result in less than a 1% impact on profit, Goldman Sachs said. The impact to fiscal 2023 pro-forma revenue and earnings before interest and taxes may be 0.15% and 0.45%, respectively, the firm said. EU developers will now pay a 17% commission on apps distributed through the App Store, with the commission falling to 10% for certain qualifying apps after the first year. Apple will levy an additional 3% fee for developers choosing to use its payment processing system. The company also announced a new \"Core Technology Fee\" for apps with over a million downloads per year. The new fee will require developers to pay \u20ac0.50 per app install, and will apply to apps distributed from both the App Store or alternative marketplaces. Europe accounts for 6% of Apple's total App Store sales, J.P. Morgan said, with the loss of revenue from a lower commission rate likely to be made up for through the new fee on downloads on all types of apps from every app store. Despite the relatively limited impact of the changes, there is a chance Apple may be be forced to make similar changes elsewhere to appease regulators, J.P. Morgan said. Apple is also expected to face an antitrust case brought by the U.S. Department of Justice as soon as March. Shares of Apple were fractionally higher on Friday. "
