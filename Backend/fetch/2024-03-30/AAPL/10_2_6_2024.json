    "text": "Spotify would be experimenting with a variety of payment models, were it not for the Apple Store\u2019s so-called \u201capp tax,\u201d Spotify co-founder and CEO Daniel Ek said on the company\u2019s latest earnings call. Asked whether Spotify was looking to move beyond its \u201call-you-can-eat\u201d pricing model \u2013 i.e., a monthly flat fee for access to the service \u2013 Ek said the company is already doing just that, but on a small scale in certain limited markets, for instance \u201cday passes\u201d and \u201cweekly passes\u201d, and physical gift cards, that are available in some areas. \u201cWe are very much adapting our pricing models in favor of what consumers want. And that\u2019s something that you should expect us to continue to do,\u201d Ek said on Tuesday (February 6).  But launching ideas such as a-la-carte purchases, special premium offers to superfans, and other things that could mean \u201cmeaningful\u201d new revenue for Spotify are facing \u201ca significant hindrance today because Apple insists on taking a 30% cut, which in many cases exceeds even our own cuts that we\u2019re able to take inside of the app,\u201d Ek said. Especially in more developed countries, Spotify is \u201cprecluded\u201d from moving forward with pricing innovations in \u201ca way\u2026 which could be profitable and good for consumers and creators, because of Apple\u2019s stance,\u201d he added. The fees charged by Apple have been a bone of contention for many app developers for years. Recently, Apple\u2019s fee model has faced challenges in both the US, where it has been the subject of a closely-watched court case, and in the European Union, where a new law \u2013 the Digital Markets Act \u2013 is meant to prevent large tech companies from acting as gatekeepers of digital commerce. \u201cWe are very much adapting our pricing models in favor of what consumers want. And that\u2019s something that you should expect us to continue to do.\u201d Daniel Ek, Spotify Spotify has argued that Apple is trying to circumvent the goals of the EU\u2019s Digital Markets Act. Under Apple\u2019s new terms, \u201cif we stay in the App Store and want to offer our own in-app payment, we will pay a 17% commission and a 0.50 cent Euro Core Technology Fee per install [per] year,\u201d Spotify explained in a blog post. \u201cThis equates for us to being the same or worse as under the old rules.\u201d Spotify added: \u201cAnd if we managed to remove our app from the App Store and only existed in the Alternative App Store, that would still not work. With our EU Apple install base in the 100 million user range, this new tax on downloads and updates could skyrocket our customer acquisition costs, potentially increasing them tenfold.\u201d  On the earnings call on Tuesday, Ek said Spotify doesn\u2019t know yet how the DMA will be enforced, and whether Apple\u2019s new 17% commission 50-cent fee per user, per year, will be allowed under the EU\u2019s new rules. Ek noted that Spotify doesn\u2019t have to accept Apple\u2019s new terms, and keep going with the existing model. But that would limit certain future \u201cupsides,\u201d such as creating superfan clubs, because it \u201csimply would mean that all of Spotify would be unprofitable if we took these new terms.\u201d \u201cAll of Spotify would be unprofitable if we took these new terms [from Apple].\u201d Daniel Ek, Spotify Ek\u2019s comments came following the release of the company\u2019s Q4 earnings, which showed that Spotify\u2019s paying subscriber count rose to 236 million during the quarter, a 15% YoY increase. Monthly active users rose 23% YoY to 602 million. Both numbers exceeded the company\u2019s guidance by about 1 million. Spotify\u2019s subscriber revenues came in at \u20ac3.170 billion (USD $3.40 billion) in Q4, up 21% YoY on a constant currency basis. Ad-supported revenue came in at \u20ac501 million ($538.62 million), up 17% YoY at constant currency. The company\u2019s \u20ac75 million quarterly operating loss was smaller than guidance. Indeed, Spotify would have been comfortably profitable in the quarter if it hadn\u2019t been on the hook for charges of \u20ac143 million ($153.73 million) \u201crelated to the efficiency actions we announced in December,\u201d Spotify\u2019s outgoing CFO, Paul Vogel, said on the call. Those costs were associated with a reduction in headcount of 1,500, which reduced the company\u2019s workforce by 17%. Here are a few other things we learned on the company\u2019s earnings call\u2026 Ek and Vogel made it clear on the call that the company\u2019s push for efficiency \u2013 which, among other things, resulted in 2,300 job cuts last year, as well as the shutting down of some Spotify programming \u2013 will continue in 2024. \u201cLooking to 2024, you should expect a continuation of what you saw in 2023 \u2013 strong product development which leads to strong growth, but with an increased focus on monetization and efficiency, which in turn drives profitability,\u201d Ek said. Asked to comment on further efficiencies, Ek said that \u201cwe don\u2019t know how far that will go,\u201d but \u201cthere\u2019s still some\u201d ahead. However, he noted that \u201cthe most important thing for us\u2026 is long-term growth, still, for the company. So that\u2019s what we will optimize for.\u201d \u201cI think you\u2019re going to see us be more diligent in shutting down things that perhaps have sort of worked, but may not work as well going forward into the future.\u201d Daniel Ek, Spotify However, in a follow-up later in the call, Ek said that when it comes efficiencies, \u201cwe have actually gone through all the hard stuff this past year,\u201d perhaps indicating that any future cost-cutting measures won\u2019t be as jarring as the ones seen in 2023. Ek added that Spotify has \u201cby no means\u201d fully switched to an efficiency-first mindset. \u201cThis is [the] notion of being relentlessly resourceful. For me that means to think constantly about the resources [we have] and not just think about getting more of them, but thinking about how we reallocate, constantly, everything we\u2019re doing to the highest-impact use case and\u2026 I don\u2019t think we are [there] yet.\u201d He added that \u201cthe hurdle rates for any new type of investments will be much higher than what [they have] been. And more importantly, I think you\u2019re going to see us be more diligent in shutting down things that perhaps have sort of worked, but may not work as well going forward into the future.\u201d Spotify recently renewed its deal for the world\u2019s most popular podcast \u2013 The Joe Rogan Experience. However, that new deal \u2013 reported to be worth $250 million \u2013 differs from the original one Spotify signed with Rogan in 2020, in that it no longer gives Spotify exclusivity. Under the new agreement, Spotify will be in charge of distribution and ad sales for Rogan\u2019s show, and Rogan will receive a guaranteed minimum fee as well as a share of ad revenue. While the exclusive deals Spotify signed with podcasters were \u201cnet positive,\u201d they were \u201cnot driving as much [revenue] as the opportunity that we see on the ad side,\u201d Ek said on the call. Additionally, broadening distribution of podcasts allows Spotify to be better aligned with creators, who \u201cobviously [want] to be on many different platforms and [want] to have as big of an audience as possible,\u201d Ek said. He added: \u201cI feel like with these new deals that we\u2019ve been making, for most of 2023, we are in a position where we\u2019re actually better aligned with [creators], we can both deliver the growth rate and we are equally incentivized to drive audience growth, and of course, then also drive revenue growth because [Spotify and creators] both share in that upside.\u201d \u201cWe have doubled down on the deals that worked, and we have got really throughout 2023, gotten out of a lot of the deals that didn\u2019t work,\u201d said Ek. He added: \u201cWhen we walked into podcasting, we went in with multiple strategies at once. We did exclusives\u2026 but we also did our own and original programming, and we also did licensed nonexclusive deals, too\u2026 I think many people [thought] that this was an all-out exclusive effort similar to that of Netflix. But we said we take much more of an \u2018opportunity\u2019 approach to the strategy and we\u2019re going to try many different things.\u201dMusic Business Worldwide The best of MBW, plus the most important music biz stories on the web.
