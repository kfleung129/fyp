IGTV financial analyst Angeline Ong looks at what has driven Microsoft's market value up, helping it to eclipse the iPhone giant. (AI Video Summary) Microsoft has taken over Apple as the most valuable company in the world by market value. This change can be mostly attributed to Microsoft focusing on generative artificial intelligence, which has caught the attention of investors. This increased interest in AI has given Microsoft's stock a boost, much like other tech stocks. On the flip side, Apple has been dealing with a decrease in demand for its famous iPhone, particularly in China. Looking at the bigger picture, Apple's stock has actually performed well in 2023, benefiting from different factors. However, Microsoft has also experienced significant gains and now has a larger market value than Apple. This rise in Microsoft's worth highlights the growing importance and potential of generative artificial intelligence. This technology allows machines to learn and generate data, and investors are very excited about it. It is also transforming many industries. Microsoft's investment and focus on AI have undeniably played a major role in its rise to become the most valuable company. On the other hand, Apple's dependence on the iPhone for its profits has created challenges as the demand for this iconic device has decreased, especially in the saturated smartphone market of China. This struggle with declining iPhone sales has hurt Apple's stock performance and allowed Microsoft to surpass it in market value. Overall, this shift in the world's most valuable company shows just how important technological advancements like AI are and how they impact the market. It also reminds us that even giant companies like Apple need to constantly innovate and diversify their products to stay ahead in the ever-changing market landscape.
