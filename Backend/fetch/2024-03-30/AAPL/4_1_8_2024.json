    "text": " Apple announces Vision Pro VR headset launch Advertisement Source: Eric Broder Van Dyke / Shutterstock.com Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock closed up by more than 2% today after the tech giant revealed the U.S. launch date of its Apple Vision Pro virtual reality (VR) headset. Indeed, the tech giant announced that the headset will release Feb. 2, with preorders opening up next Friday, Jan. 19. So, what do you need to know about Apple\u2019s latest tech marvel? Well, after years of anticipation, it seems the company is finally ready to move ahead with its own model of \u201cspatial computing.\u201d In a press release earlier today, CEO Tim Cook had some words of encouragement ahead of Apple\u2019s latest major product release. \u201cApple Vision Pro is the most advanced consumer electronics device ever created. Its revolutionary and magical user interface will redefine how we connect, create, and explore,\u201d Cook said. The Vision Pro is Apple\u2019s response to the popularity of Meta Platforms\u2019 (NASDAQ:META) Quest headsets, albeit with some notable distinctions. The Vision Pro is equipped with visionOS, for example, Apple\u2019s proprietary operating system for the device. The device also features an input system entirely dictated by the user\u2019s eyes, hands and voice and has an M2 chip to boot.  Famously, the Vision Pro also reflects the user\u2019s eyes on an outward-facing screen, as to allow communication with others while wearing the device. The headset starts at $3,500, with an additional $149 charge for prescription lens inserts. Today\u2019s news comes as something of a blessing for AAPL stock. Indeed, the news has helped snap Apple\u2019s recent five-day losing streak, which has seen the company shed around 6% of its share value. Reasonably so, the launch mark\u2019s Apple\u2019s biggest new product launch since the release of AirPods back in 2016. Not everyone is bullish on this new launch, however. Some analysts remain doubtful that the device will be a big revenue-maker for the company. This includes UBS, which estimates that the Vision Pro will bring in $1.4 billion in revenue, a \u201crelatively immaterial\u201d figure for Apple. At $3,500 per unit, the Vision Pro is more than three times pricier than even the most expensive Meta Quest model. It also ranks as one of the most expensive Apple products, close in price to a fully equipped MacBook Pro.
