    "text": "Stock Analysis Today we're going to take a look at the well-established Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). The company's stock     saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NASDAQGS, rising to highs of US$198 and falling to the lows of US$167. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Apple's current trading price of US$182 reflective of the actual value of the  large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let\u2019s take a look at Apple\u2019s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. Check out our latest analysis for Apple According to our valuation model, Apple seems to be fairly priced at around  12.04% above our intrinsic value, which means if you buy Apple today, you\u2019d be paying a relatively reasonable price for it. And if you believe the company\u2019s true value is $162.36,  then there isn\u2019t really any room for the share price grow beyond what it\u2019s currently trading.    Although, there may be an opportunity to buy in the future. This is because Apple\u2019s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company\u2019s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity. Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares.   Although value investors would argue that it\u2019s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price.    With profit expected to grow by a double-digit 19% over the next couple of years, the outlook is positive for Apple. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation. Are you a shareholder? AAPL\u2019s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price,  with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven\u2019t considered today, such as  the track record of its management team.  Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough  conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value? Are you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping an eye on AAPL,  now may not be the most  advantageous  time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the  optimistic prospect  is encouraging for the company, which means it\u2019s worth  diving deeper into  other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.
