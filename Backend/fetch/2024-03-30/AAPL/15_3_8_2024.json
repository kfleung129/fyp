Apple restored \u201cFortnite\u201d maker Epic Games\u2019 permissions to offer its own app store to iPhone customers in Europe on Friday \u2014 just one day after European Union regulators suggested its brazen move to block Epic may have violated a sweeping new antitrust law. Apple faced scrutiny under European Union\u2019s Digital Markets Act \u2014 a law that took effect this week and placed restrictions on six \u201cgatekeeper\u201d Big Tech firms. The law requires Apple to allow developers to run their own app stores \u2014 something Epic sought to do until Apple terminated its account in response to CEO Tim Sweeney\u2019s public criticism of its tough business tactics. Epic Games \u2014 which has engaged in a years-long legal battle with Apple over its App Store policies \u2014 said it would move forward with its plans to offer Fortnite and its Epic Games Store. \u201cThis sends a strong signal to developers that the European Commission will act swiftly to enforce the Digital Markets Act and hold gatekeepers accountable,\u201d Epic Games said in a statement. Elsewhere, Sweeney \u2014 who had previously referred to Apple\u2019s proposed compliance plan with the law as \u201chot garbage\u201d \u2014 lauded the company\u2019s decision as \u201ca big win for European rule of law, for the European Commission, and for the freedom of developers worldwide to speak up.\u201d The abrupt change of heart came one day after the European Commission \u2014 the EU\u2019s competition agency \u2014 said it had \u201crequested further explanations on this from Apple under the DMA.\u201d EU competition chief Margrethe Vestager snarkilly said gamers will \u201cbe able to play @FortniteGame once it will be back on iOS\u201d alongside a winking-face emoji. \u201cFollowing conversations with Epic, they have committed to follow the rules, including our DMA policies,\u201d Apple said in a statement. \u201cAs a result, Epic Sweden AB has been permitted to re-sign the developer agreement and accepted into the Apple Developer Program.\u201d Epic had initially described Apple\u2019s move to terminate its developer account in Europe as a \u201cserious violation\u201d of the DMA. The North Carolina-based video game giant published a letter from the head of Apple\u2019s App Store, Phil Schiller, who slammed Epic for publicly bashing its tactics. \u201cYour colorful criticism of our DMA compliance plan, coupled with Epic\u2019s past practice of intentionally violating contractual provisions with which it disagrees, strongly suggest that Epic Sweden does not intend to follow the rules,\u201d Schiller said in the letter. Schiller asked Epic Games to provide \u201cwritten assurance\u201d that it is acting in \u201cgood faith\u201d and to explain \u201cwhy we should trust Epic this time.\u201d Meanwhile, Apple asserted in previous statements that it court rulings had affirmed it had the \u201csole discretion\u201d to terminate deals with developers if they were found to have violated the terms of their contract. The spat marked the latest twist in a long-running feud between the corporate giants that began in 2020, when Fortnite was banned from Apple\u2019s App Store in the US after Epic tried to bypass its system for in-app purchases. An ensuing lawsuit resulted in a split verdict that mostly favored Apple. The European Commission has taken a hardline stance toward Apple on antitrust matters. Earlier this month, it hit Apple with a massive $2 billion fine after investigators found it had illegally restricted music app developers from advertising cheaper ways to subscribe to their streaming services outside the App Store Advertisement "
