AAPL is contemplating a few innovative products that could add further strength to the company\u2019s sticky ecosystem. What Happened: Separate Apple teams have begun brainstorming about a smart ring and smart glasses, said Bloomberg columnist Mark Gurman in the latest installment of his weekly Power On newsletter. Apple\u2019s industrial design team made a presentation about the concept of the smart ring, which can be worn on fingers, a few years ago, and the ring will likely adopt Apple Watch\u2019s health-tracking features, Gurman said. He also noted that engineers at Apple\u2019s lab in California more recently discussed the possibility of developing smart glasses. These smart glasses will be along the lines of similar products from Meta Platforms and Amazon, Gurman said. They will provide audio, removing the need for AirPods, and will leverage AI and cameras to identify objects around the user, he said. \u201cThe device also could act as a stepping stone toward Apple's long-held dream: true augmented reality spectacles that you can wear all day,\u201d the columnist said. The smart ring, Gurman said, is currently a mere idea, although those at Apple\u2019s campus are promoting the concept. The glasses are in an \u201cexploratory phase\u201d within the company\u2019s hardware engineering division, he  said. The columnist added the company is also exploring other ideas, such as equipping AirPods with cameras, along with\u00a0more \u201cadvanced AI and\u00a0health sensors.\u201d \u201cThat would give consumers many of the benefits of smart glasses without needing lenses and frames,\u201d he added. See Also: Everything You Need To Know About Apple Stock Why It\u2019s Important: The smart ring and smart glasses, Gurman said, will likely bolster the company\u2019s already solid wearable devices business. This division currently accounts for 10% of Apple\u2019s revenue, more than doubling its share from a decade ago, he noted. Delving into the importance of the wearables device business, Gurman said it will help the company rope in new customers, boost growth and \u201ckeep people even more locked into the Apple ecosystem.\u201d A smart ring could appeal to users who are focused on health and fitness and are not keen to have the other features of an Apple Watch, such as apps and phone calls, the columnist said. The smart ring could be a low-cost way to gather key health data without the need for wearing a full-blown watch, he further added. If the company sells the ring as an iPhone accessory, it is less likely an Apple customer will shift their allegiance to an Android phone, he added. With glasses, Apple could settle for a less ambitious yet functional product similar to the likes of Amazon\u2019s Echo Frames and Meta\u2019s Ray-Ban Smart Glasses, Gurman said. But the ones that meet Apple\u2019s standards for visual quality, performance, battery life and size could still be several years away, he said. Lower-cost wearable options, be it a ring or glasses or supercharged AirPods, could help Apple \u201cturn things around\u201d without stealing sales from existing products, the columnist said. Although the company snapped a four-quarter year-over-year revenue-declining streak in the December quarter, sales growth has yet to take off in a big way. Apple ended Friday\u2019s session down 1% at $182.52, according to Benzinga Pro data. Photo: Shutterstock \u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com. Benzinga does not provide investment advice. All rights reserved.
