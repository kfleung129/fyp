    "text": "BREAKING: Core PCE Inflation In Line With Views     Hardcore Apple (AAPL) fans grabbed the initial production run of Apple Vision Pro headsets during the first weekend of preorders. But the real test for the spatial computing device will come in the weeks ahead, analysts say. Apple stock rose on Monday. In a blog post, TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo estimates that Apple sold 160,000 to 180,000 units of Vision Pro over the first three days of preorders. That's at least 40% of the 400,000 units Apple reportedly plans to sell in the first year. Apple began taking preorders for the mixed-reality headset on Friday. The Apple Vision Pro officially goes on sale Feb. 2. However, Kuo is cautious about near-term demand for the $3,500 computer headset. \"The instant sold-out and extended shipping times seem positive at first, but a key concern emerged: shipping times remained unchanged 48 hours after preorders opened,\" Kuo said. \"It indicates that demand may quickly taper off after the core fans and heavy users place their orders.\" The key factor to watch is \"whether the demand is sustainable,\" he said. \"Right now, Vision Pro is still a very niche product.\" Apple Vision Pro is the highest-profile launch in the spatial computing headset space to date. But others are working on headsets ranging from mixed-reality goggles to augmented-reality smartglasses. JPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee thinks investor focus on Vision Pro availability and \"lead times\" is misplaced. \"The focus should be on the consumer feedback on the experience of the device,\" he said in a client note Monday. \"The orders currently being put through for the Vision Pro are prior to the product being tried or experienced by any customers.\" Apple will start demonstrating the device in stores on Feb. 2. Chatterjee added that investors also should watch for supply chain moves around the second-generation Vision Pro. Chatterjee rates Apple stock as overweight with a price target of 225. On the stock market today, Apple stock rose 1.2% to close at 193.89. With Monday's gains, Apple stock returned to the buy zone of its Dec. 5 breakout from a cup-with-handle base with a 192.93 buy point, according to IBD MarketSmith charts. The 5% buy zone stretches to 202.58. Apple stock reclaimed its 50-day line on Friday and could be forming a new base with a buy point of 199.62.
