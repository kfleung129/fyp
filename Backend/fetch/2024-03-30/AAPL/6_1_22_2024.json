    "text": "Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Apple\u2019s major iPhone security update is now available to download, designed to keep thieves from accessing users\u2019 vast personal data stored on the devices, the company announced Monday. The \u201cStolen Device Protection\u201d update adds an extra layer of protection by creating additional steps to access information. It is available with Monday\u2019s iOS 17.3 update. You can turn it on by updating your iPhone and scrolling down to Face ID & Passcode in your settings. You will be prompted to type in your passcode, and then you can scroll down to Stolen Device Protection and turn it on. To use Stolen Device Protection, you must have two-factor authentication and \u201cFind My\u201d enabled for your Apple ID account. Before the update, iPhone users could view highly sensitive information (from credit card information to every stored password) and make major changes to their phone\u2019s settings with just a passcode \u2013 typically a four or six-digit number. With Stolen Device Protection, users will be asked to enter biometric data via Face ID (face scan) or Touch ID (fingerprint) to access data or make changes. For more sensitive actions \u2013 changing an Apple ID password, adding or removing face or fingerprint scanning, turning off Find My or turning off the stolen device protection itself \u2013 users will be asked for biometric data and then wait through an hour-long security delay before re-entering biometric data to make the changes. \u201cAs threats to user devices continue to evolve, we work tirelessly to develop powerful new protections for our users and their data,\u201d an Apple spokesperson said in a statement to CNN. \u201cIn the rare cases where a thief can observe the user entering the passcode and then steal the device, Stolen Device Protection adds a sophisticated new layer of protection.\u201d The extra security measures are only enacted when a user is away from a familiar location like work or home. These locations are automatically learned and stored by the device. Most stock quote data provided by BATS.
