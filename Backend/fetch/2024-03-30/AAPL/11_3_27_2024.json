    "text": "In response to the antitrust lawsuit filed by the Ministry of Justice, Apple strongly denies all claims of illegal monopolisation of the software market. Apple has stated that it has never prevented users from switching to other products or blocked competitors' applications or services in its system. Apple representatives assured that any restrictions they impose on application developers are aimed at protecting the privacy and security of users. The company claims that it does not intend to make it difficult to switch to competitors' products, and cites the availability of popular applications such as Facebook, WeChat and Line on its platforms. Regarding the accusation that Apple Watch support is more deeply integrated with the iPhone than with other wearable devices, the company explained that this is due to the need to develop products that are compatible with different operating systems and device models. They also rejected the idea that it is difficult for users to switch to other products, as data can be easily transferred from iPhone to Android devices. Representatives of the Ministry of Justice emphasise that Apple's actions could threaten innovations that could compete with its monopoly in the market, thereby suppressing the development of innovative products and services. The tension in the case is growing, and the court's decision could determine the future regulation of tech giants and affect the innovative dynamics of the software market. Source: Engadget "
