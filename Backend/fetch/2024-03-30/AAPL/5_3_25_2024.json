Happy Holi Guys \ud83d\ude01#shotoniphone by - @joshuakarthikr @Apple pic.twitter.com/Ns1YsfvMbE Camera Changes in iPhone 16 The iPhone 16 series will be launching later this year but Apple is expected to make some design changes related to the camera, especially in the non-Pro models. Apple is expected to opt for a new oval camera island that will hold both the camera sensors vertically. This setup will allow Apple iPhone 16 non-Pro models to capture Spatial videos, that can be played back on the Apple Vision Pro. The pro models are expected to retain most of the design with a triple camera setup and a front-facing notch. However, the Pro models are expected to get a bump in size. The smaller 6.1-inch screen may graduate to a 6.3-inch screen and the bigger iPhone 16 Pro Max is expected to get a massive 6.9-inch display. Copyright\u00a92024 Living Media India Limited.
