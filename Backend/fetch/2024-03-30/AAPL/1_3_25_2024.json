Real estate experts predict that this innovative augmented reality device will transform how people interact with and perceive the property market. \u201cFollowing its official release in the region, I truly think it will bring a new level of immersion into the whole buying property process. In particular, it will create a huge opportunity for developers launching off-plan properties,\u201d Carl Allsopp, CEO of Allsopp & Allsopp Group said in an exclusive interview with Arabian Business. Foreseeable opportunities with the gadget include like-for-like walkthroughs of homes before it being built or without having to visit the location in-person. Allsopp believes that, \u201cIn the real estate sector, its use will make viewings 10 times better, as you can feel, move, and experience the real feeling of what it would be like to live in that house.\u201d The glasses also incorporate advanced spatial mapping technology, allowing users to visualise how a property would look with different colour schemes, furniture arrangements, and even renovations. \u201cI believe there is a huge opportunity for developers to showcase their newly launched properties, showcasing what a property could look like \u2013 from the kitchen counters to bathroom space \u2013 you can even step out onto a balcony to see what the view is like from your bedroom window,\u201d he said. Agents can now conduct virtual property tours with clients, regardless of their geographical location. This breakthrough eliminates the need for time-consuming and costly in-person visits, expanding the market reach for both buyers and sellers. Allsopp recognises the content as the biggest driver of real estate transactions, agents are increasingly expanding their online presence to showcase property features to drive investor interest. \u201cThis will be great for agents too as it could lead to more qualified inquiries from buyers, save time on viewings, and remove the need for them to be on the field as much filming 2D videos \u2013 they can instead provide their buyers and sellers with an immersive 3D experience,\u201d he said. Furthermore, Vision Pro enhances the efficiency of property searches. Users have the the option to walk down a street or neighbourhood while wearing the glasses, and relevant property information, such as pricing, square footage, and availability, will be displayed in real-time. This streamlined process saves time for both buyers and agents, enabling them to focus on properties that truly match their needs. Emphasising the advantage, Allsopp said, \u201c2D vs. 3D viewing \u2013 in 3D you can see more, you can move around the property, and even hear the sounds of the neighbourhood \u2013 like birds chirping or children playing. It will be very helpful for buyers to experience what living there could be like.\u201d Aside from all the advantages of the technology, it could cause drastic shifts in responsibilities and roles and the overall functioning of the property market. There is also a major factor that accompanies the acceptance of this technology as part of daily work \u2013 the cost. The device itself can cost around $3,500 and this excludes further costs to make it adaptable to the specific needs of the real estate company, including building apps and more. \u201cThe device itself is not cheap,\u201d Allsopp said, adding that, \u201cThose who invest and take risks early on could benefit the most in years to come.\u201d \u201cYes, there will be an added cost, but I do not think it will place any hurdles in acceptance \u2013 times are changing and everyone is evolving with them,\u201d he explained. Industry experts predict that the Apple Vision Pro will have a profound impact on the real estate market. With its immersive and interactive capabilities, it has the potential to attract new buyers, accelerate the property search process, and enhance the overall efficiency of the industry. \u201cIt may take a few years to get there, but I am excited to see what\u2019s in store,\u201d Allsopp concluded.
