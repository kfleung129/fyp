    "text": "Apple\u2019s third-party app store announcements \u2013 in which the company set out the terms on which it will claim compliance with European antitrust law \u2013 was nothing if not confident. The company\u2019s announcement combined criticism of the law that required it, exceedingly tough requirements on any developer wanting to sell outside the App Store, and warnings intended to deter users from buying their apps anywhere else \u2026 The headline news was that iOS 17.4 complies with Europe\u2019s Digital Markets Act (DMA) antitrust law, by allowing developers to sell their apps outside of the official Apple App Store. The headlining change in iOS 17.4 for users in the European Union is a new set of options for distributing iOS apps from alternative app marketplaces. This includes \u201cnew APIs and tools that enable developers to offer their iOS apps for download from alternative app marketplaces.\u201d This is essentially Apple opening the iPhone to third-party app stores for the first time. iPhone users will be able to download a new app store from a third party\u2019s website. The wording of Apple\u2019s announcement makes it clear that the company is only begrudgingly complying with a law it thinks should never have been passed. \u201cApple is introducing new safeguards that reduce \u2014 but don\u2019t eliminate \u2014 new risks the DMA poses to EU users\u201d \u201cThe new options for processing payments and downloading apps on iOS open new avenues for malware, fraud and scams, illicit and harmful content, and other privacy and security threats.\u201d \u201cthe unavoidable increased privacy and security threats this regulation brings\u201d \u201ca less intuitive user experience\u201d \u201cthe new options for developers\u2019 EU apps create new risks to Apple users and their devices\u201d \u201cmay negatively affect the user experience, including impacts to system performance and battery life\u201d \u201cApple will not be able to issue refunds, and will have less ability to support customers encountering issues, scams, or fraud\u201d \u201cmore opportunities for bad actors to steal sensitive financial information\u201d The impression Apple seeks to create is that this is essentially the end of app civilisation as we know it. If developers were hoping that this would open up a Mac-like world, where they are free to sell their own apps direct to users from their own websites, free from Apple\u2019s cut, they were disappointed. Apple has gone the third-party app store rather than sideloading route. And no, a small developer can\u2019t set up their own app store to sell their own apps: Apple requires anyone wanting to do this to have a \u20ac1M ($1.09M) letter of credit. This is not even saying you have to be big enough to have a million Euro business \u2013 it\u2019s saying you must have so much money that you can set aside one million Euros to cover any claims from developers or app buyers. Effectively, it\u2019s more than a million bucks tied-up in escrow, so you\u2019d need to be a huge business to be in a position to do that. There\u2019s also an annual fee of \u20ac0.50 (55c) per app install, which means that if you offer a free app which goes viral, you could be filing for bankruptcy rather than celebrating. Many freemium apps operate on a business model where a tiny fraction of their customers upgrade to a paid version, but if they hit over a million downloads, they pay for all the non-paying users too. I fell for Apple\u2019s misleading numbers. It\u2019s actually WAY WORSE. The $310k is MONTHLY.8 million installs would cost $3.7 MILLION https://t.co/sdC0HdZTw9 Did Apple just pull a Unity?!? WTF is going on in the games world? Imagine a few months from now you use Unity 6 (dumb move #1) and end up getting dinged per install TWICE. Plus the Core Technology Fee. What a year it\u2019s gonna be\u2026\ud83e\udd23 Apple has bought itself some time here for sure \u2013 in part, because what it has come up with is so complicated it will take regulators some time to digest all the details and run all the numbers. But there seems little doubt that Apple is aiming to do everything it can to make leaving the App Store as difficult and expensive as possible. Some tiny fraction of 1% of developers will be big enough to create their own \u2018app marketplace,\u2019 and developers who work on a freemium model could end up punished for their own success. Letters of credit and escrow are different things. A letter of credit is a contract between, in this case, the App Marketplace\u2019s (as a foreign entity) bank and Apple to affect payment once proof has been submitted. Also, it demonstrates the creditworthiness of the App Marketplace prior to commencement of the agreement. Escrow is the actual withholding of funds while and as long as the agreement is in place.  That said, both can be applied simultaneously. 500K each if the parties are in agreement. Once all the dust has settled, it seems pretty clear that regulators are not going to consider what Apple has done as DMA compliant. Apple will maintain that it is. And sooner or later the two sides will end up arguing the case in court. As with most court battles involving Apple, it will likely be many years before a final ruling is made. Even if Apple loses \u2013 as I would expect it to \u2013 that means it has been able to keep developers in the App Store, and protect its 15% or 30% cut, for all that time. Who will win the PR battle \u2013 Apple, or the developers who are up in arms about this \u2013 remains to be seen.
