What Happened: The new iPad Pro and iPad Air models are expected to be released in early May, according to sources familiar with the matter,\u00a0reported\u00a0Bloomberg columnist Mark Gurman on Thursday. The new Pro model is rumored to feature OLED displays and a 12.9-inch screen for the iPad Air for the first time. This release will mark the end of the longest period without new iPad models since Apple co-founder Steve Jobs launched the product in 2010. The last update was about 18 months ago, contributing to a decline in tablet demand. The Cupertino, California-based tech giant is hoping that the new models, equipped with faster chips and updated accessories, will reinvigorate the category, Gurman noted.
