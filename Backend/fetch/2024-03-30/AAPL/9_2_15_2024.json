    "text": "       Mark Zuckerberg posted a takedown this week of Apple\u2019s just-launched Vision Pro, criticizing its cost and specs, and calling out Apple's \"fanboys.\" It was a surprising swipe from the Meta boss at one of his biggest virtual-reality rivals. But if history's any indication, underestimating Apple is a risky play. After the iPhone launched in 2007, the outspoken Microsoft founder Steve Ballmer infamously laughed off the product. Related stories \"Five hundred dollars? Fully subsidized? With a plan?\u201d Ballmer said at the time. \u201cI said, that is the most expensive phone in the world, and it doesn't appeal to business customers because it doesn't have a keyboard \u2014 which makes it not a very good email machine. Now, it may sell very well or not.\" It sold \u2014 very well. Now Zuckerberg has hit out at Apple\u2019s $3,500 Vision Pro, deriding Apple \u201cfanboys\u201d and saying they're hyping a product with inferior specs to Meta\u2019s $500 competitor, the Quest headset. Zuckerberg said on top of being cheaper, the Quest had a brighter screen and was more comfortable than Apple's divisive device \u2014 though he did concede the Vision Pro had \u201creally nice\u201d eye tracking and resolution. \"I know that some fanboys get upset whenever anyone dares to question if Apple's going to be the leader in a new category,\" Zuckerberg said in an Instagram review of the Vision Pro posted Tuesday. \"But the reality is that every generation of computing has an open and a closed model,\" he said. \"And yeah, in mobile, Apple's closed model won, but it's not always that way.\" He added: \"I really want to make sure that the open model wins out. Again, the future is not yet written.\" Read next Jump to "
