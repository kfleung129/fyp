    "text": "A look at the 8 proposals under consideration at the unofficial proxy-voting season kickoff. The annual meeting for Apple AAPL informally kicks off the proxy-voting season. If Apple\u2019s proxy is any indication, expect investors to be looking closely at artificial intelligence, pay equity, and compensation. Apple\u2019s proxy contains eight proposals. Three are from management, asking investors to elect Apple\u2019s directors, to ratify its accounting firm appointment, and to approve executive compensation. You can read the Apple proxy here. You might expect some pushback on Apple\u2019s high compensation. Morningstar Sustainalytics rates Apple as an \u201coutperformer\u201d on corporate governance, yet notes: \u201cThe long service of all members of the remuneration committee together with Apple CEO Timothy Cook\u2019s long tenure may raise concerns over the committee\u2019s ability to independently fulfill its role in the oversight of executive compensation.\u201d This year, investors will focus more heavily on compensation, particularly after a Delaware court voided Tesla CEO Elon Musk\u2019s large pay package, predicts Jackie Cook, director of Morningstar Sustainalytics\u2019 Stewardship Services team. The remaining five proposals are from shareholders. Apple advises investors to vote against the proposal, claiming the report is extremely broad and could hurt its competitive position by forcing it to disclose strategic plans. The proposal is important because of the rapid adoption of generative AI technologies across workplaces, says Cook of Morningstar Sustainalytics. \u201cCybersecurity risk is amplified by AI technologies,\u201d says Cook, who notes that new SEC cybersecurity risk disclosure rules specifically ask for reporting on board oversight. Apple recommends that shareholders vote against the proposal, asserting that \u201cwe already have a comprehensive approach to promoting pay equity and diverse representation at every level of the company\u201d and that it has achieved different kinds of pay equity. The proposal could receive strong support, says Morningstar Sustainalytics\u2019 Cook. Last year, shareholders at Nike NKE and Oracle ORCL asked both companies for gender and racial pay-gap reporting. These proposals earned majority support from independent shareholders, meaning nonfamily and noninsider shareholders. The three proposals are \u201canti-ESG,\u201d which are typically opposed to sustainability measures by companies. Often, these proposals \u201clook very similar\u201d to pro-sustainability ballot items, says Morningstar\u2019s Cook. Such proposals, however, get low support. In 2023, support ranged between 1% and 4%. \u201cMost investors recognize that so-called \u2018anti-ESG\u2019 proponents\u2014individuals and opaquely funded grassroots organizations\u2014do not share their vision for sustainable business and have become suspicious of their motives,\u201d Cook added. \u201cWhile the resolution itself may seem reasonable, the proponent\u2019s supporting statement may contain subtle, or not-so-subtle, attacks on companies\u2019 sustainability efforts.\u201d Lindsey Stewart, Morningstar\u2019s director of investment stewardship research, adds, \u201cInvestors need to be careful, read the resolution properly, read the supporting statement properly, and find out the proponents.\u201d The author or authors do not own shares in any securities mentioned in this article.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFind out about Morningstar\u2019s editorial policies.
