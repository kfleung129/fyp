It also alleges that Aude\u00a0leaked regulatory compliance strategies, employee\u00a0headcounts, and other product hardware\u00a0characteristics. Apple claims that Aude\u2019s leaks were not discovered until late 2023, despite him joining the company\u00a0in 2016 as an iOS\u00a0engineer with access to sensitive product information.

The Cupertino, California-based tech giant also accused the former iOS engineer of leaking\u00a0a list of finalized features\u00a0for Apple's Journal app in\u00a0a phone call that occurred\u00a0in April 2023 to the\u00a0same reporter. A story about\u00a0the unreleased app's features appeared\u00a0that same month in The\u00a0Wall Street Journal.
