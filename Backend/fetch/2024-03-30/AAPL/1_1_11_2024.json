Ahead of last year\u2019s annual meeting, National Legal and Policy Center \u2013 a shareholder in Apple \u2013 called for fellow investors to oppose Gore\u2019s reelection, explaining in a lengthy memo filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission why he was unqualified to serve in such an influential leadership role and was detrimental to the company. NLPC wrote in part: Mr. Gore has held a position on Apple\u2019s board since 2003, despite having no relevant experience in technology or core business functions. His primary benefit to the board is his supposed climate change expertise. However, Mr. Gore\u2019s public reputation is inconsistent with his track record, his carbon-intensive lifestyle, and his actual investments. Instead, he has used his public advocacy as a tool for personal enrichment. In addition, his political activism poses to Apple a reputational risk that is not worth his limited skillset. Following the announcement, Paul Chesser, Director of NLPC\u2019s Corporate Integrity Project, stated: \u201cAl Gore was Apple\u2019s longest serving director, for more than 20 years \u2013 but he never should have even served a day. How influential were his many distortions and exagerations over the years about energy and climate? How much more did his policy preferences increase the costs of Apple products to unaffordable highs for many more potential customers? How much did his hypocritical jet-setting and personal electricity use undermine the company\u2019s reputation?\u201d \u201cApple is a great company, but it would have been even greater without the presence of Al Gore. Good riddance.\u201d NLPC is also sponsoring a shareholder proposal at the upcoming annual meeting, which seeks accountability from the Cupertino, Calif.-based tech giant about its human rights policies versus its actions. Founded in 1991, NLPC promotes ethics in public life and government accountability through research, investigation, education, and legal action. ### For more information or to schedule an interview with Paul Chesser, contact Dan Rene at 202-329-8357 or drene@nlpc.org.
