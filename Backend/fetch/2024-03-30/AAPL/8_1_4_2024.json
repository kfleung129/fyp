Our expert review: The new MacBook Pro 16-inch (2023) was a surprising, though somewhat expected, release earlier this year. Apple has upgraded its previous model to the new M2 Pro and M2 Max chipsets that they claim provides 30% faster GPU performance over the M1 predecessor. Additionally, Apple has continued to refine the efficiency of the chip resulting in an incredibly long-lasting battery for all-day performance. With an incredible range of upgrade options, users can spec out a wickedly fast machine that can handle all kinds of graphics- and processor-intensive tasks. Pair a beautiful screen, a long-lasting battery, and new M2 chipsets together, and you\u2019ve got a machine with the performance we used to dream about. Read the full review: 16-in MacBook Pro (M2, 2023)  Our expert review: This model is the one to get when you're looking for a MacBook Pro and are on a budget. One of the first Apple silicon computers released, the 13-inch MacBook Pro (M1, 2020), has a lot going for it, starting with its Apple M1 system on a chip. For a seamless video editing experience, upgrade the storage and RAM to the highest possible levels for the best results. In addition, this laptop is now the last current MacBook Pro to feature a Touch Bar, if that makes a difference. Be wary of its limited ports, however. You'll only get\u00a02x Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) and a 3.5mm headphone jack. Although it has the same design as the non-M1 2020 Pro model that it replaced, it offers considerably better performance (2.8 times faster). Not to mention, the new Magic Keyboard presents a precise and comfortable typing experience. Read the full review: 13-inch MacBook Pro (M1, 2020).  Our expert review: Released in 2022, the MacBook Air M2 is Apple\u2019s latest offering of its featherweight business laptop for those who want a lightweight and powerful machine. With an upgraded M2 chip, larger screen, and new 1080p webcam, the 2022 Macbook Air takes portability to the next level. Unfortunately, these new upgrades come at a cost, and you\u2019ll be spending more than its predecessor. For some though, the upgrades will be worth it. Read the full review: MacBook Air (M2, 2022).  Our expert review: The iMac has long been one of the cheaper ways to get into the macOS ecosystem, and we\u2019re glad that hasn\u2019t changed. The 2021 model received a beautiful refresh, while still maintaining the iMac\u2019s iconic all-in-one design. Apple managed to increase the size of the display while retaining the same physical dimensions of the previous model. Under the hood you\u2019ll find the upgraded M1 processor that is fast and snappy. Depending on your requirements, you might find the maximum 16 GB RAM and limited ports underwhelming for some business purposes. However, for the price, the 24-inch M1 iMac has a lot to offer businesses looking for an all-in-one product from Apple. Read the full review: Apple iMac (M1 24-inch, 2021).  Our expert review: Hands down, Apple is blowing away the competition with their latest Mac Mini (M2, 2023) model. With a new, lower price point for its base model and an upgraded and more powerful M2 Pro chip option, the Mac mini fits as easily on your desk as it does in your budget. You\u2019ll also find plenty of ports (even more are available on the M2 Pro model) for connecting all of your desktop peripherals. Put together, we can\u2019t find a better mini PC option on the market right now. Read the full review: Mac mini (M2, 2023)  Our expert review: Apple\u2019s largest iPad is the closest yet to replicating the feeling of a laptop in a tablet, especially when paired with a full-sized keyboard dock. Featuring a gorgeous design, a laptop-worthy M2 chip, an unparalleled mini-LED touchscreen display with 120 Hz refresh rate, and support for the Apple Pencil, this iPad is as enticing as it is powerful. iPad OS offers a unique middle ground between tablet and laptop workflows and access to the vast library on the App Store. If you\u2019re in the market for a laptop but need the functionality and portability of a tablet, look no further than the most capable tablet on the market. Read the full review: iPad Pro 12.9 (2022). When choosing the best business Mac for yourself, start with assessing the nature of your business, the kind of work you'll primarily do on the Mac, and whether you'll be on the road a lot. If you're in graphic design, video editing, architecture, or any other field that demands resource-intensive apps, then it's best to select a powerful Mac with an impressive processor and graphic capabilities. But if your work mainly involves using an internet browser or data entry, an entry-level MacBook should work perfectly well. You'll want to select the RAM based on how much multitasking you do and how resource-heavy your apps are. Look out for the connectivity ports on the device, especially if you plan to hook your laptop up to an external display. For those who're on the road frequently, the laptop's size and weight are essential considerations. Lastly, check how much storage the laptop offers and whether your budget can accommodate all the features and upgrades you need. To test the best business Macs, we started by considering their specifications, like the GPU, CPU, RAM, storage, and dimensions. We evaluated the types of businesses they'd be suitable for and how well they ran resource-heavy apps and multitasked. We assessed the dimensions and weight of the products to see how much space they take up and whether they were light enough for easy carrying during travels. We also checked their connectivity ports, wireless connectivity features, battery life, and pricing, among other things.
