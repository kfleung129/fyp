    "text": "Apple has shared a humorous new ad touting the 128GB entry-level storage capacity on the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus. The ad shows a man looking through the Camera Roll on his iPhone. As he navigates through his collection, the man finds himself contemplating whether to clear out some space on his device by deleting certain photos. As he prepares to delete some of the photos on his device, he realizes the value of each image. The man chooses to preserve his memories, opting not to delete a single photo. The spot ends with the tagline \u201cLots of storage for lots of photos,\u201d promoting the 128GB entry-level storage capacity on the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus.
