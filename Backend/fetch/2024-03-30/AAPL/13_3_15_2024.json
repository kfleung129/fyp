    "text": " FILE - A trade-in for iPhone XR promotion board is displayed as an Apple employee waits for customers at its retail store in Beijing, Thursday, Jan. 3, 2019. Apple has agreed to pay $490 million to settle a class-action lawsuit alleging CEO Tim Cook misled investors about a steep downturn in the iPhone's sales in China that culminated in a jarring revision to the company's revenue forecast. The preliminary settlement was filed Friday, March 15, 2024, in Oakland, Calif., federal court. Apple has agreed to pay $490 million to settle a class-action lawsuit alleging CEO Tim Cook misled investors about a steep downturn in iPhone\u2019s sales in China. The slowdown in China sales culminated in a jarring revision to the company\u2019s revenue forecast. The preliminary settlement filed in federal court Friday stems from a shareholder lawsuit focused on how Apple relayed information about how iPhone models released in September 2018 were performing in China. The complaint contended Cook signaled the iPhone was off to a decent start in an investor conference call in early November 2018, only to then warn in early January 2019 of a significant drop in sales.
