    "text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 February 5, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises. This week\u2019s list includes Microsoft MSFT, Meta Platforms META, Amazon AMZN, Apple AAPL, Alphabet GOOGL, Tesla TSLA and Nvidia NVDA. We have seen some awe-inspiring results from Microsoft, Meta Platforms and Amazon in recent days that reconfirm their leadership position in this market. These companies, along with their peers in the \u2018Magnificent 7\u2019 group of stocks \u2013 Apple, Alphabet, Tesla and Nvidia \u2013 led the market higher last year, and that momentum has continued this year. Other than Tesla, whose results disappointed the market once again and reflected the fourth quarter in a row of disappointing results, all of the other Mag 7 members that have reported came out with impressive growth numbers. The market wasn\u2019t particularly impressed with the Alphabet and Apple reports, but they came out with Q4 earnings growth of +51.8% and +13.1%, respectively. Tesla\u2019s earnings were down -45.8% in Q3 on +3.5% higher revenues, as the EV-maker continued to grapple with weakening margins in an increasingly competitive EV market. Using estimates for Nvidia, which will be coming out with its December-quarter results on February 21st, and actual results for the other six members of the group, total Q4 earnings for the group are expected to be up +48.7% from the same period last year on +14.5% higher revenues. Please note that the Mag 7 companies currently account for 28.6% of the S&P 500 index\u2019s total market capitalization and are expected to bring in 19.5% of the index\u2019s total earnings in 2024. For 2023 Q4, the Mag 7 group has a bigger weightage, bringing in 23.1% of all S&P 500 earnings. Given their enormous earnings power and growth profiles, it is hard to argue with the group\u2019s market leadership. Importantly, analysts had been raising their estimates for the group even before the December-quarter results, with these numbers now adding to the positive revision momentum. Beyond these mega-cap players, total Q4 earnings for the Technology sector as a whole are expected to be up +24.2% from the same period last year on +8.1% higher revenues. This week\u2019s blockbuster Tech results has pushed the aggregate earnings growth picture for the S&P 500 index to +4.3% from last week\u2019s +1.1% growth pace. Excluding the contribution from the Mag 7 stocks, Q4 earnings for the rest of the index would be down -4.2%. Including all the results that came out through Friday, February 2nd, we now have Q4 results from 230 S&P 500 members, or 46% of the index\u2019s total membership. We have more than 500 companies on deck to report results this week, including 106 S&P 500 members. This week\u2019s line-up includes a who\u2019s who of the index, including Disney, Elli Lilly, MacDonalds, DuPont, Caterpillar, Ford, Pepsi, Chipotle, Uber, PayPal, Expedia, and many others. Total Q4 earnings for the 230 index members that have reported already are up +4.2% from the same period last year on +2.8% higher revenues, with 81.3% beating EPS estimates and 63.9% beating revenue estimates.
