(AAPL) garner further gains this year? Let\u2019s look at its financial metrics to know more\u2026. Jan 3, 2024 Apple Inc. (AAPL) made history in mid-2023 by being the first tech company to reach a\u00a0$3 trillion market value, while the tech sector garnered significant investor attention due to the hype surrounding Artificial Intelligence (AI). However, for the fiscal fourth quarter (ended September 30, 2023), the company\u2019s total net sales declined marginally year-over-year to $89.50 billion due to weaknesses in the Mac and wearables segment. Moreover, the iPhone maker forecasted weakness for its holiday quarter. About this forecast, the brokerage Bernstein said, \u201cApple\u2019s revenue growth has stalled over the past few quarters \u2013 and appears likely to continue to stagnate over the next year.\u201d On top of it, Barclays downgraded AAPL on the backs of weak iPhone sales in China. Analyst Tim Long believes that this softness in sales will persist even after the company launches the iPhone 16 this year, as the model is unlikely to have any drastic updates compared to the latest model in circulation. This paints an uncertain picture of this big tech company\u2019s outlook. Therefore, investors could wait and monitor AAPL for an opportune moment to invest in its stock. Let\u2019s look at the trends of its key financial metrics to gain further insight. Tracking Apple Inc.\u2019s Financial Performance: Analyzing Key Metrics and Growth Over Two Years (2021-2023) The trailing-12-month net income of AAPL has shown a fluctuating trend over the last two years, from March 27, 2021, to September 30, 2023, with general overall growth seen. From these figures, the growth rate from the initial to the final value shows a significant 27.09% increase in AAPL\u2019s reported net income over these years. 2024 STOCK MARKET OUTLOOK The emphasis on more recent data reflects that even though there were some declines in the second half of 2022 and the start of 2023, the upward tick in the third quarter indicates potential resilience and recovery in AAPL\u2019s profitability, with the final noted net income of $96.99 billion. This is a crucial trend to consider for future projections and appraisal of AAPL\u2019s financial performance.  The trailing-12-month revenue trends and fluctuations of AAPL from March 2021 to September 2023 are as outlined: Annual Revenue Trend: From this data, the annual growth from March 2021 to September 2022 was approximately 21.2%. Recent Fluctuations: The most recent data shows that as of September 2023, AAPL\u2019s revenue stands at $383.3 billion, reflecting a downward trend from its peak in 2022. Overall, between the first value in March 2021 and the latest in September 2023, there has been growth of approximately 17.8%.

Beginning on March 27, 2021, decoding the data series unveils: The gross margin demonstrated an overall upward trend from the beginning of the series in March 2021 to the end in September 2023. The growth rate, calculated by measuring the last value from the first value, suggests a positive growth of approximately 4.10%. However, there were periods of relative stability, such as roughly half of 2022, when the gross margin plateaued at around 43.30%. It\u2019s also worth noting a slight dip at the end of 2022 before it continued on its upward trajectory throughout 2023. This data underlines that although fluctuations (and some steady periods) were present within each fiscal quarter, the overall gross margin for AAPL increased over the specified timeline, reflecting positively on its economic performance.  The current ratio of AAPL exhibited a decreasing trend for the period from March 27, 2021, to June 25, 2022. It decreased from 1.14 in March 2021 to 0.87 in June 2022.

Here are a few highlighted data points: The overall growth rate, measured by comparing the current ratio from March 27, 2021 (1.14), to the most recent observation on September 30, 2023 (0.99), indicates a decrease of around 13%.  Analyzing Apple Inc.\u2019s Share Price Fluctuations: July 2023 \u2013 January 2024 The trend and growth rate of AAPL share prices from July 2023 to January 2024 is characterized by variability and some degree of volatility.
