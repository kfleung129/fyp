    "text": "Hey, folks, welcome to Week in Review (WiR), TechCrunch\u2019s newsletter covering all of \u2014 or at least the bulk of! \u2014 noteworthy happenings around the tech-o-sphere. This week, Roku played hardball with its customers, requiring them to consent to new dispute resolution terms. This means users can\u2019t use their Roku devices until agreeing to the terms (or opting out via snail mail), which requires any customer with legal complaints against Roku to take them to the company\u2019s lawyers first. In other news, a leaky database spilled two-factor authentication codes for the world\u2019s tech giants \u2014 including Facebook, Google and TikTok \u2014 online. YX International, an Asian tech and internet firm that routes millions of SMS text messages across the world, exposed a repository containing one-time security codes that might\u2019ve granted access to users\u2019 accounts. And Elon Musk, the CEO of X, sued OpenAI over allegedly \u201cbetraying\u201d its nonprofit mission. (OpenAI began as a nonprofit but shifted to a \u201ccapped-profit\u201d company managed by a nonprofit entity in 2019.) Musk, a co-founder and early backer of OpenAI, is accusing OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and president and co-founder Greg Brockman of pursuing profit at the expense of the organization\u2019s founding mission to develop AI that benefits humanity. Lots else happened. We recap it all in this edition of WiR \u2014 but first, a reminder to\u00a0sign up\u00a0to receive the WiR newsletter in your inbox every Saturday. Epic takedown: Apple has terminated Epic Games\u2019 App Store developer account, reportedly calling it a \u201cthreat\u201d to the iOS ecosystem. Epic and Apple have long sparred \u2014 rhetorically and in numerous courtroom battles \u2014 over the latter\u2019s power and influence over the app economy. Social media meltdown: Facebook, Instagram and Threads went down in a massive Meta outage on Tuesday. After restoring service, Meta revealed the issue was \u201ctechnical\u201d in nature, but gave no further details. Musk money: Four former Twitter executives, including ex-CEO Parag Agrawal, sued Musk on Monday, alleging that they\u2019re owed over $128 million in severance payments. Data transfers unfettered: AWS has followed Google in announcing unrestricted free data transfers to other cloud providers. As Paul writes, the move stems from regulatory pressure around cloud lock-in practices \u2014 leaving Microsoft Azure the odd one out. AI worker:\u00a0A new startup called\u00a0Ema has raised $25 million for what it describes as a \u201cuniversal AI employee\u201d \u2014 an enterprise-focused, AI-powered platform that\u2019s designed to \u201cemulate human responses\u201d like handling customer service tasks, offering tech support and more. Uninvestable startups: Haje writes about a case study in unwise capitalization \u2014 a Norwegian hardware startup that gave up more than two-thirds of its equity to raise $3.3 million. Such a move can make a company uninvestable, he says. But there\u2019s hope. On Equity, the crew talked about\u00a0OpenAI bringing receipts to its tussle with Musk and about what\u2019s happening with the VC firm OpenView. Also on the agenda was online banking startup Monzo\u2019s big tranche, a noteworthy funding deal in the AI space and upcoming climate regulations. Over on Found, Becca and Dom spoke with Advocate founder Emilie Poteat. Advocate helps Americans engage with federal benefits programs through its tech-enabled services platform. And Chain Reaction featured Dee Goens, the co-founder of Zora. Zora is a platform and protocol that helps developers and creators bring their ideas on the blockchain and Ethereum through an open and shared environment. Udacity exit: Accenture this week announced that it\u2019d acquire the learning platform Udacity, reportedly for $80 million. That\u2019s far below the roughly $300 million Udacity raked in from its founding in 2011 until now, Ron reports. "
