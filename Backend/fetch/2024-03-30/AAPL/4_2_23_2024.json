    "text": "Update font size. Reset  Apple\u2019s work in India is finally beginning to pay off. The company\u2019s revenue in India soared 42% year-over-year in 2023 to $8.7 billion, Morgan Stanley reported in a note to clients on Friday. Manish Singh for TechCrunch:\n \u200e The iPhone shipments in India grew 39% year-on-year in 2023 to 9.2 million units, making it iPhone\u2019s fifth largest smartphone market. India\u2019s iPhone business is now larger than any standalone country in the European Union, Morgan Stanley added. \u201cThis means that in CY23, India represented 4% of iPhones shipments and revenue, up from 3% in CY22 and 1% 5 years ago. This compares to China iPhone shipments, which represented 20% of iPhone shipments and revenue in CY23 (down 1-2 points Y/Y, respectively),\u201d the analysts wrote. \u201cUltimately, this means that India as a standalone market is still not big enough to offset the declines we are seeing in the Chinese market today, but if India continues to grow at the same trajectory while China iPhone shipments stay flat, India would be a bigger iPhone market than China by 2027.\u201d \u200e\nMacDailyNews Take: It bears repeating: \u201cIndia\u2019s iPhone business is now larger than any standalone country in the European Union\u2026 [I]f India continues to grow at the same trajectory while China iPhone shipments stay flat, India would be a bigger iPhone market than China by 2027.\u201d\n \u200e\nPlease help support MacDailyNews.
