Bart Andre, who joined Apple in 1992 alongside Ive, told colleagues this month that he is retiring, according to people familiar with the matter. Andre was one of the last remaining designers from the Ive era and helped create the aesthetic for Apple products released over the past three decades \u2014 even prior to Steve Jobs returning to the helm in the late 1990s. The designer was known as one of Ive\u2019s top lieutenants and helped run the team after former chief Evans Hankey, Ive\u2019s successor, departed last year. He\u2019s also known as one of the biggest holders of Apple patents.
