AAPL trailing its Magnificent Seven peers on the artificial intelligence technology front, the company could still make up for the early sluggishness by taking the lead in personalized AI, a fund manager said on Tuesday. What Happened: \u201cPersonalized AI will transform our lives and $AAPL is going to lead the way,\u201d said Deepwater Asset Management\u2019s Gene Munster in a post on X, formerly Twitter. The tech venture capitalist and fund manager premised his deduction on Apple CEO Tim Cook\u2019s statement on the earnings call last week. \u201cWe continue to spend a tremendous amount of time and effort, and we\u2019re excited to share the details of our ongoing work in that space later this year,\u201d Cook had said. According to Munster, Apple has the scope for employing AI across its products and services. \u201cI believe the biggest opportunity for Apple is to overlay AI across Messages, iCloud, Safari, Maps, Mail, Music, Apple TV, Fitness, and Calendar, and automate our lives,\u201d he said. The fund manager expects Apple to announce an AI bot some time this year. \u201cAbout 20% of the world is locked into Apple\u2019s ecosystem and would welcome the product with open arms,\u201d he said. Why It\u2019s Important: Leadership in AI has propelled the shares of companies such as Nvidia Corp. NVDA and Microsoft Corp. MSFT to dizzying heights. The AI revolution began to take hold in early 2023 with the popularity of OpenAI\u2019s GPT-powered AI chatbot, ChatGPT. Sensing the opportunity, Microsoft expanded its prior relationship with OpenAI with a $10 billion investment. As the software giant began deploying AI in several of its businesses, its stock price pushed ahead with verve, catapulting the company as the most valued global corporation. Incidentally, Microsoft dethroned Apple as the leader on that front. Apple, for one, hasn't committed to anything yet regarding its AI plans. In mid-July, Bloomberg reported that\u00a0Cupertino has\u00a0built its own framework to create large language models known as \"Ajax\"\u00a0and created a chatbot service that some engineers call \u201cApple GPT.\u201d In premarket trading on Wednesday, Apple rose 0.50% to $190.25, according to Benzinga Pro data.
