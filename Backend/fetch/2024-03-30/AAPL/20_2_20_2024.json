    "text": "Lobro78/iStock Editorial via Getty Images Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) reclaimed the top spot in the European smartphone market during the fourth quarter of 2023 after spending more than two years behind Samsung (OTCPK:SSNLF), according to research firm Canalys. Apple shipped 12.4M units compared to Samsung's 10.8M during the fourth-quarter, Canalys said. Samsung had previously been the top shipper of smartphones into Europe (minus Russia) for seven straight quarters. Although total smartphone shipments for the quarter declined 3% year-over-year to 37.8M from 38.9M, Apple's shipments increased 1% compared to Samsung's 12% drop. Xiaomi ranked third in shipments at 6M units, followed by Motorola and HONOR at 2M and 1.1M, respectively. Although Motorola's and HONOR's shares were small in comparison, volumes shipped surged year-over-year by 73% and 116%, respectively. Despite winning the fourth quarter, Apple's full-year 2023 market share of 27% trailed Samsung's 34% hold. \u201cHigh-end smartphones took a record share of the European market in Q4 2023,\" said Canalyst analyst Runar Bj\u00f8rhovde. \"Almost 40% of smartphone shipments were priced at $800 or higher.\" The iPhone 15 Pro, Galaxy S-series and Google Pixel dominated the European market. \"In 2024, single-digit growth will return to the European smartphone market, driven by an impending refresh cycle of devices that were bought during the pandemic,\u201d said Bj\u00f8rhovde. Artificial intelligence and \"ecosystem interaction\" looks to be the focus for smartphone manufacturers in the year ahead, Canalys finds. "
