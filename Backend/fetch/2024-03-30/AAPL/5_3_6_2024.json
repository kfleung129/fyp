Apple and Google add new features to iPhones and Android devices with each update. Sometimes it can be difficult to keep up with what these new features do. VERIFIED reader Erin messaged us to ask about viral social media posts making some alarming claims that new iPhone features could compromise privacy and safety. These posts claim a feature called \u201cSuggest logging\u201d has a default setting that allows people nearby to see your full name and exact location. These claims have spread across multiple platforms, including Facebook and TikTok. \u201c[The setting] Let people discover you based on whether they\u2019re nearby or not,\u201d one person claims in a TikTok video with 4.6 million views.  Does iPhone\u2019s Suggested Logs feature allow people nearby to see your full name and exact location?   No, iPhone\u2019s Logging Suggestions feature doesn\u2019t let people nearby see your full name and exact location.   Apple added the Diary app to iPhone in December 2023. The app can suggest custom prompts and questions to inspire electronic entries within the app. However, these Logging Suggestions don\u2019t let people see your full name and exact location, no matter what settings you enable. Apple added the Diary app to serve as a kind of diary that people can keep on their iPhone. Suggested journaling uses data stored locally on your iPhone such as exercise, location, media usage, contact information, and photos to suggest people and topics to write. Viral social media posts highlight the device\u2019s Logging Recommendations setting, located in the device\u2019s general settings menu. They say the setting, which is enabled by default, \u201cmay be discoverable by others,\u201d shares your full name and exact location with other iPhones nearby. But Apple\u2019s website explains that this setting doesn\u2019t share names or locations with strangers. \u201cLogging hints use Bluetooth to detect the number of devices and contacts around you without storing specific nearby contacts,\u201d Apple\u2019s website says. \u201cThis information is used to improve and prioritize your recommendations.\u201d For example, it won\u2019t share your full name with someone nearby or allow strangers to track your location. Let\u2019s say you and two friends with iPhones go bowling. If everyone turns on \u201cdiscoverable by others,\u201d each person\u2019s phone will detect that two of your contacts are nearby and may then suggest you write a diary about bowling with friends, based on your location. According to Apple, turning off this setting means you won\u2019t be included in the list of nearby people in your contacts. So in this example, if you turn that setting off, your friend\u2019s iPhone will only detect one person nearby, and your iPhone won\u2019t try to detect anyone. If you turn that setting off, your iPhone won\u2019t detect anyone nearby. The future magazine suggestion could be just about bowling. VERIFY journalists used their iPhones to test how Log Recommendations responded to nearby contacts by default. In their proposal there is no information about the names and exact locations of people nearby, even with the \u201cdiscoverable by others\u201d setting enabled. The diary prompt advised journalists to write about contacts that appeared in their photos or messages a few days earlier. But these suggestions don\u2019t include the exact locations of past or present contacts.  The VERIFY team works to separate fact from fiction so you can understand what is right and wrong.
