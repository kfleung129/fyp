Since the iPhone\u2019s launch in 2007, Apple\u2019s product launches have continuously diversified the company\u2019s revenue sources. This infographic illustrates Apple\u2019s revenue by product between 2007 and 2023, based on the company\u2019s 10-K filings for the period. When Apple introduced the iPhone in 2007, Steve Jobs labeled it a \u201crevolutionary product\u201d. That same year, the phone represented just 0.5% of the company\u2019s total revenue. Today, it corresponds to over half of it. Initially sold exclusively through AT&T for $499, it has since become the company\u2019s most profitable product and one of the world\u2019s most popular phones, with over 2.3 billion units sold and a user base of over 1.5 billion active users. In 2015, the iPhone\u2019s share of Apple product revenue peaked at 66%, coinciding with the release of the iPhone 6. Apple has also experienced a shift in the share of revenue originating from its Mac division. In 2007, Macs represented 43% of the company\u2019s revenue, while iPods accounted for 35%. Since 2015, however, services and accessories/wearables (such as the Apple Watch and AirPods) have contributed increasingly to the company\u2019s revenue shares. Mac revenue declined by 27% year over year in 2023, making up only 8% of Apple\u2019s total revenue.  More recently, the growth of services and accessories/wearables has started to slow down, mirroring trends seen in other product lines. Perhaps the next question for the company is whether the Apple Vision Pro, a wearable computer that projects output directly into the eyes and is primarily controlled through eye tracking and gestures, will become a consistent source of revenue and product line.

Digital technologies have become an integral part of our daily lives, transforming communications, business, health, education, and more. Yet, billions of people around the world are still offline, and digital advancement has been uneven. Here, we map internet usage by region based on data from the World Bank\u2019s Digital Progress and Trends Report 2023. According to the World Bank, between 2018 and 2022, the world gained 1.5 billion new internet users. In 2020 alone, the share of the global population using the internet increased by 6% (500 million people), marking the highest jump in history. India, in particular, has seen high rates of adoption. For example, in 2018, only 20% of Indians used the internet. By 2022, this percentage had grown to more than 50%. However, the progress of digitalization has been uneven both within and across countries. In 2022, one-third of the global population remained offline, with parts of Asia and Africa still experiencing very low rates of internet usage. For instance, more than half of businesses in Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Ghana, and Senegal reportedly lack internet connection. According to the World Bank\u2019s report, when fast internet becomes available, the probability of an individual being employed increases by up to 13%, and total employment per firm increases by up to 22%. Moreover, firm exports nearly quadruple with the availability of fast internet. Across Africa, 3G coverage has been associated with a reduction in extreme poverty, with reductions of 10% seen in Senegal and 4.3% in Nigeria. Curious to learn more about the internet?
