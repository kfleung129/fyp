The video, which Apple uploaded on Friday as pre-orders for Vision Pro opened in the US, shows a user experiencing Vision Pro and visionOS for the first time, with the demonstration showcasing visionOS navigation, photos, panoramas and spatial videos, TV and movies, Workspace, FaceTime and personas, Environments, Mac Virtual Display and experiences, including gaming. Apple Vision Pro will be available in the US beginning Friday, February 2, with reports suggesting that the device will launch internationally by the end of 2024.
