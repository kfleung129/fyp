When Apple TV Plus debuted in 2019, it filled a void for Apple enthusiasts, despite its initial scant lineup beyond a few standout shows and movies. Fast forward to now, and the narrative has shifted significantly. With an expanded roster featuring acclaimed hits like the Oscar-winning \u201cCoda\u201d and Emmy-favorite \u201cTed Lasso,\u201d Apple TV Plus demands a fresh assessment. In an era flooded with streaming options, the inevitable question arises: Is another service justifiable? Given Apple TV Plus\u2019s latest offerings, it begs the question of whether its value justifies adding another subscription to our already stretched budgets and crowded screens. Apple TV Plus is a subscription-based streaming service offered by Apple. It was launched on November 1, 2019, as part of Apple\u2019s broader strategy to diversify its revenue sources beyond hardware sales into services. Apple TV Plus focuses on providing a wide range of original content, including TV shows, movies, documentaries, and children\u2019s programming. Unlike many other streaming services, Apple TV Plus primarily features original content exclusively produced for the platform, rather than a mix of original and licensed content from other providers. Apple TV Plus on Android TV, phones, and tablets launched in November 2019 for $4.99 a month in the US, with a 7-day free trial. In October 2023, the company raised the service price to $9.99 a month. This only covers Apple Originals, mind \u2014 if you pay for third-party Apple TV Channel add-ons, those are extra, usually as much as they would cost in separate apps. Getting them through Apple only simplifies access and billing. Only one tier supports up to five family members, 4K quality, and media downloads. Apple TV Plus offers its streaming service at varying prices internationally, reflecting adjustments for different markets. As of the information available: If you already subscribe to a few other Apple services, like Apple Music, it might be worth merging them into an Apple One subscription. The Individual tier includes Apple TV Plus, Apple Music, Apple Arcade, and 50GB of iCloud storage for $19.95 monthly. A Family plan expands all of those services to five people for $25.95, simultaneously boosting iCloud storage to 200. The most expensive plan (Premier) costs $37.95, boosting storage to 2TB while adding Apple News Plus and Apple Fitness Plus. To inflate subscriber numbers in the face of tough competition, Apple initially offered a free year of the service to anyone who had recently purchased an Apple device. This included iPhones, iPads, Macs, Apple TV set-tops, and even iPods. Apple stopped offering that in July 2021. Since then, the company has provided no more than 3 months of free access and typically limits new subscribers to a 7-day trial. Let\u2019s be clear up front: if you\u2019re not interested in Apple\u2019s exclusive content, Apple TV Plus isn\u2019t for you. You won\u2019t find staple shows like Community, Seinfeld, The Office, or I Love Lucy here, nor will you find classic movies like The Thing or Casablanca. There is some older licensed content, but it\u2019s almost a footnote. The original content that\u2019s available may justify the cost, though. Some examples include the sci-fi epic Foundation, based on Isaac Asimov\u2019s classic novels; The Morning Show, a drama starring Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon, and Steve Carell; See, an epic sci-fi drama starring Jason Momoa and Alfre Woodard; and Servant, a horror series produced by M. Night Shyamalan. While Foundation is gaining some more attention, the service\u2019s best-known titles are probably the workplace sci-fi mystery Severance and the feel-good comedy Ted Lasso, about an American coach leading an English soccer team. Both have won or been nominated for many awards. The service has a small slate of movies, including acclaimed titles like the 2022 Oscar Best Picture winner CODA and The Tragedy of Macbeth, directed by Joel Coen. Consider movies a value-add rather than a primary reason to subscribe. Apple\u2019s real ace in the hole may be pricing (see current prices below). It\u2019s cheaper than many other ad-free services, so some people might subscribe for a few months without even thinking about it. You may even be able to get the service for free, usually in conjunction with another service or by buying an Apple device like the Apple iPad Air 6. Apple also has a fairly generous family-sharing plan, allowing up to five family members to use the same subscription. They can use their own logins, so you don\u2019t need to share your password with anyone. Signing up for Apple TV Plus is easy and can be done from both the web and the Apple TV app. In fact, it\u2019s usually the first thing you see when you open the app. Just tap Try It Free and confirm your purchase to get started. After your trial period, you\u2019ll automatically be charged $9.99 a month. Be sure to cancel at least 24 hours before your trial ends if you don\u2019t intend to subscribe. On the web, simply navigate to the Apple TV Plus website, then click Start Your Free Trial. If you aren\u2019t already logged in, you\u2019ll have to log into your Apple account, but the entire process takes less than a minute. No matter how you sign up, you\u2019ll get a pop-up letting you know if you have three months to claim due to a recent purchase. Once your free period with Apple TV Plus is over, you can also opt for an Apple One subscription if you use other Apple services such as Apple Music, iCloud Plus, and Apple Arcade. The bundle saves money compared to paying for all those services individually. Apple TV Plus is available on the Apple TV app in over 100 countries and regions. This wide availability allows viewers from around the world to access Apple Originals from today\u2019s most imaginative storytellers. Some of the countries include: This is not an exhaustive list, and availability can vary, so it\u2019s a good idea to check the Apple TV app or the official Apple website for the most current information. Apple TV Plus is available on any Apple device with the Apple TV app. If a device is compatible, the app is usually pre-installed. That includes iPhones, iPads, Macs, iPod touches, and Apple TV set-tops from the 3rd generation onwards. The app is optional or included on third-party streaming devices by the likes of Amazon, Roku, and Google. That\u2019s also true with many smart TVs from Vizio, Samsung, and LG brands. If a smart TV isn\u2019t compatible with the Apple TV app, you may still be able to access the service using AirPlay. This allows you to cast from any Apple device. You can see a list of supported smart TVs on Apple\u2019s website. Android phones and tablets are technically excluded but should be able to stream via the web, but the app is available on Macs and Windows PCs. Don\u2019t worry\u2014you\u2019re all good if you have a TV or set-top with Android TV or Google TV. You can also set up the Apple TV Plus app on your PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, or Xbox Series S. No luck with the Nintendo Switch. Here\u2019s the full list of Apple TV-compatible devices: Apple TV Plus is mostly about content under the Apple Originals program. This includes shows, movies, and documentaries, some starring the biggest names in Hollywood. The company\u2019s deep pockets and relationships with other industries give Apple\u2019s streaming service an advantage over some competitors. By this point, there are many great shows and movies on Apple TV Plus, with new content monthly, and in many cases, you can watch the first episode of a series for free before you even start your 7-day trial. As mentioned, there\u2019s very little third-party licensed content. What is there is generally intended to boost Apple\u2019s continuations, such as Fraggle Rock and Charlie Brown. We won\u2019t list everything on Apple TV Plus in this article, but here\u2019s a brief list of some of our favorites, so you know what to expect. Apple has invested heavily in original shows, although few have captured the general public\u2019s hearts and minds (Ted Lasso and Severance being the major exceptions). Check out our full list of the best Apple TV Plus shows with trailers and descriptions. In the meantime, here\u2019s a quick list of some of our favorites: Apple TV Plus doesn\u2019t have nearly as many movies as its competitors, but it has a respectable selection, and Apple is pushing hard to establish its credibility. Here\u2019s a brief list of what you can expect: Apple hosts two live Major League Baseball games every week, plus some miscellaneous related content, such as highlights and daily recaps. It\u2019s not a substitute for a service like ESPN or MLB.tv, but there\u2019s no extra cost for Plus subscribers. You will need to pay if you want to access the MLS (Major League Soccer) season pass. This is treated as another Channel subscription (see below), but Plus subscribers can get it for $12.99 per month or $79 for the full season, which is cheaper than it would be otherwise. There may be mid-season discounts available. Although they\u2019re not technically part of Apple TV Plus, Apple TV Channels are a great way to get more out of your experience with the Apple TV app. It turns the service into something more like traditional cable TV but without all the bloat. The Channels program is essentially an \u00e0 la carte selection of TV channels and streaming services that you can subscribe to within the Apple TV app. This allows you to consolidate most (if not all) of your services into one place, with Apple getting a cut of every Apple TV-based subscription. It\u2019s easy and convenient to subscribe using your Apple account, but existing subscriptions outside of the app can\u2019t be transferred over. You\u2019ll need to cancel them and resubscribe through Apple TV. There can be potential benefits to using channels, such as higher-bitrate streams and media downloads. Like Apple TV Plus, many subscriptions can also be shared with up to five family members. Here\u2019s a full list of confirmed Apple TV Channels: Subscription fees vary by channel but typically start at $5 or more. Channel availability varies by region. You\u2019ll also see select non-channel services appear in the TV app, but generally only as Up Next content, and launching a video will switch you to an outside app. Here\u2019s a list of external streaming services supported by Apple TV: Several cable and satellite apps and internet-only TV platforms are integrated. Check with your provider if this matters to you. Usually, it\u2019s best to access live services within their native apps.

Apple TV is a streaming device offered by Apple that enables users to stream content to their televisions from their home devices.

This is highly subjective, but the TLDR is that it\u2019s only worth it if you\u2019re interested in its original shows.
