That\u2019s come out in a recent\u00a0Stocklytics.com\u00a0data analysis showing the segment\u2019s share of Apple\u2019s revenues has jumped 150% in the last nine years. The site reports that the branch accounted for 25% of the tech giant\u2019s Q3 2023 earnings, up from 10% in Q3 2015. According to Stocklytics\u2019 investment expert Edith Reads, Apple Services\u2019 growth has been extraordinary. She adds that the rise is more impressive given that it has outdone some of Apple\u2019s other key segments like wearables and iPads. Edith projects an even brighter future for the segment, asserting: Apple Services\u2019 income surge underscores its growing significance to Apple\u2019s overall revenue structure. The segment can only consolidate its gains as the tech giant innovates to expand its global reach. Stocklytics Financial Analyst, Edith Reads Apple Services\u2019 quarterly earnings have been on a tear since crossing the $10 billion mark in Q3, 2018. This movement has seen the unit\u2019s annual income grow from roughly $40B in FY18 to over $85B in FY23.  The spike is due to three major factors:\u00a0\u00a0price increases across various service offerings, Apple\u2019s expanding installed capacity, and AI adoption. CEO Tim Cook echoed similar sentiments on Apple\u2019s Q4,23 earnings call. He said: The services segment achieved all-time revenue records across App Store, advertising, AppleCare, iCloud, payment services, and video, as well as the September quarter revenue record in Apple Music. Tim Cook, CEO of Apple The tech giant recently hiked prices for some of its premium offerings, which could net an extra $5 billion yearly. It has also grown its active devices from 1.3 billion in 2018 to over 2 billion. That jump has coincided with a 360% peak in its subscribers, standing at 1.1 billion. According to analysts, Apple Services\u2019 revenues will surpass the $100 billion mark by H2 FY24, buoyed by its remarkable growth. Its earnings have grown at a CAGR of nearly 17% since 2018. Meanwhile, Apple\u2019s and\u00a0iPhone\u2019s\u00a0CAGRs have grown at comparatively low figures of 7.6% and 4.0%, respectively. The company will seek to consolidate its gains in its core markets of America, Europe, the APAC region, and Greater\u00a0China. Additionally, it is pursuing some AI projects that it could monetize. Though it remains tight-lipped on these, speculation is that it will integrate the technology into some of its popular products like Siri and its iOS operating system.
