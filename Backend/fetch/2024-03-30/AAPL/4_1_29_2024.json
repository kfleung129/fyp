If you missed that corner near the top left of the image, let me zoom it in for you. Indeed, you\u2019ve understood correctly. OptionsProfitCalculator.com classifies specific trades as surefire victories. Let\u2019s delve straight into it. Select well-established companies that you favor. Determine their long-term trend, whether it\u2019s bullish or bearish, by examining the hourly to daily timeframes. Sell options significantly out of the money that align with the identified bullish or bearish trend. Gather the premiums. Now, let\u2019s explore the steps and illustrate how to implement this straightforward strategy. gurufinanceinsights.com Numerous factors can influence a stock\u2019s movement, but aligning with the prevailing trend is often the most advantageous approach. The phrase \u201cthe trend is your friend\u201d is a common adage emphasizing the importance of following market trends. Optimal stocks for this strategy are typically those with low volatility and robust, sustained trends. In the current market, technology companies appear to occupy this favorable position. However, this preference may vary depending on the market conditions, such as financials or real estate dominating in previous markets. A brief analysis can help identify companies with upward momentum, and if you perceive it as a strong buying opportunity, why not capitalize on it by collecting premiums from those who may hold a contrary view? In this illustration, I\u2019ve selected the widely favored stock, $AAPL. The chart below depicts Apple\u2019s stock performance in 2023. Undoubtedly, Apple has experienced an impressive surge, driven in part by the AI boom and its recent forays into Apple finance programs. However, there are indications that this upward trend might encounter some deceleration. The strength of the trend is clearly evident, as depicted by the prominent vertical and horizontal lines on the screen, which will be elucidated shortly. It\u2019s crucial to emphasize that our objective is not solely to track the stock\u2019s trend but rather to align it with the broader market trend. Although SPY\u2019s ascent this year may not have been as meteoric as that of AAPL, it\u2019s crucial to recognize that the overall market is also in an upward trend. This reinforces our hypothesis that the positive trend observed in AAPL is likely to persist. Having identified our potential high-performer, let\u2019s delve into our Options (pun intended). Since we anticipate Apple\u2019s continued ascent, our strategy involves selling puts, a bullish approach. The vertical and horizontal lines featured in our initial AAPL chart signify the expiration date and strike of our contract. Typically, I opt for options with an expiration period ranging from approximately 2 weeks to 1 month, providing ample time for position management and an extended view of the stock. Here are the options for AAPL expiring on July 28th, as of July 1st. Our aim is to sell out-of-the-money puts since they are more prone to expiring out of the money. On the mentioned website, we continue to choose increasingly out-of-the-money options to sell and assess the probability of profits until we reach the remarkable 100% probability of profit. For $AAPL, this occurs with a put expiring at the end of the month with a strike of $165. Now, let\u2019s revisit this. Isn\u2019t it perfect? It\u2019s crucial to acknowledge that the market is unpredictable, and trend reversals can be risky, making us cautious about black swan events or general selloffs. However, in most scenarios, statistically, it\u2019s unlikely that $AAPL will experience a significant decline. The profit and loss (P/L) chart illustrates the profit and loss at each day as the sold contract expires. Since options lose value over time due to theta, selling them generates income automatically, assuming the option hasn\u2019t moved too far in a specific direct As long as AAPL hasn\u2019t declined by -17.64% by the day of expiry, we can collect the premium. Additionally, even if AAPL is up just 3% in 2 weeks, we can collect our full premium and close the position. Opportunities like this are prevalent in the market, and we just need to be vigilant. It\u2019s essential to monitor this position and set stop losses to safeguard your position in case $AAPL experiences an unprecedented decline. By adopting this approach, you can collect premiums across various stocks. While there are undoubtedly better opportunities than $AAPL, it serves as a good example to begin with.
