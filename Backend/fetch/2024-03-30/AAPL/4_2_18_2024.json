    "text": "Apple is invested in bringing AI technology to its product line, with the iPhone being the prime candidate to receive many new additions. Apple's process to bring AI to the iPhone is two-fold. While some features may be part of iOS 18, others will be exclusive to the iPhone 16 lineup. Altogether, AI will make the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro models a worthy upgrade over the current models, considering the number of new features coming with iOS 18. The iPhone 15 launched with a slew of new front-facing features, making the device stand out from the crowd. iOS 17 had a lot to do with it as well, as the company brought a boatload of changes and design variations to the table through its annual software updates. However, most of the new additions were also available on older iPhone models. Now, Apple is slated to bring numerous AI-related features with iOS 18, some of which will be exclusively available on the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro models. We have previously heard that Apple's AI efforts will not only stretch to apps but also operate on a system level. Apple's developers are working on bringing AI to various apps, such as Messages, Health, Apple Music, Notes, Keynote, Pages, Numbers, and additional apps. The company will implement generative AI technology based on its large language models so users can get the most out of the apps in terms of utility and productivity. While all of these AI upgrades will be available on the iPhone 16 lineup, older iPhone models will also receive their fair share. Other than this, It was recently reported that Apple is training Siri and Spotlight Search using large language models. While Siri has lagged behind the competition since its debut, AI integration could change the fate of the virtual assistant later this year. Additionally, the company could offer exclusive Siri features for the iPhone 16 lineup. So, what makes the iPhone 16 lineup a worthy upgrade over the current iPhone 15 lineup? While it is too early to conclude, the iPhone 16 lineup will house powerful internals that can fully take advantage of the company's forthcoming AI features and upgrades. It was previously reported that the iPhone 16 models will feature an upgraded Neural Engine with the A18 chip, allowing the devices to perform better machine learning and AI-centric tasks more efficiently. With upgraded hardware, the iPhone 16 will be able to bolster Apple's high-end AI features for the iPhone 16. Apple is gradually making breakthroughs in AI as the company showcased some of its latest projects. It was recently revealed that the company has developed a tool to edit and manipulate still images based on natural language commands. Additionally, another AI tool allowed SVG images to be animated based on text-based input. Possibly, the latest additions could make their way to the iPhone 16 as exclusive features, similar to how Google offers exclusive AI features in its Pixel-branded smartphones. Note that these are mere speculations at this stage, as the final word rests with Apple. We will share more details on the subject as soon as further information is available.
