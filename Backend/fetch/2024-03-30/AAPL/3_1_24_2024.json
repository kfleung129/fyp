    "text": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc.\u2019s iPhone was the top-selling smartphone series in China for the first time last year, a surprisingly strong showing in the face of fierce local competition and expanding government prohibitions against the American company\u2019s technology.

It came after several analysts, including Jefferies, said iPhone sales tanked in the fourth quarter due to a lull in enthusiasm for the Cupertino, California company\u2019s latest generation of hardware in the world\u2019s biggest smartphone market. IDC also noted rising competition from domestic names like a resurgent Huawei Technologies Co., but timely discounts and promotions helped reduce the harm for Apple. Success in the fourth quarter was largely a matter of declining less than competitors, the IDC data showed. For the year, Apple\u2019s 2.2% drop in 2023 was better than local rivals like Honor Device Co. and Vivo \u2014 both of which suffered double-digit slumps \u2014 and the overall 5% fall in shipments. The year marked the lowest volume of smartphones in China in a decade, due to a soft economic recovery and weak consumer sentiment, according to IDC. It was also highlighted by Huawei\u2019s return to prominence with its Mate 60 series, catapulting it back into the top five makers in China in the holiday quarter, with a 36% jump in shipments. \u201cApple\u2019s climb to the top spot in 2023, especially in light of renewed competition from Huawei and the soft spending sentiment, marks a tremendous success,\u201d said IDC research analyst Arthur Gao. \u201cApple achieved this thanks to timely price promotions in its third-party channels, which stimulated demand.\u201d Apple also took the crown of the world\u2019s biggest smartphone seller in 2023, after iPhone sales slumped less than Samsung Electronics Co.\u2019s Galaxy smartphones. Still, the iPhone 15 family of products is facing headwinds in sustaining demand in China, where analysts forecast sales will continue to weaken.
