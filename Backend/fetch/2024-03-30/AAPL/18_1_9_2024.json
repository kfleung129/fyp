    "text": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. returned to an annual list of the 100 best places to work after falling off last year, but the ranking wasn\u2019t as rich with technology firms after layoffs roiled the sector.

How Scientists Are Preparing for the Next Pandemic The iPhone maker was No. 39 in the list from Glassdoor, a website where employees submit anonymous workplace reviews. Glassdoor has conducted the survey since 2009. Apple was one of 31 tech-industry firms on the list, down from 41 last year, leaving more room for old-line employers like banks, retailers and manufacturers. The best company to work for was management consultant Bain & Co., followed by chipmaker Nvidia Corp., whose products underpin the booming artificial intelligence field. \u201cTech has lost some of its luster versus the past year,\u201d said Glassdoor\u2019s lead economist Daniel Zhao. \u201cIt\u2019s still a great industry for jobseekers, but the shine has worn off to some extent. And the companies making a comeback, they\u2019re the old guard, so it suggests we\u2019re heading back to a more balanced job market.\u201d While Apple\u2019s return-to-office push in 2022 may have been to blame for its falling off the list last year, the tech bellwether\u2019s lack of large-scale layoffs compared with its peers likely brought it back, Zhao said, as employees value \u201cstability and security.\u201d The 48% gain in Apple\u2019s shares last year \u2014 double the benchmark S&P 500\u2019s increase \u2014 probably also kept employees satisfied. Other prominent tech firms on the list include Adobe Inc. at 15, Microsoft Corp. at 18 and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google at 26, while Salesforce Inc., Intel Corp., Netflix Inc. and Yahoo Inc. fell off. In finance, Fidelity Investments ranked tenth, up from 18th the previous year. New financial firms making an appearance include Raymond James Financial at 14, Barclays Plc at 72 and JPMorgan Chase & Co. at 82, while BlackRock Inc. didn\u2019t make the cut after being included on the 2023 list. Work-life balance gained importance for many employees last year \u2014 mentions of \u201canxiety\u201d in posts on Glassdoor\u2019s community sites shot up fourfold \u2014 but factors such as career opportunities traditionally carry more weight, Zhao said. Bain\u2019s rise to number one for the sixth time was fueled by its reputation for career enhancement, he said, despite the industry\u2019s well-publicized long hours. Bain and Google are the only two firms that have made the list every year. With some tech stalwarts fading \u2014 Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. missed the cut for the second straight year \u2014 more companies from other industries filled the void. The number of retail companies more than doubled to 10, with Lululemon Athletica Inc. and HEB Grocery Co. making repeat appearances while regional supermarket chain Wegmans Food Markets made the cut after not being on last year\u2019s list. Manufacturing firms doubled their presence to six companies, including medical-device maker Boston Scientific Corp., engine maker Cummins Inc. and Texas Instruments Inc. To be considered for the list, firms must have more than 1,000 employees and receive at least 75 employee ratings over the past year on nine workplace attributes, such as compensation, culture and senior management. The rating threshold resulted in last year\u2019s No. 1, software company Gainsight Inc., falling off the list entirely this year as it didn\u2019t receive enough reviews, Zhao said.
