Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway has made headlines once again, this time for selling off a portion of its Apple stock. The move has sparked interest and speculation among investors and market watchers alike. Here\u2019s a closer look at the details and potential reasons behind this decision. In the last quarter of 2023, Berkshire Hathaway sold 10 million shares of Apple, which constitutes about 1% of its total holdings in the tech giant. Despite this sell-off, Berkshire still retains a significant stake in Apple, with more than 905 million shares valued at approximately $174 billion. This massive holding represents 6% of all Apple shares and accounts for one-fifth of Berkshire\u2019s entire portfolio. Warren Buffett is renowned for his long-term investment strategy, famously stating, \u201cIf you aren\u2019t willing to own a stock for 10 years, don\u2019t even think about owning it for 10 minutes.\u201d The recent sale is notable as it deviates from Buffett\u2019s typical buy-and-hold approach. However, it\u2019s important to note that Berkshire\u2019s overall investment in Apple remains substantial. This isn\u2019t the first time Berkshire Hathaway has adjusted its position in Apple. In 2020, the company sold off about $11 billion worth of Apple stock, a decision Buffett later described as \u201cprobably a mistake.\u201d Despite this, Berkshire continued to show confidence in Apple, purchasing an additional $31 billion in shares in 2022. Apple has faced challenges in recent quarters, with four consecutive periods of revenue declines due to slower device sales amid economic uncertainties. However, the company reported year-on-year sales growth in the December quarter of 2023. Despite this, revenue from the crucial China region has declined, indicating growing competition for the iPhone maker. In addition to the Apple sell-off, Berkshire Hathaway also reduced its holdings in other companies. The conglomerate sold 80 million shares of HP, cutting its stake by 78%, and pared off 32% of its holdings in media company Paramount. Warren Buffett\u2019s decision to sell a portion of Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s Apple stock has generated significant interest. While the move might seem at odds with his long-term investment philosophy, it\u2019s worth noting that Berkshire still maintains a substantial stake in the tech giant. As always, Buffett\u2019s actions and insights will continue to be closely watched by the investment community.
