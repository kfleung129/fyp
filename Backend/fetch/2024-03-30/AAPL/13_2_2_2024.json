    "text": "Plus: Defense Contractor Scale AI Quietly Scrapped Deal With Chinese-Owned TikTok Over Security Concerns Good morning, Tax season kicked off this week, but a looming question mark as taxpayers begin filing is whether Congress will expand the child tax credit in the coming weeks. The $78 billion bill, which also restores corporate tax breaks, was approved by the House on Wednesday but faces an uncertain future in the Senate. It would result in hundreds of dollars of tax cuts and credits for those who qualify, starting in the 2023 tax year. That leaves many questioning whether they should hold off on filing taxes. But the IRS has encouraged taxpayers not to wait on Congress and file when they\u2019re ready. IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel said the agency will make any changes that impact your tax return. If all of that or other aspects of filing sound confusing, Forbes is launching a new weekly tax newsletter, Tax Breaks, to help answer your questions and break down these developments.

Santiago/Getty Images) Allen Weisselberg\u2014the ex-CFO of the Trump Organization\u2014is reportedly in talks to negotiate a plea deal with Manhattan prosecutors in which he would plead guilty to perjury during the trial over whether Trump, his children and business associates lied about the value of assets for personal gain. Weisselberg was taken off the stand after Forbes accused him of perjury and undercut his testimony with reporter\u2019s notes and emails that showed Weisselberg had thought about the size of Trump\u2019s penthouse\u2014something he said he \u201cnever focused\u201d on. January was one of the biggest months for layoffs in almost 15 years, a new report found, as more than 82,000 people lost their jobs. The largest sectors for layoffs were finance, tech, food production and retail, and companies cited restructuring, closing, market conditions and cost-cutting as the biggest reasons for the staffing changes. Amazon reported $170 billion in fourth-quarter revenue, surpassing expectations and causing its stock to jump more than 4% in after-hours trading Thursday. Following a solid year of growth, Amazon\u2019s stock is separating itself from an abysmal 2022 and closing in on its 2021 all-time high after introducing cost-cutting measures. Meta recorded its most profitable quarter and year ever, its latest earnings report revealed, marking a rapid turnaround from the company\u2019s painful 2022. Shares of Meta soared more than 10% shortly after the report\u2019s release, as the company announced another $50 billion in stock buybacks and unveiled its inaugural cash dividend, but scars remain from billionaire CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s criticized pivot into the \u201cmetaverse.\u201d Apple beat Wall Street\u2019s expectations in its quarterly earnings report Thursday, but its 2% revenue growth from 2022\u2019s December quarter and 16% profit expansion are far more paltry than those just reported by rivals Microsoft and Google. Apple\u2019s tepid growth can largely be traced to lackluster growth in iPhone sales and a 15% annual decline in sales in greater China, a historically high-growth region. The Florida-raised justice started her career in law as a self-described \u201cprofessional vagabond,\u201d but found more stability after becoming a judge. Ketanji Brown Jackson\u2019s ascendency to become the first Black woman on the Supreme Court no doubt took plenty of perseverance, but unlike some of her colleagues, it has not yet led her to immense wealth: She ties with Brett Kavanaugh as the least wealthy justice, worth $2 million, according to Forbes estimates. But Jackson has a book coming out later this year that could give her fortune a bump. Former President Donald Trump has racked up nearly $40 million in legal fees for his civil and criminal cases in the months since he was first indicted in March 2023, according to filings from his leadership PAC Save America. The ex-president used donor funds last year to battle the cases, and campaign finance experts told Forbes that Trump using PAC money to pay his personal legal fees is a \u201chighly questionable\u201d legal gray area. On The Rise: Lionel Messi has raised Inter Miami's global profile, leading to this year's preseason tour through Saudi Arabia, Hong Kong and Japan. Lionel Messi\u2019s arrival at Inter Miami supercharged the team both on and off the field, with revenue more than doubling to $118 million in 2023, making it the second-most valuable MLS team, Forbes estimates. It\u2019s the second team in league history to achieve a billion-dollar valuation, but the Los Angeles Football Club remains MLS\u2019s most valuable franchise, at $1.2 billion. YouTube\u2019s Premium and Music paid services for ad-free access and music streaming reached a combined 100 million subscribers, the Google-owned company announced. The new subscriber figure is still small compared to YouTube\u2019s overall user base of 2.5 billion people, but hitting the triple-digit millions means the company\u2019s subscription business is slowly catching up to a number of well-established rivals like Spotify premium and Amazon Prime. Danish pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk will boost supplies of its wildly popular obesity drug Wegovy in the U.S. this year, helping mitigate shortages as it reports huge profits but struggles to meet growing demand. The company had throttled distribution of smaller doses in the U.S. in May in order to safeguard supplies for existing patients, but now will more than double the quantity of lower doses reaching the country compared to recent months. ETHAN PINES FOR FORBES TOPLINE In the fall of 2022, Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang saw a huge opportunity: a deal with TikTok where his $7.3 billion AI data-labeling company would provide insights for the social media giant\u2019s advertisers. But as Wang pushed the deal through, members of Scale\u2019s leadership panicked, three people with direct knowledge of the matter told Forbes. Just two years earlier, former President Donald Trump had announced plans to ban TikTok, arguing the app, which is owned by Chinese company ByteDance, posed a threat to U.S. national security. And TikTok remained the subject of an ongoing national security review inspired by fears that American user data could be accessed by the Chinese Communist Party (a claim TikTok has denied). Some executives worried that a deal with TikTok might jeopardize future government business, the sources said. But the then 25-year-old Wang, who has said publicly that beating China in the AI race is a matter of national security and has loudly positioned himself as a leader in defense tech, wasn\u2019t swayed: The commercial opportunity was too good to turn down. He pushed it through over their objections. But when Forbes broke the news that TikTok parent company ByteDance had planned to surveil American citizens using the app\u2019s geo-location data, Scale reconsidered the deal. The company told Forbes it ended discussions with TikTok less than a month after the partnership began. The reputational implications or optics of doing this would be \u201chorrible,\u201d Bill Evanina, former director of the U.S. government\u2019s National Counterintelligence and Security Center, told Forbes, speaking generally about any deal between a defense contractor and TikTok. Scale\u2019s TikTok reversal was one of a number of issues that some company executives worried might undermine its efforts to build out a government and military business\u2014efforts Wang himself has said are a priority\u2014according to internal communications and interviews with 11 former employees and industry sources. In interviews with Forbes, John Brennan, Scale\u2019s general manager for public sector, said the company doesn\u2019t currently have a contract with TikTok; Wang said \u201cno data or money was ever exchanged with TikTok.\u201d Both stressed Scale\u2019s commitment to national security and safety, with Wang noting the company was one of seven to sign on to the Biden-Harris administration\u2019s voluntary commitment to ensure that AI is safe and secure. TikTok declined to comment. WHY IT MATTERS \u201cScale, which uses human labor to label the data on which AI is trained and has expanded to other data analytics services, began working with the government in 2020,\u201d says Forbes senior reporter Kenrick Cai. \u201cIt is now among a handful of tech companies like Palantir and Anduril most vocally courting defense contracts. Between 2020 and the end of the third quarter of 2023, it spent $1.95 million lobbying the federal government, according to lobbying disclosures, and has generated $90 million in public government contracts over the same time period, procurement records show (this figure doesn\u2019t include potential non-public contracts). By 2023, the number of people working on Scale\u2019s public sector business had grown to more than 100 employees, the company said. Brennan told Forbes that Scale currently has 20 active government contracts.\u201d MORE How Alexandr Wang Turned An Army Of Clickworkers Into A $7.3 Billion AI Unicorn The Biden Administration started negotiations Thursday with the manufacturers of drugs widely used by older Americans. It\u2019s part of an effort to cut prescription prices for the costliest medications covered by Medicare: $98.5 billion: The amount drug price negotiations are expected to save Medicare over a decade 10: The number of drugs the White House said Medicare officials are initially targeting for negotiations 20%: The share of total Medicare Part D prescription spending that the 10 drugs accounted for You\u2019ve heard of blue-collar and white-collar workers, but what about gold-collar? Referring to highly-skilled professionals in high-demand fields, such as doctors, lawyers, engineers, pilots and scientists, their roles are specialized and typically the highest-paid. Becoming a gold-collar worker typically involves advanced education, but if you are skilled at critical thinking and problem-solving, the jobs are more valuable and relevant than ever with the rise of generative AI.
