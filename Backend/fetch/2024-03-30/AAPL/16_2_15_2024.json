    "text": "\"I don't just think Quest is the better value; I think Quest is the better product,\" Mark Zuckerberg shares in a review of Apple Vision Pro. Apple Vision Pro launch, which was all set in February this year, has become the new talk of the town, especially with its unique features, which gives the confidence that the future of VR and AR is making a jump start in the year 2024. Right after the revolutionary launch of the all-new Apple Vision Pro, we have many enthusiasts sharing their reviews and experiences about the all-new Apple Vision Pro. Talking about the reviews, now getting reviews is not only ended to tech bloggers and YouTubers but, in fact, a few prominent names like Open AI\u2019s CEO and founder, Sam Altman, and even now Facebook\u2019s founder and Oculus\u2019s founder, Mark Zuckerberg, has shared their review on the new Apple Vision Pro. Most of the review shares to date have been positive. However, the review from Mark Zuckerberg has sparked a controversy, grabbing the attention of many tech lovers worldwide; let\u2019s now take a further look into Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s review of Apple Vision Pro. With the release of Apple Vision Pro, Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality have seen a massive boost. Although Apple Vision Pro combines both Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality, which is called Mixed Reality, combining both technologies is only done by Apple for now. Talking about the reviews, as mentioned, OpenAI\u2019s founder, Sam Altman, has already shared a review saying that the \u201cVision Pro is the 2nd most impressive tech after iPhone.\u201d On the other hand, we have Mark Zuckerberg, who shared a mixed review of the Apple Vision Pro. The Facebook, a.k.a Meta founder, posted a video on Instagram, taking the attention of many fan lovers. In the video, the billionaire founder could be seen sharing, \u201cI finally tried Apple Vision Pro, and I think the Quest 3 is the better product, despite being seven times less expensive,\u201d With the statement, Zuckerberg shares his review, saying that the latest new VR headset from Meta, the Quest 3, is better than the Apple Vision Pro in terms of pricing as well as weight. He shared, \u201cQuest 3 is not just a better value product, but it is a better product, period.\u201d and \u201cQuest is better for the vast majority of things,\u201d he added later. Zuckerberg also shared that playing games and having no wire experience is possible with Quest 3, and also, on the weight side, the Quest 3 is around 120 grams lighter than the Apple Vision Pro. You can check out the video where Zuckberge can be seen sharing his review of Apple Vision Pro. He also strongly emphasizes that the Quest 3 offers an even better field of view and a brighter screen on the front side combined with motion blur. In the video, he did admit to the fact that Apple Vision supports more pixel resolution compared to the Quest 3, and on the tracking side, the Apple Vision Pro takes an edge over with its eye-tracking, whereas the Meta Quest 3 takes an edge over with the hands tracking features. For this, Zuckerberg did confirm that the fourth generation Quest or Meta Quest 4 will surely come with the feature for eye tracking. You can checkout his review down below:   A post shared by Mark Zuckerberg (@zuck) He also confidently emphasizes the most extensive library you get with Meta Quest 3, alongside the ability to play Xbox games. And you get all of these for much less than the Apple Vision Pro\u2019s $3500 listed pricing. In conclusion, Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s review only showcases his point of view about the technology going ahead with the Apple Vision Pro. Both headsets have their plus points and minus points. Still, yes, we do firmly believe that Meta will be taking a lot of inspiration from the Visnio Pro, and possibly the next generation VR headset, the Meta Quest 4, will be getting a massive upgrade over its predecessor model. also We can expect it to be way cheaper than Apple Visino Pro.
