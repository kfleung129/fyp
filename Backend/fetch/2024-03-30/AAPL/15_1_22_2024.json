The company aims to eventually give consumers a complete picture of their well-being via sensors on different parts of the body and around the home. Health tracking is already a key selling point of smartphones and watches, with Samsung, Apple and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google using the features to attract and retain customers. Creating sensors for continuous blood pressure tracking and glucose monitoring would be particularly valuable breakthroughs. Apple has been working for years on a glucose reader that wouldn\u2019t require users to prick their skin for blood \u2014 a potential boon for millions of diabetics. \u201cIf we can do continuous blood pressure and glucose, we\u2019re in a whole different ballgame,\u201d Pak, Samsung\u2019s mobile digital health chief, said during a wide-ranging interview. \u201cI think that\u2019s where everyone is trying to get to. We\u2019re putting significant investment toward that.\u201d He wouldn\u2019t comment on a timeline for either feature, but said he hopes noninvasive glucose monitoring could come to the market in some form within five years. \u201cWe are looking at everything from miniaturization to the various different technology platforms that can do some type of glucose monitoring or anything in between,\u201d Pak said. The remarks follow Samsung\u2019s announcement last week that it\u2019s working on a ring with health sensors. The Galaxy Ring product is scheduled to be released before the end of 2024 and will come in a range of colors and sizes, Pak said. The company is eyeing activity and sleep tracking for the ring, with more health features to come later. Smart rings from companies like Oura offer an alternative for people who don\u2019t like to wear a watch but still want to track their health metrics and sleep patterns. \u201cThe ring represents that community of people who want health tracking that is more comfortable and less obtrusive,\u201d Pak said. \u201cIt\u2019s meeting a need of a specific population of people who want to track and measure, but in a different way.\u201d Pak said Samsung hasn\u2019t finalized pricing on the Galaxy Ring, but \u2014 like the company\u2019s Galaxy Watches \u2014 it probably won\u2019t be compatible with Apple\u2019s iPhone. Developing a blood sugar monitor would be a more challenging task, but one that could have major rewards. Current products on the market typically require a blood draw or a prick in the skin \u2014 an obtrusive process. Apple has been working on a noninvasive approach since around 2010 and has since made major progress, Bloomberg News has reported. Even so, a product remains years away.

Samsung smartwatches have long offered the ability to determine a user\u2019s blood pressure, but the monitoring isn\u2019t constant throughout the day and requires calibration against a standalone blood pressure checker. Pak said Samsung is \u201cevaluating all options\u201d to improve its blood pressure features. The aim is to go longer without needing calibration. \u201cWe\u2019ve been thinking long and hard about this,\u201d he said. Apple, meanwhile, is planning to add hypertension detection to its smartwatch later this year in a way that doesn\u2019t require calibration but also doesn\u2019t provide exact readings. Instead, the watch will inform users that they may have elevated blood pressure. Apple\u2019s expansion into health technology hasn\u2019t gone entirely smoothly. It recently pulled a blood oxygen feature from the Apple Watch after a legal setback in its patent dispute with Masimo Corp. Pak said traditional blood pressure readings aren\u2019t \u201creally that meaningful\u201d other than showing a range of normal and abnormal. \u201cWhether it\u2019s Apple or others, I think we are trying to redefine blood pressure in a way that it was originally intended, which is: How much cardiovascular risk do you have?\u201d he said. Samsung also is exploring a range of different sensors for future versions of its earbuds. The company is studying new ways to measure body temperature and heart rates, adding that the ear is a closer pathway to the heart than the wrist. Data from the ear could be combined with wrist and ambient data to provide users with a more comprehensive picture of their health. Mixed-reality headsets could be a new frontier for health as well, Pak said. Apple is poised to release its first product in that market next week when the Vision Pro goes on sale for $3,499. Meditation and mental health could be key areas for such devices, he said. \u201cWe are right now looking at partnerships to address that,\u201d Pak said.
