    "text": "Apple Loop takes a look back at the news and headlines surrounding Apple, starting with the announcement of the dates for WWDC 2024. The Worldwide Developer Conference will be a crucial event for Apple, as they are under pressure to deliver a meaningful AI-based product in response to their smartphone rivals being ahead in the game. The event will run from Monday, June 10, to Friday, June 14, with the keynote expected to kick off at 10 a.m. local time. In terms of iPhone news, details about the upcoming iPhone 16 Pro models have been leaked, revealing colorways such as Rose Gold, Natural Titanium, and Space Black. While AI is a big focus for the company, the color of the phone remains an important factor when it comes to attracting consumers. The iPhone 16 range is also expected to receive a significant power boost to support its AI capabilities, with rumors of additional RAM and storage capacity to enhance performance. Apple\u2019s plans for a folding iPhone have been delayed by at least three years, as the company struggles to match the technological advancements made by competitors like Samsung. Despite stockpiling parts, the launch of a foldable iPhone has been pushed back to the first quarter of 2027. Meanwhile, Apple has released an interim fix for critical bugs in macOS 14.4, addressing issues with USB connectivity, iCloud backups, and Java processes crashing on Apple Silicon powered Macs. In the iPad realm, the next release is expected to feature a new forward-facing camera along the long edge, allowing for a more comfortable landscape experience. This change will bring the iPad Pro in line with the iPad Air, which already has the camera positioned to the side for landscape use. Additionally, iPhone 12 owners were surprised with an increase in charging speed with the release of iOS 17.4, enabling faster wireless charging at 15W using the Qi2 standard. Finally, a rare 4GB original-release iPhone was auctioned off for an astonishing $130,027.20 due to its rarity and pristine condition. The model, discontinued by Apple in 2007, fetched a high price at LCG Auctions, highlighting the collector\u2019s value placed on early iPhone models.
