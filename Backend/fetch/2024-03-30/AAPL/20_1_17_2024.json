    "text": "krystiannawrocki/iStock Unreleased via Getty Images A U.S. appeals courts on Wednesday ruled that a ban on imports of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Watches with blood oxygen sensors would be reinstated, after finding no merits in the tech giant's appeal over a patent infringement dispute with Masimo (MASI). The ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit will lift the interim stay on the import ban of Apple Watches on January 18 at 1700 ET. The ruling also means that the affected Apple Watch models cannot be imported while the iPhone-maker appeals the underlying ban issued by the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC). The ITC's import ban on Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 models went into effect late last month after the Biden Administration did not veto it. The U.S. appeals court lifted the ban on December 27 while it mulled Apple's (AAPL) request for a long-term pause. The company had resumed sales of the Watches later that day. The main issue at hand is Masimo's (MASI) accusations that Apple's (AAPL) blood oxygen sensors in its Watches infringes several of the medical technology company's patents. Apple (AAPL) did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Seeking Alpha. Media reports over the weekend said that Apple (AAPL) will abandon the blood oxygen feature on its Watches if its court appeal fails. That workaround was approved by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection. According to Apple's (AAPL) latest quarterly results, its wearables, home and accessories business - which includes the Apple Watch - brought in revenue of $9.32B in the three months ended September 30, 2023.
