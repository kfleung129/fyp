Sign up for the full article here Who owns the phone in your pocket? That\u2019s the question at the heart of Apple\u2019s latest battle with European regulators, and it doesn\u2019t look as if it\u2019s going to be settled any time soon. On Thursday, the company published its plan for how to comply with the European Union\u2019s Digital Markets Act (DMA), a mammoth piece of legislation that seeks to break up the power of so-called \u201cgatekeepers\u201d: the massive (almost entirely American) technology companies whose stature warps whole industries. From our story: Under the changes, the US tech company will also give iPhone users a range of browsers to choose from as their default, allow the use of alternative payment systems to Apple Pay, and permit the installation of alternatives to its App Store, which could theoretically include the Google Play store. But there is a catch: for the first time, developers who take advantage of the option will be charged a flat fee per installation, overturning free-to-play business models and limiting the sorts of apps that can bypass the store. The six companies named as gatekeepers \u2013 the American big five of Apple, Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Amazon, plus ByteDance \u2013 have a raft of requirements foisted on them in the areas they are considered to be dominant. Varied though they are, covering everything from TikTok\u2019s power in social networking to Google\u2019s monopoly in search engines, the goal is the same: to ensure that control of the services doesn\u2019t lead to control of the world we build on top of them. But giving up control is hard. Apple has long argued that its strict control of the iOS platform and the App Store is fundamentally paternalistic, rather than authoritarian. It says that a world in which iPhones worked like Macs would be one with more scams, viruses and consumer harms. The EU says, effectively: \u201cWe\u2019ll take that risk.\u201d Hence the company\u2019s begrudging new plans. When Apple switched the iPhone line to use USB-C rather than the company\u2019s own Lightning ports, it was effusive about the benefits the change would bring \u2013 and silent about the fact that it was mandated by the EU. Not so this time. Apple\u2019s announcement drips with displeasure at being forced to do something it detests: The DMA requires changes to this system that bring greater risks to users and developers \u2026 This includes new avenues for malware, fraud and scams, illicit and harmful content, and other privacy and security threats. These changes also compromise Apple\u2019s ability to detect, prevent, and take action against malicious apps on iOS and to support users impacted by issues with apps downloaded outside of the App Store. A whole new world So what has changed? A whole lot. Some of the new rules announced last week apply globally, and some in the EU only, which helpfully lets us guess at what things Apple is pissed off at having to change, and what things Apple is absolutely spitting furious about. In the former category, the company has relaxed its limitations on video game streaming services (such as Microsoft\u2019s Xbox Game Pass), and will no longer require each individual game to have its own presence on the App Store. It\u2019s also dropped requirements for apps to support its homegrown \u201cSign in with Apple\u201d technology (though developers will still have to offer a \u201cprivacy-focused\u201d login service, and cannot force people to use, for example, \u201csign in with Facebook\u201d). Developers will also receive new analytics data, it said. The latter category is much bigger, much more consequential, and all exclusive to users within the EU. Top of the list is the ability, for the first time, for developers to make their apps available outside the App Store. It\u2019s not a total free-for-all, however: Apple will require apps to be installed from a comparable marketplace, which can only be run by big companies (who can prove they have access to \u20ac1m of credit), and must be (as best it can enforce it) \u201creal\u201d marketplaces. In other words, Facebook can run an app store, but not if it only has apps made by Facebook on it. Apple will still maintain a modicum of control over those app stores, vetting the apps that go on them for security concerns, but explicitly not applying the company\u2019s content policies. That\u2019s as the EU wants it, but does mean the burden of complying with the vast array of other European regulations will fall on the third-party marketplaces that spring up. Equally important is the ability of developers to build their own web browsers and contactless payment systems. Apple has long prevented others from doing that (third-party browsers on iOS, such as Chrome and Firefox, are just wrappers for Apple\u2019s own \u201cWebKit\u201d rendering engine) for security reasons, and now we get to see whether the trade-off was worth it. Money talks But let\u2019s not get too stuck on points of principle. The real reason this bevy of announcements is so consequential is money. And that\u2019s where Apple threw a grenade at the status quo. Sign up to TechScape Alex Hern's weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our lives after newsletter promotion EU developers will be offered two choices. They can either continue as though nothing has changed, or they can take the \u201calternative terms\u201d. Those see the cut they pay Apple for downloads from the App Store reduced from its current 15-30% down to 10-17% (depending on the business they\u2019re in), with a 3% surcharge to use Apple\u2019s own payment system. Payments from alternative app stores garner no commission at all (although said stores may charge their own fees). But these savings don\u2019t come for free. Developers who sign up for the new terms will also need to pay a \u201ccore technology fee\u201d, an (effectively) annual \u20ac0.50 per user. And that\u2019s where the question of who owns your iPhone comes in. For the first time, Apple is making explicit an argument it has danced around for a long time: that even though you have bought an iPhone from it, it still deserves to be paid for you to use it. The core technology fee, the company says, \u201creflects the many ways Apple creates value for developers\u2019 businesses\u201d. (Apple already charges developers $99 a year to build for the platform.) The fee has sparked outrage from some of the companies that were most hoping for the change, including Epic Games (who called the new terms \u201chot garbage\u201d) and Spotify (who called it \u201cextortion, plain and simple\u201d). It certainly upends the economics of app development, rendering free-to-play development extremely risky, and almost certainly increasing the payment many developers would have to make to Apple. Spotify, for instance, doesn\u2019t allow users to subscribe through the App Store, and so currently pays nothing to the company. That would increase to tens of millions of euros a year if it accepted the alternative terms. And while most apps get their first million users for free, thanks to the beneficence of Apple, alternative app stores have to pay the fee from user one \u2013 which means they\u2019ll be economically compelled to impose their own charging structure to avoid haemorrhaging cash. Where does this leave indie developers? What follows will almost certainly be an extended period of haggling. Big European tech firms will want the fee to be cut or eliminated altogether. Apple, meanwhile, will want to give no further ground, but more importantly, will want to avoid the appearance of the European experiment being seen to be a success. If few alternative app stores launch, and most developers stick on the pre-existing terms, it will strengthen its claim that other jurisdictions don\u2019t need to follow the EU\u2019s lead. That, more than anything, likely explains the dogged attempt to follow the letter rather than the spirit of the regulations. Both sides of big tech, then, think that the new terms will have little difference. But I\u2019m not so sure they\u2019re right. The tech I want to see flourishing isn\u2019t megascale streaming services who need to trim pennies from every monthly user, any more than it is monolithic platforms whose desire for control warps the culture at large. Instead, I\u2019m eager to see a world in which indie developers, artists and creators can coexist with the massive players. Alternative marketplaces, low commissions and flat fees don\u2019t help Spotify in its battle with Apple Music, but could make for a very different landscape for those developers who just need to find a niche within a niche to make their home.
