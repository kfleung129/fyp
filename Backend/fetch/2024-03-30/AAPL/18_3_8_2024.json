    "text": "Update font size. Reset  Apple stock is coming off a seven-session losing streak, and it\u2019s down 12% so far this year. Shares could remain under siege through the company\u2019s WWDC developer event in June, according to a Citi Research analyst. Emily Bary for MarketWatch:\n \u200e Smartphone demand has been sluggish, though that event could become the \u201cAI catalyst to drive upside to 2025 AI smartphone demand,\u201d Citi\u2019s Atif Malik wrote Friday. While Malik kept his buy rating on Apple shares, he narrowly reduced his price target to $220 from $225 in his latest note to clients\u2026 [T]hird-party data from Counterpoint Research suggested that iPhone unit sales plunged 24% in China during the first six weeks of the year. And Apple appears to be getting more aggressive with its discounting in order to drive sales. Meanwhile, his analysis of U.S. third-party data found that foot traffic to a sampling of U.S. Apple Stores was off 6% in the first two months of 2024 relative to the same period a year before\u2026 \u201cApple currently holds 75% market share in the premium phone market\u2026and we expect Apple to release [generative AI] features to maintain its position in the high-end market,\u201d Malik said. \u200e\nMacDailyNews Take: Via it\u2019s current frenzied catch up efforts, Apple needs to get \u201cgood enough\u201d generative AI \u2014 preferably better than rivals\u2019, but Apple is trying to come from way behind here \u2014 out the door and into its marketing and, finally, into users\u2019 hands ASAP. It\u2019d be best for the stock if users didn\u2019t have to wait for generative AI to appear in Apple\u2019s next-gen OSes to hit public release in the fall.\n \u200e\nPlease help support MacDailyNews.

The Apple schtick of giving users 50% of what was expected in new products (nickel and diming with RAM and drive space) and software and then making us all wait 4 more months for the software to be released, is not working any more. The last few years of software releases have been pathetic. The best thing that comes to mind is the improved stability of AirDrop, a glaring embarrassment for years prior to that. It\u2019s not pretty but having MSFT and NVDA kick AAPL\u2019s ass is necessary, hopefully they wake up. I ignore all articles that predict Apple\u2019s share price movement without a clear commitment to either buy or short shares by the writer of the article. They never put their asses on the line and just take pot shots to get their article fee and move on to the next guessing game. Buy it, Sell it, Short it, RIGHT AFTER YOU WRITE ABOUT IT,  FOOL TOOL.
