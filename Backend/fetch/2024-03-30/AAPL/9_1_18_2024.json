By Alex King Let's get to the punchline first. We believe Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock can run up a little way yet, and we have a 2024 year-end price target in the range of $214-240/share. That's 17%-31% up from today's closing price. We rate the stock at Hold accordingly, because that's not really enough upside to get excited about - so not an Accumulate rating - but we think the market will run up in 2024 and take AAPL stock with it - so not a Distribute rating. Why own AAPL stock at this point? Well, speaking personally, I don't. Not directly anyway, though my largest two personal account holdings are (TQQQ) and (UPRO), and AAPL is typically the largest underlying stock in those 3x index ETFs. We believe the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 will close the year meaningfully higher than today, a result of institutional demand for US equities at large, and that demand for equities will pull AAPL stock upwards with it. In short, if large account players want to build US equities exposure - and we think they do - then we believe AAPL stock will rise. Do we think there's something special in Apple fundamentals supporting that bull logic? We do not. The company numbers look like a slowly atrophying oligopolist to our old, tired and cynical eyes, but the numbers have looked that way for a year or so now and that hasn't stopped the stock from ripping up around 50% from the 2023 lows to the current price. As always, the price of a security is determined directly by the demand for and supply of that security, not by the number of phones sold, whether the issuer's phones are better or worse than some other issuer's phones or not, or the gross margin achieved, or any other such input factor. Let's take a look at the numbers up to and including the September 2023 quarter. AAPL Fundamentals (Company SEC Filings, YCharts.com, Cestrian Analysis) AAPL Fundamentals (Company SEC Filings, YCharts.com, Cestrian Analysis) First, the good. Then the bad. Valuation? Sort of a nothingburger really. Not expensive and not cheap on cash flow, revenue multiple looks punchy vs. the growth rate, but that's an arithmetic function of the high margins rather than the market being blind to the lack of growth. AAPL Valuation Analysis (Company SEC Filings, YCharts.com, Cestrian Analysis) AAPL Valuation Analysis (Company SEC Filings, YCharts.com, Cestrian Analysis) The real story of AAPL stock for us lies in the chart. Here's our take. AAPL Chart (TrendSpider.com, Cestrian Analysis) AAPL Chart (TrendSpider.com, Cestrian Analysis) This is a very pretty chart if you care to use the Elliott Wave / Fibonacci extension/retracement method of pattern recognition. There are many other excellent forms of chart analysis but this one works for us. We like to add in the volume x price profile - that's the gray bars on the right-hand side of the chart - to help us form a view on institutional accumulation vs. distribution behavior. Here's the story of AAPL stock since 2018 looking through this particular technical lens. If you knew nothing about iPhones or EBITDA or anything else, but you were handy at pattern recognition, you would say, well, this pattern often ends with a final Wave 5 up terminating at between the .618 and the .786 extension of the Wave 1-3 combined. Sound complicated? It isn't. Measure the stock price change from the Wave 1 low at the end of 2018 to the Wave 3 high in late 2021/early 2022. Multiply that number, we'll call it X, by .618 and add the number you get to the stock price at the Wave 4 low. That's the low end of the typical Wave 5 termination zone. Now multiply X by .786 and add the number you get to the stock price at the Wave 4 low. That's the high end of the typical Wave 5 termination zone. Sound dumb? We agree. Does it work more often than you might think? It does. Why? Because large accounts trade to these patterns. (Or something to do with seashells and the Earth's magnetic field, you choose). So, in short, we think the market will likely close 2024 up materially from here, and we think AAPL stock will continue to be a hugely important index constituent. So if demand for US equities is up so too will be demand for AAPL stock, and we think that is a perfect setup to measure with Fib extensions, because market bigs are at the wheel here, not fundamentalists or hobbyists. Which says to us, a year-end target of $214-240 range, rating, Hold. Cestrian Capital Research, Inc, 17 January 2024.
