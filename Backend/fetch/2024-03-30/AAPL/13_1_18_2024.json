One reason so many people love Apple\u2019s products is that they\u2019re high quality and the company mostly deserves your trust. This week, though, Apple displayed its worst instincts for jerking you around for the company\u2019s gain. Apple was on the wrong end of two fights that the company picked \u2014 over a supposed \u201cban\u201d on the latest Apple watches and over its control of the apps on your iPhone. But Apple came out of the messes with more attention, more power and probably more money. You lost. Here\u2019s what this week\u2019s Apple developments mean for you: Masimo, a medical technology company, has been saying for years that the Apple Watch ripped off Masimo\u2019s technology to measure blood-oxygen levels. Masimo asked courts to stop what it said was Apple\u2019s theft. Facing what could have been a ban on Apple Watch sales in the United States, Apple briefly paused selling new models right before Christmas. Apple has said it disagreed with the court decision and is appealing it. This week, a court ordered Apple to stop selling watch devices as long as they infringed on Masimo\u2019s patented technology. To comply, Apple, starting Thursday, disabled the blood-oxygen feature in new Apple Watch devices. Straight talk: There was no chance that Apple would have stopped selling the Apple Watch. No matter what courts ruled, Apple had the fallback option to remove the blood-oxygen feature. And that\u2019s what the company did. The crummy part for you is that Apple encouraged the \u201cwill-they-or-won\u2019t-they\u201d idea of a potential ban on the Apple Watch. That was confusing for people who were considering buying an Apple Watch over the Christmas holiday, and it generated the kind of publicity for Apple that\u2019s hard to buy. The fight with Masimo did not do anything useful for you. Apple essentially goaded Masimo into a legal fight, generated attention for itself and defended to the hilt a smartwatch feature that most people wouldn\u2019t use regularly. Ask yourself, why does a smartwatch need to have a blood oxygen sensor? It\u2019s a niche health feature that can be useful, but unnecessary for most of us to have on a wrist 24/7. You can buy a separate blood oxygen checker, also called a pulse oximeter, to use as needed. I own a Walgreens model that was recently selling online for about $35. Apple also this week announced changes to how it handles your purchases from apps after the U.S. Supreme Court declined to intervene in a 2021 legal ruling that went partly against Apple. And again, Apple turned the lemon into lemonade for itself. The company gave itself more control over purchases that you make from iPhone apps. Buying stuff from iPhone apps will probably get more confusing and maybe more expensive. For the first time, Apple is now required by law to let apps point you to their websites to buy a digital news subscription, an e-book or another digital purchase. But Apple imposed onerous conditions. For example, if you click a web link in Peloton\u2019s iPhone app and buy a digital fitness subscription from Peloton\u2019s website with your credit card, Apple now says it\u2019s entitled to a 27 percent cut of what you spent. Apple will keep collecting a chunk of your Peloton subscription fee forever \u2014 all because you followed a link from an iPhone app once. Apple also said it would need to look at Peloton\u2019s subscriber records regularly to make sure Peloton isn\u2019t welching on what it owes Apple. Apple and Google already are app dictators and collect fees when you buy most digital products in apps. But never before has Apple given itself domain over what you buy anywhere on the internet with your own credit card. It\u2019s a good bet that some companies will raise their prices for digital purchases to offset Apple\u2019s commissions. (Some companies already charge higher prices for digital purchases made in their apps compared with the company\u2019s website. Apple hasn\u2019t let companies tell you about lower prices available online.) [Buying stuff in apps is broken. Try this instead.] Some app makers are furious over Apple\u2019s power grab. John Gruber, a longtime technology blogger who often sides with Apple, wrote that the company\u2019s move \u201creeks of greed and avarice\u201d and risks angering regulators and politicians. Apple\u2019s app changes show the company is trying to position itself to blunt a new law in Europe intended to loosen Apple and Google\u2019s power over apps. Regulators could force Apple to water down the app changes it announced this week. But for now, Apple twice lost legal fights this week \u2014 and still came out ahead at your expense. "
