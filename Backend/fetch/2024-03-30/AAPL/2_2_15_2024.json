An Apple class action alleges the company won\u2019t service Apple Watches under its service, support and repair contract, AppleCare+, for consumers with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). Plaintiff Harrison Varnes, who has an ICD, claims Apple is refusing to service his Apple Watch while allegedly telling him his implant makes him an \u201cunintended user\u201d for the Apple Watch and AppleCare+. \u201cApple has confirmed by subsequent letter to Plaintiff\u2019s counsel that its refusal to repair or service Plaintiff\u2019s Apple Watch under AppleCare+ was solely because Plaintiff has an ICD,\u201d the Apple class action states. Varnes is seeking to represent a nationwide class of consumers with a cardiac pacemaker, ICD or other implanted electronic device and who purchased an Apple Watch in the U.S. that is or was covered by AppleCare+. Varnes says in the Apple class action that he was \u201csurprised to learn\u201d that his ICD would make him an \u201cunintended user\u201d of the Apple Watch. Varnes claims Apple encouraged him and \u201cthousands of other Americans with ICDs and pacemakers\u201d to use the device to monitor their cardiac activity. \u201cThere is nothing in the AppleCare+ contract that suggests that AppleCare+ services are not available to Apple Watch customers with ICDs or defibrillators,\u201d the Apple class action states. Varnes, who argues he has received no compensation for his two prior years of payments for AppleCare+, claims Apple is guilty of breach of contract and violating the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act. The plaintiff is demanding a jury trial and requesting declaratory and injunctive relief along with an award of actual and statutory damages for himself and all class members. U.S. Customs and Border Protection decided last month that a redesigned version of the Apple Watch that does not contain a blood oxygen monitor will not be subject to an import ban, amid an ongoing patent dispute between Apple and global medical technology company Masimo. Do you have an implanted electronic device and purchased an Apple Watch with AppleCare+? Let us know in the comments. The plaintiffs are represented by Darren T. Kaplan of Kaplan Gore LLP. The Apple Watch ICDs class action lawsuit is Varnes v. Apple Inc., Case No. 1:24-cv-01007, in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York.
