    "text": "Martyn Landi, PA Technology Correspondent Mark Zuckerberg has taken a swipe at Apple\u2019s new Vision Pro spatial computing headset, saying his firm\u2019s Quest headsets are \u201cso much better\u201d at most tasks. The Meta founder said having now tried Apple\u2019s Vision Pro device, which was released in the US earlier this month, he was \u201csurprised\u201d how much better he believes Meta\u2019s Quest devices are despite being \u201cseven times less expensive\u201d. The Vision Pro costs $3,500, while the Meta Quest costs around $500.     Speaking in a video post to his Instagram page, Mr Zuckerberg gave a short review of his experience with the Vision Pro, and while complimenting the Apple device\u2019s eye-tracking feature \u2013 which enables users to control the device using their eyes \u2013 the Meta founder claimed his company\u2019s devices were superior. \u201cI have to say that before this, I expected that Quest would be the better value for most people since it\u2019s really good and it\u2019s seven times less expensive, but after using it, I don\u2019t just think Quest is the better value, I think Quest is the better product, period,\u201d he said. \u201cOverall, Quest is better for the vast majority of things that people use mixed reality for now. \u201cI think it\u2019s just a lot more comfortable, and we designed it to weigh 120 grams less which makes a really big difference on your face. \u201cThere\u2019s no wires that get in the way when you move around \u2013 it\u2019s a big deal.\u201d He added that he believed the Quest had a bigger field of view along with a brighter screen. \u201cHonestly, I\u2019m pretty surprised that Quest is so much better for the vast majority of things that people use these headsets for with that price differential,\u201d he said. The tech billionaire ended the video by acknowledging that some \u201cfanboys\u201d would criticise him or others who \u201cdare to question if Apple is going to be the leader\u201d in a certain technology sector. He then compared the growing mixed reality headset market to the smartphone and PC markets, and how Apple\u2019s \u201cclosed\u201d model, where it controls what appears on its devices, had been historically successful in some sectors, but not others. \u201cThe reality is that every generation of computing has an open and a closed model,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd yeah, in mobile, Apple\u2019s closed model won, but it\u2019s not always that way \u2013 if you go back to the PC era, Microsoft\u2019s open model was the winner. \u201cIn this next generation, Meta is going to be the open model, and I really want to make sure that the open model wins out again.\u201d  Message submitting...
