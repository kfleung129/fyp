Yet, years of innovation by Apple have effectively given the company its own exclusive tech ecosystem. Now, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) has alleged this ecosystem is harming competition and innovation through Apple\u2019s unique market power. The department\u2019s lawsuit will face a few big hurdles. Perhaps chief among them: many of the \u201canti-competitive\u201d systems Apple has built are the very things that enable the bold innovation they\u2019re famous for. Apple is the latest modern major US tech firm to face investigation into alleged anti-competitive behaviour by the US government. The DOJ explains its lawsuit through five consumer-relatable examples of where Apple\u2019s iPhone ecosystem stifles competition: the inability to give \u201csuper apps\u201d like WeChat full functionality on iPhone restrictions on game streaming apps a functionality divide between \u201cblue bubble\u201d and \u201cgreen bubble\u201d friends on iMessage poor connectivity between non-Apple smartwatches and iPhones digital wallet technology that locks out third parties. Read more:\n      Why are Apple, Amazon, Google and Meta facing antitrust lawsuits and huge fines? And will it protect consumers? In the US and other jurisdictions, the tech giant has already taken steps to address some of these concerns. However, the DOJ stresses these complaints aren\u2019t exclusive or exhaustive. They\u2019re examples to show where Apple\u2019s \u201cclosed\u201d ecosystem locks customers into what Apple has built. One problem for the DOJ is that the tech world has been left to private design for 30 years. Enjoying strong growth and innovation has meant relying on private infrastructure. Having the most disruptive ideas might draw consumer attention, but vast infrastructures keep them as customers (for example, OpenAI\u2019s partnership with Microsoft). Our research group considers how digital innovations come to shape the \u201cinfrastructures\u201d that guide our increasingly digital lives. Consider Apple\u2019s influence on the mundane and technical, such as USB-C technology. Or surprising cultural shifts, such as Airpods. And even how iPhone technology effectively launched Instagram culture. The DOJ\u2019s core argument is that Apple\u2019s business model has now shifted from leading innovation to gatekeeping its cultural-technical infrastructures. Such shifts are not necessarily planned evils. Infrastructure can lead to further infrastructure with novel benefits: it is no accident internet fibre cables follow old rail lines on land and telegraph cables undersea. Over time, though, a combination of cultural-technical infrastructures built up by a powerful company can monopolise a market. To know that story\u2019s end game, think Boeing. Another problem for the DOJ is it will be hard to define the market that Apple allegedly monopolises or attempts to. Use of the 1890 Sherman Anti-Trust Act on firms requires such a definition.  It makes sense the department is using this act against Google, which controls more than 90% of the search market. But Apple\u2019s market share is far lower \u2013 not even a majority of mobile phone sales worldwide. To get around this, the department argues the market that Apple does have is unique. Apple is famously good at creating its own markets \u2013 rehashing familiar things (hard drives and MP3 files) to make novel products (iPods) that \u201cjust work\u201d for consumers and suppliers. Apple\u2019s competitive edge is creating the exclusive platforms it\u2019s now being pursued for. As many will remember, before the iPhone, browsing the internet on a phone wasn\u2019t a thing. Before iTunes, digital music was a pain or illegal. For millions of Apple fans across the US, the DOJ\u2019s logic is a hard sell. Notably repeated in this lawsuit is the need for \u201cdisintermediation\u201d, which means removing the \u201cmiddlemen\u201d who take a cut between customers and suppliers. The DOJ alleges Apple acts as such a middleman by imposing on consumer choice \u2013 whether by restricting Apple\u2019s interoperability with other products, or charging a 30% fee (the so-called Apple Tax) to do business on Apple\u2019s platforms. The challenge is that in a world of bad actors on the internet (evil or incompetent), people actually seem to love Apple\u2019s capacity to intermediate. The company\u2019s strict control of its apps, products and services enables growth across its platforms and has given it a reputation for being an exceptional \u201cmiddleman\u201d for privacy, usability and other consumer concerns. For example, Apple\u2019s wallet launched to not transmit credit card numbers to merchants, who regularly suffer data breaches and leaks. It offered an intermediary solution where evil (and incompetent) actors abound. The department\u2019s claim this practice creates an \u201cadditional point of failure for privacy and security\u201d is incoherent. An extensive history of cybercrime incidents around the world shows that for consumers, credit card companies and merchants, holding customer data becomes a liability, as well as an asset. During the pandemic, Apple\u2019s trusted ability to intermediate also fostered the success of \u201cExposure Notification\u201d, a privacy-preserving contact tracing system that kept personal exposure data away from governments and other parties. But in other areas, the department argues that Apple has leveraged this reputation in self-serving ways. Fortnite developer Epic Games\u2019 ongoing stoush with Apple over policies to charge 30% on in-app purchases is one key example. Many developers would likely have followed Epic in trying to get their customers cash out of Apple\u2019s grasp, if not for fear of retribution from Apple. Yet, Epic Games largely lost to Apple in US courts, and this year the Supreme Court refused to hear the appeals. This loss may have compelled the DOJ to act. Read more:\n      Apple, Google and Fortnite's stoush is a classic case of how far big tech will go to retain power Even the success of this lawsuit won\u2019t necessarily bring about useful change at Apple or for the consumer. In Europe, the tech giant has already demonstrated an expert capacity for \u201cmalicious compliance\u201d \u2013 after meeting the European Union\u2019s new Digital Markets Act policy in such bad faith that its solution barely works and is now being re-investigated. Overall, it\u2019s not that Apple is necessarily, well, a \u201cbad apple\u201d, but that \u201cApple vs USA\u201d allows us to think different about what really drives innovation in modern tech.
