Foxconn plans to invest $1.54 billion in India, the latest in its growing expansion plan, following a surge in revenues in the South Asian market. Foxconn said in a stock exchange filing that the investment will help it fulfill \"operational needs.\" The investment comes two months after the Taiwanese firm said it plans to double its workforce and investment in India by next year.
