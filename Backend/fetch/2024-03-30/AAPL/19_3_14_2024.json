    "text": "Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has been one of the most successful companies in history, both in terms of capturing the imagination of its users and investors, and of simply growing its business. Indeed, the company is known for running advertisement campaigns aimed at selling the feel of Apple\u2019s electronics \u2013 advanced, slick, futuristic, liberating, subversive, and revolutionary if we judge by a famous ad from 1984 \u2013 rather than any individual product. In more recent years, AAPL has triggered a different type of daydreaming: what if I bought Apple stock ahead of the first iPhone release, or at least at the same time as Warren Buffett, and, finally, will there be another time in the stock\u2019s future enabling traders to make it big as before? With the hopes that investors may still manage to capitalize on Apple\u2019s future breakthroughs and the historical triumphs of the big tech company, Finbold decided to ask \u2013 and try to answer \u2013 what will Apple stock be worth in 2030? Predicting the future of Apple stock is arguably harder in 2024 than at any point in recent years. On the one hand, the company has, so far, failed to capitalize on the artificial intelligence (AI) boom, but on the other, it has an AI in the works. Apple gave up on its electric vehicle (EV) dreams, but at the same time, given the state of the industry in the U.S., the decision might have been prudent. The big tech firm released an exciting new product \u2013 Vision Pro \u2013 a tool that has a chance to trigger a smartphone-like revolution, but the revolution is yet to start. Additionally, perhaps showing the stagnant spot Apple is in, in early 2024, it lost its spot as the world\u2019s biggest company to Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and is pressured in the stock market by fears of dwindling sales in China. Finally, Apple not only still has the potential to reignite its growth with a new breakthrough in the coming months and years but is also working with a solid foundation given its consolidation of the Apple Pay ecosystem, which, if nothing else. nearly guarantees a steady source of revenue with the big tech firm\u2019s notorious lack of interoperability with third-party products. There are several routes Apple stock might go in the coming 6 years. First, should it successfully launch its artificial intelligence platform, it might continue rising at the pace seen in recent years \u2013 though it would still have to fight for market share as a new arrival despite the benefit of brand recognition. Under such circumstances, it might, by early 2023, be worth approximately $320 to $400 on the low end and more than $800 should it emulate the success seen with other AI-focused firms in recent times. The \u201cVision Pro\u201d is another product that could see Apple stock return to its former glory, though it may take multiple years if we look at the trends created by iPhone and iPad. Indeed, should Apple stock price history repeat itself, AAPL investors might see the first major benefits of the VR/AR boom in 2029 and the actual blossoming closer to 2033. Still, if we assume the iPhone-like effect, by 2030, Apple shares could be priced near $580, and if we admit the chance the \u201cVision Pro\u201d could take off quicker and send AAPL shares surging in a manner akin to what was observed in the six years leading up to the COVID-19 pandemic, the big tech company might rise to about $720. As a side note, should the world be hit with another lockdown-inducing pandemic \u2013\u00a0 and another lockdown-driven technology sector boom \u2013 Apple might find itself close to $500 within one year\u2019s time, assuming it starts from the press time price of $171.13. Finally, should Apple fail to secure its AI market share, and should the \u201cVision Pro\u201d ultimately prove unexciting, AAPL shares might follow the pattern of a firm like IBM (NYSE: IBM) and find themselves close to $130 by 2030. Ultimately, it is worth remembering that 2030 is far away and that no repeat of Apple\u2019s \u2013 or another firm\u2019s \u2013 past performance is guaranteed. It is also difficult to gauge the actual effects of hypothetical innovation or even the depth of some upcoming recession \u2013 which some, like JPMorgan\u2019s (NYSE: JPM) Jamie Dimon, believe still has a 65% chance of starting in 2024. While AAPL shares\u2019 future is difficult to gauge, Apple stock price history is well documented. The company, known for achieving stellar growth, has actually been doing relatively poorly in 2024. Year-to-date (YTD), AAPL stock has declined 7.82%. The more recent performance isn\u2019t much better either, and Apple shares are 7.07% in the red in the last 30 days but 1.18% in the green in the last week. Finally, the latest full trading session \u2013 Wednesday, March 13 \u2013 saw AAPL close at $171.13 after falling 1.21%.
