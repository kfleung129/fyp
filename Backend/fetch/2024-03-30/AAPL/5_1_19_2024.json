In fiscal 2023, which ended September 30, the company spend $29.9 billion on research and development, bringing its R&D intensity, i.e. R&D spending as a percentage of sales, to levels last seen before the iPhone launch in the early 2000s. Since fiscal 2020, Apple's research and development spending has increased by more than $10 billion, as work on the company's supposedly groundbreaking XR headset and its transition to Apple silicon took up a lot of capital.When asked about the steep increase in R&D spending over the past two years, Apple CEO Tim Cook put it down to \"a number of things\": things he couldn't talk about, the Vision Pro, AI, machine learning and investments in Apple silicon. He also pointed out that Apple's R&D expenditure was \"very competitive\" compared to others, while CFO Luca Maestri added that the company's aggressive R&D spending is one of the drivers behind its gross margin expansion, meaning that it partly pays for itself, so to speak.
