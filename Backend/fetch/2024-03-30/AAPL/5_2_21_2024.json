    "text": "Apple will roll out an iMessage update guarding against future hacking threats through quantum computing, the company announced Wednesday, following warnings by government agencies and tech executives suggesting protections are needed to guard against threats from advanced computers. TKTK The update\u2014which will be applied to all iPhones this year\u2014includes a new encryption standard for iMessage that will periodically reissue encryption keys to the app, making it harder for hackers to gain access, Apple said. Current encryption standards could be attacked using a \u201csufficiently powerful quantum computer\u201d and hackers who have collected \u201clarge amounts of today\u2019s encrypted data\u201d for reference, according to Apple. Apple said it hasn\u2019t identified any evidence of a successful attack on the new encryption standard, which the company calls PQ3, though it noted quantum computers capable of cracking the old standard \u201cdon\u2019t exist yet.\u201d Apple\u2019s new security protocols \u201csurpass those in all other widely deployed messaging apps\u201d like Signal, an encrypted messaging service, the company said. Similar protections for other Apple products are being developed, including iCloud, according to the company. Chinese government officials claimed last month a Beijing-based forensic lab managed to crack Apple\u2019s encryption for AirDrop. China\u2019s Judicial Bureau said the lab analyzed encrypted logs on a recipient\u2019s iPhone and created a tool that could decipher the AirDrop sender\u2019s phone numbers and emails. The tool helped police \u201cidentify suspects\u201d who were using AirDrop for \u201cmalicious purposes,\u201d like sending \u201cillegal pictures, videos, audio\u201d while \u201cillegally delivering and spreading bad information to nearby people in crowded places such as subways, buses and shopping malls.\u201d It was not immediately clear whether any arrests were made because of the breakthrough. A bill calling for cybersecurity standards protecting against possible threats from quantum computers\u2014capable of solving complex problems faster than classic computers\u2014was announced in 2022. The National Institute of Standards and Technology and Homeland Security subsequently released new standards for cybersecurity, indicating quantum computers pose risks while working at \u201cunprecedented speed and power in computing.\u201d Separately, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency warned against potential threats from quantum computing and said \u201cearly planning is necessary.\u201d Ana Paula Assis, a general manager for IBM, suggested last month quantum computing would create a \u201ccybersecurity armageddon,\u201d according to Bloomberg. Most companies don\u2019t have a roadmap for protecting against hacking threats posed by AI or quantum computers, according to SandboxAQ CEO Jack Hidary, who claimed banks could need eight to 10 years to implement proper standards.
