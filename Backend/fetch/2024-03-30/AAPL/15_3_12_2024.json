Learn more The Apple Watch is one of the\u00a0best fitness trackers, so you'll want to outfit it with a strap designed specifically for working out. Regardless of how you stay active, wearing one of the best Apple Watch bands for working out is a great way to maximize your exercise time. Some of our favorites include the Apple Sport Band. It has a comfortable design, comes in several color options, and has an easy-to-use clasp. We also like the Otterbox Terrus Band. It's comfortable against the skin, durable, and made from recycled materials. Below are the best Apple Watch bands for working out. Although they're intended for the Series 9, SE, and Ultra 2, many also work with older models as far back as the first Apple Watch. It's smart to double-check the sizing of the band and your watch before purchasing, though. To see more of the best Apple Watch bands, check out our picks of the\u00a0best metal Apple Watch bands\u00a0and the\u00a0best designer Apple Watch bands. This mostly comes down to personal preference, as some folks may prefer to wear a rubber strap while others may like the look and feel of woven nylon. Deciding between the two comes down to which one you feel is more comfortable against your skin while wearing it normally and while working out. It's worth noting that a rubber strap may be a bit easier to clean as it won't need as much time to dry off as a nylon band would. While this is subjective based on personal preference and comfort, some Apple Watch sport bands are better than others for running, particularly those made of rubber with a design that promotes airflow. For instance, the Nike Sport Band features a perforated design that helps keep the watch lightweight and breathable, two things that are vital to runners (especially those covering long distances). Not necessarily. So long as the third-party option comes from a reputable brand like Nike, Nomad, Otterbox, or others. Apple-branded sports bands are premium bands, but they aren't the only option you have when picking out one of the best Apple Watch bands for working out. The best materials to look for when shopping for an Apple Watch band for working out are either rubber (sometimes referred to as fluoroelastomer) or woven nylon. Almost all sports bands you'll come across feature one of these materials and the reason is that these are both highly durable, lightweight, comfortable, and (mostly) breathable. They also tend to be easy to clean. While you don't need to wash your Apple Watch band after every workout, wipe any excess sweat off of it when you're done exercising. This means physically taking off the watch and wiping down the inside of the band and the watch itself. However, to ensure the long-term usability of the best Apple Watch bands for working out, you\u00a0should clean them often. This helps preserve its durability and also helps prevent bacteria from forming, which can potentially irritate your skin. If you do start to see any irritation or a rash forming, take your watch off, wash the band, and let the irritation heal before putting it back on. Yes, you absolutely can. Apple Watch sports bands aren't strictly for working out, especially if you want them to give off a sporty everyday look. They're stylish in their own way and don't need to be reserved for going on a run or lifting weights. No, many Apple Watch bands are only compatible with certain Apple Watch models, so it's important to check the sizing of both the band and your Apple Watch to ensure a proper fit. For instance, bands that fit the smaller Apple Watch Series 9 may not work for the Apple Watch Ultra 2, and vice versa.
