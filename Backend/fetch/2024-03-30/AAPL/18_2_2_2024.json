Most of Wall Street is scrambling today as narratives and stock prices shift within the \u201cMagnificent 7.\u201d Consensus may have been caught off guard, but this week\u2019s earnings reports confirmed our analysts\u2019 long and short calls. Amazon\u00a0(AMZN), a Hedgeye Retail \u201cBest Idea\u201d Long call, was\u00a0up over 7% today\u00a0while\u00a0Apple\u00a0(AAPL),\u00a0our\u00a0Global Tech\u00a0research team\u2019s\u00a0top short idea, was\u00a0down.\u201cWe said a couple quarters ago, when the stock was closer to $100, it would test new all-time highs,\u201d\u00a0Retail analyst\u00a0Brian McGough\u00a0said of Amazon, which saw its stock price surpass $170 today. \u201cThe print was great, which was what we expected,\u201d\u00a0Retail analyst\u00a0Jeremy McLean\u00a0added. \u201cWe thought the numbers would look really good. Upward revisions continue to happen. We\u2019ve seen three quarters now of really good accelerating trends and upside to numbers.\u201d Few analysts are bearish on Apple. Those who are believe the tech giant\u2019s problems are limited to China.\u00a0Our analyst\u00a0Felix Wang\u00a0has repeatedly said that\u2019s not the case, and last night\u2019s earnings call proved that to be true. \u201cBulls will point to the fact that Apple returned to growth 2% growth. Oh my God, 2% growth. Apple should be surging, right? Not so fast,\u201d Wang explained. \u201cOnly one segment showed growth in the December quarter, and that was the iPhone, but that was because they were comping a 9% decline from a year ago.\u201d\u201cChina gets all the blame from analysts when you talk to them about Apple, but it\u2019s not just a China problem. This is so important to my short thesis. If you really dig into their earnings statements, there were multiple red flags, which I wrote to clients last night.\u201d To stay informed of our analysts\u2019 long and short calls on the Magnificent 7 and other companies, subscribe to\u00a0Retail Pro\u00a0and\u00a0Tech Pro.
