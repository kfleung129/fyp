    "text": "By Dade Hayes Business Editor Powered by its artificial intelligence assets, Microsoft has leapfrogged Apple to become the most valuable public company. According to Bloomberg, Microsoft\u2019s market value finished the week at $2.88 trillion, compared with Apple\u2019s $2.86 trillion. Over the past year, Microsoft has added about $1 trillion in value, as fascination with generative AI (a major point of contention in Hollywood\u2019s dual strikes) increased. Shares in Microsoft finished Friday\u2019s trading at $388.47, up 1% and near an all-time high. Apple\u2019s stock has also been within range of record territory, though it closed the day up only a fraction at $185.92.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRelated Stories\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tNews\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tVP Kamala Harris Unveils \"Safe, Secure & Responsible\" AI Guidelines For Federal Agencies\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tCasting\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJohn Leguizamo Joins Taron Egerton In Apple Drama Series 'Firebug'; Kari Skogland To Direct & EP OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, is partly owned by Microsoft. The tech giant invested $10 billion in it last year, making a claim on a large chunk of the profits made by its for-profit arm. The market has been in a frenzy over AI stocks, causing shares in chipmaker Nvidia to triple in 2023 because the company was seen as an avenue for investors looking to take part in the AI revolution. In addition to its stake in ChatGPT, Microsoft has built out its own AI infrastructure and made investments in the space via M12, its 7-year-old investment firm. \u201cWe were already looking for uses of generative AI before the whole thing exploded,\u201d\u00a0M12 partner Michael Stewart told Crunchbase News. AI is viewed on Wall Street as a way for Microsoft to close the longtime gap with Google in search revenue. The former took in about $3.2 billion in search revenue in 2023, compared with $43 billion for the latter. Apple, by contrast with Microsoft, does not have a fully developed presence in AI. Its shares have also drifted down about 4% in recent weeks on concerns about its fourth-quarter results and potential softness in its flagship iPhone, which accounts for more than half of company revenue.
