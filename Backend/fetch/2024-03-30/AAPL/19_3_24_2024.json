The company bought DarwinAI earlier this year and the firm\u2019s employees have joined the iPhone maker\u2019s AI division, Bloomberg reported citing \u201cpeople with knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be identified because the deal hasn\u2019t been announced.\u201d DarwinAI makes technology that can \u201cinspect components during the manufacturing process\", the report said, adding that the company has also developed tech that can make AI systems smaller and faster. \u201cThat could be helpful to Apple, which is focused on running AI on devices rather than entirely in the cloud,\u201d it explained. Additionally, DarwinAI deal also gives Apple some very able staff to help develop AI as iOS 18 takes shape including Alexander Wong- \u201can AI researcher at the University of Waterloo who helped build the business\"- as per Bloomberg. Earlier Bloomberg Apple commentator Mark Gurman wrote in his Power On newsletter that iOS 18 is \u201cseen within the company as one of the biggest iOS updates\u2014if not the biggest\u2014in the company\u2019s history\" after Apple CEO Tim Cook recently told shareholders that the firm will \u201cbreak new ground\u201d in AI in 2024. With Apple\u2019s purchase of DarwinAI, iOS is going to be game-changing for iPhone. As privacy remains at the core of Apple, iOS 18 could have accompanying AI features to come with stringent controls that users can take advantage of.
