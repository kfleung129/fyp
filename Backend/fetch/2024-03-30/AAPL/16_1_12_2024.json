AFP Microsoft chairman and chief executive Satya Nadella speaks during CES 2024 in Las Vegas, Nevada. AFP Microsoft overtook Apple to become the world\u2019s most valuable publicly traded company for the first time in more than two years, as worries over smartphone demand have weighed on the iPhone maker\u2019s stock in recent weeks. The Redmond, Washington-based software company rose 1 per cent to $388.47 on Friday, ending with a market valuation of $2.89 trillion. Meanwhile, Apple gained 0.2 per cent and closed with a market capitalisation of $2.87 trillion. It is the first time since November 2021 that Microsoft has closed with a higher value than Apple. \u201cWhen you compare and contrast the two, the growth Apple is showing is nothing special, whereas Microsoft has done a better job of executing and demonstrating earnings growth,\u201d said David Katz, chief investment officer at Matrix Asset Advisors, which has positions in both. \u201cMicrosoft also has a much clearer road map with AI, and it has done a great job articulating how that will accelerate growth to make its long-term prospects even more compelling.\u201d While both were part of the so-called Magnificent 7\u2019s powerful rally in 2023, their fortunes have diverged this year. Microsoft has risen 3.3 per cent, supported by ongoing optimism over artificial intelligence, while Apple has dropped 3.4 per cent amid rising concerns over its growth. It has been hit by at least three analyst ratings downgrades, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Wall Street\u2019s less-favourable view on Apple suggests it would not be surprising if Microsoft maintained or even built on its newfound size advantage. The average analyst price target for Microsoft equates to upside of about 8 per cent over the coming 12 months, slightly above Apple\u2019s return potential. Such a gain would result in Microsoft topping $3 trillion in market valuation, joining Apple as one of only two companies to hit such a threshold. Microsoft and Apple remain the biggest weights in the S&P 500 by far, together accounting for roughly 14 per cent of the overall index. Few other companies approach them in size: oil giant Saudi Aramco\u2019s value sits at a little more than $2 trillion, while Alphabet, Amazon and Nvidia are all valued above $1 trillion. Meta Platforms, which jumped nearly 200 per cent last year, is the next closest, sitting right below the trillion-dollar threshold.
