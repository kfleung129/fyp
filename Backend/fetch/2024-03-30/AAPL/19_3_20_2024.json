The suit, filed Friday, claims \u201csurgical\u201d restraints prevent customers from effectively using any service except its iCloud storage system. iCloud is the only service that can host certain data from the company\u2019s phones, tablets and computers, including application data and device settings. Plaintiffs allege the practice has \u201cunlawfully \u2018tied\u2019\u201d the devices and iCloud together. \u201cApple\u2019s arbitrary prohibition on hosting Restricted Files fundamentally distorts the competitive landscape to privilege iCloud over all rivals,\u201d the suit reads. \u201cAs a result of this restraint, would-be cloud competitors are unable to offer Apple\u2019s device holders a full-service cloud-storage solution, or even a pale comparison.\u201d iCloud enjoys about 70 percent market share in cloud storage for Apple users, according to the suit. Plaintiffs also noted that the high market share has allowed prices to skyrocket, marking it \u201cundisciplined by competition.\u201d \u201cApple has marked up its iCloud prices to the point where the service is generating almost pure profit. Apple\u2019s ability to sustain these prices is a testament to its monopoly power,\u201d the suit said. The plaintiffs propose a class action suit with tens of millions of members, all iCloud platform users. The Hill has reached out to Apple for comment.
