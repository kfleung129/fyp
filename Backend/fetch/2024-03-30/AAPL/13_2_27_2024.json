What Happened: Ross Gerber, the CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management took to social media platform X on Wednesday to share his thoughts on Apple\u2019s recent move. Gerber expressed his relief at Apple finally admitting defeat in the EV race, while Ives acknowledged the changed landscape of the EV industry. Gerber opined on X that Apple had \u201cmissed their big opportunity to\u00a0invest in Tesla\u2026\u201d He further stated, \u201cAbout time they throw in\u00a0the towel on this mess.\u201d Apple has reportedly put the brakes on its EV project, codenamed Titan, and informed nearly 2,000 employees working on the project about this decision. The company plans to reassign many of these employees to its generative AI division, with layoffs expected but the exact number of affected workers still unclear. The decision to abandon the project was reportedly finalized internally among top executives in recent weeks, following ongoing pressure from the company\u2019s board.

Last month, Apple reportedly shifted to a less ambitious design for its EV, similar to Tesla\u2019s offerings. However, the project has now been scrapped entirely. However, with the decision to abandon the EV project, dubbed Titan, Apple is now focusing its efforts on generative AI. Given Gerber\u2019s recent bet on whether\u00a0Apple\u2019s Vision Pros would outperform Tesla\u2019s Cybertrucks, the recent developments have certainly added a new twist to the tale. Moreover, CNBC\u2019s Jim Cramer suggested that Alphabet should also follow Apple\u2019s lead and cut projects that are no longer effective. Cramer cited Apple\u2019s recent decision to cancel its electric car project as an example of \u201cembracing efficiency.\u201d Read Next:\u00a0Carvana Stock Trades Like \u2018An AI Darling,\u2019 Short Seller Says: But \u2018Paint Will Eventually Peel Off\u2019 Photo via Shutterstock Engineered by Benzinga Neuro, Edited by \nKaustubh Bagalkote The GPT-4-based Benzinga Neuro content generation system exploits the extensive Benzinga Ecosystem, including native data, APIs, and more to create comprehensive and timely stories for you.\n            Learn more. \u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.
