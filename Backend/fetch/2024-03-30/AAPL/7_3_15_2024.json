    "text": "Norfolk County Council has secured a settlement in a lawsuit against Apple, with the tech giant agreeing to pay 490 million dollars (\u00a3384 million) in a \u201ctremendous result\u201d. The lawsuit alleged Apple\u2019s chief executive Tim Cook misled investors about iPhone sales in China between November 2018 and January the following year. The preliminary settlement filed in the US District Court in Oakland, northern California, will need final approval from a judge at a further hearing. The class action \u2013 made on behalf of a group of claimants including investors in Apple \u2013 was led by Norfolk Council, which said its pension fund was affected by the company\u2019s alleged actions. A spokesperson for the Norfolk Pension Fund said: \u201cWe are proud of this recovery for investors. \u201cWe are mindful that we are stewards of pensions relied upon by thousands of families and individuals. \u201cWhen and where it\u2019s warranted, we will take decisive action to recover losses when our participants\u2019 investments are harmed by fraud.\u201d The Oakland court\u2019s judgment said: \u201cThe settlement is a tremendous result for the class.\u201d According to the document, Norfolk Council became the \u201clead plaintiff\u201d in June 2020 and alleged that Apple \u201cmade materially false and misleading statements and omissions about demand for the newly-released iPhones and Apple\u2019s business in China\u201d contrary to the Securities Exchange Act 1934. The complaint further alleged \u201cfalse and misleading statements and omissions\u201d caused Apple\u2019s stock to trade at \u201cartificially inflated prices\u201d before the stock price declined when the \u201ctrue facts\u201d were disclosed. Mr Cook indicated during an investor conference call in November 2018 that iPhone sales in China were performing well, according to the complaint. In January the following year, the chief executive warned Apple\u2019s revenue for the quarter would drop nine billion dollars (\u00a37.09 billion) below what was predicted \u2013 with almost all of the fall found to be down to poor demand in China. It led to the company\u2019s stock price diving 10% in the next day of frenetic trading and cut shareholder wealth by more than 70 billion dollars (\u00a355 billion). Apple denied Mr Cook deceived investors about the phone\u2019s sales in China in that period. \u201cDefendants (Apple) have expressly denied and continue to deny that they have violated the federal securities laws or any other laws, or have otherwise misled investors as alleged in this action,\u201d the Oakland judgment made clear. \u201cBut in recognition that further litigation will be protracted, overly burdensome, expensive and distracting have determined that it is desirable and beneficial for them to resolve the action.\u201d The parties accepted a mediator\u2019s proposal to settle on March 1. Norfolk Council will receive a portion of the settlement. Apple recorded 97 billion dollars (\u00a376 billion) in profit in its last fiscal year. The 490 million-dollar payment is less than 1% of that figure. Apple has been approached for comment.
