What Happened: On Tuesday, Apple announced that its annual developers conference, WWDC 2024, will be held from June 10 to June 14 this year. The conference will be streamed live on Apple\u2019s website. However, the tech giant has extended invitations to select software developers to attend a celebratory event in person on the first day. Mark your calendars for #WWDC24, June 10-14. It's going to be Absolutely Incredible! pic.twitter.com/YIln5972ZD After this announcement, Munster took to X, formerly Twitter, and said that he believes this event will mark the launch of Apple\u2019s generative AI strategy. \u201c$AAPL just put out their invite for WWDC, starting on June 10. While the press release made no mention of the topic, the event will likely be Apple's generative AI launch party,\u201d Munster said. Munster anticipates that Apple CEO\u00a0Tim Cook\u00a0will not delve into AI during the company\u2019s March quarter report; instead, he will direct investors to WWDC. He said that the event could feature Apple\u2019s most significant announcement since 2007, focusing on the evolution of their operating systems. Deepwater\u2019s managing partner also predicted that Cupertino will follow in the footsteps of\u00a0Microsoft Corporation\u00a0and\u00a0Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google\u00a0by integrating generative AI into its operating system interface.

He also predicted, \u201cI expect generative AI will be added into iMessage, Mail, Calendar, Notes, Pages, and Numbers,\u201d adding, \u201cAs for Siri, I'm optimistic that they will announce an AI powered version that will be available sometime in 2024. Currently, while Siri uses some AI for recommendations, it lacks a generative, conversational experience that catapulted Chat GPT into our lives.\u201d Subscribe to the\u00a0Benzinga Tech Trends newsletter\u00a0to get all the latest tech developments delivered to your inbox. $AAPL just put out their invite for WWDC, starting on June 10. While the press release made no mention of the topic, the event will likely be Apple's generative AI launch party. When Apple reports their Mar-24 quarter in late April, I don't expect Cook to say much on AI and... Why It Matters: Earlier this month, it was reported that Apple was in talks with\u00a0Google\u00a0to\u00a0license Gemini AI models\u00a0for future iPhones. Munster previously commented on the report, stating that this deal could position Apple as a leader in personalized AI. Last month, it was reported that the Cupertino, California-based tech giant has halted its pursuit of the Apple Car and ceased its Electric Vehicle (EV) development initiative known as Titan. According to sources, Apple plans to redirect numerous staff members from EV development to its generative AI division.
