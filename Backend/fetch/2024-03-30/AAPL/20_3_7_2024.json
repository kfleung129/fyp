    "text": "Apple\u2019s Epic ban \u2013 which saw the iPhone maker again terminate a developer account used by the games company \u2013 is being questioned by EU antitrust regulators. More details also emerged of follow-ups to Phil Schiller\u2019s demand for written assurances of good faith by both Epic CEO Tim Sweeney and Apple\u2019s lawyers \u2026 The drama continued when Epic opened a developer account through its Swedish subsidiary. At the time, it appeared as it all was forgiven \u2013 but it has since emerged that Apple wasn\u2019t actually aware the account had been opened. Epic Sweden just applied as if it were a new developer, and the automated system granted the account. Once senior Apple execs became aware of the account, they terminated it. Apple said that it has a good reason for terminating the account: Epic previously agreed to the App Store terms, and then blatantly broke that agreement. If the company had said no more than that, it would probably have been on safe ground \u2013 especially as it said it was willing to reconsider if Epic provided written assurances that it would stick to the terms this time around. But Phil Schiller said more than this. He specifically referenced a tweet by Tim Sweeney which was extremely critical of Apple. You have described our DMA compliance plan as \u201chot garbage,\u201d a \u201chorror show,\u201d and a \u201cdevious new instance of Malicious Compliance.\u201d And you have complained about what you called \u201cJunk Fees\u201d and \u201cApple taxes.\u201d While this was within the context of whether Epic could be trusted, this was perceived as saying that Epic had better not criticise Apple in public if it knew what was good for it. Apple Inc. will face questions from European Union regulators over accusations it barred Epic Games Inc. from opening its own app store for iPhone customers in Europe...  That isn't what Apple did. Epic not being able to open its own app store for iPhone customers in Europe is a consequence of not being able to secure a developer account. Bloomberg reports that regulators are questioning the basis of this decision. Apple Inc. will face questions from European Union regulators over accusations it barred Epic Games Inc. from opening its own app store for iPhone customers in Europe [\u2026] An EU commission spokesperson confirmed it had requested further explanations from Apple concerning its conduct with Epic\u2019s game developer account under the bloc\u2019s DMA. Key to this battle is that Schiller wanted Epic to provide a written assurance that the company would respect the new App Store terms. The Verge reports that Sweeney provided this assurance, but Apple rejected it. Sweeney responded the same day. \u201cEpic and its subsidiaries are acting in good faith and will comply with all terms of current and future agreements with Apple, and we\u2019ll be glad to provide Apple with any specific further assurances on the topic that you\u2019d like,\u201d Sweeney wrote [\u2026] Sweeney said that Epic received no communication from Apple between Schiller\u2019s email and the letter from Apple\u2019s lawyers and said that he\u2019d have been willing to provide \u201cany assurance they\u2019d like\u201d to abide by the contractual agreement. When asked whether Epic planned to abide by Apple\u2019s developer terms despite Sweeney\u2019s public criticism of its policies, Sweeney responded, \u201cYes, absolutely.\u201d Regulators will most likely write to Apple, requesting a detailed explanation of the company\u2019s decision, and the basis for it \u2013 as well as its conditions for reinstating the account. The most likely outcome is that Apple will allow Epic back, but likely on the very clear understanding that its account can and will be terminated again if the games company breaches the agreement.
