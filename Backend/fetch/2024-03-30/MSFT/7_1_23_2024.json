View more search results Discover how Microsoft's strategic focus on cloud services and AI technology has propelled a significant 20% increase in net income and an 18% rise in operating income in FY23 Q4. Microsoft Corp is scheduled to report its fiscal Q2 2024 results on Wednesday, 31 January at 5am (GMT+8), after the market closes. Wall Street's expectations for the upcoming results are as follows: Investors cheered Microsoft's first-quarter results, reported in late October, as it beat Wall Street's estimates and promised future product offerings infused with AI. \"With copilots, we are making the age of AI real for people and businesses everywhere,\" said Satya Nadella, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Microsoft. \"We are rapidly infusing AI across every layer of the tech stack and for every role and business process to drive productivity gains for our customers.\" Within the details, Microsoft reported the following highlights.  During Q1, Microsoft experienced a notable acceleration in its Azure cloud revenue growth, marking a significant shift after two years of slowing momentum. This uptick has captured the attention of analysts who anticipate a continuation of this trend in the upcoming Q2 Earnings Report. Additionally, there's a growing interest in the performance of the Microsoft 365 CoPilot AI add-on, which was launched last year and is available on a subscription basis. Despite its innovative approach, the add-on has so far received mixed reviews. Microsoft's recent completion of the $68.7 billion acquisition of video game publisher Activision Blizzard is set to influence Q2 earnings. This acquisition, finalised in mid-October, is expected to be a topic of discussion by Microsoft executives, particularly in regards to its impact on the financial guidance for Q3. Another point of interest is the management's perspective on the recent developments at OpenAI, along with their viewpoints on the current structure of the OpenAI board, which has been the subject of much discussion. Building on an almost 57% gain in 2023, Microsoft's share price has surged over 6% in the opening weeks of 2024, as investors began the new year with renewed enthusiasm for tech stocks that offer exposure to AI. The chart of Microsoft's share price is a textbook example of a market in an uptrend, putting in place a sequence of higher highs and higher lows punctuated by corrective and orderly pullbacks. The RSI is now pushing into overbought territory, which offers hope that a pullback may not be too far away, providing an opportunity to buy Microsoft shares at better levels. Near-term horizontal support comes in at $380/378 and below that at around $360, coming from July highs/ December lows. Medium-term support is strong in the $350/335 area, coming from the uptrend drawn from January 2023's $219.35 low and the 200-day moving average at $337.00. To note, a sustained break below $335 would negate the uptrend and warn that a deeper pullback is underway.
