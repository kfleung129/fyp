It is important for investors to look ahead and not in the rearview mirror. Consider continuing to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider a protection band consisting of cash or Treasury bills or short-term tactical trades as well as short to medium term hedges and short term hedges. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time. You can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges. The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive.\u00a0 If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges. It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash.\u00a0 When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks.\u00a0 High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market. Probability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time. Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of seven year duration or less.\u00a0Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time.
