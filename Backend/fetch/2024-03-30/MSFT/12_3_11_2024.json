    "text": "CBA will work more closely with Microsoft in the areas of generative AI and cyber security under an expanded partnership agreement. Group CIO and group executive of technology Gavin Munroe said that Microsoft engineers in Seattle \u201chad already started working with CBA on a set of experiments with real life use cases to improve our customers\u2019 experience.\u201d \u201cThrough our ongoing partnership, we\u2019ll be able to deliver technology that will allow customers to interact with CBA seamlessly and resolve queries faster than ever before,\u201d Munroe said. \u201cWe also see this as an opportunity to work together with leading global technology teams to ensure CBA\u2019s safety and security is constantly upgraded and improved, to keep pace with the evolving threat landscape.\u201d The expanded partnership appears to position Microsoft as underpinning a \u2018CommBank customer copilot\u2019 that Munroe first revealed plans for at the end of last year. At the time, it was unclear what technology foundation the copilot would use; the bank has an existing strategic partnership with H2O.ai, which underpins the vast majority of its GenAI use cases. CBA said today that copilots, built on Microsoft, would also be offered to staff. \u201c[We\u2019ll be] developing copilots to help team members use Generative AI to better respond to customer needs,\u201d the bank said. A significant part of the expanded partnership with Microsoft is cyber security focused. It will include more sharing of intelligence \u201cto enhance cyber security and developing tools for CBA business customers to help them better protect themselves\u201d, as well \u201cworking together to develop cyber skills capability to help Australia keep pace globally on artificial intelligence.\u201d The cyber security elements were reinforced by comments from Microsoft Australia and New Zealand managing director Steven Worrall. \u201cOur collaboration will also go beyond immediate business outcomes, addressing critical societal challenges through enhanced cyber security and sovereign capability development,\u201d Worrall said in a statement. \u201cTogether, we aim to not only enhance the security posture of CommBank and its customers but also increase Australia\u2019s resilience against evolving cyber threats.
