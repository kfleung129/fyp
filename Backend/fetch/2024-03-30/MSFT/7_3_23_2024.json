A top Republican lawmaker has urged President Biden\u2019s Commerce Department to probe whether Microsoft\u2019s business in China is a national security risk \u2013 after The Post highlighted growing fears on Capitol Hill that the Big Tech giant was getting too cozy with Beijing as it develops AI technology. A scathing letter by Rep. Pat Fallon of Texas sent on Feb. 12, which has not been previously reported, was addressed to Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo \u2013 one of several US officials whose emails were brazenly hacked after a China-based group breached their Microsoft Outlook accounts last year. Fallon cited The Post\u2019s report last December, in which US lawmakers warned Microsoft against working too closely with China. Executive Brad Smith had raised eyebrows by declaring Microsoft wanted to \u201cactively participate in the digital transformation of China\u2019s economy.\u201d \u201cWhat we seek to understand is if and how Microsoft\u2019s broad usage across the US federal government, close ties to [People\u2019s Republic of China]\u2019s government and compliance with intrusive PRC laws threatens US national and economic security,\u201d Fallon said in the letter. \u201cNo US company should be playing a role in supporting the Chinese government,\u201d the letter added. \u201cIt is critical that any such efforts be stopped, and that broader Chinese operations be carefully scrutinized. Microsoft has faced more calls to exit China \u2013 where it has about 10,000 workers and multiple research labs \u2013 as critics warn that the Chinese Communist Party will force companies to divulge sensitive data and trade secrets. Those fears helped drive passage of a House bill that would force Beijing-based ByteDance to sell TikTok within six months or face a US ban. Microsoft is a notable outlier compared to Big Tech rivals such as Google and Meta, which have pulled out of the country to avoid the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s censorship and tough scrutiny from US lawmakers. A Microsoft spokesperson said the company has \u201clong\u00a0provided\u00a0governments around the world ability to inspect limited portions of our source code to assure themselves it does not contain backdoors.\u201d \u201cThis is done only in controlled environments where the code cannot be recorded or extracted, and our source code is always maintained so that customer security does not depend on it staying secret,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cThis access is not a response to any law in China or elsewhere and is something we provide broadly except where prohibited by sanctions.\u201d Microsoft has a set policy for disclosing software vulnerabilities that is not tailored to a specific country. The company has \u201cnot otherwise provided China with access to our source code or any other information about vulnerabilities,\u201d the spokesperson added. Representatives for the Commerce Department did not return requests for comment. Fallon noted that Microsoft has maintained its \u201clongstanding business\u201d in China \u2013 and is subject to stringent local laws \u2013 even as it holds an \u201c85% share in the US government office productivity software market.\u201d \u201cIn order to comply with China\u2019s National Cybersecurity Law, Microsoft must provide the Chinese government with access to its source code,\u201d the congressman said. The Texas Republican pointed to the hack of Raimondo\u2019s email account while demanding answers on what the Commerce Department has done \u201cto reduce the reliance on Microsoft\u2019s software and cybersecurity capabilities which have created a single point of failure that can easily be breached.\u201d Fallon asked Raimondo to explain what steps the Commerce Department had taken to hold Microsoft accountable for the cybersecurity failure. The GOP lawmaker also demanded that Raimondo explain what export controls are in place for \u201ceffectively regulating Microsoft\u2019s operations\u201d in China to protect US interests. Fallon asked Raimondo to submit written responses to address his concerns. The congressman told The Post he has yet to receive a response. \u201cWith every new cyberattack on critical infrastructure, and every move to threaten its neighbors and our allies, there is no reason we should afford Communist China any further openings to weaken American national security,\u201d Fallon said in a statement on Friday. \u201cThis extends to American companies that operate within China as well. The United States needs assurances that we can counter asymmetrical threats, particularly in the realm of artificial intelligence.\u201d Stay up on the very latest with Evening Update.

Never miss a story. \u201cLast month, I raised this specific point in a letter to Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo, but have yet to receive a response,\u201d the statement continued. \u201cThis comes as my colleagues and I on the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability have begun our own initiative to review potential threat vulnerabilities within the federal government to the CCP.\u201d \u201cA proper response from Sec. Raimondo would make clear that the Biden Administration takes seriously an increasingly emboldened Communist China,\u201d Fallon added. As The Post reported, Smith\u2019s December trip appeared to directly contradict comments that Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella made just weeks earlier during a Nov. 15 appearance on CNBC. At the time, Nadella said Microsoft was \u201cmostly focused on the global market ex-China\u201d and downplayed the company\u2019s work with the Chinese government.\u201d Sen. Josh\u00a0Hawley (R-Mo.) said Microsoft should \u201cknow better\u201d and that Congress \u201cshould block partnerships like this,\u201d while Rep. Mike Gallagher (R-Wis.), chairman of the House Select Committee on China, warned Microsoft that the Chinese Communist Party \u201cwill use AI for evil techno-totalitarian purposes.\u201d Top Microsoft executives have reportedly debated shutting down the company\u2019s AI research lab in Beijing due to the mounting Congressional scrutiny, the New York Times reported in January.
