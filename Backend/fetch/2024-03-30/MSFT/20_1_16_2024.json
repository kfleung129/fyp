    "text": "Microsoft and Vodafone have launched a $1.5 billion payments and AI-focused collaboration. The partnership will see the companies employ Microsoft\u2019s generative artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance Vodafone\u2019s customer experience, Microsoft said in its announcement Tuesday (Jan. 16). The tech giant and the telecom will also build new digital and financial services for businesses, particularly small and mid-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Europe and Africa. That includes helping expand Vodafone\u2019s financial technology platform M-Pesa \u2014 already the largest such platform in Africa \u2014 by housing it on Microsoft\u2019s Azure and launching new cloud-native applications. \u201cThe companies are also launching a purpose-led program that seeks to enrich the lives of 100 million consumers and 1 million SMEs across the African continent,\u201d the announcement said. \u201cThe goal is to enhance digital literacy, skilling and youth outreach programs, as well as offer digital services to the underserved SME market. The partnership aims to boost financial services innovation, building a community of certified developers.\u201d As PYMNTS wrote last year, M-Pesa is considered one of the most successful mobile payment systems in Africa \u2014 if not the world \u2014 and has, since its debut in 2007, helped speed financial inclusion in the region. The platform, at the time, had more than 40 million active customers and over 500,000 merchants accepting M-Pesa in Kenya alone. Aside from the payments aspect, the Microsoft/Vodafone partnership will see the companies use Azure OpenAI to \u201cdeliver frictionless, real-time, proactive and hyper-personalized experiences\u201d for things like Vodafone\u2019s digital assistant TOBi. Microsoft says it also plans to invest in Vodafone\u2019s new, standalone Internet of Things (IoT)-managed connectivity platform, which connects 175 million devices and platforms around the world. Vodafone, meanwhile, will become part of the Azure ecosystem, making the IoT platform available to \u201ca vast developer and third-party community using open APIs.\u201d The collaboration is happening as Microsoft\u2019s investments in AI have helped put the company in the running for the world\u2019s largest in terms of market value. Last week, shares in Microsoft climbed to push its market value to $2.87 trillion, ahead of its long-time rival. \u201cMicrosoft has benefitted from investor enthusiasm in the rise of generative artificial intelligence (AI) technology in the wake of the rising popularity of AI chatbot ChatGPT,\u201d PYMNTS wrote last week. \u201cMicrosoft is the largest backer of OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT.\u201d  We\u2019re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.
