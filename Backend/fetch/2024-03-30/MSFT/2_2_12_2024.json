Read more Key notes Microsoft has had quite a busy past few months. Now, the Redmond tech giant has officially scored the highest market capitalization of any company \u2014 at least until the time of this writing. Satya Nadella\u2019s time took another triumphant week as it reached $3.125 trillion in market cap, according to recent data. The record was previously set by Apple, which reached $3.09 trillion last summer. On the other hand, the iPhone makers ended Friday with $2.916 trillion in market cap. The AI hype train has somewhat cemented Microsoft\u2019s name as the leading company in its development, resulting in a few impressive numbers over the past few months. \u201cBy infusing AI across every layer of our tech stack, we\u2019re winning new customers and helping drive new benefits and productivity gains across every sector,\u201d Nadella said back then. As revealed in the\u00a0recent financial reports\u00a0for the second quarter (Q2) of the fiscal year 2024, Microsoft\u2019s total revenue increased by 18% to $62 billion. The major growth was influenced mostly by Redmond\u2019s role in developing AI in Windows 11, like its Copilot assistant tool, as well as the successful, big-money\u00a0Activision acquisition\u00a0for its gaming department.
