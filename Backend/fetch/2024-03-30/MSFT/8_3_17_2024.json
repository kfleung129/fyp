Tech giant Microsoft told European antitrust regulators that rival Google has a competitive edge in generative artificial intelligence (AI) due to its trove of data and AI-optimized chips. Microsoft's comments were in response to a consultation launched by the European Commission in January on the level of competition between tech companies in generative AI. Generative AI tools like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini can produce human-like content in response to written prompts, but have triggered concerns about misinformation and intellectual property violations. \"Today, only one company \u2013 Google \u2013 is vertically integrated in a manner that provides it with strength and independence at every AI layer from chips to a thriving mobile app store.

New entrants and competitors of Google and Apple will not enjoy the same advantages.\" Google pushed back on Microsoft's report with a spokesperson telling Reuters that, \"We hope the Commission's study will shine a light on companies that don't offer the openness of Google Cloud or have a long history of locking-in customers \u2013 and who are bringing that same approach to AI services.\" WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?
