    "text": "By Steve Goldstein Terry Smith, the fund manager of the GBP23.7 billion ($30 billion) Fundsmith Equity Fund, is often called Britain's answer to Warren Buffett. He's coming off a year in which he underperformed his benchmark, the MSCI world index, which he attributed to weakness in Estee Lauder (EL), McCormick  (MKC) and Mettler-Toledo (MTD) among other holdings, though his annualized 15.3% return since 2010 is about 4 points ahead. In Smith's annual letter to investors, he said the stock market has decided that Nvidia  (NVDA) will be the winner in designing chips for artificial intelligence and that Microsoft  (MSFT) will be the winner as the provider of an AI model. \"If it can do so at this stage it would seem to me to be a break with tradition. Think back to some of the major technology developments of the past half century or so and the early leaders: Microchips: IntelInternet Service Providers: AOLMobile Phones: NokiaSearch Engines: YahooSmartphones: Research In Motion (Blackberry)Social Media: Myspace.\" Where are they now, he asks? (Intel is trying to re-establish itself; Apollo Global Management owns both AOL and Yahoo after both fell on hard times; Nokia and Research In Motion are both out of the phone business; and Myspace no longer exists.) It should be noted that Smith does hold Microsoft, which after Meta Platforms (META) was the second-best driver of performance for his fund. He said even if all of the so-called Magnificent Seven fitted the fund's investment criteria, he would not want to own all of them, owing to concentration risk. -Steve Goldstein This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.
