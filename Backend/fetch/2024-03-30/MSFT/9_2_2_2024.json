    "text": "By Steve Goldstein So, just how big are the so-called Magnificent Seven tech companies? At $12.5 trillion - and likely a whole lot more after Friday - the combined market capitalization of Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL) (GOOG), Amazon.com (AMZN), Nvidia  (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) is equal to the combined GDP of New York, Tokyo, London, Los Angeles, Paris, Seoul, Chicago, San Francisco, Osaka, Dallas and Shanghai, according to Bank of America calculations. Related: Meta just joined Nvidia and Microsoft in elite subset of the 'Magnificent Seven' It's, of course, worth adding the caveat that market cap and GDP really aren't meant to be directly compared, and so much of San Francisco's output is directly tied to the tech heavyweights that reside in and near the city, principally in Silicon Valley to its south. Bank of America strategists led by Michael Hartnett say that the Magnificent 7 accounted for 45% of the S&P 500's SPX return in January, and an even starker 71% excluding Tesla, which has struggled this year. Don't miss: Tesla's stock had its worst month in a year, but Cathie Wood's ETFs kept buying Harnett and team said the bond-yields-down-and-Nasdaq-up action in the fourth quarter has flipped to a Nasdaq-up-and-yields-up trend for the first weeks of 2024. They say that price action occurs either post-recession or in bubbles. They say an optimal strategy is a barbell of bubble stocks and very distressed assets, e.g. China or small caps.
