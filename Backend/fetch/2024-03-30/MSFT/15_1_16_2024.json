    "text": "(Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp. Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella said he doesn\u2019t want greater control over OpenAI as European and UK regulators consider probes of the deep ties between the two companies.

So I\u2019m comfortable. I have no issues with any structure.\u201d OpenAI CEO Sam Altman\u2019s ouster in November laid bare how inextricably linked Microsoft and his company have become. Nadella personally advocated for Altman\u2019s return and, at one point, offered him a job. Those ties, together with Microsoft\u2019s some $13 billion investment in the startup, have spurred antitrust reviews in both the UK and the European Union.

That\u2019s the core of making sure you have vibrant competition.\u201d Nadella said his company, which received a non-voting board observer role following Altman\u2019s return, isn\u2019t pushing for a seat on the board. The software giant, which is OpenAI\u2019s largest backer, has overhauled its entire product line around the technology that underlies ChatGPT, a product Nadella identified as the \u201cfirst AI product that we all could relate to.\u201d Yet, Nadella said Microsoft is not too dependent on OpenAI, noting that OpenAI relies on Microsoft for key parts of the technology it needs to create its products, and that Microsoft is also researching and developing its own AI programs apart from its partner. \u201cI feel very good about the construct we have,\u201d he said about the partnership. \u201cI feel at the same time very capable of controlling our own destiny.\u201d Read More: Davos Live: Zelenskiy to Meet With Dimon in Hunt for Cash As the use of AI evolves, it will enable new interfaces and new models for apps, Microsoft sees the opportunity to participate in hardware that takes advantage of the developments, he said. Though Microsoft last week passed Apple Inc. as the most valuable company by market capitalization, Nadella isn\u2019t overly impressed with the milestone, which he called a \u201clagging indicator.\u201d Read More: Microsoft Dethrones Apple as Most Valuable Stock in the World \u201cThe last thing you want to do is to fixate on the stock price, which we know means nothing in terms of what happens tomorrow, especially in our industry,\u201d he said. \u201cQuite frankly the problem, in some sense, is for all of us whether we can bet it all on what comes next.\u201d (Updates with details of antitrust investigations from first paragraph.)
