(Photo courtesy of WEDC) At the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp., CEO Missy Hughes looks back on 2023 as a significant year for the state\u2019s business community \u2014 at home and on the world stage. In a late December interview, Hughes rattled off some big hits for the state. One is the federal government greenlighting the next phase for an ambitious proposal to establish a biohealth tech hub in Wisconsin. Another is a new and promising future for the highly touted, perennially doubted Foxconn site in Southeastern Wisconsin. Hughes isn\u2019t shy in her enthusiasm for the biohealth tech hub and its focus on \u201cpersonalized medicine\u201d \u2014 tailoring diagnosis and treatment of illness to a patient\u2019s distinctive genetic characteristics. \u201cIt\u2019s going to transform health care,\u201d she declares. Doctors treating a patient with a tumor won\u2019t have to throw \u201cthe kitchen sink at this tumor,\u201d Hughes says. Instead, they\u2019ll be able \u201cto give the most effective treatment the most directly, with as little damage to the rest of the healthy body as possible and get you back to work, get you back to your family, as quickly as possible. It\u2019s really, honestly, going to be game-changing.\u201d The federal CHIPS and Science Act passed in 2022 authorized and provided funding for the tech hubs. But Hughes says the state was only able to take part because of groundwork laid well before by the participants. The biohealth tech hub project brings together faculty from the University of Wisconsin and Madison and Milwaukee technical colleges, health technology businesses, and economic and workforce development agencies. Universities conduct research, businesses develop technologies that make use of those findings and health care providers then put those technologies to the test. \u201cThat work is already happening,\u201d says Hughes. \u201cWith the designation of the tech hub, we\u2019re able to expand on that.\u201d It brings together \u201ca whole bunch of different skill sets that we already have in Wisconsin\u201d \u2014 artificial intelligence, research into gene functions, drug development and advanced manufacturing. Wisconsin\u2019s was one of 31 tech hub projects that the federal government designated in October for initial funding, with the prospect of larger federal investments to come. Just getting this far gives Wisconsin additional allure for everyone from academics looking to relocate to employers eying the state, Hughes says. In March, Microsoft announced a $1 billion investment to establish a data center on a 315-acre site in the Racine County village of Mount Pleasant \u2014 part of the land originally developed for Foxconn. In November Microsoft announced it was expanding its footprint there with the purchase of another 1,030 acres. The Foxconn project that began under previous administrations in Madison and Washington, D.C., and never approached the original promise sold in 2017 by then-Gov. Scott Walker and President Donald Trump: a $10 billion high-tech flat screen manufacturing complex employing 13,000 people. Critics were skeptical from the start, especially at the $3 billion in potential tax credits that the Legislature and Walker promised the company, and questioned the $700 million that Mount Pleasant spent on infrastructure development. Tony Evers ran for governor criticizing the project as a massive boondoggle. Foxconn\u2019s actual operational plans changed repeatedly, leading WEDC to disqualify the company\u2019s tax credit applications. Midway through Evers\u2019 first term, WEDC and Hughes renegotiated the tax credits, which for the first time enabled the company to actually qualify for them, but at much lower cost to the state than the original credits would have cost if the company had ever qualified for them. The April 2021 renegotiation was \u201cright-sizing for what Foxconn is prepared to do in the marketplace,\u201d Hughes says \u2014 putting it on the same level as other companies that WEDC has rewarded with tax credits for job creation. Having employed about 1,000 people over the course of its history in the state, \u201cit\u2019s a good company to have here in Wisconsin,\u201d she says of Foxconn. \u201cBut they\u2019re just like any of our other companies at this point.\u201d Reworking the deal was important to ensure an eventual return on the money sunk into developing the site. \u201cThe way that I looked at it was, it would be a shame for all of the infrastructure investment that happened to go to waste,\u201d Hughes recalls. And as it became clear that the company would only use about a third of the redeveloped land, WEDC \u201cvery aggressively went out \u2026 doing everything we could\u201d to market the remaining vacant land, Hughes says. Microsoft showed interest with a $500 million investment initially, later doubling that and then adding to it. \u201cWe were very involved with having conversations\u201d with the company, she says. Lawmakers and Evers included a sales tax exemption for data centers in the 2023-25 state budget \u2014 a further incentive for Microsoft. Milwaukee 7, the economic development organization that covers seven southeast Wisconsin counties, handled \u201cthe nitty gritty work of working through the new development agreement and the purchase and sale of the land with Microsoft and Foxconn, Hughes says. \u201cA blue-chip company like Microsoft is the best outcome that we could have hoped for, and worked for,\u201d she says. While working with large business enterprises occupies much of WEDC\u2019s agenda, the agency has continued to dig more deeply into small business support. Emblematic of that side of the operation is the Main Street Bounceback program, now completing its second year of providing expansion grants of up to $10,000 each to 9,500 small businesses around Wisconsin. Small business development is an important part of WEDC\u2019s mission, Hughes says, because small businesses such as retailers and service providers help bring character, life and value to the communities where they thrive. In Prairie du Chien, Main Street is bouncing back  \u201cHaving communities where folks want to live and go downtown and spend time with each other is incredibly important,\u201d Hughes says. \u201cAt WEDC we like to say we can walk and chew gum at the same time, so we can focus on our small businesses and our large businesses.\u201d The Bounceback program gave the participating businesses opportunities to expand, perhaps renovate or move into new space and to increase their value without owners having to drain their own savings. Small businesses \u201coften become large businesses if we give them enough support,\u201d she adds. \u201cSupporting small businesses, along with the tens of millions of dollars that we give to large businesses every year in the form of tax credits, is a way of evening things out.\u201d In the coming weeks, WEDC expects to announce the first investments to be made by the Wisconsin Investment Fund, a venture capital project. The Wisconsin Investment Fund is being seeded with a federal grant \u2014 $50 million from U.S. Treasury\u00a0 State Small Business Credit Initiative. The Evers administration had sought $75 million in the state budget for venture capital, but the budget committee\u2019s Republican majority removed that request. \u201cWe had a lot of conversations with the Legislature about how other Midwest states \u2014 Michigan, Minnesota \u2014 are really digging in and investing in economic development,\u201d Hughes says, \u201cand I would have liked to have seen more willingness to really invest and think about the future with regard to economic development from our Legislature.\u201d Nevertheless, she considers the investment fund one of WEDC\u2019s big priorities for the new year. \u201cAccess capital is going to be incredibly important \u2014 whether it\u2019s our small businesses, our mainstream businesses, but also our startups or entrepreneurs who need significant capital to bring their product to market, or to develop their software or their medical device,\u201d Hughes says. Hughes is also looking to other opportunities afforded by the federal government. The 2022 Inflation Reduction Act included a number of provisions aimed at addressing climate change, including funding for the state green innovation bank. \u201cThe governor has told WEDC we\u2019re responsible for that,\u201d Hughes says. Working with a commission that Evers established in June, WEDC will be looking at projects \u201call around the state that help businesses become more sustainable, Wisconsinites choose renewable energy.\u201d GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX There are also bank federal tax credits to reward cleaner energy choices in the legislation, and WEDC will dig into \u201chow can we help our communities and our businesses\u201d make use of those incentives, she adds. \u201cA lot of the recent federal funding is \u2018get it while you can and be first in line,\u2019\u201d says Hughes. \u201cWe want to make sure that for those opportunities, our businesses and our communities are up at the front of the line.\u201d Hughes says she\u2019s also been glad to have an opportunity in the last year \u201cto get back on the road and travel internationally,\u201d helping Wisconsin businesses make new connections around the world. \u201cI think it\u2019s incredibly important for Wisconsin businesses to realize that they\u2019re part of a global marketplace and that there are opportunities in Asia, there\u2019s opportunities in Africa, there\u2019s opportunities in Europe \u2014 and not only grabbing those opportunities, but also just having that understanding that there are markets to expand to and places to sell your goods that are different and interesting, and pursuing them,\u201d she says. Exports are increasing, Hughes observes \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s going to continue to create opportunities for Wisconsin businesses.\u201d by Erik Gunn, Wisconsin Examiner January 3, 2024 by Erik Gunn, Wisconsin Examiner January 3, 2024 At the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp., CEO Missy Hughes looks back on 2023 as a significant year for the state\u2019s business community \u2014 at home and on the world stage.
