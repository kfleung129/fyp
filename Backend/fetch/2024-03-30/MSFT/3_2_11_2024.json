IANS | February 11, 2024 8:45 am Microsoft.(Photo:Twitter) Microsoft ended the week with a market capitalisation of $3.125 trillion, the highest for any company ever, Barron\u2019s reported. The company\u2019s market value topped the previous record set by Apple, which reached $3.09 trillion in July. Apple ended Friday with a market cap of $2.916 trillion. Microsoft is also the first U.S. company to close with a market cap greater than $3.1 trillion, Barron\u2019s reported. Microsoft stock closed the week at $420.55. Over the past 12 months, its shares have soared 60 per cent, largely thanks to the enthusiasm about its artificial intelligence software.

In a setback for Microsoft-backed OpenAI, the US Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) has refused to allow the Sam Altman-run company to register the word GPT (generative pre-trained transformer) as a trademark. It means that these services will not face new obligations, including a requirement to offer interoperability with other messaging services.
