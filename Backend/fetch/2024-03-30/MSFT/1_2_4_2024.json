    "text": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2013 Satya Nadella, marking a decade as Microsoft CEO, led the company through a remarkable decade of growth, with its stock soaring over 1,000 per cent and achieving a market value of USD3 trillion. Since taking the helm in 2014, Nadella\u2019s strategic vision steered the slow-moving software giant towards a laser focus on cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AI), propelling Microsoft to new heights. This growth surpasses the broader S&P 500, with Microsoft\u2019s market value now exceeding that of any US publicly traded company, including its long-time rival, Apple. Nadella\u2019s transformative impact is widely recognised, with Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives stating, \u201cNadella\u2019s had the biggest transformation of a tech company potentially ever.\u201d Comparisons are drawn to Steve Jobs\u2019 turnaround of Apple with the iPhone, highlighting the magnitude of Microsoft\u2019s shift under Nadella\u2019s leadership. Shareholder wealth creation has been extraordinary, reaching USD2.8 trillion in the past decade. An investor who bought a USD10,000 stake in Microsoft at the time Nadella took over would now hold a stake worth about USD113,000. The transformation under Nadella was swift. He redirected resources towards building up the Azure cloud computing platform, a departure from the company\u2019s historical reliance on its flagship Windows operating system. Notably, he curtailed Microsoft\u2019s ill-fated attempts to catch up in the smartphone market, marked by the USD7.3 billion acquisition of Nokia\u2019s phone business under his predecessor, Steve Ballmer. However, the most significant changes were not just strategic but cultural. Nadella shifted Microsoft\u2019s internal dynamics from a brash and competitive environment to a more collaborative approach. His \u201clearn-it-all\u201d culture, in contrast to a traditional \u201cvery strong ego CEO,\u201d emphasises a measured approach to explaining future directions. Raimo Lenschow, a stock analyst at Barclays, notes that Nadella treats everyone with respect, fostering a more inclusive and collaborative company culture. Nadella\u2019s leadership style was evident even in casual encounters, such as his interest in a startup at CES. A small Michigan-based startup, showcasing its product Audio Radar for deaf and hard-of-hearing gamers, received a visit from Nadella. The founder, Tim Murphy, described Nadella as \u201cvery down to earth,\u201d showcasing genuine curiosity and engagement. Beyond business success, Nadella\u2019s commitment to accessibility in technology is deeply personal. Raised a son who was visually impaired, quadriplegic, and had cerebral palsy, Nadella has long prioritised making technology inclusive. His influence on Microsoft\u2019s emergence as an AI leader has been substantial, setting the agenda on how AI tools are used in work and society. The partnership with OpenAI, creator of ChatGPT, played a pivotal role in Microsoft\u2019s AI advancements. Historically, Microsoft might not have been the first choice for innovative startups, but Nadella secured OpenAI\u2019s commitment to Azure, providing a significant competitive advantage over Google and Amazon. Despite Nadella\u2019s success, his tenure has not been without challenges. Cybersecurity concerns persist, with Microsoft\u2019s tendency to prioritize convenience over security highlighted. Instances of successful compromises of Microsoft Office 365 have raised questions about the company\u2019s approach to safeguarding sensitive information. Additionally, ongoing antitrust scrutiny has resurfaced, putting Microsoft under the regulatory spotlight once again. Nadella\u2019s response to these challenges has been notable. He has called for a cyber Geneva Convention with Russia and China, emphasising the need for global collaboration in addressing cybersecurity threats. His confident testimony at a federal court hearing helped secure approval for Microsoft\u2019s purchase of video game giant Activision Blizzard. Looking ahead, Nadella, 56, appears poised to continue leading Microsoft through these challenges. Despite the complexities of the cybersecurity landscape and renewed antitrust scrutiny, his leadership role and enjoyment in navigating these \u201cvery, very, very interesting times\u201d signal a commitment to staying at the helm for a while, according to analyst Raimo Lenschow.
