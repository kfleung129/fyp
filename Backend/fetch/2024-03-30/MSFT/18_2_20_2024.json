    "text": "The Financial Express U.S. software giant Microsoft will expand its artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud infrastructure in Spain through an investment of $2.1 billion in the next two years, the company\u2019s Vice Chair and President Brad Smith said in a post on social media site X. The move comes on the heels of its announcement of a 3.2 billion euros ($3.45 billion) AI-focused investment in Germany, spanning the next two years. Microsoft did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for further details on the investment in Spain. \u201cOur investment is beyond just building data centers, it\u2019s a testament to our 37-year commitment to Spain, its security, and development and digital transformation of its government, businesses, and people,\u201d Smith said.
