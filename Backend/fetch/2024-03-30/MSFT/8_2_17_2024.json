    "text": "Microsoft has fixed a vulnerability in its Edge browser that was reportedly stealing Chrome tabs and data. The company issued a fix in the latest Microsoft Edge update, saying that Edge has a feature that provides an option to import browser data on each launch from other browsers with user consent. \u201cThis feature\u2019s state might not have been syncing and displaying correctly across multiple devices. This is fixed,\u201d said the company in its update. The fix means that the \u201csetting for controlling the automatic import of browsing data wasn\u2019t syncing and displaying correctly across devices,\u201d reports The Verge. Recently, Firefox browser developer Mozilla commissioned independent researchers and experts in harmful design to investigate Microsoft\u2019s tactics and the impact on consumers. They published a report detailing how Microsoft prevents effective browser choice on Windows. In the report, they documented how Microsoft places its own browser \u2014 Edge \u2014 at the center of its operating system and \u201cweaponises Windows\u2019 user interface design to undermine people selecting rival browsers,\u201d the report mentioned. \u201cThis kind of behaviour is particularly concerning for an independent browser like Firefox, which is reliant on the operating systems provided by companies who are also rival browser vendors,\u201d said Mozilla. Now, with the implementation of the Digital Markets Act (DMA) in the European Union, \u201cwe hope that the barriers to browser competition would be dismantled\u201d.
