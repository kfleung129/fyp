    "text": "The head of Microsoft\u2019s Bing search engine and ad business is reportedly leaving that role. Mikhail Parakhin\u2019s departure \u2014 the subject of a Monday (March 25) Bloomberg News report \u2014 comes a week after the tech giant appointed DeepMind co-founder Mustafa Suleyman to head up Microsoft\u2019s consumer artificial intelligence (AI) efforts, with Parakhin reporting to him. Parakhin, who had been chief executive for advertising and web services, will report to Chief Technology Officer Kevin Scott while seeking a new role, Microsoft told Bloomberg. However, the report notes that it\u2019s not clear whether Parakhin would exit the company or take on a new position inside Microsoft. Microsoft announced the hiring of Suleyman last week. He had been heading a startup known as Inflection, with most of that company\u2019s staff transferring over with him. Inflection developed the Pi chatbot, which was designed to mimic human conception of emotions and act as \u2014 to quote the company \u2014 as a \u201ckind and supportive companion.\u201d The Bloomberg report said the move underlined Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella\u2019s impatience with the company\u2019s AI project, citing two sources familiar with his thinking. In the last year, the company has integrated AI into projects like Windows, Office and the Bing search engine, and released digital assistants as part of its Copilot brand. Still, Bing trails Google in the search space, while other products are still works in progress, the report said. As covered here last week, Microsoft is among the \u201ctitans\u201d in the AI race, having invested $13 billion in OpenAI, recently valued at $80 billion. \u201cMicrosoft\u2019s hefty investment is one reason why OpenAI is now seen as so valuable,\u201d PYMNTS wrote. \u201cIn addition to OpenAI, Microsoft is investing $2.1 billion in another AI company, Mistral, based in France.\u201d Elsewhere in the AI space, PYMNTS recently examined the proposed deal between two other tech titans \u2014 Apple and Google \u2014 that would see the latter company integrate its Gemini AI engine into the iPhone. \u201cApple\u2019s largest moat, the App Store and Apple Services and their nearly 2 billion loyal and affluent customers, will lead to them investing in AI for developer tools for app development, app content, and a category that\u2019s eluded Apple forever, search,\u201d Michael Jaconi, CEO of the AI marketing tech company Button, said in an interview with PYMNTS. \u201cApple\u2019s $18 billion paycheck from Google is great, but no one monetizes AI search today, really, so why not own that future when so much of the current search market already starts with you.\u201d  We\u2019re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.
