Read more Key notes At Intel\u2019s first foundry event, Intel Foundry Direct Connect, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella confirmed that Microsoft will be using Intel\u2019s upcoming 18A process to manufacture one of its own chip design. The Intel\u00a018A process offers the foundry industry\u2019s first backside power solution. This innovative design optimizes power distribution,\u00a0resulting in potential performance and efficiency gains. Intel will use ASML\u2019s cutting-edge High-NA (High Numerical Aperture) Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography machines for manufacturing 18A chips.\u00a0High-NA EUV offers far greater resolution,\u00a0enabling the intricate patterning required at this microscopic scale. \u00a0Intel 18A introduces RibbonFET,\u00a0Intel\u2019s first new transistor architecture since their groundbreaking FinFETs over a decade ago.\u00a0RibbonFETs are a type of Gate-All-Around (GAA) transistor,\u00a0providing better performance and power efficiency compared to FinFETs. \u201cWe are in the midst of a very exciting platform shift that will fundamentally transform productivity for every individual organization and the entire industry,\u201d Nadella said. \u201cTo achieve this vision, we need a reliable supply of the most advanced, high-performance and high-quality semiconductors.\u00a0That\u2019s\u00a0why we are so excited to work with Intel Foundry, and why we have chosen a chip design that we plan to produce on Intel 18A process.\u201d Last year, Microsoft announced two in-house designed silicon chipsets, the Maia 100 AI Accelerator and the Cobalt 100 CPU. Since these chipsets are already under deployment, Microsoft may use Intel 18A process to manufacture successors to Maia 100 and Cobalt 100. Intel also confirmed that they are ready to manufacture ARM-based chip designs as part of its foundry business.
