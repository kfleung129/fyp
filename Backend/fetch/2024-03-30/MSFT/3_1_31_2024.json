Illustration by Leonardo Betti Follow these steps to help with your AI rollout Download the checklist IIf 2023 was all about AI\u2019s promise, 2024 will be all about the proof.f 2023 was all about AI\u2019s promise, 2024 will be all about the proof. Organizations that have embraced generative AI are already seeing the benefits. According to our latest Work Trend Index, 70 percent of Microsoft Copilot users said that, after just three months, they were more productive, and 68 percent said it improved the quality of their work. And the most efficient Copilot users? They saved more than 10 hours a month. But these productivity gains only come when companies take an intentional and programmatic approach to their rollout. \u201cBecoming an AI-powered organization doesn\u2019t happen with the flip of a switch,\u201d says Jared Spataro, Corporate Vice President of Modern Work and Business Applications at Microsoft. \u201cAI is unlike any technology we\u2019ve seen before, which means it requires a unique strategy to deploy and drive adoption. Organizations that take a thoughtful and deliberate approach are going to be the ones to reap the benefits of AI.\u201d Here are five steps to nail your AI rollout\u2014along with key lessons from companies leading the charge. Get your data house in order. What we\u2019ve learned\u00a0The magic of Copilot is its ability to reason over all the data and content in your organization\u2014enabling it to deliver personalized, relevant, and actionable responses. It automatically inherits your existing Microsoft 365 data and security permissions, which makes it essential to have solid content management practices and data governance in place before rollout begins. Futurist Amy Webb advises leaders to ask their teams: \u201cWhen was the last time you did a data audit?\u201d If you want a future where you can get the full value of AI, she says, you need to shore up your internal infrastructure. Are all your confidential files labeled accordingly? You\u2019ll want to make sure your data is labeled properly so only those who should have eyes on a file get access. What early adopters are getting right\u00a0In the highly regulated financial services industry, security is a top priority. \u201cWe wanted to find an AI solution that could provide us with great time-saving benefits without making us feel like we were placing ourselves at unnecessary risk,\u201d says Vicki Holman, a Collaboration Platform Owner at Hargreaves Lansdown, a UK-based financial services company. With Copilot for Microsoft 365, \u201cwe found a highly secure alternative to the AI solutions employees were using outside of our well-protected environment.\u201d Because Copilot automatically inherits an organization\u2019s security, compliance, and privacy policies for Microsoft 365, Holman and her colleagues felt confident that their new AI bet would safeguard their data. \u201cWe had peace of mind using Copilot because we\u2019ve already got our Microsoft 365 E5 licenses, and we are quite mature in terms of the security and compliance we already have in place.\u201d \u201cTo build an AI-powered organization, leaders need to help their teams embrace new mindsets and habits. Before starting any project, document, email, or presentation, first ask yourself: how can AI help me with this task?\u201d  Be intentional about your rollout. What we\u2019ve learned\u00a0\u00a0To maximize the return on your AI investment, you\u2019ll need to make sure that the first people who have access are the ones who will glean the most value. With Copilot, we\u2019ve found that a three-pronged approach is most effective: Give the technology to entire teams within a specific business function, like customer service or sales. That way, they can share insights and learn from one another\u2014multiplying the technology\u2019s impact. Allocate remaining seats to a variety of roles and levels, from senior leaders to IT admins to project managers. We recommend that most seats go to non-executive employees. Define clear objectives for how each team will use the new technology, such as \u201creducing ticket volume\u201d for customer service. This will help guide employees toward the most pressing business needs. What early adopters are getting right\u00a0Multinational technology company Lumen Technologies first gave Copilot to its customer service, sales, and customer experience teams. The customer service team is using AI to surface relevant policies, summarize tickets, and access step-by-step repair instructions from manuals, while the sales and customer experience teams are using it to enrich customer interactions with additional depth and context. \u201cOur people are seeing immediate productivity improvements with Copilot,\u201d CEO Kate Johnson says, which ultimately helps them better serve their customers and makes it easier to do business with them. Identify champions to lead the way. What we\u2019ve learned\u00a0AI advocates are internal influencers: they show off exactly how Copilot can help in their day-to-day work and get work friends and colleagues excited to try it themselves (no #promocode needed). Ask managers to identify one power user from their team to be a representative and empower these advocates to lead internal trainings\u2014like a Copilot 101 session for salespeople\u2014and create quick video demos that can spread organically throughout the company. Another idea, from Wharton professor and AI expert Ethan Mollick: \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019d be remiss as a leader of a large-scale Fortune 1000 company to take the top 20 percent most creative people in your company, require they all use AI for a week, and give a million-dollar prize to whoever comes up with the best way to automate parts of their job, all while promising you\u2019re not going to fire anyone as a result of this.\u201d Of course, that won\u2019t be feasible for many companies. Another way to get started: task your internal champions with filming short, social media\u2013style videos of their favorite ways to use AI in their work and share them with your people in regular email or Teams dispatches. What early adopters are getting right\u00a0Our own early Copilot champions at Microsoft are discovering agile ways to share their skills\u2014and their passion\u2014across teams, quickly scaling AI habits and helping everyone learn. They\u2019ve led virtual demo workshops, Ask Me Anything sessions, and Copilot tips Teams channels where they share favorite prompts. One of the most impactful initiatives to date? Function-specific training sessions, where each champion led an interactive training geared toward the day-to-day work in, say, marketing. \u201cGrassroots champions have been a key to Copilot adoption,\u201d says Daniel Vargas, a Senior Director of Product Marketing\u2014and unofficial Copilot ambassador\u2014at Microsoft. \u201cWhen people embed AI into their daily work and share the things they\u2019ve done with it, it helps others see the potential and inspires them to explore the technology for themselves.\u201d Prioritize skilling. What we\u2019ve learned\u00a0\u00a0Without ongoing training, AI won\u2019t make much of a difference to your bottom line. That\u2019s why it\u2019s vital to create\u2014and maintain\u2014virtual spaces for people to share tips, ask questions, and find resources. Organizations should encourage people to share their most powerful AI prompts with their teams, says A.J. Brush, a researcher on human-computer interaction and Partner Group Manager at Microsoft, who keeps a running list of her favorites that she gets from co-workers. (A good one she heard recently: \u201cGo through my flagged emails and rank the top five in importance.\u201d) Copilot Lab, our collection of prompt tips and prompt guidance, can help companies grow that muscle. What early adopters are getting right\u00a0To get the most out of Copilot, Morula Health, a small business that provides regulatory medical writing services to the healthcare industry, has been building out its very own prompt library. Sharing great prompts helps the team save time as they use Copilot to keep action items on track, write first drafts of blogs, and redact documents. That process, says Philip Burridge, Morula\u2019s Director of Operations and Strategy, \u201censures sustained high-quality output, allowing us to seamlessly integrate technology without compromising consistency.\u201d Help people build new work habits. What we\u2019ve learned\u00a0\u00a0To build an AI-powered organization, leaders need to help their teams embrace new mindsets and habits. Before starting any project, document, email, or presentation, first ask yourself: how can AI help me with this task? Working effectively with AI requires the ability to delegate, exercise good judgment, and apply subject-matter expertise\u2014in other words, you need to think like a manager. You\u2019ll also need to re-learn how to search. In our global survey of 18,100 people, respondents said they spend more time searching for information (27% of their day) than creating (24%), communicating (24%), or consuming it (25%). AI eases this pain by scanning your entire data universe\u2014emails, meetings, chats, documents, and more, plus the web\u2014to find what you\u2019re looking for. What early adopters are getting right In the Crop Science division of Bayer, a global enterprise with a focus on healthcare and agriculture, researchers and data scientists can use a few key phrases in Copilot in Teams to quickly locate studies and predictive models elsewhere in the company. Via a customized Teams plugin, Copilot not only calls up the relevant models, it identifies who is responsible for the research\u2014making it easier to connect with the expert source on a specific topic. In one instance, a researcher in the United States was working on a project that would require a significant amount of time to complete. By using Copilot to investigate other models being created at the company, the researcher identified a predictive model developed by a researcher in Germany, preventing a duplicate model from being developed. That saved two to three months of work\u2014and sped up the time it took to get a solution to farmers. And at global ad agency dentsu, Copilot has changed workflows entirely. \u201cBefore, we would sit with a client in a room for an ideation session, we would come up with ideas together, we\u2019d take that information, and days or weeks later we\u2019d come back with creative visualizations of these ideas,\u201d says James Thomas, Dentsu Creative\u2019s Global Head of Technology. \u201cWith Copilot, we\u2019ve already got visuals and draft ideas of what things could look like with the client in the room, which means we can get to the right idea faster.\u201d AI can transform your organization, but only if you adopt it with intention and strategy. And while there\u2019s no one-size-fits-all approach to getting it right, these insights can help guide leaders who want to get the most out of their AI investment.
