Read more Key notes Microsoft\u00a0announced today\u00a0the availability of a free and straightforward migration for Surface Hub 2S devices to Microsoft Teams Rooms on Windows. Initially launched back in 2019, this brings the latest collaboration features and functionalities enjoyed by recently-launched Surface Hub 3 users to the previous generation device. Since Surface Hub 2S now runs the same Teams Rooms on the Windows software platform as Surface Hub 3, you can download the Migration Launcher app from the Microsoft Store. The migration is designed for both small businesses and large enterprises, with options for manual and remote deployment using Microsoft Intune. You can also choose to migrate now to experience the Teams Rooms features or wait for future support of Windows Autopilot and Auto-login of Teams Rooms for a fully automated end-to-end transition. But it still comes with a few limitations. While migration does bring software upgrades, some advanced features like Smart Rotation and Intelligent Audio are exclusive to Surface Hub 3 hardware. First-generation Surface Hubs and Surface Hub 2S devices running Windows 10/11 Pro or Enterprise are also not eligible for this migration. Surface Hub 3, which was\u00a0launched back in September\u00a0last year during the Surface event, comes in 50-inch and 85-inch variants. It\u2019s well powered by AI: you get tools like Cloud IntelliFrame and Copilot in Whiteboard, besides Smart AV, Smart Rotation, and more.
