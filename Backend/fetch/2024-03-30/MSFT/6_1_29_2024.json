    "text": "  In a transformative decade under Satya Nadella, Microsoft\u2019s ascent to the $3 trillion club reflects a remarkable turnaround. From a humble iPad encounter to now challenging Apple, Nadella\u2019s strategic shift prioritised flexibility, embracing a software-as-a-service model. Diversifying beyond Windows, Microsoft\u2019s revenue is spread across Azure, Office 365, Xbox, LinkedIn, and AI. Breaking free from the Windows-centric approach has allowed Microsoft to explore diverse technologies, making it a true \u201cjack of all trades,\u201d proving the adage: \u201cA jack of all trades is a master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of one.\u201d Sign up for your early morning brew of the BizNews Insider to keep you up to speed with the content that matters.

It was summer 2015, and he was just over a year into his role as Microsoft Inc.\u2019s chief executive officer, and the value of the company that day stood at about $370 billion. ___STEADY_PAYWALL___ \u201cIs that an iPad?\u201d he asked, on camera, as I pulled out the device so I could have my questions at hand. On reflection, it was really no big deal. But as a still somewhat junior reporter, I was worried I was rubbing his face in it. The success of the iPad had blown all of Microsoft\u2019s tablet efforts out of the water. And the iPhone, of course, had made mincemeat of Windows Phone. Nadella\u2019s predecessor, Steve Ballmer, had not been quick enough to grasp the mobile revolution \u2014 \u201cthere\u2019s no chance that the iPhone is going to get any significant market share,\u201d he said \u2014 and had left Microsoft weak. What a difference a decade of Nadella makes. This week, Microsoft\u00a0joined the $3 trillion\u00a0club \u2014 which so far has only two members, the other being Apple Inc., which first hit the milestone two years ago. The\u00a0two titans are very much toe-to-toe now \u2014 and products like the iPad, it turned out, were part of Microsoft\u2019s resurgence. Before becoming CEO, Nadella had risen through Microsoft\u2019s ranks to build its then-fledgling cloud business. It helped him see into the future. Once in the top job, rather than obsessing on protecting the lucrative Windows business at all costs, Nadella knew it was more important to let bygones be bygones and just put its products wherever it could, shifting to the software-as-a-service model \u2014 where revenue comes from recurring subscriptions \u2014 that would become the industry norm.\u00a0Nadella told me that day in 2015 that he didn\u2019t care what device people were using\u00a0or what operating system. As long as they were accessing Microsoft products somehow, that would be the way ahead. This freedom allowed Nadella to set about greatly diversifying Microsoft\u2019s business. Apple\u2019s reliance on a single popular device, the iPhone, is a persistent investor concern. The smartphone accounted for 52% of the company\u2019s total hardware sales in its\u00a0most recent\u00a0reported quarter, and Apple\u2019s Services segment \u2014 which includes things like the App Store, Apple Music and Apple Care \u2014 would suffer tremendously if iPhone use were to fall. Others in the so-called Magnificent Seven of tech stocks suffer from their own overreliances: 98.5% of Meta Platforms Inc.\u2019s revenue comes from selling targeted ads, while ads displayed on Google searches alone account\u00a0for 57% of Alphabet Inc.\u2019s. Nvidia Corp.\u2019s soaring valuation currently rests almost entirely on its ability to manufacture enough of its H100 GPU.

Office 365 made $13.1 billion; Windows $5.6 billion. LinkedIn, the professional network acquired by Nadella in 2016, brought in $3.9 billion. The company\u2019s Xbox gaming division brought in $3.9 billion \u2014 and will be greatly boosted by the completion of the $69 billion deal to acquire Activision Blizzard Inc., helping it regain ground in its rivalry against Sony, particularly as the video game\u00a0business switches to a more subscription-based model, just as software did. This all before the realization of the extreme potential of artificial intelligence, where Microsoft has a clear leadership position thanks to its $10 billion investment in OpenAI. Direct revenue might be slow in coming, and computing\u00a0costs will weigh heavy, but AI will boost just about every part of Microsoft\u2019s portfolio \u2014 and through its cloud business it stands to benefit when other companies turn to Microsoft for help utilizing AI, too. Releasing Microsoft from its Windows ball-and-chain has meant Nadella can afford to have a cloud business smaller than Amazon\u2019s, an advertising business smaller than Alphabet\u2019s and Meta\u2019s, and a hardware business certainly much smaller than Apple\u2019s. It means Microsoft can afford to experiment with wild new technologies \u2014\u00a0like its faltering HoloLens\u00a0\u2014 without investors piling on the pressure for it to be the company\u2019s grand vision of the future, like Apple\u2019s Vision Pro. Microsoft\u2019s $3 trillion valuation comes from being a jack of all trades, as they say, though many people neglect to use the full saying. \u201cA jack of all trades is a master of none,\u201d it goes, \u201cbut oftentimes better than a master of one.\u201d Read also: \u00a9\u00a02024\u00a0Bloomberg L.P.
