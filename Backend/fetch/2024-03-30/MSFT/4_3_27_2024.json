This change is expected to occur sometime later in 2024. [Update \u2013 March 2024]: WordPad will be removed from all editions of Windows starting in Windows 11, version 24H2, and Windows Server 2025.

For editing plain text files (.txt), Microsoft recommends using the built-in Notepad application. On the other hand, for editing rich text documents (.rtf), Microsoft suggests using the paid Microsoft Word application. A free web version of Microsoft Word is also available, but it requires a Microsoft account and internet access. WordPad will remain available on Windows 10 devices until the operating system reaches its end of support in October 2025. More\u00a0here.
