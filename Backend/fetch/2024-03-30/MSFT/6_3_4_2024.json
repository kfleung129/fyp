    "text": "Technology: Elon Musk is suing OpenAI, the makers of ChatGPT, arguing it has breached the principles he agreed to when he helped found it in 2015.  The lawsuit - which has also been filed against OpenAI boss Sam Altman - says the firm has departed from its original non-profit, open source mission.   It says instead of trying to \u201cbenefit humanity\u201d - as it was set up to do - it is focusing on \u201cmaximising profits\u201d for major investor Microsoft.  OpenAI has been approached for comment.  The firm was created with the intention of building what\u2019s known as artificial general intelligence (AGI) - AI that can perform any task a human being is capable of. It was also set up as a not-for-profit company, meaning it would not aim to make money.    The lawsuit, which has been filed in San Francisco, states it was under these conditions, that Mr Musk agreed to found OpenAI, along with Mr Altman and co-founder Greg Brockman.  He left three years later.  \u201cThis case is filed to compel OpenAI to adhere to the Founding Agreement and return to its mission to develop AGI for the benefit of humanity, not to personally benefit the individual Defendants and the largest technology company in the world,\u201d the lawsuit says.  The filing comes after the Wall Street Journal\u00a0reported\u00a0on Wednesday that US regulators had begun to probe the ChatGPT creator over whether investors had been misled, following boardroom drama at OpenAI in November 2023.   It saw Mr Altman\u00a0suddenly ousted from the board, before being reinstated at the helm several days later.  The board at the time accused Mr Altman of not being \u201cconsistently candid in his communications\u201d, and said as a result they had \u201clost confidence\u201d in his leadership.  It was a row Microsoft became deeply embroiled in - including\u00a0an offer to take on any staff\u00a0who quit OpenAI.  Mr Musk had said in a post on X - formerly Twitter - that he was \u201cvery worried\u201d by the situation.  His lawyers now say in this lawsuit that these \u201cstunning developments\u201d highlight Microsoft\u2019s increased influence over the company.  \u201cIts technology, including GPT-4, is closed-source primarily to serve the proprietary commercial interests of Microsoft,\u201d it says.  Microsoft\u2019s initial $1bn backing of OpenAI in 2019 came shortly after the AI firm - previously operating as a non-profit - announced a new \u201ccapped profit\u201d structure which would allow investment in it. Microsoft\u2019s investment swelled\u00a0to a multi-year, multi-billion partnership in January 2023\u00a0following the launch of OpenAI\u2019s chatbot, ChatGPT.
