Through collaboration with the Canadian financial services sector, this solution not only evaluates the impact of transition risk across various sectors of the economy, but also provides valuable insights to assist financial institutions in strategizing for client engagement initiatives and refining their decarbonization strategies based on scenario results. Consequently, federally regulated financial institutions in Canada can proactively comply with OSFI's B-15 guideline and disclosure deadlines while maturing climate scenario analysis capabilities internally.\"We recognize that operational readiness, resource constraints, and the evolving regulatory landscape pose significant challenges to the seamless execution of climate scenario analysis and stress testing programs,\" adds Katerina Kindyni, EY Canada Financial Institutions Sustainability Leader. \"This solution offers a centralized tool that enables FIs to efficiently identify, measure and monitor risks associated with the transition to a net-zero economy, while seamlessly integrating market intelligence into an organization's infrastructure.\"The solution covers three key areas: Loan portfolio assessment: Helps financial institutions evaluate the transition risk of their loan portfolio by leveraging a spectrum of Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) scenarios. It also performs sector-specific modeling of transition risk and estimates the financial impact across the balance sheet, as well as income and cash flow statement of counterparties. Risk assessment: The solution is configured with a climate risk management module that measures the impact on key risk metrics such as Probability of Default (PD), Rating Migrations (RM), and Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR). It also evaluates the impact of transition risk on the portfolio and provides valuable insights that inform overall decarbonization strategies and mitigation actions. Long-term growth enablement: Addresses an organization's core capacity and capability gaps from a continuous improvement perspective. This allows clients to identify themes, track progress against goals, and identify market opportunities, while minimizing downside risk from carbon intensive sectors. \"Microsoft is dedicated to promoting sustainability in financial services through our cloud, data, and AI solutions that address ESG priorities,\" says Jacqueline O'Flanagan, Microsoft Canada Financial Services Industry Lead. \"By joining forces with EY to address regulatory compliance needs, we're accelerating and magnifying our impact and commitment to advancing innovation in climate technology.\"EY and Microsoft spokespeople available for insights and commentary at Globe Forum 2024EY and Microsoft are attending Globe Forum 2024\u00a0to support their goal of uniting leaders and change-makers that are accelerating solutions for a regenerative, resilient, net-zero economy.
