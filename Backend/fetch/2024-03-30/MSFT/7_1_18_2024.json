What Happened:\u00a0Amid the market declines, Cramer discussed broader market themes that investors could reference on down days. Given the strength with which the Mag 7 came into the year, there might be concerns about whether these stocks can sustain their momentum, he\u00a0said\u00a0on CNBC. Cramer delved into which of these mega-cap techs could be the first to decline. \u201cTo me, it\u2019s looking a little like\u00a0Tesla, Inc.\u00a0TSLA would be the first to fall,\u201d Cramer said. \u201cWe have a CEO [who\u2019s] getting a little petulant\u2026again, talking about needing to control 25% to innovate.\u201d Cramer was referring to Tesla CEO\u00a0Elon Musk\u2018s recent post on X in which he said, \u201cI am uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in AI & robotics without having ~25% voting control. Enough to be influential, but not so much that I can\u2019t be overturned.\u201d \u201cUnless that is the case, I would prefer to build products outside of Tesla,\u201d he warned. To make his case, Cramer mentioned a hypothetical scenario of\u00a0Nvidia Corp.\u00a0NVDA CEO\u00a0Jensen Huang\u00a0coming out and saying he needs five times his current holdings if he were to make a \u201csuper-duper generative AI.\u201d Cramer is a big fan of Nvidia and its CEO, so much so that he has named his dog after the company. Why It\u2019s Important:\u00a0After a strong performance in 2023, tech stocks have had a rocky start to the new year. The weakness is primarily due to investors paring their Fed rate-cut bet, as they drew cues from hawkish comments from some central bank officials and a few strong economic readings received at the start of the year. Valuation concerns, especially after last year\u2019s heady gains, have kept investors at bay. That said, analysts are optimistic that improving AI use cases could benefit companies leveraged to the technology. Nvidia,\u00a0Microsoft Corp.\u00a0MSFT, and\u00a0Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\u00a0AMD are the AI stalwarts that have received love from analysts recently. Tesla, on the other hand, is stymied by fundamental issues such as slowing electric-vehicle adoption, which has prompted the company to cut prices to keep pushing volume. This, in turn, has impacted its bottom line even as the price cuts have not produced the desired effect. Delving into the relative under-ownership of Tesla stock by institutional investors, Future Fund\u2019s\u00a0Gary Black\u00a0listed several risk factors\u00a0keeping big investors away. More details on Tesla\u2019s near-term trajectory could come through from the company\u2019s fourth-quarter earnings report due Wednesday. In premarket trading on Thursday, Tesla rose 1.41% to $218.59, according to Benzinga Pro data. Check out more of Benzinga\u2019s Future Of Mobility coverage by\u00a0following this link.
