Read more Key notes Is Microsoft\u00a0getting greedy again? The Redmond company with OpenAI is apparently ready to spend crazy money on a data center with a supercomputer to train AI, calling it a \u201cStargate.\u201d The estimated cost of the whole thing? $100 billion. Yes, you\u2019ve read that right. It\u2019s billion with the B. According to this speculation, which was first exclusively reported by\u00a0The Information\u00a0on Friday, the supercomputer will have millions of specialized server chips and cost a hundred times more than many big data centers today. Executives over at Redmond see it as the first of several installations planned over the next six years. It\u2019s safe to say that Microsoft has somewhat been at the forefront of the AI war for quite some time. The OpenAI partnership, which cost them\u00a0billions of dollars, has been quite fruitful, despite plenty of AI models coming out recently from their competitors. Copilot\u2019s experiences with Windows 11 have also been the company\u2019s\u00a0major selling point\u00a0for a while now. Google, on the other hand, has Gemini, but even then, Microsoft and OpenAI seem to be\u00a0moving way too fast\u00a0with AI-related decisions, a drama months ago which led OAI\u2019s boss Sam Altman to get\u00a0fired and re-hired\u00a0in a span of days. But this supercomputer project won\u2019t be without controversies, especially from competition regulators to say the least. Just earlier this year, the European Commission said that it\u2019s\u00a0investigating\u00a0Microsoft\u2019s financial backing for OpenAI, which some view has given it an unfair advantage because it gives Microsoft closer, exclusive access to OpenAI\u2019s technology. Although, the $100 billion isn\u2019t specifically directed for OpenAI, but rather for Microsoft\u2019s AI efforts, including a new organization called Microsoft AI led by top AI talents. But still, this may possibly not be favorable for the Redmond tech giant in the eyes of its competitors.
