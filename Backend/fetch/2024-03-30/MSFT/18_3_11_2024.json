    "text": "EN EN Microsoft said it is investigating ongoing hacking attempts by Midnight Blizzard, a Moscow-sponsored group also known as Nobelium, which is using compromised data to further its attempts. Microsoft said a Moscow-sponsored hacker group \u201cexfiltrated some emails and attached documents\u201d and \u201caccess to some of the company\u2019s source code repositories and internal systems\u201d since November 2023, and it is now continuing to use that compromised information to further its hacking attempts. The company detected the attempts in January and identified the group as Midnight Blizzard, a Russian state-sponsored actor also known as Nobelium and Cozy Bear, who is known to be associated with Russia\u2019s Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) according to a Microsft cybersecurity report on Ukraine from June 2022. Microsoft also believed the attacks were aimed at understanding the company\u2019s level of knowledge about the group itself and not driven by commercial or financial motives.   Source: A slide taken from Microsoft\u2019s Defending Ukraine: Early Lessons from the Cyber War report. It is believed that Midnight Blizzard utilized password-spraying attacks, in which the same, commonly used passwords were used on multiple accounts in brute-force attacks. During last year\u2019s attempts, the group first compromised a dormant account, then it used the newly gained permissions to get ahold of \u201ca very small percentage of Microsoft corporate email accounts,\u201d including that of senior Microsoft personnel and employees in the cybersecurity, legal and other teams. It then extracted \u201csome emails and attached documents\u201d and \u201caccess to some of the company\u2019s source code repositories and internal systems,\u201d where it continued to use the compromised info to further its hacking efforts. \u201cIn recent weeks, we have seen evidence that Midnight Blizzard is using information initially exfiltrated from our corporate email systems to gain, or attempt to gain, unauthorized access. This has included access to some of the company\u2019s source code repositories and internal systems. \u201cIt is apparent that Midnight Blizzard is attempting to use secrets of different types it has found. Some of these secrets were shared between customers and Microsoft in email, and as we discover them in our exfiltrated email, we have been and are reaching out to these customers to assist them in taking mitigating measures,\u201d read the Microsoft blog post. The company added that it has \u201cfound no evidence\u201d that its customer-facing systems have been compromised.\u201d Microsoft also said it registered an increased volume of attacks by Midnight Blizzard \u201cby as much as 10-fold\u201d in February compared to the month prior, and the likely involvement of state actors such as Moscow has highlighted certain risks in the cybersecurity landscape. \u201cMidnight Blizzard\u2019s ongoing attack is characterized by a sustained, significant commitment of the threat actor\u2019s resources, coordination, and focus. It may be using the information it has obtained to accumulate a picture of areas to attack and enhance its ability to do so. \u201cThis reflects what has become more broadly an unprecedented global threat landscape, especially in terms of sophisticated nation-state attacks,\u201d read the blog post. The company said investigations are ongoing. Midnight Blizzard was also the group behind the 2020 SolarWinds hack, where multiple US federal agencies were compromised.
