Read more  One of Windows 10\u2019s most interesting and controversial new additions is a new torrent like delivery system. This system serves to allow\u00a0users to download an update- either a system update or an app update \u2013 and then \u201cshare\u201d parts of that update to other systems on their network. It is good for speeding up downloads and updates to PCs on your personal network, but there are concerns. Essentially, people are not necessarily happy to be using some of their data on metered systems or similarly capped internet to download updates for other PCs. Similarly, if one chooses to share to PCs on \u201cMy Network Only\u201d, this may be fine if you\u2019re at home and using your own data plan, but if one were to connect to a strangers network or a public area, the situation would be different. That is not to mention the privacy concerns this raises (legitimate or not) \u00a0it is understandable why some users would prefer to not have to deal with this at all.\nHere\u2019s how to turn off \u201cUpdates from more than one place\u201d Check this out.
