    "text": "Intel Corp has landed Microsoft Corp as a customer for its made-to-order chip business, marking a key win for an ambitious turnaround effort under chief executive officer Pat Gelsinger. Microsoft plans to use Intel\u2019s 18A manufacturing technology to make a forthcoming chip that the software maker designed in-house, the two companies said at an event on Wednesday. They did not identify the product, but Microsoft recently announced plans for two homegrown chips \u2014 a computer processor and an artificial intelligence (AI) accelerator. Photo: AP Intel has been seeking to prove it can compete in the foundry market, where companies produce custom chips for clients. It is a major shift for the semiconductor pioneer, which once had the world\u2019s most advanced chipmaking facilities and kept them to itself. These days, Intel is racing to catch up with companies such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (\u53f0\u7a4d\u96fb), which leads the foundry industry. Meanwhile, Microsoft is looking to secure a steady supply of semiconductors to power its data-center operations \u2014 especially as demand for AI grows. Designing its own chips also lets Microsoft fine-tune the products to its specific needs. \u201cWe need a reliable supply of the most advanced, high-performance and high-quality semiconductors,\u201d Microsoft chief executive officers Satya Nadella said in a statement. \u201cThat\u2019s why we are so excited to work with Intel.\u201d The broader industry has struggled to get enough advanced silicon \u2014 particularly Nvidia Corp\u2019s highly prized accelerator chips, which help develop chatbots and other AI services. For Intel, securing a large customer for its foundry business should help reassure investors that Gelsinger\u2019s comeback bid remains on track. His plan involves building out the chipmaker\u2019s factory operations to handle the increased load \u2014 a costly gamble \u2014 as well as restoring Intel\u2019s once-dominant technological prowess. The company is looking to governments in the US and Europe to help defray the costs, and seeing Microsoft on board might help that effort. Intel has held talks with the administration of US President Joe Biden to secure more than US$10 billion in subsidies under the Chips and Science Act, Bloomberg reported last week. Microsoft and cloud-computing rivals Amazon.com Inc and Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google are among the largest buyers of advanced chips, which they use to power their data centers. They have increasingly turned toward using their own designs \u2014 a trend that\u2019s hurt Intel in its most lucrative business. Acting as a foundry for Microsoft and others could help grab back at least a portion of that lost revenue. DECOUPLING?\n                                         In a sign of deeper US-China technology decoupling, Apple has held initial talks about using Baidu\u2019s generative AI technology in its iPhones, the Wall Street Journal said                                        China has introduced guidelines to phase out US microprocessors from Intel Corp and Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD) from government PCs and servers, the Financial Times reported yesterday.\r\nThe procurement guidance also seeks to sideline Microsoft Corp\u2019s Windows operating system and foreign-made database software in favor of domestic options, the report said.\r\nChinese officials have begun following the guidelines, which were unveiled in December last year, the report said. \r\nThey order government agencies above the township level to include criteria requiring \u201csafe and reliable\u201d processors and operating systems when making purchases, the newspaper said.\r\nThe US has been aiming to boost domestic semiconductor Nvidia Corp earned its US$2.2 trillion market cap by producing artificial intelligence (AI) chips that have become the lifeblood powering the new era of generative AI developers from start-ups to Microsoft Corp, OpenAI and Google parent Alphabet Inc.\r\nAlmost as important to its hardware is the company\u2019s nearly 20 years\u2019 worth of computer code, which helps make competition with the company nearly impossible. More than 4 million global developers rely on Nvidia\u2019s CUDA software platform to build AI and other apps.\r\nNow a coalition of tech companies that includes Qualcomm Inc, Google and Intel Corp plans to loosen Nvidia\u2019s chokehold by going OPENING ADDRESS: \n                                        The CEO is to give a speech on the future of high-performance computing and artificial intelligence at the trade show\u2019s opening on June 3, TAITRA said                                        Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD) chairperson and chief executive officer Lisa Su (\u8607\u59ff\u4e30) is to deliver the opening keynote speech at Computex Taipei this year, the event\u2019s organizer said in a statement yesterday.\r\nSu is to give a speech on the future of high-performance computing (HPC) in the artificial intelligence (AI) era to open Computex, one of the world\u2019s largest computer and technology trade events, at 9:30am on June 3, the Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA) said.\r\nSu is to explore how AMD and the company\u2019s strategic technology partners are pushing the limits of AI and HPC, from data centers to ENERGY IMPACT: \n                                        The electricity rate hike is expected to add about NT$4 billion to TSMC\u2019s electricity bill a year and cut its annual earnings per share by about NT$0.154                                        Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC, \u53f0\u7a4d\u96fb) has left its long-term gross margin target unchanged despite the government deciding on Friday to raise electricity rates.\r\nOne of the heaviest power consuming manufacturers in Taiwan, TSMC said it always respects the government\u2019s energy policy and would continue to operate its fabs by making efforts in energy conservation.\r\nThe chipmaker said it has left a long-term goal of more than 53 percent in gross margin unchanged.\r\nThe Ministry of Economic Affairs concluded a power rate evaluation meeting on Friday, announcing electricity tariffs would go up by 11 percent on average to about NT$3.4518 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) "
