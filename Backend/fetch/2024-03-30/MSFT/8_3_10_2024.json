    "text": "NewsNation Reuters (Reuters)\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Microsoft\u00a0MSFT.O\u00a0said on Friday that\u00a0hackers\u00a0linked to Russia\u2019s foreign intelligence were\u00a0trying\u00a0again to\u00a0break\u00a0into\u00a0its\u00a0systems, using data stolen from corporate emails in January to gain new access to the tech giant whose products are widely used across the U.S. national security establishment. The disclosure alarmed some analysts who cited concerns about safety of\u00a0systems\u00a0and services at\u00a0Microsoft, one of the world\u2019s largest software makers which provides digital services and infrastructure to the U.S. government. Analysts have expressed worries about national security risks.\u00a0Microsoft\u00a0has said a\u00a0Russian\u00a0state-sponsored group called Midnight Blizzard, or Nobelium, is behind the intrusions. The\u00a0Russian\u00a0embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment on\u00a0Microsoft\u2019s statement, and has also not responded to\u00a0Microsoft\u2019s previous statements about Midnight Blizzard activity. Microsoft\u00a0disclosed the breach in January, saying the\u00a0hackers\u00a0had tried\u00a0breaking into\u00a0corporate email accounts\u00a0including those of senior company leaders as well as cybersecurity, legal, and other functions. \u201cIn recent weeks, we have seen evidence that Midnight Blizzard is using information initially exfiltrated from our corporate email\u00a0systems\u00a0to gain, or attempt to gain, unauthorized access,\u201d the tech firm said in a new blog. Given\u00a0Microsoft\u2019s vast customer network, it is not surprising it is being targeted, said Jerome Segura, principal threat researcher at the cybersecurity firm Malwarebytes\u2019 Threatdown Labs. He added it was unnerving that the attack was\u00a0still\u00a0underway despite\u00a0Microsoft\u2019s efforts to thwart access. \u201cThat one of the largest software vendors is\u00a0itself kind of learning things as they go is a little bit scary,\u201d Segura said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have the reassurance that if you\u2019re a customer, that there isn\u2019t something bigger going on.\u201d The attacks are also a testament to how aggressive the\u00a0hackers\u00a0are, he added. Among the data the\u00a0hackers\u00a0stole was access to source code repositories and internal\u00a0systems,\u00a0Microsoft\u00a0said. The company owns GitHub, a public repository of software code for various applications, said Malwarebytes\u2019 Segura. \u201cThis is the kind of thing that we\u2019re really worried about,\u201d Segura said. \u201cThe attacker would want to use (Microsoft\u2019s) secrets to get into production environments, and then compromise software and put backdoors and things like that.\u201d Previously,\u00a0Microsoft\u00a0said the\u00a0hackers\u00a0had broken into staff emails by using a dormant account through a \u201cpassword spray\u201d attack \u2014\u00a0using\u00a0the same password on multiple accounts until they\u00a0break\u00a0into one. Such attacks increased as much as tenfold in Midnight Blizzard\u2019s latest attempts, compared the January breach,\u00a0Microsoft\u00a0said in\u00a0its\u00a0blog. \u201cThis seems like it\u2019s something very targeted, and if (the\u00a0hackers) are that deep inside\u00a0Microsoft, and\u00a0Microsoft\u00a0hasn\u2019t been able to get them out in two months, then there\u2019s a huge concern,\u201d said Adam Meyers, a senior vice president at the cybersecurity firm Crowdstrike, who tracks nation-state hacking. \u2018SECRETS OF DIFFERENT TYPES\u2019 Midnight Blizzard is known to target governments, diplomatic entities, and non-governmental organizations, according to various analysts who track the group. In\u00a0its\u00a0January statement\u00a0Microsoft\u00a0said Midnight Blizzard was probably targeting it because the company has done robust research unraveling the hacking group\u2019s operations. Microsoft\u2019s threat intelligence team has been investigating and sharing research on Nobelium since at least 2021, when the group was found to be behind the\u00a0SolarWinds cyberattack\u00a0that compromised a raft of U.S. government agencies. The persistent attempts to breach\u00a0Microsoft\u00a0are a sign of \u201csustained, significant commitment of the threat actor\u2019s resources, coordination, and focus,\u201d the company said on Friday. \u201cIt is apparent that Midnight Blizzard is attempting to use secrets of different types it has found,\u201d it added. \u201cSome of these secrets were shared between customers and\u00a0Microsoft\u00a0in email, and as we discover them in our exfiltrated email, we have been and are reaching out to these customers to assist them in taking mitigating measures.\u201d Microsoft\u00a0did not name affected customers.
