Read more Luckily, now there is a way to quickly and easily share your screen with Microsoft Teams during the call with just a single click. So, here\u2019s how to share your screen in Microsoft Teams from the Taskbar on Windows 11. As you can see, using this feature is incredibly simple and intuitive to use. If you want to disable this feature, just uncheck this checkbox and that\u2019s it. Keep in mind that this feature might not be available for you since Microsoft plans to release it for school and work users before making it available to the home users. More good news is the fact that this won\u2019t be limited Teams, because other communications applications can also use this new feature. There are multiple reasons for this issue, and in most cases, the problem is related to your network connection. To share screen you need a fast and reliable connection. Your screen resolution can also be a problem, and if you\u2019re using a 4K display, you might want to try switching to a lower resolution. Alternatively, you can also use a different screen-sharing software for Windows if Teams isn\u2019t working for you. This is a welcome feature, and it will allow all Teams users to share their screens more intuitively, with fewer clicks.
