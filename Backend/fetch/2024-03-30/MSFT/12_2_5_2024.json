To support their work, we need to ensure we meet their needs, honor their concerns, and set up the best possible environments for their success. In parts of Europe, our relationships with employees are governed by works councils, and they\u2019re key players in all new technology implementations. When we\u2019re adapting our solutions to highly regionalized regulatory standards, the best expertise comes from the people who live in those countries. \u201cMicrosoft is striving to be the most trustworthy company, and one part of that is about privacy and security,\u201d says Allan Hvass, director of Microsoft Digital Employee Experience (MDEE) for Western Europe. \u201cThere\u2019s local legislation and special interest groups, but another strong input is works councils in specific geographies.\u201d In the course of our partnerships with regional works councils, we\u2019ve learned some strategies for operating alongside these bodies on product rollouts. If you do business in a region where works councils are part of the regulatory landscape, you may want to consider these strategies for your own tech implementations. [See what we\u2019ve learned from deploying Microsoft Viva, Data and AI across Microsoft. Learn how Microsoft benefits from partnering with our works councils. See how our relationships with our works councils boost product and service rollouts.] In several European countries, employers may have to partner with works councils. That depends on several factors, including the size of the organization and other legal requirements. Works councils are collective bodies, primarily at a local level, that represent rank and file employees within an organization. In practice, employers may need to engage with works councils in multiple countries. If you have a widespread European employee base, you might have a relationship with several works councils, each representing workers in their home country. For example, Microsoft operates across the European Union, so we collaborate with representatives in several different countries like Austria, Belgium, Germany, France, and the Netherlands, just to name a few. While a union is typically an external body that governs an industry, sector, trade, or business, works councils sit within the employer. They generally consist of employees elected from the company\u2019s workforce. Those employees can be devoted to their works council roles either full-time or part-time. Works councils might play a role in day-to-day operations, and you may need their input or approval for any changes that impact the work environment. In some countries, works councils\u2019 purview extends beyond consultation and into co-determination, which means that companies need to obtain a works council\u2019s agreement before moving ahead with an initiative. Their authority and responsibilities vary from country to country, but the core mission remains the same: representing and protecting employees. Of course, you should consult with your own legal counsel to understand your obligations to any works councils within your organization, since they vary country-by-country. This article highlights Microsoft\u2019s experience with our own works councils, and it isn\u2019t intended to provide legal advice. Works councils can be responsible for a wide range of concerns depending on local laws and prior agreements their organizations have made. Typically, they have purview over topics like workplace health and safety, pay and benefits, hiring, business reorganizations, training, and more. In the context of technology implementations, they often take a keen interest in products, tools, and features that organizations might use to monitor or influence employee performance or behavior. As a result, you may need to consult with your works council before deploying certain kinds of tools and software in your organization. For example, Microsoft Viva Sales for Microsoft Teams is currently under review by our works councils across Europe. Its AI-powered conversation-tracking features demand careful consideration. One core principle of partnering with works councils is being aware of the kind of information they need and what sort of questions they\u2019ll typically have. \u2014 Alexandra Jones, senior business program and change manager, Employee Experience Success \u201cIn Viva Sales, we have a feature that we call Sales Conversation Intelligence, which is basically an AI-driven assistant that sits in the background of a meeting and pulls out action items, sentiment analysis, and statistics that can help a salesperson have more productive calls with customers,\u201d says Aaron Bjork, partner director of product management for Dynamics 365, CRM, and Viva Sales. \u201cBut within that feature set, we\u2019re recording the call and creating a transcript, and those features need to follow certain additional guidelines depending on the works council we\u2019re partnering with.\u201d Initiating a consultation with a works council typically involves three steps: A strong relationship with works councils is a powerful asset because it builds a foundation of understanding between product teams, employees, and the HR and technical staff who liaise between them. \u201cOne core principle of partnering with works councils is being aware of the kind of information they need and what sort of questions they\u2019ll typically have,\u201d says Alexandra Jones, senior business program and change manager for Microsoft\u2019s global Employee Experience Success team. \u201cThat helps us anticipate those questions and provide that information up front without waiting to be asked.\u201d Before you engage a works council, a good first step is reaching out to your HR, privacy, and legal teams. They may help you head off any unforeseen blockers before they become an issue. In some cases, works councils actually require a privacy or GDPR review as part of their process, so privacy and legal professionals are essential partners. What we\u2019ve learned is that the more proactive we are, the more prepared we are for these conversations, and the more we do up front, the better. \u2014 Aaron Bjork, partner director of product management, Dynamics 365 CRM and Viva Sales Organizations usually want to implement their technology as quickly as possible. To make that happen, it\u2019s important to engage with a works council early in the process. Review and approval may take anywhere from several weeks to several months depending on the nature of the technology\u2019s features, the works council\u2019s existing docket, and even the time of year. \u201cIf you\u2019re reactive in your approach, this takes longer,\u201d Bjork says. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve learned is that the more proactive we are, the more prepared we are for these conversations, and the more we do up front, the better.\u201d At Microsoft, we\u2019ve been evolving a replicable and efficient process for getting new solutions and features approved. Seek approval from global HR. Confirm that the technology only interacts with employees\u2019 information in a limited, private capacity, it complies with General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR), and its data won\u2019t play into performance assessment or influencing behavior. Once global HR clears a solution, it\u2019s time to zoom in on countries with works councils. This involves identifying the local HR representatives that engage with each country\u2019s individual councils and submitting the actual details of the technology. Through partnering with our works council in Germany, we\u2019ve developed a process for triaging reviews based on the compliance concerns that a solution is likely to raise. Those break down into two process flows: one for simple scenarios and one for more complex ones. For technology that\u2019s unlikely to cause any concerns, the product team completes a single-page intake form. It answers simple questions like the tool\u2019s name, audience, owner, and access rights to its data. The works council can expedite a simplified review of the technology in under four weeks. Some solutions require more extensive review. These complex scenarios include specific kinds of features: If these features are present, the product team completes a lengthier form that outlines the tool\u2019s place in our organization, how managers might use it, and if the information it provides could inadvertently allow anyone other than a direct manager to appraise an employee\u2019s performance. It\u2019s also a good idea to provide screenshots, mockups, or other materials that demonstrate the user experience. The lengthier form usually gives the works council everything it needs to approve a tool. But if more information would be helpful, we initiate a dialog with other teams. The two-scenario workflow in place for Germany is just one example of how we engage with works councils in Europe. Each country\u2019s council has its own processes and concerns, largely tied to the work culture in the region. But what they all share in common is that they\u2019re a hub for dialog around the impact of new solutions and features. When a technology requires more than the simplest approval, it\u2019s an opportunity for a conversation between several teams throughout Microsoft. Returning to our ongoing implementation of Viva Sales for Microsoft Teams, this tool contains a number of features that include recording and tracking. Its ongoing implementation is a good example of this consultation process. Several stakeholder teams are involved: Every stakeholder has a role to play in ensuring our organization balances the dual objectives of getting Viva Sales for Microsoft Teams implemented quickly and respecting our works councils\u2019 need to protect employees and maintain compliance. If you\u2019re considering a technology implementation in a works council jurisdiction, it\u2019s worth considering who in your organization might belong in the conversation. It\u2019s essential for companies and councils to work together closely to drive outcomes that work for everyone\u2014employees and organizations alike. Our rollout experiences at Microsoft have demonstrated the power of this approach: unique innovations that wouldn\u2019t have taken shape if not for collaboration with works councils. \u201cEverything we build these days is configurable and allows an organization to tailor the solution to their specific requirements,\u201d Bjork says. \u201cThat\u2019s directly related to works councils because there\u2019s no one-size-fits-all. You can\u2019t apply the same level of compliance or the same capabilities to everyone and assume that it will just work.\u201d That insight wouldn\u2019t be possible without close partnerships between product groups, works councils, and our wider organization. Ultimately, it means we\u2019re more equipped to meet regulatory demands around the world. It\u2019s also an asset for our customers, who can use Microsoft technology knowing it meets rigorous standards for protecting employees and their data. \u201cMicrosoft wants to represent the gold standard of solutions that keep people safe, regardless of the mechanisms their countries have in place for protecting employees,\u201d Jones says. \u201cThese conversations drive us to do better and question solutions before we even get to the point of launching them.\u201d Tags: compliance, digital transformation, HR, labor relations, Microsoft 365, privacy Mar 29, 2024\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAngela Gamba The use of business applications in Microsoft Teams has become a strategic advantage for many organizations, as they can accelerate the digital transformation of all business areas, generating a high demand for the Information Technology (IT) team to make these applications available.
