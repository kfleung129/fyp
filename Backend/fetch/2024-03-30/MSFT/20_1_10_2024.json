    "text": "Microsoft ranked second on Forbes' list of best employers in 2023. The tech giant scored well in several areas, including talent development, remote working options, parental leave benefits, diversity, work-life balance and employee pride. However, it\u2019s unlikely the company would have ranked anywhere on this list back when co-founder Bill Gates was trying to establish the firm in the mid- to late-\u201970s. Commercial real estate has outperformed the S&P 500 over 25 years. Here's how to diversify your portfolio without the headache of being a landlord Take control of your finances in 2024: 5 money moves to start the new year off strong The US dollar has lost 87% of its purchasing power since 1971 \u2014 invest in this stable asset before you lose your retirement fund In those days, Gates had a reputation as a micromanager who would memorize the license plates of every employee in order to keep tabs on them. \u201cHe was growing into the taskmaster who would prowl the parking lot on weekends to see who\u2019d made it in,\u201d co-founder Paul Allen once told Vanity Fair. Gates isn\u2019t the only tough boss in the billionaires\u2019 club. In fact, some famous entrepreneurs claim it\u2019s the only way to run a company successfully. However, this leadership style has faced pushback in recent years, and some wonder if strict management is a prerequisite for success \u2014 or an annoying roadblock for employees. There\u2019s a long list of entrepreneurs who are just as famous for being successful as they are for being difficult to work for. Steve Jobs was notorious for being ruthless and controlling with employees, according to his business partner Steve Wozniak. Elon Musk\u2019s \u201cultra hardcore\u201d work culture pushed some employees to sleep on the floor of the office after working a 12-hour shift. Meanwhile, Jeff Bezos once called \u201cwork-life balance\u201d a \u201cdebilitating phrase.\u201d In 2023, Amazon delivery drivers filed a lawsuit against the company for forcing them to urinate in bottles \u2014 rather than stopping to go to a bathroom \u2014 during their shifts. Suffice it to say, billionaires don\u2019t mind pushing people to the edge of sanity. But is this aggressive work culture really a key to success or an unnecessary hassle? Research seems to lean towards the latter.

A study published in the Asian Journal of Economics and Banking found that controlling bosses reduced employee morale and productivity. In fact, productivity suffered even if the micromanager somehow sustained employee morale. Authoritative bosses undermined employee autonomy and made them more likely to agree with fake news even if they knew it was fake, according to a recent paper published in Scientific Reports. Unsurprisingly, employees are not keen to work for controlling bosses. A survey conducted by Monster found that 73 percent of workers felt micromanagement was their biggest workplace issue. The survey also found that 46 percent of workers would consider leaving because of it. Micromanagement might also be unnecessary for business leaders trying to enter the billionaires\u2019 club. Warren Buffett is the perfect example. Buffett\u2019s management style has been described as hands-off and laissez-faire. Business owners acquired by his company are allowed to \u201coperate on their own, without our supervising and monitoring them to any degree,\u201d Buffett once said. \u201cMost managers use the independence we grant them magnificently, by maintaining an owner-oriented attitude.\u201d In other words, Buffett is a master delegator who trusts his associates to work independently with minimal oversight. If the world\u2019s seventh-richest man doesn\u2019t need micromanagement to succeed, it\u2019s probably not necessary for anyone else.
