    "text": "Pune: Baby Rajaram Bokale, a 53-year-old woman from Maharashtra\u2019s Kharadi, teaches Marathi to Microsoft AI tools and gets Rs 400 per hour. She earned Rs 2,000 after working for 11 days. Bokale runs a small business of grinding spices and chilli peppers. \u201cI used what I earned to buy a part and repair my grinder. That\u2019s money I wouldn\u2019t normally have,\u201d she said. After a long day at work, Bokale spends an hour on her phone, teaching her native language Marathi to AI. Bokale is associated with a social impact organisation called Karya which has partnered with Microsoft to train AI models in Marathi. \u201cI\u2019m really proud that my voice is getting recorded, and someone is about to learn Marathi thanks to my voice and also proud that it will make these tools and features available in Marathi,\u201d she told Microsoft. Teaching Marathi to AI tools has not only helped Bokale earn an extra income but also learn new things. The stories she reads are about how banks work, how to save, and how to avoid scammers and frauds. \u201cThe story she was reading is designed to deliver practical information in an entertaining way,\u201d Microsoft said in a blog. Bokale has also learned how to use the UPI payment system. \u201cNow I\u2019m able to do more interesting things with my smartphone,\u201d she said. "
