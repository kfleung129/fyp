Organizations that work with MSSPs and are part of Microsoft\u2019s Early Access Program will be able to extend access to their Security Copilot environment, allowing MSSPs to participate with them using Security Copilot (Bring Your Own\u2014MSSP). Stellar Cyber, an Open XDR specialist, offers Copilot through its marketplace, according to Steve Garrison, senior vice president of marketing. He regards the Copilot release as \u201ca trend for vendors to build communities\u00a0and ecosystems\u201d and believes it\u2019s preferable that companies work together even though they compete now and then. Microsoft said its new version 365 Defender helps \u201cguide analysts directly with actionable recommendations from within a single unified experience.\u201d Moreover, Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence is now included at no cost with Security Copilot.  Defender Threat Intelligence enables customers to directly access, operate, and integrate Microsoft\u2019s threat intelligence to provide security teams with a greater depth of insight, Microsoft said in a blog post. Microsoft\u2019s blog explained that \"the era of AI brings unprecedented opportunities for us, and at the same time we are also facing an unprecedented surge in cyberthreats, coupled with a global shortage of security experts.\" As such, \u201ca paradigm shift is required in the security industry\u2019s approach to this challenge,\u201d and key to this effort is harnessing the power of generative AI. \u201cGenerative AI is transformative for security, and generative AI combined with Microsoft threat intelligence and our security-specific models will enable us to tip the scales in favor of security teams,\u201d Microsoft said.  Microsoft brought Security Copilot to market in March 2023 \u2014 calling it \u201cthe first generative AI security product to help protect organizations at machine speed and scale.\u201d Microsoft described Security Copilot as an AI assistant for security teams that is built on the most recent large language models. Microsoft said that Security Copilot is helping its preview customers\u00a0save up to 40% of their time on core security operations tasks. The combination of 365 Defender and Security Copilot is intended help analysts focus on what matters most to protect faster, Microsoft said. The new embedded experience opens up scenarios directly from within Microsoft 365 Defender, including: Jim Masters is Managing Editor of MSSP Alert, and holds a B.A. degree in Journalism from Northern Illinois University.
