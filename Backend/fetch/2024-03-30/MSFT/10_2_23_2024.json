Read more According to a report published by AV-TEST, Microsoft Defender is the best antivirus tool for Windows 10 PCs. This is for the second consecutive year that Microsoft\u2019s free antivirus software has topped AV-Test\u2019s list of the best antivirus tools for Windows 10. Based in Germany, AV-TEST is an independent organization that ranks Windows antivirus products based on their performance in three key areas \u2014 performance, protection, and usability. Microsoft Defender managed to get a perfect score in all these three categories, thus becoming the best free antivirus software on Windows 10. The report published by the German organization\u00a0is\u00a0based on the samples collected in July and August. Interestingly, Microsoft Defender is not the only antivirus product that managed to get a perfect score. Besides Microsoft Defender, Kaspersky, F-Secure, Avira, AhnLab, G Data, McAfee have also performed equally well.  Microsoft Defender is a free antivirus tool that comes preinstalled in Windows 10, meaning you don\u2019t have to pay to secure your system. That being said, paid third-party antivirus tools offer features such as real-time malware protection, integrated firewall, zero-day threat detection \u2014 all these features are currently missing in Microsoft\u2019s antivirus tool. So, whether or not you need a paid antivirus tool is something that you\u2019ll need to decide on your own. via\u00a0Windowslatest More about the topics: antivirus, Microsoft Defender, windows 10 Rahul Naskar Windows Expert Rahul Naskar Windows Expert Rahul Naskar covers Windows devices and smartphones.
