Published: 10:50 18 Jan 2024 EST Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) has seen its price objective raised by Bank of America (BoA) analysts from $430 to $450 on their thesis that its Azure and Office offerings will drive upside in the fiscal second quarter. Shares of Microsoft traded 0.7% higher at US$392.18 late morning on Thursday.

They noted that channel feedback suggested only early interest in M365 Copilot, an AI-driven tool integrated into the M365 suite of productivity software.
