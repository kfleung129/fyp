    "text": "dem10/iStock Unreleased via Getty Images Concerns surrounding Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) may soon lead to a new titleholder of the world's most valuable company. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) closed out the session on Thursday with a market cap of $2.73T, compared to the $2.83T of its tech rival, which has fallen in every session of the new year. Apple (AAPL) has held the crown since Nov. 21, but it was recently hit with a set of downgrades at Barclays and Piper Sandler over concerns about an iPhone slowdown, hardware trouble and macroeconomic pressures. On the other hand, Microsoft (MSFT) has been forecast to be one of the AI favorites in 2024 as mentioned recently in Wall Street Breakfast's special holiday edition. The company also just added a Copilot AI button to its Windows keyboard, marking the first big change to the device in nearly three decades. "
