    "text": " MSFT stock is one of the best AI investments you can make today Advertisement Source: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com It\u2019s funny, how life comes full-circle sometimes. Many years ago, Microsoft\u00a0(NASDAQ:MSFT)\u00a0became a gigantic company based on the company\u2019s operating systems for personal computers. Now, there\u2019s talk of a PC-market resurgence and Microsoft has developed artificial intelligence embedded programs for PCs. It\u2019s just another reason that MSFT stock\u00a0can continue to provide supreme value for the shareholders. As Microsoft\u00a0continues to evolve, its market capitalization grows over time. The company relentlessly advances the latest and greatest in tech trends, including AI-capable software. Consequently, we\u2019re giving Microsoft stock a well-deserved \u201cA\u201d grade and are preparing for it to perform well in 2024. When we call Microsoft\u00a0an \u201cMVP\u201d or \u201cmost valuable player,\u201d this is a baseball metaphor but there\u2019s also a literal meaning to it. That\u2019s because Microsoft recently overtook\u00a0Apple\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL) to become the most valuable publicly traded company. Apple had a market cap of $2.87 trillion, while Microsoft\u00a0beat that number with a market cap of $2.89 trillion. The point here isn\u2019t to put down Apple. Rather, we\u2019re emphasizing that Microsoft\u2019s smart strategy of investing early and heavily in generative AI technology is paying off big-time. Matrix Asset Advisors Chief Investment Officer David Katz cited a couple of reasons Microsoft\u00a0took Apple\u2019s place as the market-cap leader. First, Microsoft \u201chas done a better job of executing and demonstrating earnings growth.\u201d Furthermore, according to Katz, Microsoft \u201chas a much clearer roadmap with AI, and it has done a great job articulating how that will accelerate growth to make its long-term prospects even more compelling.\u201d By the time you read this, the market-cap leader may be Microsoft, Apple or some other company. That\u2019s not the most important issue, though. What really matters is that Microsoft never ceases to advance its AI-compatible programs for multiple use cases. Not only did Microsoft\u00a0invest in OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT gen-AI chatbot technology, but the company also enhanced its browser, cloud-computing and video-conferencing programs with AI functionalities. Now, with the financial-media buzz getting louder about a potential PC-market comeback, Microsoft is ambitiously rolling out its AI-powered Copilot assistant software. Yusuf Mehdi, Microsoft corporate vice president, emphasized the AI-tech functionalities that Copilot can bring to PCs. \u201cThere\u2019s never been a better time to get started with Copilot today,\u00a0whether it\u2019s turning your ideas into songs, creating beautiful images and polished drafts to adjusting your PC settings, Copilot is your everyday AI companion for work and life,\u201d he said. Moreover, Mehdi contends that when Copilot is combined with AI-capable PCs, \u201cEvery user becomes a power user.\u201d Reportedly, Microsoft\u2019s new keyboards for Windows-based PCs will even include a dedicated button to launch Copilot. It\u2019s another sign that Microsoft\u00a0is going all-in on AI tech during a year when the PC market might turn a corner. Clearly, Microsoft\u00a0isn\u2019t a company that sits back and coasts on its past achievements. The company continues to develop next-generation technology, and this is\u00a0why Microsoft stock provides ongoing value to the shareholders. So, don\u2019t obsess over which company has the biggest market cap on any given day. Just remember Microsoft\u00a0can generate robust revenue in 2024 by enhancing its products with powerful AI features. Therefore, MSFT stock easily earns an \u201cA\u201d grade and investors can prepare for another winning year by considering a share position today.
