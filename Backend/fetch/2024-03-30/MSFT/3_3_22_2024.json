    "text": "Microsoft is sprucing up Windows 11\u2019s lock screen again! As per a recent update, Windows 11 is receiving multiple widgets for the lock screen to bring you the latest weather updates, sports updates, traffic, and stock market info. All these widgets are powered by MSN websites. All the widgets are dynamic, in that they reveal additional information as you hover over them. Clicking on a card (and then signing in) opens the information in Microsoft Edge with the full forecasts and the latest updates. This happens even if Windows has in-built app for the same (for example, the Weather app), which is something that Microsoft would want to work upon in future updates. The lock screen widgets can be enabled from Settings > Personalization > Lock screen > Lock screen status > Weather and more. Currently, this feature is also only available to Windows Insiders in the Release Preview channel (builds 22621.3371 and 22631.3371). These are the same as the lock screen widgets that recently rolled out to Windows 10. However, one issue that users might have with this setup is that they don\u2019t get to choose which widgets appear on the Lock screen. Once enabled, you either get all widgets or none at all.
