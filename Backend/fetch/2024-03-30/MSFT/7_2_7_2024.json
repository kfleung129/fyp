This move aims to preempt a potential in-depth EU investigation, which could result in fines and a mandate for Microsoft to alter its business operations. CISPE, comprising\u00a0Amazon.Com Inc\u00a0AMZN and 26 smaller cloud providers across the EU, initiated the complaint in late 2022, accusing Microsoft of implementing contractual terms that detrimentally impact the European cloud computing environment, Reuters reports. The contention stems from Microsoft\u2019s licensing adjustments made in mid-2022, prompted by complaints from competitors in Germany, Italy, Denmark, and France to the EU\u2019s competition authority. Notably, the revisions excluded Amazon,\u00a0Alphabet Inc\u00a0GOOG GOOGL\u00a0Google,\u00a0Alibaba Group Holding Limited\u00a0BABA, and Microsoft\u2019s cloud services. CISPE\u2019s discussion with Microsoft seeks to rectify issues surrounding what it deems unfair software licensing that adversely affects cloud infrastructure providers and their clientele within Europe. The European Commission has acknowledged receiving multiple complaints against Microsoft, particularly concerning its Azure cloud computing platform. The CISPE emphasizes the importance of making considerable progress by the first quarter of 2024. Meanwhile, the EU scrutinizes Microsoft\u2019s $13 billion investment in OpenAI. The regulator\u00a0had also flagged\u00a0complaints against Microsoft Teams. Over the past decade, Microsoft has paid \u20ac1.6 billion in EU antitrust penalties but has recently adopted a more conciliatory stance towards regulatory engagements. Price Actions:\u00a0Microsoft shares traded higher by 1.42% at $411.22 on the last check Wednesday.
