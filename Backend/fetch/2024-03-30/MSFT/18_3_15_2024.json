Microsoft is making investments in infrastructure to dominate the\nworld of artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud services, and to increase its presence in advertising. Larry Ellison, Oracle founder, spoke following the release of the company's fiscal Q3\nearnings earlier this week, and said Oracle is preparing to put its cloud infrastructure in three additional Microsoft data centers. Oracle has been a provider of database services, but has\nshifted to provide cloud infrastructure. Ellison said\u00a0last\nyear\u00a0that Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) was being installed in 20 Microsoft data centers. On Monday's call, he told analysts that number could increase. That number of servers\nwould not be cheap. advertisement advertisement The companies have been working closely for several months, with Microsoft renting GPUs from Oracle to run artificial intelligence (AI) in Microsoft\u2019s Bing search\nengine, according to one report. On Thursday, the companies\u00a0revealed\u00a0the expanded availability\nof the Oracle Database@Azure service that enable users to access Oracle services running on OCI in Azure data centers. The partnership adds five additional regions, including a first German\nregion in Frankfurt. It marks the debut of Oracle Database@Azure in Europe, and the second region after\u00a0Microsoft Azure East US general availability\u00a0in December 2023. Microsoft\ncontinues to make many changes as it begins to integrate AI across its product lines. During Microsoft\u2019s monthly product meeting a company executive ran through several updates. For\nexample, advertisers in 32 markets can now buy Display ads directly in the\u00a0Microsoft\u00a0Advertising Platform to reach specific customers across more platforms with ads. While not\nmentioned during the update, Hana Kobzov\u00e1 posted on X that Microsoft Advertising is testing a different online\ninterface. \u201cIt is modern, sleek & fast and very similar to Google Ads,\" she wrote in a blog post. \u201cMicrosoft's AI chat assistant Copilot features its own icon in the top\nhorizontal menu, which, when clicked, opens a chat window on the right side,\u201d she wrote. \u201cAdditionally, it's integrated into the search bar, and interacting with it also opens the chat\nwindow on the right.\u201d Microsoft also recently announced that Copilot for Security will become generally available worldwide on April 1. The platform uses generative AI to help\nsecurity and IT professionals catch what others miss, move faster, and strengthen team expertise. Copilot is informed by more than 78 trillion security signals processed by Microsoft\ndaily. advertisement "
