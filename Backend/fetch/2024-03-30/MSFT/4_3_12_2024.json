A seasoned technology writer and content strategist, he\u2026 As far as extolling the virtues of artificial intelligence (AI) goes, in tandem with promoting a strong, vibrant brand identity, Microsoft appears to have dropped a masterclass on how not to do it. The US tech giant has been ridiculed after a developer shared what some called a \u201chideous\u201d AI image, with significant potential to go viral on social media. The Microsoft update from its Windows Develop account on X was intended to detail support information when migrating from UWP to WinUI 3 platforms but it appears something has been lost, in transit perhaps?

The worst is that MS thought that this would be accepted on the internet without becoming an instant meme and source of mockery.\u201d Then in a rather scathing and succinct critique, @pyke_64 unleashed the rebuke, \u201cIf this is a sign of the quality of your upscaling tech for PC, don\u2019t bother.\u201d That is just a selection of the responses on X, alone.
