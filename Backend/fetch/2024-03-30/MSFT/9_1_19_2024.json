The relationship between Microsoft and OpenAI is beneficial to the broader AI industry, according to Satya Nadella, despite lingering doubts among regulators on both sides of the Atlantic Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has defended the company\u2019s close relationship with OpenAI amid growing scrutiny from regulators over the nature of the ties between the two companies. Speaking at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos this week, Nadella told Bloomberg the alliance between the tech giants is a \u201cpro-competition partnership\u201d which has enabled both companies to deliver impactful results for customers. Microsoft\u2019s initial investment in OpenAI in 2019 was a \u201chighly risky bet\u201d, he said, but one that has proven beneficial for the broader market place so far. \u201cWhen we made these investments and backed OpenAI, went all-in on a particular form of compute that led to all these breakthroughs, we wouldn\u2019t have had what we had, and more importantly the incumbents would\u2019ve been the winners,\u201d he said.  Generative AI has been the secret sauce for Microsoft as its market cap surpasses AppleNew Microsoft Copilot updates target individual users, small businesses with \u2018Pro\u2019 subscription tier and cheaper pricing From Nadella\u2019s perspective, the partnership with OpenAI has enabled the tech giant to compete more effectively with major industry players who also have a vested interest in driving AI innovation. Microsoft faces stiff competition in the generative AI space from other tech giants, such as AWS, and Google, both of which have invested heavily in their own range of generative AI tools and services over the last year. OpenAI, however, appears to be the key differentiator for Microsoft, Nadella suggested. Receive our latest news, industry updates, featured resources and more.

Regulators in the UK, US, and European Union may contest that statement, however. In recent weeks, the relationship between Microsoft and OpenAI has been subject to intense regulatory scrutiny, with the UK\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) launching a preliminary investigation into the tie between the firms. Just days later, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) launched its own probe. On January 9, European regulators also signaled their intention to begin an examination of the relationship aimed at \u201cchecking whether Microsoft\u2019s investment in OpenAI might be reviewable under the EU Merger regulation\u201d. All three probes represent the preliminary stage of any potential future antitrust investigation, with regulators inviting industry stakeholders to voice their views and concerns over competition. Nadella admitted that the nature of this relationship was always likely to draw regulatory scrutiny, but appeared confident that the company\u2019s position on the matter is secure. \u201cI\u2019m sure regulators will look at this and say, is this a pro-competition partnership or not? And to me, it\u2019s a no-brainer.\u201d  Discover how hyperscale cloud service providers bring a wealth of value to their customers\n\nDOWNLOAD NOW To date, Microsoft has invested billions in OpenAI, injecting upwards of $13 billion in supporting the firm. Around $10 billion of that was invested in 2023 alone. The tech giant also holds a 49% stake in OpenAI\u2019s for-profit arm. It\u2019s this aspect of the relationship that has prompted much concern from regulators. OpenAI was rocked by a week of chaos in late November after chief executive Sam Altman was ousted in a surprise boardroom coup. Days of disruption followed which saw Altman join Microsoft, then make a triumphant return to the company. Microsoft has a vested interest in ensuring its poster child and leading partner in the generative AI space remains stable, and this has resulted in some changes at the firm.  Why AI could be a legal nightmare for years to come Since the November chaos, Microsoft has been granted a non-voting seat on the OpenAI board. This has rung alarm bells for regulators, with the CMA specifically highlighting this as a key concern. \u201cThere have recently been a number of developments in the governance of OpenAI, some of which involved Microsoft,\u201d the CMA said in a statement at the time. Nadella told Bloomberg that recent disruption hasn\u2019t prompted the same concerns at the tech giant, despite the fact reports suggested he was \u201cfurious\u201d at the incident last year. \u201cI\u2019m comfortable,\u201d he said. \u201cI have no issues with any structure. What we just want is good stability. I\u2019m not even interested in a board seat\u2026we definitely don\u2019t have control. We just want to have a good commercial partnership. \u201cWhat I would like is good governance and real stability, that\u2019s it.\u201d Ross Kelly is ITPro's News & Analysis Editor, responsible for leading the brand's news output and in-depth reporting on the latest stories from across the business technology landscape.
