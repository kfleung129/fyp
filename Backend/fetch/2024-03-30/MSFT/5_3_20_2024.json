    "text": "In a recent filing, Microsoft told New Zealand\u2019s Commerce Commission that Activision Blizzard produces no \u201cmust-have\u201d games. Weird thing to say when the company plans to spend $68.7 billion to buy the gaming giant behind Call of Duty, Overwatch, Diablo, World of Warcraft\u00a0and plenty more. In the document, Microsoft said: \u201cThere is nothing unique about the video games developed and published by Activision Blizzard that is a \u2018must have\u2019 for rival PC and console video game distributors that give rise to a foreclosure concern.\u201d Attempting to downplay the importance of Call of Duty is just one of the ways Microsoft has tried to placate regulators. In February, the company pledged it would continue to make the franchise available on PlayStation consoles beyond any existing agreements between Sony and Activision. \u2014 Mat Smith Nearly 600 more TV writers call for Netflix, Apple to detail abortion safety policies Sega Genesis Mini 2 stock will be extremely limited in the US Apple's 10.2-inch iPad is back on sale for $300 at Amazon Solo Stove's Fire Pit 2.0 fixes the original's biggest flaw Chromecast with Google TV is on sale for $40 once again Sony is retiring the PlayStation 5's Accolades feature because people aren't nice An e-bike- and scooter-sharing startup co-founded by Olympian Usain Bolt appears to have stopped operations.

Apple famously bragged it\u2019ll never invade your privacy to serve ads, but it does have an ad business on its App Store and elsewhere. The company is now expanding that business by adding a new ad slot to its Today homepage tab and on individual app pages. The company says these new ad slots will adhere to Apple's policies on privacy and transparency, by not offering personalized ads to users under 18, never using sensitive data and avoiding hyper-targeting.

That makes it difficult to maintain meaningfully different lists for its various consoles \u2014 at least for now. But while next-gen exclusives may be few and far between, there are a lot of gamers who simply haven\u2019t experienced much of what Microsoft has had to offer since the mid-'10s. It\u2019s in that frame of mind that we approach this list, now updated: What games would we recommend to someone picking up an Xbox today?

Crispo concurred with Twitter's claims that Musk is using false claims about bots and spam to wriggle out of the deal without a valid legal standing. Continue reading.
