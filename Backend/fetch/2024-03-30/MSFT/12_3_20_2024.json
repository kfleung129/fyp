Get features like A second US Senator has attacked Microsoft Corp.\u2019s operations in China, adding to a wave of criticism from human rights groups following a Bloomberg Businessweek investigation about the way it censors its Bing search engine in the country. Senator Marco Rubio, Republican from Florida, said in an emailed statement that there\u2019s \u201cno defending\u201d such compliance from any US company. Bloomberg\u2019s story found that Bing in China is removing an increasing amount of information about human rights, democracy, climate change and other topics to satisfy Beijing. \u201cEvery company doing business in China makes concessions to a genocidal, authoritarian regime,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cAmerican companies try to rationalize their choices to US lawmakers and regulators, but there is no defending censorship at the behest of the Chinese Communist Party. It comes down to this: every American company that chooses to work in China gives the Chinese Communist Party another opportunity to achieve its goal of overpowering the United States. It really is that simple.\u201d Last week, Sen. Mark Warner, a Democrat from Virginia, called on Microsoft to consider shutting down its Bing platform in the country. A Microsoft spokesperson reiterated an earlier statement that the Chinese version of Bing is \u201cthe least censored search engine\u201d in the country and that leaving the market there \u201cwould only serve to cut people off from information they otherwise have through Bing.\u201d \u201cWe only censor a result in response to a narrow legal order that we conclude obligates us to do so,\u201d the spokesperson said, \u201cand we regularly push back when we believe an order doesn\u2019t comply with proper interpretation of Chinese rules.\u201d Rubio\u2019s comments reflect bipartisan unease about US corporations\u2019 relationship with the Chinese government amid rising tensions between Washington and Beijing over a variety of political and economic issues. Meanwhile, human rights groups are voicing their own concerns. Maya Wang, interim China director at Human Rights Watch, called on Microsoft to make transparent its content removal policies following Chinese government requests and to consider pushing local partners to better protect human rights. \u201cBut if such a review suggests that it cannot reasonably act to avoid being complicit in human rights abuses, then the company should consider withdrawing from China,\u201d like Google did in 2010, Wang said. Google and Yahoo! shut down their China operations thanks in part to government crackdowns on freedom of expression. Microsoft\u2019s Bing platform is now the only Western search engine accessible on China\u2019s heavily restricted version of the internet. To operate in the country, Microsoft has configured Bing to incorporate a blacklist of thousands of websites, words and phrases, including those related to \u201chuman rights,\u201d \u201cclimate change China\u201d, \u201cdemocracy,\u201d and \u201cNobel Peace Prize,\u201d Bloomberg Businessweek reported. Searches for information on alleged abuses of the minority Uyghur population in China\u2019s Xinjiang region return results that exclude news reports about the topic. Users searching for censored content are notified that \u201cresults are removed in response to a notice of local law requirement.\u201d Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, said in a statement that China\u2019s internet was \u201cfree, open, and orderly.\u201d He added that \u201cforeign-\u00adinvested enterprises in China should abide by China\u2019s laws and regulations.\u201d Beijing has previously denied committing abuses in Xinjiang. Omer Kanat, executive director at the Uyghur Human Rights Project, said that it was an \u201coutrage\u201d for Microsoft to be involved in removing information about what he said were atrocities against Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslims. \u201cBing should be deeply ashamed of helping the government suppress that reporting,\u201d he said, adding that Microsoft should \u201clift all censorship and donate the profits from Bing\u2019s China operations to the victims of the coverup.\u201d   "
