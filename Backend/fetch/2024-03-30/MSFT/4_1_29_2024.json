    "text": "The US wants cloud services providers such as Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp. to actively investigate and call out foreign clients developing artificial intelligence applications on their platforms, escalating a tech conflict between Washington and Beijing. The Biden administration\u00a0proposal, scheduled for release Monday, requires such firms to reveal foreign customers\u2019 names and IP addresses. Amazon and its peers, which include Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google, would have to devise a budget for collecting those details and report any suspicious activity, according to draft rule\u00a0published\u00a0Sunday. If implemented, Washington could use those requirements to choke off a major avenue through which Chinese firms access the data centers and servers crucial to training and hosting AI. They also place the onus of collecting, storing and analyzing customer data on the cloud services, a burden not unlike strict \u201cknow-your-customer\u201d rules that govern the financial industry. US cloud providers have worried that restrictions on their activities with overseas users without comparable measures by allied countries risks disadvantaging American firms. Representatives for Microsoft, Amazon and Google didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment outside normal US hours. A Commerce Department spokesperson referred Bloomberg to Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo\u2019s\u00a0comments\u00a0last week. Raimondo\u00a0said\u00a0Friday her team was working to eradicate national security threats posed by AI development, an effort likely to focus on firms from China. Washington, which has already worked to constrain Beijing\u2019s access to the most advanced semiconductors, wants to limit Chinese firms\u2019 ability to develop AI with potential military capabilities. \u201cThese models getting in the hands of non-state actors or people that aren\u2019t our allies is very dangerous,\u201d Raimondo said in Washington. President Joe Biden in October\u00a0directed\u00a0the Commerce Department to require such disclosures in an effort to detect foreign actors that might use AI to launch what the proposal dubs \u201cmalicious cyber-enabled activities.\u201d The US is asking for comments on the proposed rule through April 29 before finalizing the regulation. Commerce said it may provide an exception to the identification rules for the foreign subsidiaries of US cloud providers. It also referred to commenters so far who\u2019ve pushed for the broadest possible definition of a US cloud service, adding it will clarify whether foreign subsidiaries fall under the rules. China\u2019s development of AI and other next-generation technologies is a top concern for the administration, which sees Beijing as its primary global strategic competitor. Washington has tried to rein in China\u2019s advances by restricting chip exports to the country and sanctioning individual Chinese firms, but the country\u2019s tech leaders have managed to make significant\u00a0breakthroughs\u00a0despite US curbs. The US in October tightened its controls to capture more chips, equipment and geographies. One key update targeted Chinese-headquartered companies operating in more than 40 countries, an attempt to prevent those firms from using other nations as intermediaries to secure semiconductors they can\u2019t access at home. \u00a9 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.
