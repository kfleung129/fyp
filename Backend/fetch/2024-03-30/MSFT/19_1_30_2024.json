    "text": "Microsoft Corp. posted beats across the board with its latest results Tuesday afternoon, calling out momentum in the cloud and traction with artificial intelligence. Microsoft\u2019s \n        MSFT,\n        -0.17%\n       Azure and other cloud-services businesses posted revenue growth of 28% on a constant-currency basis in the fiscal second quarter, with that rate coming in ahead of the 27% growth that analysts tracked by FactSet were expecting. What stood out to analysts was that AI services contributed 6 percentage points to Azure\u2019s growth in the December quarter, up from 3 points in the September quarter. On the earnings call, UBS\u2019s Karl Keirstead called the lift \u201cextraordinary.\u201d Meanwhile, Microsoft\u2019s management expects to see similar overall growth for Azure in the current quarter. \u201cGrowth will be driven by our Azure consumption business with continued strong contribution from AI,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said on the earnings call. Despite the upbeat results and AI commentary, however, shares of Microsoft slipped 1% in premarket trade on Wednesday. Could the stock\u2019s recent rally over the past three months (up 21%) and past 12 months (up 69%) have something to do with the muted response? \u201cAI is becoming a major story, but at this point it\u2019s well-known and was priced into the stock,\u201d David Russell, TradeStation\u2019s global head of market strategy, said in an email.

Overall, Microsoft recorded $62.0 billion in revenue for its fiscal second quarter, up from $52.7 billion a year earlier. Analysts were modeling $61.1 billion. \u201cBy infusing AI across every layer of our tech stack, we\u2019re winning new customers and helping drive new benefits and productivity gains across every sector,\u201d Chief Executive Satya Nadella said in the company\u2019s press release. During the December quarter, Microsoft generated $19.2 billion in revenue from its productivity and business-processes segment, which houses Office. Analysts were modeling $18.6 billion. Heading into Microsoft\u2019s report, analysts were curious about the impact of AI on Microsoft\u2019s software portfolio, especially after the company launched Copilot, an AI assistant for its Microsoft 365 product, late last year. The company didn\u2019t offer too much detail on Tuesday\u2019s call but hinted at traction. \u201cWhile it\u2019s early days for the Microsoft 365 Copilot, we\u2019re excited about the adoption to date and continue to expect revenue to grow over time,\u201d Hood said on the call. Intelligent-cloud revenue was up 20% to $25.9 billion, while the FactSet consensus was for $25.3 billion. The More Personal Computing segment, which includes Xbox and Windows, saw revenue rise 19% to $16.9 billion and edging ahead of the consensus view, which was for $16.8 billion. \u201cA stronger-than-expected performance from Activision was offset by the weaker-than-expected console market,\u201d Hood said. Microsoft posted net income of $21.9 billion, or $2.93 a share, up from $16.4 billion, or $2.20, in the year-ago quarter. Earnings per share came in ahead of the consensus view, which was for $2.79.
