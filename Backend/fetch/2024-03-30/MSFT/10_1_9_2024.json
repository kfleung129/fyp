    "text": "9 January 2024 Along with a coalition of civil society organisations, ICCL has submitted comments in response to the UK's competition authority's Microsoft-OpenAI merger enquiry. Microsoft's investments in OpenAI and the events of November 2023 indicate the influence Microsoft has on OpenAI, which is highly likely to be anti-competitive. In our submission, we raise a number of issues that should be investigated along with a set of example questions that can guide the investigation. See ICCLs related work on artificial intelligence. For comment: Dr Kris Shrishak, Enforce Senior Fellow, ICCL For media queries: ruth.mccourt@iccl.ie / +353874157162 8 January 2024 Submission to CMA on Microsoft-OpenAI \u201cpartnership\u201d merger inquiry The Microsoft-OpenAI \u201cpartnership\u201d Why this investment must be investigated Why Microsoft's investment in OpenAI gives it significant influence Competition issues the CMA should investigate 1. On 22 July 2019, OpenAI and Microsoft announced an exclusive computing partnership, initially underpinned by $1bn in investment and later supplemented with further funding.[11] What is the nature and the extent of this exclusivity? 2. How much of this investment was compute budget, and at what rate is OpenAI being offered computing power? How does this rate compare with market rates Microsoft offers other companies using Azure? 3. On 22 September 2020, Microsoft announced that it \u201cexclusively license[d] GPT-3\u201d.[12] What are the details of this exclusive relationship, and to what extent does this exclusivity apply to subsequent models and products developed by OpenAI, including DALL-E and GPT-4? 4. Does Microsoft have an exclusive license to OpenAI\u2019s intellectual property?[13] 5. Do any of these exclusive arrangements have an end date? 6. OpenAI switched from non-profit to a capped profit in March 2019.[14] At the time, OpenAI justified this switch as necessary in raising capital to pay for computational power. What role, if any, did Microsoft play in influencing OpenAI\u2019s change in legal structure? 7. Does Microsoft have any tacit or explicit agreement with OpenAI that restricts the latter\u2019s ability to directly compete against it? 8. In 2021, OpenAI released Codex, a fine-tuned GPT-3 model that generated code, in beta phase as an API. This model underlies Microsoft\u2019s coding assistance product GitHub CoPilot. OpenAI subsequently shut down Codex in March 2023.[15] What role did OpenAI\u2019s partnership with Microsoft play in Codex not receiving a product release and being shut down? 9. Since its initial $1bn investment, Microsoft is reported to have invested a total of up to $13bn in OpenAI, including $10bn in January 2023.[16] More recently, after a chaotic weekend at OpenAI,[17] Microsoft is now a non-voting observer on OpenAI\u2019s board.[18] This gives Microsoft exclusive access to knowledge and information with technical or commercial significance. To what extent does this access give Microsoft an unfair competitive advantage? 10. Is there an explicit link between Microsoft\u2019s partnership with OpenAI and the deprecation of existing Microsoft products, which reduces competition? 11. In 2023, Microsoft ended support for its AI-driven virtual assistant Cortana.[19] Which of Microsoft\u2019s other AI products have been deprecated since the beginning of its partnership with OpenAI? 12. Which Microsoft internal AI research and product teams have been shrunk or eliminated since the beginning of the partnership with OpenAI? Which AI staff have been reassigned from Microsoft\u2019s deprecated AI products, such as Cortana, to OpenAI-related work? 13. It has been reported that Microsoft will receive 49% of OpenAI\u2019s profits, after OpenAI pays back its early investors.[20] What are the precise details of this arrangement? 14. Microsoft\u2019s Azure powers \u201call OpenAI workloads across research, products and API services\u201d.[21] What level of insight does this privileged role give Microsoft into OpenAI\u2019s technical and commercial operations and decision-making? 15. How much direct insight does Microsoft have into the development of OpenAI\u2019s models? 16. Does Microsoft have access to the weights, source code, training data and model architecture for OpenAI\u2019s trained models, including GPT-3 and GPT-4? 17. How much insight does Microsoft have into the integration of OpenAI\u2019s trained model into Microsoft products? 18. How much insight does Microsoft have into the integration of OpenAI\u2019s trained models into the products of other organisations? 19. At which layers in the AI stack (e.g., through its ownership of the infrastructural layer) does Microsoft collect insights and information about OpenAI\u2019s operations? 20. Do these insights give Microsoft a competitive advantage over its rivals? 21. Do these insights eliminate or diminish OpenAI's ability to compete against Microsoft? 22. Does OpenAI depend on Microsoft for gathering insight into how enterprises use OpenAI\u2019s products, for example through the OpenAI Azure-hosted API?
