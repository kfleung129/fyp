In the biggest investment made by the company in Germany in the last 40 years, Microsoft will spend mostly on setting up data centres and on training people in artificial intelligence in 2024 and 2025. \"We are doing this today because of the enormous confidence we have in Germany,\" said Smith. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz welcomed the move, saying it represented a vote of confidence for Europe's biggest economy.
