Jones to Guide the Retail Technology Company as It Enters the New Market and Expands Into New Retail Verticals NEW YORK, UNITED STATES, March 28, 2024 /EINPresswire.com/ -- tutch, the in-store digital platform that gives shoppers a self-service option for discovering every product in a retailers\u2019 ecosystem, today announced the appointment of Greg Jones as Chief Executive Officer (CEO). Jones previously served as Global Director of Retail and Consumer Goods Solutions at Microsoft, and North America Retail and Consumer Goods Lead at Avanade. Jones has spent two decades empowering retailers to use technology to transcend the limitations of their physical footprints. As CEO, he will lead tutch as it scales adoption of its software as a service (SaaS) platform by U.S. brick-and-mortar stores and enters into new industry partnerships. Jones\u2019 career has revolved around introducing new technologies to traditional industries to improve efficiency and profitability. During his tenure at Microsoft, he was responsible for establishing the company\u2019s Travel and Transportation vertical, including forging partnerships with Boeing and SITA. At Avanade, he developed the North America Retail & Consumer Goods Advisory practice, which guides retailers as they leverage AI and technology to digitize core functions. Jones will channel these experiences as the company builds on its track record in Australia, where hundreds of stores currently rely on its platform to sell beyond what\u2019s in the aisles, grow revenue, enhance staff productivity and increase customer loyalty. Retailers across the board are considering new self-service options that enable them to sell more, optimize staff and give customers the same autonomy they have when shopping online. This growing trend toward self-service and digital experiences has carved out a space in the market for tutch, resulting in increased demand from chain stores, malls, big box retailers and others, across apparel, home goods, luxury, speciality, drug stores and more. Using tutch, brick-and-mortar retailers are able to compete with ecommerce storefronts that keep shoppers at home, but don\u2019t let them experience items first-hand like they can in stores. Customers can now benefit from a familiar digital experience in stores, while also touching, feeling and testing out products. For retailers, the technology gets to the core of what makes them profitable: higher sales, streamlined costs and increased efficiency. \u201cPhysical stores are still responsible for approximately 87% of all consumer purchases, but their models present many challenges that online platforms simply don\u2019t have,\u201d said Jones. \u201cIssues like high staff turnover, tight margins, dated in-store experiences, space limitations and inventory carrying costs make it difficult to compete with online marketplaces\u2013and even the brands they carry. But all of this creates a huge opportunity for the retailers willing to address these challenges head on. tutch was designed from the ground up to help them do this, and we\u2019re prepared to replicate the success we\u2019ve achieved for retailers in Australia, state-side.\u201d tutch is also enabling retailers to explore net new revenue streams and store formats.  Using tutch, retailers can expand their physical stock through drop-shipped products, offer branded opportunities to brands that want to get close to shoppers at the point of purchase, and even transform brick-and-mortar stores into marketplaces through complementary buying options available through the self-service digital screens. \u201cWe built tutch after experiencing firsthand the opportunities that retailers have to optimize their physical store footprints,\u201d said Grant Oayda, founder of tutch. \u201cAs we expand our own footprint, we know that Greg\u2019s experience will put us in the best position to expand and open retailers\u2019 eyes to the potential of digital to connect them to customers like never before.\u201d Jones\u2019 retail and technology experience will be invaluable to tutch as it tackles the nuances of the expansive U.S market. His history creating partnerships and facilitating integrations also makes Jones uniquely suited to guide retailers as they evolve beyond traditional store challenges and entertain previously unattainable marketplacing ambitions and ways to connect with shoppers beyond the store floors.
