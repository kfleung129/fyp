In 2011, when I saw them mushrooming in the US, I decided to get back in the game again\",\u00a0 he said, as per Moneycontrol report. microsoft job quit farmer startup/harvesting.co After that, he founded Harvesting, a business that aims to get farmers better deals by eliminating middlemen and selling fresh farm produce.

The family suffered financially after he lost his father when he was nine years old, and the mother's meager salary served as their only source of income. Having no money to buy books, Garg spent his time reading everything he could find at the library. He also considered going through the numerous case studies in the Harvard Business Reviews to be a \"fun pastime\". Following the founding of Harvesting, Garg received an invitation to Harvard University in 2018 to give a speech on financial inclusion for smallholder farmers. \"And I bought a copy of Harvard Business Review at the Harvard University campus, mine own copy!
