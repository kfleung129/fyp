Microsoft Corp. recently acquired vacant property zoned for data centers in Gainesville for more than $465 million, according to a\u00a0Washington Business Journal\u00a0report. The publication reports the property comprises about 124 acres across two parcels at 13490 University Blvd. and 5941 Wellington Road, directly south of Conway Robinson State Forest and Manassas National Battlefield Park, near where the contentious PW Digital Gateway data center corridor is primed for development. The properties were sold for $465.5 million by 41992 John Marshall Highway LLC, an entity closely associated with JK Land Holdings LLC, a land acquisition firm managed by Loudoun-based logistics and data center mogul Chuck Kuhn, according to the Washington Business Journal. A spokesperson with JK Land Holdings verified the legitimacy of the sale but otherwise declined to comment. Microsoft could not be immediately reached for comment. Both parcels\u2019 existing heavy industrial zoning designation already accommodates data center development. But a rezoning application submitted to Prince William County last year for the University Boulevard site is seeking an allowance for up to nearly 4 million square feet of data centers and a new electric substation. County documents show the Wellington Road parcel sits on land that was previously home to the Atlantic Research Corporation, which operated a rocket and missile production and testing facility under contract with the U.S. Department of Defense until 2005 when it was decommissioned. The University Boulevard site is nearby. A nearby 181-acre property on the former Atlantic Research Corporation site was sold in 2017 to Delaware-based Sharpless Enterprises LLC, which is now aiming to construct a data center hub with multiple buildings pending approval from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.        Keep at it Al. So the patriot does so little actual work at his job (that sucks up taxpayer money) he admits to having 5 weeks of free time throughout the year to do pro bono work. Also he takes credit for 150000 hours of volunteering \"we\" performed when in actuality he just spent his time looking at a spreadsheet telling others to get their hands dirty. Keep at it Al.

Nothing to get excited about here. Just another big data center property changing hands between two fat cats.The notable aspect of the story is the price paid: $465.5 million for 124 acres. That\u2019s more than $3.75 million per acre.Those parcels are part of a huge 415 acre area south of I-66 that used to comprise the old Atlantic Research Corporation missile testing facility which will eventually comprise more than 8.4 million square feet of data centers.How much longer will it be until the 115-acre Jiffy Lube Live concert venue just across the street falls to the data center juggernaut? At $3.75 million per acre, they\u2019ll be hard pressed to sell enough tickets to make the concert business worth their while. I suspect they will soon be playing a new tune there.

Interesting point there. I wonder if liberal communities prefer the hum of data centers over guitar amps. I guess one is never ending though. Interesting point there.

Don\u2019t be fooled by \u201cEducated Patriot\u201d. He\u2019s no Patriot and he was educated by the left. It\u2019s very clear from his posts that he\u2019s full of himself and more knowledgeable than everyone else. He even went so far the other day by telling everyone how much he makes. But remember, he\u2019s a govt employee or a govt-connected employee. Without that, he\u2019s a nobody. I can\u2019t imagine any woman could stand to listen to him either. My guess he\u2019s a bow-tie wearing clown. Sorry, but I can\u2019t stay silence on this. Don\u2019t be fooled by \u201cEducated Patriot\u201d. He\u2019s no Patriot and he was educated by the left.

As Dan Bongino has so brilliantly stated, \u201ccutesy time is over.\u201d You see a lefty mouthing off, challenge his a$$! Many of others reading this no doubt have the same thoughts that you do. They agree with you but don\u2019t want to get involved. It takes time to get an account, write coherently, etc. I say to those people, I understand, I\u2019m spending way too much time here, too. But I can\u2019t sit idly by and watch people like Educated Patriot, those who clearly hate what we represent and the country we envision, regurgitate garbage unchecked. No way. Pick your battle and win it. If it\u2019s here against \u201cEducated Patriot\u201d then so be it, win it. If it\u2019s against liberals elsewhere, win it. Make your stand and join the fight. Your actions will inspire others to do the same. The time for staying silent has passed.

We know who they are though, and when the political winds change course I have a feeling most will frantically scurry to the contracting/consulting world. You guys can all compare Power Point Ranger badges and have great discussions about the wars you didn\u2019t fight in. Yes, leftists have even infiltrated the Marine Corps.

CABs and Bronze Stars: The participation trophies for GWOT-era officers everywhere.I knew officers who got blanket-awarded CABs and put in for Bronze Stars for literally doing their job. There's a reason why people view them as a joke nowadays, which is kind of sad. CABs and Bronze Stars: The participation trophies for GWOT-era officers everywhere.

Is it because I have the testicles that you lack? This ought to be good, don\u2019t disappoint, loser. Loser, this is actually very disappointing. I was expecting way more from an elite, Ivy League grad. Once again though, you demonstrated how you slipped through the cracks. Or maybe it\u2019s because you\u2019re just frail and weak and lack a fighting spirit, especially when the sun goes down. Perhaps it\u2019s a combination of all.-TA covered almost all education funds, which I am still very thankful for. Big 12 school, solid program with challenging professors - I got a lot out of it. Great experience.-I have no resentment at all for those who have attended prestigious universities, I just don\u2019t like you. The Military Academy has to be disappointed in you as well, General Patton wouldn\u2019t be doing any bragging about you, that\u2019s for damn sure. Too much \u201cI\u201d in your communication, not a team oriented type guy. Have you ever even played organized, competitive sports?-Still work with the Marine Corps, yes. Because I can and also because I love it. I also do some volunteer work, can you guess why? Yeah, because I can and because I love doing it. You\u2019re not the volunteering type though are you? Clearly not. But if you ever get bored with self oriented service, you should consider serving others for once in your life. Oh, you should also ask around to see if anyone found the balls that you\u2019re missing. Loser, this is actually very disappointing. I was expecting way more from an elite, Ivy League grad.

Eh, I still have to deal with Microsoft's adware (fun fact: MS shares your data with over 800 external companies, nearly all of which are ad agencies).For personal use? I ditched Windows years ago for Linux and never looked back. MS hasn't released a decent OS since XP. LibreOffice is also a great alternative to the 360 suite, it actually runs well and doesn't sacrifice core functionality for gimmicky features that nobody wants. \"If you use Microsoft 360, don't bother complaining.\" For work?
