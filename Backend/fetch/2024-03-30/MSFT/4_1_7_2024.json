Ongoing controversies with Elon Musk and the X platform have apparently benefited LinkedIn in the advertising sphere. Big advertisers including IBM, Coca Cola and Comcast, have jumped ship after Musk made news for using antisemitic language in a post. LinkedIn is seeing a surge in advertising numbers \u2013 up to 30 percent this year. Advertising analysts have drawn a direct line to the ad decline on X \u2013 $400 million less per quarter this year.

For starters, we don\u2019t need more advertising noise to pollute LinkedIn, which arguably remains the best place for professional engagement among all the social sites. Also, we should be rooting for X/Twitter to thrive because it provides a great alternative to LinkedIn for those businesses that are more suited to the platform \u2013 creators, media firms, public relations companies, etc. 4 \u2013 These are five pivotal cybersecurity trends for 2024. Tal Mazir of security software and services provider Perception Point detailed five cybersecurity trends to be aware of this year. (Source: Help Net Security) Why this is important for your business: Mazir says that chatbots that appear to be ChatGPT will be used to craft messages from an \u201cauthorized\u2019 sender to achieve serious security breaches like accessing funds or other sensitive data. Deepfakes \u2013 up 3000 percent \u2013 is another tool hackers will continue to use to create counterfeit images or audio to dupe recipients lured by content \u201cvirtually indistinguishable\u201d from legitimate data. A third example is the use of SaaS apps to probe and locate weak points in security systems. Mazir\u2019s underlying message is with every remarkable advantage of AI, its equally destructive capacity will be exploited. 5 \u2013 Four ways companies can respond and more effectively comply with the SEC's new cybersecurity rules. Speaking of cybersecurity threats, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has ramped up its efforts to counteract these escalating issues. As of this summer new rules were enforced requiring companies to disclose any cybersecurity incidents as well as submitting information detailing their \u201ccybersecurity risk management, strategy, and governance.\u201d (Source: SC Magazine) Why this is important for your business: The advice for companies to keep up with stricter SEC guidelines is to prioritize cybersecurity risks and approach it as any other risk management issue. Also suggested is to establish aggressive metrics to respond to potential threats in a timely manner and to prioritize transparency and make certain due diligence is given when submitting cybersecurity reports to the SEC. Taking a \u201cbusiness centric\u201d approach with Chief Security Officers and communicating with their teams about how to improve security systems, where flaws exist, and what should stay on the company\u2019s radar in terms of threats is also important.
