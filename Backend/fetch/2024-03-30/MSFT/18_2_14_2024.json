According to data crunched by\u00a0Warn Tracker\u00a0and\u00a0layoffs.fyi, so far this year companies laid off more than 30,000 employees. So far, in 2024, data shows the tech industry announced the biggest layoffs. Major companies including Microsoft, Google and Amazon are cutting more than 1,000 jobs, despite reporting major revenue boosts in the months preceding their announcements. According to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, the media industry cut\u00a0more than 800 positions\u00a0in January \u2014 that's up 11% from the same time last year. Just this week, Paramount, which owns CBS, cut 800 jobs \u2014 just two days after its Super Bowl coverage broke viewership records. Experts say companies point to cost-cutting as the main driver for layoffs. Other factors experts cite include preparing for potential policy changes after the November election, increased automation and adoption of artificial intelligence. Cory Stahle, an economist at\u00a0Indeed Hiring Lab, says with AI technology now easily accessible to the public, they're seeing a sweeping impact to the workforce. \"Some of the biggest impacts are for some of these white collar roles and unsurprisingly to these technologies are happening right now in the tech industry. We are seeing with these types of tools being able to write code and do these tech tasks,\" said Stahle. While the layoffs are significant, the job market remains resilient. The latest jobs report shows last month the economy added a robust 353,000 jobs. SEE MORE: US job market remains strong despite recent layoff announcements Trending stories at Scrippsnews.com "
