Google (GOOGL)\u2019s ad revenue for the December quarter included $48 billion from Google Search and approximately $9.2 billion from YouTube. On a call with analysts on Jan. 30, CEO Sundar Pichai touted the rapid growth of YouTube, calling it a \u201ckey driver of our subscription revenue.\u201d The tech giant also reported the first time that YouTube had more than 100 million paid subscribers at the end of 2023. The video platform plowed in as much revenue as Google\u2019s cloud business, which also saw strong growth in the fourth quarter. Microsoft drew headlines throughout 2023 for its many initiatives, from deepened collaboration with OpenAI to legal progress in its $68.7 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard. On the earnings call on Jan. 30, CEO Satya Nadella emphasized the company\u2019s transition from experimenting with A.I. to applying the technology at scale, with A.I. capabilities being integrated across Microsoft\u2019s product offerings, from Microsoft Copilot to Azure AI to GitHub Copilot, the popular A.I. developer tool. \u201cWe\u2019re using this A.I. inflection point to redefine our role in business applications,\u201d Nadella told analysts. iPhones continued to dominate Apple\u2019s revenue makeup, accounting for roughly 60 percent of its Q4 sales. The Mac segment generated $7.8 billion in revenue, returning to growth, while iPad revenue fell 25 percent from the previous year to $7 billion. The sharp decline was in part due to Apple\u2019s lack of new iPad models in 2023. Apple\u2019s revenue in the \u201cWearables, Home, and Accessories\u201d business fell 11 percent year-over-year to $12 billion. This decline was offset by a 11 percent growth in the \u201cServices\u201d unit, which includes Apple TV+, Apple News+ and Apple One bundles. The unit reported $23.1 billion in revenue in the December quarter, a record high. Apple reported earnings a day before its Vision Pro headset arrived in stores in the U.S. On yesterday\u2019s earnings call, CEO Tim Cook called the Vision Pro \u201cthe most advanced personal electronics device ever. We can\u2019t wait for people to experience the magic for themselves.\u201d Amazon saw record user acitivites during last quarter\u2019s Black Friday and Cyber Monday shopping events, where customers purchased over 1 billion items on Amazon globally. In the U.S., over 500 million items were ordered from independent sellers, attracting millions of new Prime memberships. Throughout 2023, Amazon provided its fastest-ever global delivery to Prime members, delivering over 7 billion units the same or the next day. \u201cThis Q4 was a record-breaking Holiday shopping season and closed out a robust 2023,\u201d CEO Andy Jassy said on the earnings call yesterday. Amazon plans to increase capital expenditures in 2024, particularly in expanding its A.I. efforts. The company just launched Rufus, an A.I.-powered shopping assistant. In addition, its recent move to display ads on Prime Video aims to leverage Amazon\u2019s massive audience for advertising expansion. In the fourth quarter, Amazon generated $14.7 billion in ad revenue, up 26.7 percent from a year ago. Meta tripled profits in the December quarter, in part thanks to aggressive cost-cutting in the previous months. The tech giant also announced its inaugural cash dividend of $0.50 per share during the earnings call yesterday. Meta\u2019s family of social media apps, including Facebook, Instagram, Threads and WhatsApp, had 3.19 billion daily active users at the end of 2023. Threads, Meta\u2019s answer to Elon Musk\u2019s X, had 130 million monthly active users at the end of last year. CFO Susan Li said on the earnings call Meta would no longer report Facebook-specific numbers, suggesting a shift away from its legacy social media platforms. Altogether, revenue from the total family of apps came at $39 billion during the quarter, a 24 percent increase from the previous year. Looking into 2024, CEO Mark Zuckerberg promised significant investments in A.I. for foundational research and product development, expecting capital expenditures to be between $30 billion and $37 billion this year. \u201cMoving forward, a major goal will be building the most popular and most advanced A.I. products and services,\u201d Zuckerberg said on yesterday\u2019s earnings call.
