Andrew joined The Verge in 2012, writing over 4,000 stories. On February 15th Microsoft released a particularly interesting episode of the official Xbox podcast in which it outlined the beginning of a slightly new direction for the company. The episode featured Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer, head of Xbox game studios Matt Booty, and Xbox president Sarah Bond, who discussed everything from Xbox exclusives coming to the PS5 and Nintendo Switch, the latest Game Pass subscriber numbers, and even (vague) future plans for its next-gen console. We also had the chance to speak to Spencer about what it all means \u2014 and you can catch up with every bit of news right here. Feb 16 Tom Warren Microsoft announced yesterday that four Xbox-exclusive games are coming to PS5 and Nintendo Switch soon, opening up a new strategy for Xbox to be on more screens. Just two hours before Microsoft\u2019s big announcement, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer explained the company\u2019s new Xbox vision in an internal memo to employees. The Verge has obtained a copy of the memo. It\u2019s the first time Spencer has fully outlined a new strategy \u201cwhere every screen is an Xbox\u201d to employees, after an internal town hall meeting earlier this month didn\u2019t address multi-platform games directly. Feb 15 Emma Roth At one point, Xbox wanted to get its cloud gaming service on the App Store \u2014 but now that Apple will actually allow it, the gaming giant isn\u2019t biting. Here\u2019s Xbox boss Phil Spencer: There\u2019s not room for us to monetize Xbox Cloud Gaming on iOS. I think the proposal that Apple put forward... doesn\u2019t go far enough to open up. In fact, you might even say they go the opposite direction in some way, but they definitely don\u2019t go far enough to open up competition on the world\u2019s largest gaming platform. Feb 15 Sean Hollister Gaming CEO Phil Spencer: One of the weak points in the experience on a ROG or the Lenovo [Legion Go] is Windows. How Windows works on controller input only on that kind of DPI, on a smaller eight- or seven-inch screen. That\u2019s a real design point that our platform team is working with Windows to make sure that the experience is even better. Does that mean handheld mode isn\u2019t just a hackathon project anymore? There was that Xbox app compact mode... Feb 15 Andrew Webster Taken on their own, today\u2019s gaming announcements from Microsoft might not seem all that earth-shattering. A handful of unspecified Xbox games are coming to rival platforms, the subscriber numbers for Game Pass have grown, Diablo IV will lead the rush of Activision Blizzard titles on Game Pass, and more hardware is on the way, including a powerful next-gen console and possibly a handheld. But they all point to a future that Microsoft hasn\u2019t exactly been shy about: making Xbox into more than just a console. In an internal memo to employees, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer explained the strategy like this: Feb 15 Andrew Webster You can read all of the news right here, but if you want to check out the podcast where Xbox leadership discussed everything from platform exclusives to the state of Game Pass to some vague talk of new hardware, the whole thing is embedded below. Feb 15 Tom Warren Microsoft has been gradually moving Xbox away from the idea of a single piece of hardware in recent years, with ambitions to reach billions of gamers across consoles, PCs, and mobile devices. Now it\u2019s officially bringing four Xbox-exclusive games to PS5 and Nintendo Switch amid an \u201cXbox Everywhere\u201d effort inside Microsoft that will likely see even more games arriving on rival consoles. It\u2019s a seismic strategy shift that the company is downplaying publicly, so I sat down with Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer to get some answers and discuss the company\u2019s vision for the future of Xbox. Feb 15 Tom Warren Microsoft\u2019s Xbox Game Pass service\u00a0now has 34 million subscribers. That\u2019s up 36 percent from the 25 million Microsoft previously reported more than two years ago. Microsoft revealed the new 34 million figure in an official Xbox podcast today, as part of an announcement that some Xbox exclusives are coming to the PS5 and Nintendo Switch. It\u2019s the first time Microsoft has disclosed fresh Xbox Game Pass subscriber numbers since announcing its Activision Blizzard acquisition in January 2022. Feb 15 Tom Warren It\u2019s official: Microsoft is bringing some Xbox-exclusive games to PS5 and Nintendo Switch. It\u2019s part of a broader strategy shift inside Microsoft\u2019s gaming business to grow games beyond just the company\u2019s Xbox consoles. \u201cWe\u2019ve made the decision that we\u2019re going to take four games to the other consoles,\u201d reveals Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer on the official Xbox podcast. Bizarrely, Microsoft is refusing to name the four titles, but the company says that two are community-driven games and the other two are smaller titles. Feb 15 Ash Parrish Diablo IV will be the first Activision Blizzard game coming to Xbox Game Pass, launching on the service on March 28th. Once Microsoft completed its billion-dollar acquisition of Activision Blizzard, fans speculated that its games would arrive immediately on the subscription service. Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer said in October of last year, right when the deal closed, that fans would have to wait until 2024 before games like Call of Duty would start showing up on the service. That time is now, but instead of Call of Duty, we\u2019re getting Diablo IV. Feb 15 Tom Warren Microsoft is teasing the potential for unique Xbox hardware in the future and a powerful next-gen console. Four previously exclusive Xbox games are officially coming to the PS5 and Nintendo Switch soon, and Microsoft wants to reassure Xbox fans that it\u2019s still very much invested in the future of its platform and hardware. In an official Xbox podcast today, Xbox president Sarah Bond teased that Microsoft will deliver \u201cthe largest technical leap\u201d with the next-generation Xbox: Feb 15 Andrew Webster Later today Microsoft will be sharing \u201cupdates on the Xbox business\u201d in an episode of the Xbox podcast that will feature Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer, head of Xbox game studios Matt Booty, and Xbox president Sarah Bond. If rumors are to be believed, we\u2019ll be hearing about multiplatform games and possibly even new hardware. It\u2019ll be available at 3PM ET and you can check it out on the Xbox YouTube channel \u2014 and, of course, stay tuned to The Verge for all the news. Feb 14 Sean Hollister The Nintendo Switch is on track to become the bestselling game console of all time. Sony\u2019s PS5 will likely surpass the Xbox One\u2019s entire lifetime sales later this year. Meanwhile, Microsoft\u2019s newer Xbox Series X and S, with their comparatively disappointing exclusive games, are firmly in third place yet again \u2014 and it doesn\u2019t look like Xbox Game Pass will ever fill the gap. Microsoft isn\u2019t planning to take this lying down. It\u2019s among the largest video game companies in the world now that it owns Activision Blizzard, and it\u2019s going to act. This Thursday, we expect the company to reveal a seismic shift in strategy, one where it could bring Xbox exclusives like Hi-Fi Rush, Starfield, even Indiana Jones to PlayStation and / or Switch. Feb 12 Tom Warren Microsoft\u2019s Xbox business needs to get bigger. The company\u2019s Xbox Series S and X sales still lag behind Sony\u2019s PlayStation 5, and Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer has previously admitted its Xbox Game Pass subscriptions were slowing down, too. He admitted that in 2022, a dry year for\u00a0Xbox\u00a0games after\u00a0Microsoft\u2019s big exclusive Bethesda game\u00a0Starfield\u00a0was delayed. An Xbox Game Pass slowdown might be why I\u2019m hearing that a number of Xbox exclusives are coming to consoles with which Microsoft usually competes. Sources familiar with Microsoft\u2019s plans tell The Verge that the company is getting ready to launch a select number of Xbox games on PS5 and Nintendo Switch. Weeks of rumors suggest that Hi-Fi Rush, Sea of Thieves, and even Bethesda titles like Starfield and Indiana Jones could appear on non-Xbox platforms. Feb 12 Tom Warren After weeks of rumors of Xbox exclusives coming to PS5 and Nintendo Switch, Microsoft is now planning to discuss its vision for the future of Xbox at an event later this week. Microsoft\u2019s Xbox business update event will take place on Thursday, February 15th at 12PM PT / 3PM ET. Weeks of rumors suggest that Hi-Fi Rush, Sea of Thieves, and even Bethesda titles like Starfield and Indiana Jones could appear on non-Xbox platforms. Microsoft hasn\u2019t addressed these rumors directly, but Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer didn\u2019t dismiss them last week. \u201cWe\u2019re listening and we hear you,\u201d said Spencer, before announcing the Xbox business update event. Feb 5 Tom Warren Microsoft is planning to share details about its plans to bring Hi-Fi Rush and other Xbox exclusives to PS5 and Nintendo Switch consoles, according to sources familiar with Microsoft\u2019s plans. Details of Microsoft\u2019s multi-platform plans have been gradually leaking, with The Verge revealing over the weekend that the upcoming Indiana Jones game is being considered for PS5. Now, Microsoft is getting ready to outline the future of Xbox next week after a weekend of leaks and uncertainty for Xbox fans. \u201cWe\u2019re listening and we hear you,\u201d says Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer in a post on X. \u201cWe\u2019ve been planning a business update event for next week, where we look forward to sharing more details with you about our vision for the future of Xbox. Stay tuned.\u201d Feb 4 Tom Warren Bethesda\u2019s upcoming Indiana Jones game is also tentatively set to launch on Sony\u2019s PlayStation 5 console. We got our first glimpse of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle during Microsoft\u2019s Xbox Developer Direct event last month, where it was announced for Xbox and PC. A source familiar with Microsoft\u2019s plans tells The Verge that Bethesda is also considering bringing Indiana Jones and the Great Circle to PS5. A new multi-platform approach for certain Xbox games is emerging inside Microsoft, we\u2019re told, with the company weighing up which titles will remain exclusive and others that will appear on Switch or PS5 in the future. Indiana Jones appears to be part of this new wave of multi-platform games. Feb 1 Tom Warren After rumors of Xbox console exclusive Hi-Fi Rush coming to PS5 and Nintendo Switch, data miners might have just found a smoking gun. T-shirt files included in the game\u2019s latest update include a \u201cI\u2019m here baby!\u201d in PlayStation blue, a \u201cRock out! Anywhere\u201d in Nintendo Switch red, and \u201cShadow dropped\u201d in Xbox green. The rock out anywhere slogan must reference the Switch\u2019s portability, the \u201cI\u2019m here baby!\u201d the sheer surprise of an Xbox game on PS5, and the shadow drop for the original surprise Xbox launch. There\u2019s no smoke without fire. 1/3 / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily. The Verge is a vox media network \u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.
