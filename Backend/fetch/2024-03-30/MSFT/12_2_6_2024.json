    "text": "Sat, Mar 30, 2024 | Ramadan 20, 1445 Published: Tue 6 Feb 2024, 7:43 PM Satya Nadella marks his tenth year as Microsoft CEO on Sunday, capping a decade of stunning growth as he pivoted the slow-moving software giant into a laser focus on cloud computing and artificial intelligence. Microsoft\u2019s stock has soared by more than 1,000 per cent since Nadella took the helm in 2014, compared to the more gradual 185 per cent growth of the broader S&P 500. Microsoft now has a market value of $3 trillion \u2014 more than any US publicly traded company, including its longtime rival Apple. \u201cNadella\u2019s had the biggest transformation of a tech company potentially ever,\u201d said Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives. \u201cThe only one that would rival it was (Steve) Jobs coming back to Apple and turning it around with the iPhone.\u201d Microsoft has created $2.8 trillion in shareholder wealth in the past decade, meaning an investor who bought a $10,000 stake in Microsoft at the time Nadella took over and did nothing with those shares, would have a stake worth about $113,000 now. \u201cOur industry does not respect tradition \u2014 it only respects innovation,\u201d Nadella told employees in an inaugural memo 10 years ago, an opening salvo that hinted at bigger shifts to come. Microsoft declined requests for an interview. Now a hero to Wall Street, some were at first sceptical that such transformation could come from an insider who\u2019d already spent 22 years at the Redmond, Washington company. He\u2019s only the third Microsoft CEO, following Steve Ballmer, who lasted for 14 years, and Bill Gates, who co-founded the company in 1975 and took it public in 1986. Big changes came quickly under Nadella. He marshalled resources to build up the Azure cloud computing platform, a shift in priorities from the company\u2019s long-time reliance on its flagship Windows operating system and the royalties it gets for each PC sold with it. And he largely put the brakes on Microsoft\u2019s ill-fated attempts to play catch-up in the smartphone market, marked by his predecessor Ballmer\u2019s $7.3 billion acquisition of Nokia\u2019s phone business. But some of the biggest changes were in the company\u2019s culture, a shift away from Microsoft\u2019s brash external reputation and internal bickering to a more collaborative approach that Nadella has modelled in his own collegial personality and engineer\u2019s mindset. \u201cMicrosoft is known for rallying the troops with competitive fire,\u201d Nadella said in his 2017 autobiography. \u201cThe press loves that, but it\u2019s not me.\u201d Much of Nadella\u2019s strength is how he stands out from the typical \u201cvery strong ego CEO,\u201d said Raimo Lenschow, a stock analyst at Barclays who covers 36 tech companies. Instead of making bold pronouncements, Lenschow said Nadella takes a more measured approach to explaining \u201cwhere he thinks the future is going.\u201d And \u201cwhether it\u2019s the person making food in the cafeteria, an engineer, finance executive, a customer, he treats everyone in the same way, with respect,\u201d said Ives. It\u2019s not just Wall Street analysts who think so. A tiny startup from Zeeland, Michigan, running a booth at January\u2019s CES gadget show in Las Vegas caught a glimpse of Nadella\u2019s curiosity when he showed up, shook founder Tim Murphy\u2019s hand and asked for a demo. The product, Audio Radar, visualises the sounds in video games for deaf and hard of hearing players. \u201cHe\u2019s very down to earth,\u201d said Murphy, who was there with a small crew including his teen son. \u201cI gave him the pitch, played some games, and he was like, \u2018It\u2019s wonderful what you\u2019re doing.\u2019 Honestly, I can\u2019t really remember too much of what he said because I was just kind of shocked.\u201d Nadella has long made the accessibility of technology a priority, informed in part by his experience raising a son who was visually impaired, quadriplegic and had cerebral palsy. Zain Nadella died in 2022. What\u2019s brought Microsoft to its latest heights is its emergence as an artificial intelligence leader, setting the agenda on how AI tools could get used in work and society. While Nadella has been emphasising AI for most of his tenure, its role was not guaranteed and happened after years of careful planning that led to a close partnership with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI. (OpenAI pays The Associated Press an undisclosed fee to license its archive of news stories). \u201cHistorically, if you\u2019re a cool startup that was doing something amazing, Microsoft wasn\u2019t really your first choice,\u201d Lenschow said. \u201cSo the fact that he got OpenAI to commit to Azure was an amazing masterstroke ... it gives him a massive, competitive advantage over Google and Amazon.\u201d That position was put in jeopardy late last year when OpenAI\u2019s board of directors suddenly fired CEO Sam Altman. A weekend of behind-the-scenes manoeuvres and a threatened mass exodus of employees championed by Nadella helped bring back Altman and stabilise the startup, assuaging clients and shareholders. Nadella\u2019s tenure hasn\u2019t been without hiccups, especially given how much of the world relies so heavily on Microsoft products \u2014 sometimes to the frustration of people using them. Cybersecurity experts say its tendency is to sacrifice security for convenience, including in its gung-ho rollout of AI large language models. The company\u2019s trademark suite of work tools, Microsoft Office 365, has also been penetrated successfully in recent years in embarrassing high-profile compromises that have seen elite Russian and Chinese cyber operators access the email accounts of senior US officials and members of Microsoft\u2019s senior leadership team. It stepped in to provide cloud hosting to Ukraine just ahead of Russia\u2019s 2022 invasion, but the networks serving NATO allies are constantly peppered by intrusion attempts. That, and the worsening ransomware scourge, have led Nadella to call for a cyber Geneva Convention with Russia and China. And despite Nadella\u2019s stated aversion to \u201ccompetitive fire,\u201d Microsoft is once again drawing the kind of antitrust scrutiny that dogged Gates and Ballmer in earlier years. Nadella\u2019s confident testimony at a federal court hearing last summer helped persuade a judge not to block Microsoft\u2019s purchase of video game giant Activision Blizzard, but the company is now facing another round of questions on its partnership with OpenAI. None of those challenges are likely to push Nadella, 56, who made $48.5 million in total compensation last year and has also chaired Microsoft\u2019s board since 2021, out of his leadership roles anytime soon. \u201cFrom everything I can gather, he\u2019s really enjoying himself,\u201d Lenschow said. \u201cWe\u2019re in very, very, very interesting times. I would expect him to stay for a while.\u201d Get news and views from the world of golf delivered to your inbox every Wednesday. business The UAE already has a 10-year Golden Visa programme for investors, entrepreneurs, property buyers and outstanding students since 2019 business business UAE authorities showcase a forward-thinking approach to harnessing and regulating the sector business business Transaction to finance gas carriers for Al Seer Marine and BGN business business Dubai\u2019s exhibitions, conferences, seminars and business events sector has recorded a 25% business business Gllit seeks to simplify real estate transactions by directly connecting homebuyers and tenants business business Ahmad Bin Shafar: Empower focuses on increasing market share in the UAE business business Too many choices in the digital world can create confusion during decision-making business business Venture capital market in the UAE is experiencing significant growth and development business "
