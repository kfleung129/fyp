The company experienced a good quarter with solid growth and strong margins. The company is benefiting from its investments in artificial intelligence. Microsoft is deeply entrenched within its customer base, has high switching costs, and is benefiting from growth tailwinds such as cloud computing and artificial intelligence. We think an underappreciated strength of Microsoft\u2019s business model is that not only are its products designed to work together, but it is also more economical for the customer when multiple products are bundled together. This bundling approach positions Microsoft well to gain market share over time.\" Roman Pyshchyk/Shutterstock.c.om Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is in first position on our list of\u00a030 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds.
