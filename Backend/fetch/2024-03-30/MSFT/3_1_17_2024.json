By Aaron Raj | 17 January, 2024 Microsoft wants to ensure users get the most out of generative AI, not least because it\u2019s fundamentally embedded in large-scale investments in the technology through OpenAI. There is no denying that AI will continue its growth and adoption. In fact, Gartner predicts generative AI is due to make people \u201cbetter and more powerful\u201d in the relatively short term. Individuals can use generative AI to create better resumes, reports, work products and even interactions with others. By 2027, the productivity value of AI in the workplace is expected to be recognized as a primary economic indicator of national power, largely due to widespread gains in workforce productivity. Muhammad Zulhusni | 8 January, 2024 Recognising as much, Microsoft is\u00a0 introducing several new features to Copilot. Since unveiling Copilot, Microsoft has continued to develop the technology, launching new features almost every quarter. The latest features announced would allow Microsoft customers, be they businesses or individuals, to have better opportunities and access to making the most of AI on their devices. In a blog post, Yusuf Mehdi, executive vice president, consumer chief marketing officer at Microsoft, said that Copilot has already worked on more than 5 billion chats and more than 5 billion images to date. For Microsoft, the increased usage can be divided into two categories of users. The first would be those who want rapid access to AI. These include creators, researchers and programmers. The second would be those who want to use Copilot for personal projects and such. Microsoft wants to make Copilot \u201cthe everyday AI companion\u201d to millions of people around the world. Microsoft is introducing three key updates to Copilot. This first is Copilot GPTs. Copilot GPTs let users customize the behavior of Copilot on a topic that is of particular interest to them. The Copilot GPT builds on Microsoft\u2019s partnership with OpenAI. The GPTs, which will start rolling out, will have specific purposes such as fitness, travel, cooking and more. Microsoft also unveiled the Copilot mobile app for both Android and iOS devices. The Copilot app gives users the power of Copilot on the go as their Copilot queries and chats will roam across users\u2019 phones and PCs. The Copilot mobile app includes the same capabilities as Copilot on the PC including access to GPT-4, Dall-E 3 for image creation, and the ability to use images from your phone when chatting with Copilot. The third feature is more for business. Microsoft is adding Copilot to the Microsoft 365 mobile app for Android and iOS for individuals with a Microsoft account. This new feature is rolling out over the next month. Access Copilot right inside the app and easily export the content users create to a Word or PDF document.

Copilot Pro is a new premium subscription service for individuals that provides a higher tier of service for AI capabilities, brings Copilot AI capabilities to Microsoft 365 Personal and Family subscribers, and new capabilities, such as the ability to create Copilot GPTs. Microsoft is also announcing the general availability of Copilot app for iOS and Android phones. Finally, Microsoft will bring Copilot for Microsoft 365 to more commercial customers by expanding the availability to businesses of all sizes, including small- and medium-sized businesses, starting today. With a subscription price of US$20 per month, Copilot Pro is expected to deliver more advanced features and capabilities to individuals. Specifically, users will get a single AI experience that runs across their devices, understanding their context on the web, on their PC and across their apps. It will be soon available on their mobile devices as well. Users will also get priority access to the very latest models, including GPT-4 Turbo as well as access to enhanced AI image creation with Image Creator from Designer. Moreover, they will have the ability to build their own Copilot GPT. \u00a0Copilot GPT is a customized Copilot tailored for a specific topic, with just a simple set of prompts. Businesses will be able to leverage the new updates offered by Copilot for Microsoft 365. (Source \u2013 Microsoft). While individuals can make the most out of Copilot Pro, businesses will be able to leverage the new updates offered by Copilot for Microsoft 365. Despite only being launched to enterprises in November 2023, 40% of the Fortune 100 participated in Microsoft\u2019s Early Access Program, and since GA for enterprise, customers like Visa, BP, Honda, Pfizer, and partners like Accenture, KPMG and PwC are already using Copilot. \u201cThis means thousands of people across industries and sectors have started working in new ways, with an AI-powered copilot at their side. Today we are excited to announce that Copilot for Microsoft 365 is now available for organizations of all sizes \u2014 with no seat minimum. We are also enabling our partners to help every business become AI-powered,\u201d said Mehdi. The new updates announced include the general availability of Copilot for Microsoft 365 to small businesses. Microsoft 365 Business Premium and Business Standard Customers can purchase between one and 299 seats for US$30 per person per month. Microsoft is also removing the 300-seat purchase minimum\u00a0for commercial plans and making Copilot available for\u00a0Office 365 E3 and E5\u00a0customers. Commercial customers can now purchase Copilot for Microsoft 365 through the network of\u00a0Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider partners. \u201cCopilot for Microsoft 365 is even more powerful for organizations because it works across your entire universe of data at work \u2014 including emails, meetings, chats, documents and more, plus the web. With natural language prompts like \u201cTell my team how we updated the product strategy,\u201d Copilot can generate a status update based on the morning\u2019s meetings, emails and chat threads,\u201d added Mehdi. Microsoft has also announced a new, far-reaching 10-year strategic partnership with Vodafone. The partnership leverages their respective strengths in offering scaled digital platforms to more than 300 million businesses, public sector organizations, and consumers across Europe and Africa. Through the partnership, the companies will collaborate to transform Vodafone\u2019s customer experience using Microsoft\u2019s generative AI; hyperscale Vodafone\u2019s leading managed IoT connectivity platform; develop new digital and financial services for businesses, particularly SMEs across Europe and Africa; and overhaul its global data center cloud strategy. Vodafone will invest US$1.5 billion over the next 10 years in cloud and customer-focused AI services developed in conjunction with Microsoft. Additionally, Microsoft will use Vodafone\u2019s fixed and mobile connectivity services. Microsoft also intends to invest in Vodafone\u2019s managed IoT connectivity platform, which will become a separate, standalone business by April 2024. The new company will attract new partners and customers, driving growth in applications and expanding the platform to connect more devices, vehicles and machines.
