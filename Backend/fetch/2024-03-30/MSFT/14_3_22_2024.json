    "text": "     LONDON \u2013 Microsoft has hired Mustafa Suleyman to head up its consumer artificial intelligence business, adding another influential figure to its pool of talent leading the charge to build a technology that Suleyman views as both as a boon and threat to humanity. Suleyman, co-founder of AI research lab DeepMind, said in a LinkedIn post this week that he\u2019ll become CEO of Microsoft AI, leading all the company\u2019s consumer AI products and research, including its generative AI service Copilot as well as its Bing search engine and Edge browser. Microsoft is also hiring the chief scientist at Suleyman\u2019s AI company, Inflection, and several of its top engineers and researchers, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in a blog post. The hirings will likely bolster Microsoft\u2019s lead role in the AI industry. Microsoft has teamed with ChatGPT maker OpenAI, investing billions in the San Francisco company, and recently partnered with France\u2019s Mistral, a hot AI startup. Suleyman co-founded the DeepMind AI research lab, which Google purchased in 2014, and worked there until 2022, when he left to set up Inflection.ai with LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman in an effort to create AI that won\u2019t veer into racist, sexist or violent behavior. He also co-wrote a book, \u201cThe Coming Wave,\u201d that examines AI\u2019s promise and the need to limit its potential perils. Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
