    "text": "Microsoft has announced an update for its Edge browser to fix a bug that imported tabs and browsing data of users from Google Chrome without permission. The setting in the previous case was not syncing correctly across devices which led to the malfunctioning of automatic imports, Microsoft noted. Redmond-headquartered tech giant Microsoft has announced an update for its internet browser Edge to fix a bug that imported tabs and browsing data of users from Google Chrome without permission. In one case, the bug opened the tabs in the Edge browser which were otherwise active in Chrome after a routine Windows update restart, according to The Verge. While the company did not share a statement with the news outlet in the past, the bug was recently fixed in the stable build update.  \nThe setting in the previous case was not syncing correctly across devices which led to the malfunctioning of automatic imports. In the past, the company has also adopted tactics such as pinning Edge to the Windows taskbar without user consent and prompts that ask you to stick with Microsoft's offering when you head out to download Google Chrome from the internet browser. \n\nAlso Read:\u00a0Copilot In Microsoft Shopping To Review Summaries, What's New In Microsoft Edge's AI Suite | Know Here  \n\"Edge has a feature that provides an option to import browser data on each launch from other browsers with user consent. This feature's state might not have been syncing and displaying correctly across multiple devices. This is fixed,\" Microsoft said. The Stable Channel update will roll out \"over one or more days.\"  \nThe update to address the sync issue will roll out for all Microsoft Edge users soon.

The report noted that the company adopted several ways such as opening links in Edge once a user clicks on a link from the Windows Widgets or search results. \nAlso Read:\u00a0Microsoft To Bring 'Next Wave Of AI Innovation' With These Cutting-Edge Features In New Bing\nAmong the recent tweaks in the search browser include the Copilot AI chat engine with default integration in the UI. While it might help some users, the other group who prefers a different search engine will get better independence with the arrival of the Digital Markets Act (DMA) in the EU. The new draft legislation will let users of Windows 11 remove the Edge browser and extend more controls to alternative search services from providers like Google.
