The technology giant\u2019s stock reached $427.81 in intraday trading Thursday, and ended at $425.22, according to Investor\u2019s Business Daily. It last reached a record high on Feb. 9 when its stock hit $420.82. Microsoft said Wednesday its Microsoft Copilot for Security tool, which will launch worldwide on April 1, is the AI industry\u2019s \u201cfirst generative AI solution\u201d for security and IT professionals\u201d and is trained on \u201clarge-scale data and threat intelligence\u201d including over 78 trillion security signals that the company processes daily. Security analysts reported being 22% faster with Copilot for Security, and 7% reported their work being more accurate with the tool, according to an economic study by the company. Vasu Jakkal, corporate vice president of security, compliance, identity, and management at Microsoft told Quartz cyber attackers are using large language models (LLMs) to become more productive. For example, they may employ AI tools like ChatGPT to do reconnaissance on people and companies to find security vulnerabilities, improve coding skills and password cracking, and to spread misinformation. \u201cIt fundamentally boils down to finding information and directly launching these attacks to strengthen their own positions of influence and get economic advantage,\u201d Jakkal said about nation-state and financial crime actors targeting companies in cyberattacks. But while Microsoft is developing its own AI tools, some employees reportedly think its AI work is too centered on its multi-year, multi-billion dollar partnership with OpenAI. \u201cThe former Azure AI is basically just tech support for OpenAI,\u201d a former Microsoft executive said, according to a Business Insider report. \u201cEric Boyd [corporate vice president of Microsoft\u2019s Azure AI Platform] is effectively maintaining the OpenAI service. It\u2019s less of an innovation engine than it once was. Now it\u2019s more IT for OpenAI. The beating heart of innovation is elsewhere.\u201d Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.  "
