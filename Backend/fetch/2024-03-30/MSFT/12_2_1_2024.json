    "text": " My Apple stock analysis suggests AAPL stock is a buy on any weakness Advertisement Source: Yalcin Sonat / Shutterstock.com Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the only public company with a $3 trillion market capitalization, $130 million higher than Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). While both companies have wonderful businesses, AAPL stock analysis suggests it might fall behind Microsoft in 2024. What can Apple shareholders like Warren Buffett do about the fact Microsoft is killing it in the all-important area of artificial intelligence? There isn\u2019t anything they can do except wait for CEO Tim Cook to come up with a product that drives revenue like AI will. In the meantime, MSFT stock has more than doubled Apple\u2019s performance over the past year (65% for the former compared to 30% for the latter) and looks ready to widen the lead in 2024. What are analysts saying about the gap in the two companies\u2019 valuations? Is there any hope for Apple shareholders that 2024 won\u2019t be sideways to a lower type of year in the markets? Let\u2019s consider what the analysts say about Apple\u2019s current problem. CNBC recently reported comments from TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. According to the analyst, iPhone sales, especially in China, will likely fall in 2024, as much as 15%. \u201cKuo wrote that Apple\u2019s weekly shipments in China have fallen by 30% to 40% from a year earlier in recent weeks, \u2018and this downward trend is expected to continue,\u2019 CNBC reported Kuo\u2019s comments on Jan. 30. \u2018Apple may have the most significant decline among the major global mobile phone brands in 2024.\u2019\u201d Between foldable phones and Huawei\u2019s comeback in China, Apple\u2019s been pushed in the past year like never before. It will need to respond to the competitive threats facing its biggest moneymaker. According to Yahoo Finance data, the analyst estimate for Apple\u2019s revenue in the latest quarter is $108.77 billion, 7% lower than a year earlier. That\u2019s on top of a 5% decline in Q1 2023. Not every estimate has Apple\u2019s iPhone revenue declining in Q1 2024. A Reuters report from Jan. 31 suggested that its quarterly iPhone sales rose 3%, the best growth in five quarters. However, almost all Apple analysts expect 2024 to be a challenging year for iPhone sales. As a result, its Services segment will have to do much of the heavy lifting in 2024. In Q1 2024, LSEG expects revenue from the segment, including advertising, App Store, Apple Music, Apple TV+, etc., to rise 12.5% over last year to $23.4 billion. The segment\u2019s gross margin in Q4 2023 was nearly 71%. It contributes 39% of Apple\u2019s gross profit despite generating less than 18% of revenue. In Q1 2023, its services revenue increased by 6.4%. Generating double the growth a year later would tremendously contribute to the overall business. I suspect advertising has something to do with it. Statista data says Apple\u2019s U.S. ad revenue in 2020 was $2.2 billion. In 2024, it\u2019s expected to be $6.2 billion, with a compound annual growth rate of 29.6%. If it were to maintain this CAGR through 2028, its annual ad revenue would be $17.5 billion, almost as much as its current Services revenue. In March 2023, Investor\u2019s Business Daily discussed how Apple\u2019s ad business was underappreciated. \u201c\u2018We believe Apple advertising on its own apps is underappreciated,\u2019 Barclays analyst Tim Long said in a note to clients Tuesday. \u2018Most ad revenues are generated on the App Store, with some contribution from News and Stocks. This could expand to other apps like Maps, TV+, Podcasts, etc.,\u2019\u201d IBD reported. Long\u2019s estimate for ad revenue is $19 billion by 2026, $1.5 billion higher than my estimate above, but two years earlier. While analysts might be worried about its upcoming Q1 2024 report, it\u2019s clear that Services won\u2019t be a part of the growth deficit facing Apple in 2024. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any question that Apple remains a formidable tech company. That said, it\u2019s clear that its Products business is facing revenue headwinds that should limit its growth. As I write this, AAPL stock has barely moved in 2024, up slightly over 1%. It reports earnings on Feb. 1 after the close. By the time this is published, the results could already be out. Apple stock trades at 7.8x sales, which isn\u2019t cheap relative to its five-year average. However, compared to Microsoft\u2019s multiple of 13.4x, it\u2019s the value play of the two. Should AAPL stock fall on its earnings news, long-term investors shouldn\u2019t hesitate to buy on weakness.
