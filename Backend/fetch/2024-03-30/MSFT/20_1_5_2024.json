    "text": "Update font size. Reset  Microsoft is poised to retake the title of the world\u2019s most valuable company from Apple after a bad start to the new year by the Mac-maker. Emily Bary for MarketWatch:\n \u200e Now valued at $2.73 trillion, Microsoft s worth about $100 billion less than Apple, which is valued at $2.83 trillion. Apple hasn\u2019t been worth less than Microsoft since a 14-session stretch that ended Nov. 17, 2021, and the market-cap gap hasn\u2019t been this small since Nov. 22, 2021. Microsoft\u2019s stock is coming off a slightly stronger year than Apple\u2019s, having risen 57% in 2023 as compared with 48% for Apple. Microsoft shares have also seen slimmer losses to start 2024. The rally in Microsoft shares comes as enterprise spending has held up, aiding the company\u2019s Azure cloud-computing business. Azure has also benefited from the artificial-intelligence frenzy\u2026 Microsoft\u2019s business is levered to AI in other ways\u2026 Apple, meanwhile, has seen its business stagnate in recent quarters as the company deals with heightened competition in China and general macroeconomic pressure that is weighing on consumer spending. \u200e\nMacDailyNews Take: Apple\u2019s next earnings report and executive commentary will tell the story. Based on historical earnings dates, Apple is expected to announce earnings between January 26, 2024 and February 02, 2024 (the company has not yet set a date for the release of Q124 results).\n \u200e\nPlease help support MacDailyNews.

Honestly, all Apple products looks like they come from a conservative company afraid of risk and unsure of where to go next. Is it VR goggles? Not convinced. This isn\u2019t surprising.  MS, for a number of yrs,  has been regularly putting efforts into new ventures.  Just heard this morn they will be working with hardware vendors to have a command option on machines to employ \u201ctheir\u201d ChatGPT.  Apple has been iterative for a long time\u2013unreleased Vision Pro\u2013is an exception.  Apple seems MUCH more interested in content\u2026where they do seem vigorously involved.  The migration of top employees AWAY f/ Apple probably tells a lot more than the outsider can see. Haven\u2019t they taken over 500B in buy backs off the table? So yea, not surprising. Imagine if MSFT had kept its 5% of AAPL\u2026 Maybe Apple should start marketing to White people again. Maybe Apple should market based on pure qualitative & truth substance, instead of woke garbage, which is driven by \u201cwe know what\u2019s best for you and the World,\u201d hubris? Tim Cook\u2019s Apple will struggle to figure AI out. Tim is too worried that an Apple branded AI will recommend or promote \u201cfake news\u201d or an unapproved narrative. AI is in the early days wild Wild West and it\u2019s impossible to control its output without diminishing its functionality. No one is interested in a Tim Cook approved AI model. On the other hand Microsoft\u2019s buy into open A.i. was strategically brilliant. Microsoft will overtake Apple in market value as Tim struggles with reality This site uses Akismet to reduce spam.
