Read more Key notes Microsoft Outlook is one of the most popular email providers out there. Lots of organizations and businesses use it, especially now that it has\u00a0Copilot AI, but there\u2019s one thing that needs to be patched: sometimes, it sends out hidden attendees\u2019 details when forwarding. The problem is, that whenever you forward a meeting invitation in Outlook, even when the participant list is initially hidden, the new recipient can still receive the full list of original participants. It poses an obvious privacy concern because it can expose their emails without consent. Folks online are calling it a\u00a0major privacy bug\u00a0and privacy flaw, but it is actually by design. You can only hide attendees\u2019 details while creating the event. Once it\u2019s created, you can\u2019t hide it when you forward or send updates. Of course, it\u2019s not an ideal situation when you have a meeting or some information that isn\u2019t intended for \u201cthe new guy\u201d to know who else gets the email. And in fact, that\u2019s not the only privacy concern Outlook has been subject to in the past few weeks. Not too long ago, we reported that Proton Mail, an encrypted email service,\u00a0raised concerns\u00a0over Microsoft\u2019s way of handling data collection in Outlook and how over\u00a0800 third parties\u00a0have used its data for (mainly) advertising purposes, among other things.
