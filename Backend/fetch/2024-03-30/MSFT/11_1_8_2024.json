    "text": "Microsoft Copilot, the company\u2019s recently launched AI chatbot built with OpenAI technologies, does not yet appear to be siphoning users away from OpenAI\u2019s own ChatGPT, according to a new analysis of app store data. Copilot, which combines an AI chatbot with an Image Creator feature powered by DALL-E 3, is notable for offering free access to OpenAI\u2019s newer GPT-4 technology \u2014 something that OpenAI charges for in ChatGPT, which runs on GPT-3.5. Given it\u2019s a free alternative, it\u2019s somewhat surprising that Copilot\u2019s launch hasn\u2019t seemingly impacted ChatGPT\u2019s installs or revenue as of yet \u2014 but that could be explained by the lack of promotion. App store intelligence provider Appfigures, which ran the new analysis, theorizes that Copilot\u2019s launch has been largely unnoticed by potential consumers, something that could be due to several factors. Microsoft\u2019s app first launched on Google Play on December 20, but in the first few days, it wasn\u2019t ranked at all, most likely because there was no promotion on the Play Store during this time. The app then launched on the App Store on December 28, but isn\u2019t using Apple\u2019s Search Ads to gain attention from potential iOS users. With Search Ads, Copilot could be returned as a top search result when users keyed in related terms like \u201cAI chatbot\u201d or even \u201cChatGPT.\u201d But Microsoft doesn\u2019t appear to be leveraging this ad opportunity. Image Credits: Appfigures Image Credits: Appfigures To date, Copilot has only seen 2.1 million downloads across iOS and Android (as of January 5, 2024). Daily downloads peaked at 413,000 and have since slowed, the data indicates. On January 5, the app saw only 194,000 total installs, for example. The U.S. is Copilot\u2019s largest market with 24% of downloads, followed by Germany, India, Italy, and the U.K. Unlike some apps, Copilot\u2019s installs are also somewhat evenly split across iOS and Android, with 59% on Google Play versus 41% on the App Store. According to Appfigures, ChatGPT\u2019s downloads have also been slowing in December \u2014 but this started before Copilot\u2019s release. During the time that Copilot was amassing its 2.1 million installs, ChatGPT gained another 4.2 million downloads. The firm told TechCrunch there\u2019s nothing to indicate that Copilot itself is having any impact on ChatGPT\u2019s installs or its revenue, the latter of which continues to rise, in fact. As of ChatGPT\u2019s first anniversary in November, its mobile apps had netted nearly $30 million in revenue. Some other apps have more successfully monetized on mobile, but ChatGPT\u2019s subscription service can also be bought on the web, where many of its users prefer to interact with the AI chatbot. So mobile revenue is not a complete picture. ChatGPT was a breakout success at launch, topping 500,000 downloads in its first six days. Though that record was later beaten by Instagram Threads, the AI chatbot\u2019s launch was still one of the highest-performing app releases of the past couple of years, having been previously topped only by the February 2022 arrival of Trump-backed Truth Social. Copilot, meanwhile, is not seeing the same attention \u2014 perhaps because ChatGPT already has a devoted install base that isn\u2019t interested in a switch, or because the holiday launch and lack of promotion meant many potential users missed the news of its arrival. Some may also find the Bing-heavy integration undesirable, though there\u2019s no way to tell how many considered, but then did not download, Copilot in that case. In any event, Copilot has yet to unseat ChatGPT from its AI chatbot throne. In the meantime, Microsoft is finding other ways to put the AI tech to use \u2014 including via the addition of a Copilot button on PCs. "
