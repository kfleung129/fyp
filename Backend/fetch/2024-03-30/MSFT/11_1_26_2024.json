For years, Apple and Microsoft have been switching places as the world\u2019s most valuable company, in terms of market capitalization. In today\u2019s chart, we explore this history, as well as key events over the past two decades, based on data from CompaniesMarketCap and both companies. Data is from January 16, 2024. During the 1990s, Microsoft capitalized on the success of Windows, supplanting General Electric as the most valuable company in the U.S. in the process. Around the same time, Apple was on the brink of bankruptcy due to intense competition in the personal computer market, high product pricing, and a lack of innovation. The company also suffered from numerous failed attempts to modernize the Macintosh operating system (Mac OS) and the failed launches of products like QuickTake digital cameras, PowerCD portable CD, audio players, speakers, and the Pippin video game console. Over the next decade, however, after the return of Steve Jobs as the CEO, Apple\u2019s stock performance was legendary. This can be attributed to the success of products such as the iMac, iPod, and iPhone, the launch of the famous \u201cThink Different\u201d advertising brand campaign, and opening the Apple Store retail chain. In 2004, Microsoft had a market cap of $291 billion compared to Apple\u2019s $26 billion. By the end of that decade, Apple would reach $297 billion, surpassing its rival ($234 billion). *As of January 2024 Since then, the top spot has been most often held by Apple. The company only fell behind Microsoft in 2018 when concerns about COVID-driven supply chain shortages affected the iPhone maker\u2019s stock price. More recently, the Apple vs. Microsoft race was shaken up once again. Microsoft became the world\u2019s most valuable company in January 2024, after the rival iPhone maker\u2019s shares had a weak start to the year due to growing concerns over demand in China. Microsoft\u2019s shares have also been strongly buoyed by the company\u2019s early lead in generative artificial intelligence, mainly thanks to its early investment in ChatGPT-maker OpenAI.

In today\u2019s fast-paced world, internet speed isn\u2019t just a convenience\u2014it\u2019s the driving force behind how we work, play, and connect. In this map, we illustrate median download speeds in each global region, based on data from the World Bank\u2019s Digital Progress and Trends Report 2023. According to the World Bank, download speeds in high-income countries increased significantly between 2019 and 2023, while speeds in lower-income countries stagnated. As of 2022, North America and East Asia have the speediest internet. This difference in broadband speeds can mainly be attributed to investment. In 2020, nearly 90% of global telecommunication investment came from East Asia and the Pacific, Europe and Central Asia, and North America. These regions not only concentrate the highest-income population but also the top technology hubs. Meanwhile, low- and middle-income regions such as Latin America and the Caribbean, South Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa accounted for less than 10% of total investment. Most of the investment is directed towards fiber optic and 5G mobile networks. According to the mobile industry association GSMA, mobile operators alone are projected to invest more than $600 billion between 2022 and 2025, with 85% of the total allocated for 5G. In 2023, broadband speeds in high-income countries were 10x faster for fixed connections, and 5x faster for mobile connections compared to those in low-income countries. Fixed broadband connections, which provide high-speed internet to residences or businesses, reached 38% of the population in high-income countries. In comparison, fixed broadband penetration was only 4% of the population in lower-middle-income countries and almost zero in low-income countries.
