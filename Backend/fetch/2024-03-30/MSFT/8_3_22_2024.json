But there\u2019s one big problem: regulators really don\u2019t like when you buy companies. You know they\u2019ll fight like hell to block you from buying this one. What do you do? You do what Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella just did to Inflection, a would-be OpenAI challenger that raised hundreds of millions of dollars and is, for all intents and purposes, no more. This week, both companies announced that most of Inflection\u2019s staff is joining a new AI division at Microsoft led by co-founder Mustafa Suleyman, who now reports directly to Nadella. The only co-founder of Inflection who will remain on the startup\u2019s board is noted Microsoft board member Reid Hoffman.
