The Redmond, Washington-headquartered technology company, named Pavan Davuluri as the new CEO of its Windows and Surface units. Davuluri\u2019s Leadership Assignment After Panay left the company, Microsoft separated Windows and Surface and placed each under the leadership of two different leaders. Davuluri was assigned to lead Surface silicon and device work in this setup, while Mikhail Parakhin took over Windows and web experiences. The management structure was updated, and Davuluri will now lead Windows and Surface businesses. Parakhin is reportedly moving after deciding to explore new roles. CNBC noted that the latest shuffle comes after Mustafa Suleyman of Google DeepMind was named CEO of Microsoft\u2019s AI unit. Announcement from Microsoft According to The Verge, Rajesh Jha, the company\u2019s head of experiences and devices, released a memo for employees to inform everyone about the new Windows organization.

Shilpa Ranganathan and Jeff Johnson and their teams will report directly to Pavan,\u201d Rajesh Jha said in the memo. \u201cThe Windows team will continue to work closely with the Microsoft AI team on AI, silicon, and experiences.
