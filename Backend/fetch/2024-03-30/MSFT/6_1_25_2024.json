    "text": "In a significant market development on Wednesday, Microsoft achieved a milestone by surpassing the $3 trillion valuation mark for the first time. The tech giant secured its position as the second most valuable company globally, trailing just behind Apple.\u00a0Throughout the year, Microsoft and Apple have engaged in a competitive battle for the top spot as the most capitalised stock on Wall Street. In January, the software giant briefly dethroned the iPhone maker, experiencing a momentary leadership shift. During the latest surge, Microsoft shares reached a historic peak of $405.63, reflecting a 1.7 per cent increase. This surge propelled the company's market capitalisation above the $3 trillion threshold. However, by the closing bell, the stock retreated to $402.56, resulting in a valuation of $2.99 trillion\u2014just shy of the crucial $403.65 mark required to maintain the $3 trillion status. Contrastingly, Apple's shares relinquished some of their earlier gains, concluding with a 0.35 per cent decline at $194.50. Despite the dip, Apple retained its status as a $3 trillion company, according to data from LSEG. Microsoft's strategic positioning in the market dominance race within the realm of generative artificial intelligence (AI) is notably underscored by its investment in OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT. This move positions Microsoft as a frontrunner alongside other tech giants such as Google owner Alphabet, Amazon.com, Oracle, and Meta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook. Leveraging OpenAI's technology, Microsoft has introduced updated versions of its flagship productivity software and revamped its Bing search engine. These advancements are poised to enhance Microsoft's competitiveness, especially in comparison to Google's dominant search offering.
