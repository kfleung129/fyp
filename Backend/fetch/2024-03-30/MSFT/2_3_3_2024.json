    "text": " Put MSFT stock in your portfolio for premium AI-market exposure Advertisement Source: gguy / Shutterstock.com Microsoft\u00a0(NASDAQ:MSFT), with its investment in ChatGPT developer OpenAI, is already a powerful competitor in the field of artificial intelligence\u00a0technology. Yet, there are still areas for Microsoft to conquer and ways for the company to evolve and expand. For the long run, my MSFT stock analysis envisions much higher prices and rich rewards for patient investors. Microsoft\u00a0enhanced its Bing search and Edge browser, as well as the company\u2019s\u00a0Copilot assistant, with the latest and greatest in AI functionalities. So, what should Microsoft stockholders expect the company to do next? Stay tuned. (and definitely stay invested) as Microsoft\u2019s greatest inroads into the wide-open AI-tech field could come in 2024 and 2025. Here\u2019s a move that\u2019s undeniably brilliant. According to a Reuters report (citing The Information), Microsoft\u00a0is developing a network card which could reduce the company\u2019s dependence on Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). Potentially, the new network card will improve the performance of its Microsoft\u2019s Maia AI server chip. Microsoft introduced this server chip in November, and it\u2019s designed to support AI applications and large language models. This new network card could be compared\u00a0to Nvidia\u2019s ConnectX-7 card. However, Reuters reported that Microsoft\u2019s new \u201cequipment could take more than a year to develop.\u201d Even if it takes a while to develop this network card, this is still a savvy move for Microsoft. It\u2019s cost-effective for the company to keep its production process in-house as much as possible. And who knows? Maybe Microsoft\u00a0will be able to produce AI-compatible network cards for other tech-hardware companies at some point. Move over, Nvidia! Truly, Microsoft\u2019s quest for AI-industry dominance isn\u2019t limited to U.S. borders. In November, for example, the company disclosed its plans to invest 2.5 billion pounds during the next three years to expand AI-compatible data centers across the United Kingdom. If you thought this would be Microsoft\u2019s only AI push in the European continent, think again. Just recently, Microsoft revealed its intentions to invest in AI in Germany as well as in Spain. The news is coming fast and furious from Microsoft, and investors ought to be excited about this. In Germany, Microsoft plans to \u201cinvest 3.2 billion euros ($3.44 billion) in Germany in the next two years,\u201d according to Reuters, \u201cmostly\u201d in AI. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz expressed his enthusiastic support for this planned AI investment from Microsoft. In Spain, meanwhile, Reuters stated that Microsoft \u201cwill expand\u201d its AI and \u201ccloud infrastructure in Spain through an investment of $2.1 billion in the next two years.\u201d Microsoft Vice Chair and President Brad Smith touted this investment as part of the company\u2019s \u201c37-year commitment to Spain, its security, and development and digital transformation of its government, businesses, and people.\u201d Clearly, Microsoft\u00a0is making all the right moves in advancing its position as a global AI leader. First of all, Microsoft is reducing its dependence on Nvidia by developing its own AI-enabled network card. In addition, Microsoft is establishing its AI-market footprint in multiple European nations through strategic investments. My MSFT stock analysis calls for an extended rally in this year and in the coming years. Ultimately, to get prime AI exposure in your portfolio, a share position in Microsoft\u00a0is an absolute must.
