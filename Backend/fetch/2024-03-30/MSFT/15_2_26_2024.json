Read more Key notes Mistral, one of the most exciting, up-and-coming AI companies, has finally announced its AI-powered chatbot,\u00a0Le Chat. A ChatGPT competitor, Le Chat is said to be built as a \u201cconversational entry point to interact with the various models from Mistral AI\u201d like Mistral Large, Small, or Next. The chatbot itself is now rolling out for beta, and you can use it by signing up as\u00a0a beta tester. The AI start-up is also offering an \u201centerprise\u201d version with \u201cself-deployment capacities and fine-grained moderation mechanisms.\u201d Similar to ChatGPT, which offers free and paid tiers, Le Chat also has both free and paid options. However, unlike ChatGPT\u2019s $20 monthly fee for its \u201cPlus\u201d version, Le Chat uses a pay-per-use model based on tokens. Le Chat\u2019s pricing varies depending on the chosen model. The most affordable option, the open-mistral-7b, costs $0.25 per million tokens for both input and output. Meanwhile, the more powerful mistral-large-2402 model costs $8 per million tokens for input and $24 per million tokens for output. Interestingly, though, Microsoft and French AI startup Mistral have\u00a0recently struck a deal\u00a0to accelerate its AI development. The deal, whose financial details are still being kept under wrap, sends a clear message that OpenAI is not Microsoft\u2019s \u201cgolden child\u201d and the Redmond company isn\u2019t completely monopolizing AI. Just like OpenAI, Mistral is now the second company to offer commercial language models on Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud platform. The French company is now worth around \u20ac2 billion, and for comparison, Microsoft has\u00a0poured at least US$13 billion\u00a0into OpenAI since 2019.
