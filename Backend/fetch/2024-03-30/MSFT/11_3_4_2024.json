You follow Tale of the Tape - edit You follow Zacks Equity Research - edit Zacks Equity Research Tale of the Tape Microsoft (MSFT Quick QuoteMSFT  -  Free Report)     has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term. Over the past month, shares of this software maker have returned +1%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4.8% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Software industry, which Microsoft falls in, has gained 3.2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction? While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making. Earnings Estimate Revisions Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock. We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements. Microsoft is expected to post earnings of $2.84 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +1.4%. For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $11.63 points to a change of +18.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.8%. For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $13.15 indicates a change of +13.1% from what Microsoft is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.8%. Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Microsoft is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate: 12 Month EPS Revenue Growth Forecast Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial. For Microsoft, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $60.66 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +14.8%. For the current and next fiscal years, $243.69 billion and $277.54 billion estimates indicate +15% and +13.9% changes, respectively. Last Reported Results and Surprise History Microsoft reported revenues of $62.02 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +17.6%. EPS of $2.93 for the same period compares with $2.32 a year ago. Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $61.03 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.62%. The EPS surprise was +6.16%. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period. Valuation No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance. Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is. As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued. Microsoft is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here  to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade. Bottom Line The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Microsoft. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.

This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1988 it has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +24.15%  per year. These returns cover a period from January 1, 1988 through March 4, 2024. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple, equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zacks Ranks stocks can, and often do, change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available, pricing information was not collected, or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations. Zacks may license the Zacks Mutual Fund rating provided herein to third parties, including but not limited to the issuer.
