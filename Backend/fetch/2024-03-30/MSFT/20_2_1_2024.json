Microsoft\u2019s second quarter earnings for the financial year 2024 have surpassed analysts\u2019 expectations, driven by the intelligent cloud business. The results for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, saw Microsoft\u2019s revenue grow to $62bn, up 18 percent year-on-year (YoY), exceeding analysts\u2019 expectations of $61bn. Intelligent cloud business gave the company a big boost, with its revenue up 20 percent to $25.9bn as server products and cloud services revenue increased by 22 percent \u2013 spurred by Azure and other cloud services revenue growth of 30 percent. Satya Nadella, chairman and CEO of Microsoft, emphasized the role of AI as part of its offering: \u201cWe\u2019ve moved from talking about AI to applying AI at scale. By infusing AI across every layer of our tech stack, we\u2019re winning new customers and helping drive new benefits and productivity gains across every sector.\u201d Over the quarter, the company reached 53,000 Azure AI customers, with over one-third joining Azure over the past 12 months. In the company\u2019s earnings call, Nadella highlighted that Azure again took share this quarter by leaning on the added value of its AI Advantage. \u201cOur new models-as-a-service offering makes it easy for developers to use LLMs from our partners, like Cohere, Meta and Mistral, on Azure without having to manage underlying infrastructure,\u201d said Nadella. \u201cWe have also built the world\u2019s most popular SLMs, which offer performance comparable to larger models but are small enough to run on a laptop or mobile device.\u201d Meanwhile, operating income reached $27.0bn, a 33 percent jump, as net income also increased 33 percent to $21.9bn. Amy Hood, executive vice president and CFO of Microsoft added that robust execution by its sales teams and partners has again driven share gains this quarter across many of the businesses. \u201cStrong execution by our sales teams and partners drove Microsoft Cloud revenue to $33.7bn, up 24 percent (up 22 percent in constant currency) YoY,\u201d\u00a0said Hood. In some of its notable deals from the quarter, Microsoft teamed up with Vodafone in a mammoth new strategic partnership to bring advances in generative AI and the cloud closer to more than 300 million businesses. The company also partnered with the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations to create an open dialogue on AI policy that supports workers. In addition, Microsoft recently announced a collaboration with Eviden, the Atos Group business, to help clients move to the cloud and facilitate their use of Azure OpenAI Service. "
