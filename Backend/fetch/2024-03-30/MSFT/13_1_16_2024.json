    "text": "Vodafone and Microsoft have announced a 10-year contract, with the goal of enhancing business opportunities across Europe and Africa.\nVodafone and Microsoft will be working on elevating Vodafone\u2019s customer experience through the integration of Microsoft\u2019s AI technology. The initiatives under consideration encompass the expansion of Vodafone\u2019s managed Internet of Things (IoT) connectivity platform, the creation of innovative digital and financial services tailored specifically for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) across Europe and Africa, and a comprehensive overhaul of the global data center cloud strategy. As part of this strategic alliance, Vodafone commits an investment of $1.5 billion over the next decade towards the development of cloud and customer-focused AI services in partnership with Microsoft. In return, Microsoft will capitalize on Vodafone\u2019s fixed and mobile connectivity services to fortify its market position. Microsoft will make an undisclosed investment in Vodafone\u2019s managed IoT connectivity platform as part of the deal. Vodafone\u2019s managed IoT business, which is connecting 175 million devices globally, will become an independent, standalone business by April 2024, a news statement from Microsoft said. It will use Azure Cloud. Vodafone Group CEO Margherita Della Valle underscored the significance of this commitment to the digital evolution of Europe and Africa, with a particular emphasis on its impact on small and medium-sized businesses. Microsoft\u2019s Chairman and CEO, Satya Nadella, echoed these sentiments, emphasizing the potential of this novel AI technology to unlock opportunities for organizations globally. Vodafone will be using Microsoft Azure OpenAI to augment customer satisfaction through real-time, proactive, and hyper-personalized experiences across all Vodafone customer touchpoints. Vodafone aims at expanding M-Pesa, Africa\u2019s premier financial technology platform, on Azure, coupled with the launch of a purpose-driven program aimed at enriching the lives of millions of consumers and SMEs across the continent. Vodafone will be distributing Microsoft services, including Azure and security solutions. Vodafone\u2019s strategy is to become Europe\u2019s foremost platform for businesses. Vodafone is also aiming at modernization its data centers on Microsoft Azure, resulting in improved responsiveness to customers, simplified operations, reduced costs, and alignment with sustainable business strategies.
