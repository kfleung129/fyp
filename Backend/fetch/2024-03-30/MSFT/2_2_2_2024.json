    "text": "We have seen some awe-inspiring results from Microsoft MSFT, Meta Platforms META, and Amazon AMZN in recent days that reconfirm their leadership position in this market. These companies, along with their peers in the \u2018Magnificent 7\u2019 group of stocks \u2013 Apple AAPL, Alphabet GOOGL, Tesla TSLA, and Nvidia NVDA \u2013 led the market higher last year, and that momentum has continued this year. Other than Tesla, whose results disappointed the market once again and reflected the fourth quarter in a row of disappointing results, all of the other Mag 7 members that have reported came out with impressive growth numbers. The market wasn\u2019t particularly impressed with the Alphabet and Apple reports, but they came out with Q4 earnings growth of +51.8% and +13.1%, respectively. Tesla\u2019s earnings were down -45.8% in Q3 on +3.5% higher revenues, as the EV-maker continued to grapple with weakening margins in an increasingly competitive EV market. The chart below shows the one-year performance of the Magnificent 7 stocks relative to the S&P 500 index and Tesla.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Using estimates for Nvidia, which will be coming out with its December-quarter results on February 21st, and actual results for the other six members of the group, total Q4 earnings for the group are expected to be up +48.7% from the same period last year on +14.5% higher revenues. The chart below shows the group\u2019s Q4 earnings and revenue growth performance in the context of what we saw from the group in the preceding quarter and what is currently expected for the next three quarters. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research The chart below shows the group\u2019s earnings and revenue growth picture on an annual basis. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Please note that the Mag 7 companies currently account for 28.6% of the S&P 500 index\u2019s total market capitalization and are expected to bring in 19.5% of the index\u2019s total earnings in 2024. For 2023 Q4, the Mag 7 group has a bigger weightage, bringing in 23.1% of all S&P 500 earnings. The chart below shows the group\u2019s earnings contribution to the index over time and what is currently expected for the next two years. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Given their enormous earnings power and growth profiles, it is hard to argue with the group\u2019s market leadership. Importantly, analysts had been raising their estimates for the group even before the December-quarter results, with these numbers now adding to the positive revision momentum. Beyond these mega-cap players, total Q4 earnings for the Technology sector as a whole are expected to be up +24.2% from the same period last year on +8.1% higher revenues. The chart below shows the sector\u2019s Q4 earnings and revenue growth expectations in the context of where growth has been in recent quarters and what is expected in the coming four periods.
