RiverPark Large Growth Fund stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter: \u201cMicrosoft Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:MSFT): MSFT was a top contributor in the quarter following strong FY1Q24 earnings in late October. In that earnings report, MSFT delivered better-than-expected revenue (+13%) and earnings (+27%), with growth in both accelerating from the prior quarter. All three major segments grew revenue faster than expected, highlighted by 28% constant currency growth in Azure, the company\u2019s cloud offering. This marked the first quarter-over-quarter acceleration for Azure in six quarters. Operating margins (48%) were 400 basis points better than expected and earnings came in 13% ahead of expectations. Cloud-based services have become the company\u2019s largest revenue and earnings producer. The company\u2019s Azure platform alone has the potential to grow to more than $100 billion in annual revenue over the next decade. Overall, we believe that the company will continue to deliver double-digit revenue and EPS growth and generate an enormous amount of free cash flow to both return to shareholders and use for acquisitions.\u201d Insider Monkey focuses on uncovering the best investment ideas of hedge funds and insiders.
