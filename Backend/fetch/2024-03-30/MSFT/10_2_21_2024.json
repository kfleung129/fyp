In its company\u00a0blog post, OpenAI disclosed a partnership with Microsoft Threat Intelligence (NASDAQ: MSFT) to crack down on state-backed hacking organizations, which included China-affiliated threat actors Charcoal Typhoon and Salmon Typhoon, Iran\u2019s Crimson Sandstorm, and Russia-affiliated Forest Blizzard. The bad actors reportedly rely on ChatGPT and other OpenAI services to spot coding errors in the architecture of enterprises before installing malware and other trojans. Their key targets are financial, health, and educational institutions. The Chinese-backed entities allegedly used OpenAI to translate technical papers, debug code, and gain insights into the\u00a0cybersecurity tools\u00a0employed by financial institutions. OpenAI\u2019s report indicated a trend of using\u00a0generative AI tools\u00a0to create phishing campaigns and keep up with the activities of regional security agencies. North Korea-affiliated group Emerald Sleet reportedly used OpenAI\u2019s services for scripting tasks and phishing campaigns focused on the Asia-Pacific region. OpenAI also disclosed that Forest Blizzard turned to ChatGPT for research into radar imaging technology and satellite communication. OpenAI has since taken action against accounts affiliated with the state-backed hacking syndicates interacting with its platforms, including putting them on the blacklist and issuing outright bans. However, it downplayed the impact of its services for state-backed hacking entities, akin to pre-existing non-AI-powered tools. \u201cWe terminated accounts associated with state-affiliated threat actors,\u201d read the report. \u201cOur findings show our model offers only limited, incremental capabilities for malicious cybersecurity tasks.\u201d OpenAI\u2019s statement pointed to public transparency and industry collaboration as key to preventing misuse by bad actors while learning from recent incidents of abuse. The company says it is investing heavily in its safety teams to \u201cpursue leads\u201d and spot adversarial use of its content by bad actors. Wreaking havoc in Web3 State-backed actors have left a trail of security breaches in Web3, raking over $1 billion in 2022 from their malware attacks. North Korea\u2019s\u00a0Lazarus Group\u00a0became infamous following its attacks against\u00a0Harmony,\u00a0CoinEX, and\u00a0Atomic Wallet, netting profits into millions of dollars in digital assets. Security experts note the loot from the attacks is used to power North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons program in the face of stifling economic sanctions. To limit their operations, security agencies are teaming up to promote cross-border collaborations and information sharing while blacklisting known members of the hacking organizations. In order for artificial intelligence (AI) to work right within the law and thrive in the face of growing challenges, it needs to integrate an enterprise blockchain system that ensures data input quality and ownership\u2014allowing it to keep data safe while also guaranteeing the immutability of data.\u00a0Check out CoinGeek\u2019s coverage\u00a0on this emerging tech to learn more\u00a0why Enterprise blockchain will be the backbone of AI.

The process of swiftly generating an AI image involves DMD, which allows new AI models to mirror the existing image generators without the hassles of undergoing a \u201c100-stage process.\u201d Learning continues with sCrypt co-founder Yiqiang Wang on the afternoon session of the sCrypt Hackathon 2024, where he discussed how developers can create fungible tokens or NFTs easier with SDK. Overlays are a way to create a shared context by maintaining a subset of transactions, and allowing users to read data from chain using SPV. They also provide a framework for the monetisation of distributed systems presenting new economic opportunities for service providers.
