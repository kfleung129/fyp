Submissions: tips@geekwire.com \u2014\u00a0Longtime Microsoft exec Pavan Davuluri is taking on a new role leading the company\u2019s Surface and Windows divisions, according to a report from The Verge. Following last year\u2019s departure of former chief product officer Panos Panay, Microsoft split up its Surface and Windows groups with separate leaders, including Davuluri, who headed up Surface silicon and devices work. But now the tech giant is bringing the two together again, with Davuluri overseeing the combined group, according to a memo cited by The Verge. As part of the change, Mikhail Parakhin, who was leading a new Windows group focused on \u201cWindows and web experiences,\u201d is exploring a new opportunity, likely outside the company, according to The Verge. The changes follow last week\u2019s hiring of AI pioneer Mustafa Suleyman\u00a0and colleagues from Inflection AI. Suleyman, co-founder of DeepMind, will lead a new organization called Microsoft AI. Davuluri joined Microsoft more than 23 years ago. He recently appeared on stage at an AMD event with AMD CEO Lisa Su in December. We\u2019ve followed up with Microsoft for comment, and will update if we hear back. Update: The company declined to comment. \u2014 Former Zillow Group CEO Spencer Rascoff joined the board of Match Group, the online dating behemoth that owns Tinder, Hinge, and other brands. \u201cSimilar to Zillow Group, Match Group is a multi-brand, mobile-first, category-leading, two-sided marketplace in an important category \u2014 relationships,\u201d Rascoff wrote on LinkedIn.
