You follow Analyst Blog - edit You follow Ritujay Ghosh - edit Ritujay Ghosh Analyst Blog The U.S. videogame industry has been trying to stage a rebound that saw sales rise in 2023, and the momentum continues this year. Cooling inflation and easing price pressure are helping consumers spend more on discretionary items lately, giving a boost to videogame sales. According to a report from the Entertainment Software Association and Circana, spending on videogames in the United States totaled $57.2 billion in 2023, up from $56.6 billion in 2022. This included sales across all categories including physical and digital full-game, downloadable content, portable PC, subscription spending across consoles and virtual reality platforms. Spending on content totaled $48 billion last year, up from $47.5 billion in 2022. This was primarily driven by a 13% jump in digital download spending across console games. Hardware sales were steady, totaling $6.6 billion in 2023, while accessories sales rose 4% to $2.6 billion from $2.5 billion in 2022. Videogame sales hit record highs during the peak of the pandemic, as consumers invested more in indoor entertainment. However, the situation changed fast once the pandemic-led restrictions were lifted and the economy reopened. Options for outdoor entertainment were back. This saw videogame sales decline in 2021, and take a turn for the worse in 2022 as inflationary pressures started hitting consumer spending. The Federal Reserve adopted a strict monetary tightening campaign and hiked interest rates by 525 basis points since March 2022. Higher prices made consumers cut down on spending on discretionary goods. Also, a dearth of good title releases in 2022 further impacted sales. However, inflation started easing from its peak of 9.1% in June 2022 and is now hovering around 3.1%. Easing prices have been helping people spend more freely. Also, last year saw a spate of new title releases, which started attracting gamers to the market. The industry is poised to grow in the near term as the Federal Reserve gears up to start rate cuts this year, which will further ease price pressures.

This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1988 it has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +24.15%  per year. These returns cover a period from January 1, 1988 through March 4, 2024. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple, equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zacks Ranks stocks can, and often do, change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available, pricing information was not collected, or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations. Zacks may license the Zacks Mutual Fund rating provided herein to third parties, including but not limited to the issuer.
