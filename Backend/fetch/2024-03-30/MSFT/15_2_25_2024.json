    "text": "\u201cWhen we set up the company, we were just three colleagues, but we were driven by the strong belief in pushing the boundaries of the cloud services industry. We understood the transformative power of cloud solutions, we saw a gap in the local market for a cloud-first and cloud-only partner and this made us more determined to push the boundaries of what\u2019s possible in the cloud services industry.\u201d Founded in 2021, TriStratus emerged as a visionary Microsoft startup through the collaborative efforts of Kevin Abela, Jonathan Abela, and Asif Akram. United by a shared commitment to innovation and excellence in cloud services, the trio has steered the company into a new era of digital transformation. Today, TriStratus prides itself on being a fully remote company, dedicated to delivering bespoke cloud solutions that empower businesses worldwide. \u201cWe noticed how established IT companies primarily focused on hardware-based solutions and treated cloud services as an offshoot of their business. We recognized the potential to become a cloud-first and cloud-only partner that prioritizes customer needs and drives business success through tailored cloud solutions, and this led us to form the company,\u201d explains Kevin Abela, TriStratus\u2019 managing director. After just three years in operation, TriStratus has just opened its first overseas office in Cairo, Egypt to be able to tap into the Middle East\u2019s potential. By the end of this month, TriStratus will already be employing 26 people. \u201cNot bad for a startup that started operations during the Covid pandemic,\u201d added Abela. TriStratus operates fully as a remote-based company allowing it to serve its clients efficiently from any location. \u201cWe chose to operate like this because we want to practice what we preach. Showing our clients that we can operate as a fully remote-based company encourages them to understand that exceptional cloud services are possible no matter their location.\u201d \u201cWe also feel that eliminating geographical limitations has allowed us to expand our services beyond Malta and serve clients on a regional basis, which was an important factor in our fast growth rate,\u201d he added. Unlike other companies, TriStratus does not believe in migrating customers to the cloud just for the sake of it, but its goal is to ensure they obtain maximum value from adopting the cloud, driving growth, efficiency, and innovation for their businesses. \u201cWe go beyond the technicalities by focusing on a customer-centric approach and by partnering with our clients to understand their unique needs and business goals which enables us to plan and deliver tailored cloud solutions that maximize value for our clients,\u201d he added. In 2023, after just two years of operation, TriStratus was awarded the prestigious Microsoft Partner of the Year Award, a recognition that confirmed the company\u2019s direction and vision for further growth. \u201cWe always believed that this vision can only be accomplished by staying at the forefront of cloud technology, by providing exceptional customer experiences to our partners seeking digital transformation and growth in the cloud era. But leveraging our recognition as Microsoft\u2019s Partner of the Year gave us a stronger competitive advantage.\u201d Abela reminisces about the company\u2019s early days as a Microsoft startup. \u201cWe found in Microsoft all the guidance and support that any startup would be looking for. They helped us keep things real, offered us mentoring and guidance, the technological backing that we required to start and kept assisting us along the way. \u201cI think that no matter how much you believe in your project \u2013 and we did believe in ours \u2013 knowing that you have the backing of a global leader makes all the difference.\u201d \u201cReally and truly, startups operating in Malta can rest assured that the support is all there. Today, so many companies are partnering together, specifically to assist startups across all aspects of running a business. And with the technological backing and mentorship that the Microsoft For Startups Founders Hub can provide, anyone with a great idea, a well-devised plan and the right dose of passion and commitment can succeed,\u201d he added. \u201cNavigating the cloud landscape requires confidence and this is what we can offer businesses who want to achieve their full potential in this ever-evolving digital world. \u201cAs for TrisStratus, besides growing locally, our vision is to continue expanding beyond Malta, as we are in fact doing, to become a dominant player in the regional cloud services market. \u201cMore importantly, we want to partner with those businesses who seek digital transformation and growth. Because only when our clients grow, that we can grow with them,\u201d concluded Abela. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.
