Policymakers, regulators and investors will ask, what regulations can be tweaked or new ones put in place to help prevent future failures, reduce volatility, and protect the financial system as a whole? After Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) collapsed in March 2023, the U.S. Federal Reserve\u00a0embarked on an investigation into why.\u00a0\u00a0In the wake of the failures, the Fed\u00a0is looking to\u00a0shore up banks\u2019 liquidity and capital positions as well as making regional banks subject to long-term debt requirements and resolution planning, along with the FDIC. When it comes to any actual changes to shore up the financial system, however, corporate giants can\u2019t be left out of the conversation due to their possible impact on investors and the economy. Corporate giants such as Apple \n        AAPL,\n        -1.06%,\n       Microsoft \n        MSFT,\n        -0.17%\n       and Alphabet \n        GOOG,\n        +0.21%\n       are known for generating staggering profits. But they should be recognized as asset managers as well. Over the past 20 years, corporate giants have quietly emerged as significant players in financial markets, with large and complex financial portfolios. Marketable securities, not cash as normally assumed, are responsible for most of the growth in corporate giants\u2019 financial assets. In our\u00a0research, my co-author and I\u00a0collected data\u00a0on the financial portfolios of the 200 largest corporations in the U.S. from 2000 through 2021.\u00a0We found that\u00a0since 2007, their total financial assets grew by $1 trillion, while cash-like instruments grew by only $350 billion. In recent years, bond portfolios \u2014 notably, corporate bonds \u2014 have been at least as large as cash balances. In essence, corporate giants have become\u00a0lenders in their own right, running financial institutions within their company walls. This creates the potential for financial risk, for both investors and financial markets, especially with interest-rate uncertainty as high as it is now.\u00a0The bulk of these portfolios are invested in long-term U.S. Treasurys and corporate bonds. As interest rates rise, the value of long-term assets drops, and companies can suffer\u00a0significant losses on their balance sheet. Take Apple, for example, which\u00a0used to hold an astonishing $268 billion\u00a0in financial assets across many different asset types, as reported in their 2017 corporate fillings. Some $150 billion were corporate bonds, while $55 billion were U.S. Treasurys. A lot of money, however, left corporate balance sheets after the\u00a0Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA)\u00a0in 2017, when firms\u2019 incentives to keep retained earnings abroad faded. Still, as reported in the last annual filing, Apple currently has $160 billion in financial assets, of which $70 billion is a corporate bond portfolio. These large numbers continue to secure Apple\u2019s position as one of the largest global investors in fixed-income securities. In 2022, as interest rates skyrocketed, financial losses were sizeable.\u00a0Numbers are reported in the comprehensive income as unrealized losses:\u00a0Apple\u00a0reported losses\u00a0of over\u00a0$11 billion in assets, or more than 12% of its net income. For Alphabet, the losses topped $4 billion in 2022, or 7% of net income. In light of these losses, why do corporate giants keep these hefty\u00a0financial portfolios in the first place?\u00a0One reason has been cross-border tax incentives. Many multinationals have used an investment-related strategy of holding them in financial assets instead of distributing them, thereby avoiding U.S. tax fees. In late 2017, an effort to curb this behavior was attempted with the passage of the\u00a0Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), which aimed to reduce tax incentives for keeping assets abroad starting in 2018. Between 2017 and 2019, total financial assets did fall by $400 billion. But interestingly, they didn\u2019t disappear altogether, and this was most notable among the biggest companies. Another theory is that corporate giants keep massive holdings in case of a financial shock. During the COVID-19 pandemic, for example, we did see a \u201cdash to cash\u201d and an increase in cash-like instruments in the face of rising uncertainty. But, at the same time, we did\u00a0not\u00a0see corporate bond holdings drastically drop. Corporate giants may also\u00a0anticipate\u00a0a situation in which they may need funds fast but are unsure about borrowing at a fair rate. Companies with the biggest portfolios, however, tend to have high credit ratings and are less likely to need such precautionary savings. While the \u201cwhys\u201d behind these large portfolios is still an open question, the fact remains that corporate giants\u2019 massive holdings aren\u2019t as transparent as those of banks and other major bondholders like mutual funds and insurance companies. Their losses, too, are much more opaque in part because traditional data sources like Bloomberg, FactSet or Compustat don\u2019t track these financial portfolios. For example, in 2017, Apple\u2019s $268 billion of financial assets that we tracked down is much larger than the $75 billion in \u201ccash and short-term investments\u201d that was reported on the company\u2019s balance sheet and\u00a0recorded in Compustat. While companies are required to report the face value of the financial assets they hold, they don\u2019t have to disclose at the security level. Additionally, unrealized losses don\u2019t affect a company\u2019s reported income, which can conceal potential risks from inattentive investors. Digging deep into the data it\u2019s clear that\u00a0non-financial firms are key participants in financial markets, and they do have the power to cause major price swings, volatile markets, and even future major bank collapses.\u00a0Whether or not firms should provide more granular information about their financial portfolio and its performance is up for debate. But a fuller picture could help investors better understand risk, and more transparency can only benefit the financial system.
