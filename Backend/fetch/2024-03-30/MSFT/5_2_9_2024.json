The initiative, named ADVANTA(I)GE INDIA, is part of Microsoft\u2019s broader Skills for Jobs program and is aligned with the company\u2019s responsible AI principles. The goal is to accelerate India\u2019s AI transformation and empower its workforce for the jobs of the future. The program will focus on upskilling people in smaller cities and rural areas to bridge the gap in AI capabilities. It will also aim to expand AI fluency nationwide for inclusive growth.  Microsoft says that it wants to aid India\u2019s transformation into\u00a0an AI-first nation.\u00a0Nadella also highlighted how Microsoft Copilot, an AI tool can increase organizational productivity by streamlining work. He added that research shows early adopters of Copilot for Microsoft 365 are now \u201d up to 29% faster on a range of tasks,\u201d including but not limited to writing and summarizing content. Nadella mentioned that some organizations in India are already leveraging AI capabilities to improve productivity. In addition to accelerating innovation and improving efficiency, integrating AI into an organization\u2019s workflow can also increase benefits. Microsoft\u2019s ADVANTA(I)GE INDIA initiative comprises three main components: 1. Partnerships for Training: Microsoft will partner with the national government and 10 states to train 500,000 students at rural higher education institutions. The company has also collaborated with India\u2019s Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship for this initiative. 2. In-Depth AI Training: The program will provide in-depth AI training for 100,000 young women and technical skills training for 100,000 government officers. This training will be delivered through partnerships with government, nonprofits, and businesses across India. 3. Awareness and Summit: Microsoft will raise awareness about responsible AI and AI-related jobs for 400,000 students and help 250,000 government officers understand generative AI better. Also, the company will convene a summit for 2,500 nonprofits to leverage AI in their work, through a collaboration with LinkedIn.  The initiative is a significant step towards democratizing access to AI skills, to propel India into a promising era of AI fluency and empower citizens across the country with the right skills to thrive in the age of AI. Microsoft\u2019s President of Microsoft India & South Asia stated, \u201cIndia has a huge opportunity to be a global leader in AI, and creating AI fluency at scale is a critical step in that journey.\u201d Microsoft\u2019s renewed vigour to prepare the Indian AI workforce is inclusive across social class, gender, and income levels. The company aims to bridge the gap in AI capabilities, especially in Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities, by providing training and resources to individuals in smaller cities and rural areas. Smt. Trishaljit Sethi, Director General (Training), Ministry of Skill Development & Entrepreneurship \u201cIn the years ahead, AI innovation will play a pivotal role in shaping our future, and we at the Directorate General of Training, Ministry of Skill Development & Entrepreneurship, stay dedicated to realizing the potential of the AI era for India, in partnership with Microsoft and others \u2026 This commitment involves equipping the youth with skills through training in tools that redefine how people work, connect, address real-world challenges, and live.
