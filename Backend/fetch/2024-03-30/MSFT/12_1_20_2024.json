In a blog post Friday, Microsoft said the intrusion began in late November and was discovered Jan. 12. The company says a very small percentage of Microsoft corporate accounts were accessed and some emails and documents were stolen. A Microsoft spokesperson had no immediate comment on which or how many members of the company\u2019s senior leadership had their email accounts breached. \u201cWe are in the process of notifying employees whose email was accessed,\u201d Microsoft said. The Microsoft disclosure comes a month after\u00a0a new U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rule\u00a0took effect that compels publicly traded companies to disclose breaches that could negatively impact their business. It gives them four days to do so unless they obtain a national-security waiver. US and Chinese officials have completed the third meeting of a working group established to cooperate on financial issues, in a step that continues the trend set by the two powers last November to ease tensions. Officials from the U.S. Department of the Treasury met with counterparts in the People\u2019s Bank of China to discuss issues ranging from financial stability to countering money laundering. The delegation also met with Vice Premier He Lifeng while they were in China, according to a department statement. The group also indicated that Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen would return to China for a visit at some point in the future. She was previously there\u00a0in July.
