The tech giant wants to boost its data centre capacities for artificial intelligence and cloud computing. Mr Scholz said: \"This is a really good commitment to progress, to growth, to modernity and to global openness as the basis for these opportunities.\" \"Not only are we probably the most successful export economy in the world in terms of the size of our country, but we are also a country that trades with the whole world, that invests everywhere, but also invests in our own country,\" Microsoft President Brad Smith announced the news in Berlin alongside Scholz. This is the biggest single investment Microsoft has ever made in Germany in its 40-year history there. It even includes an AI training programme aiming to reach up to 1.2 million people. Microsoft hopes being close to big customers like pharmaceutical company Bayer AG and energy company RWE will keep data latency low between data centres and applications. The central German state of Hesse will also benefit from Microsoft's investments. Get our money-saving tips and top offers direct to your inbox with the Mirror Money newsletter "
