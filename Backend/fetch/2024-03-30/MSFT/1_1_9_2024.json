This follows concerns that the partnership may hinder fair competition in the rapidly growing field\u00a0of artificial intelligence\u00a0and virtual worlds. The European Commission, alongside the UK's Competition and Markets Authority,\u00a0explores the depth\u00a0of Microsoft's involvement with OpenAI, particularly in light of the recent internal upheaval at ChatGPT's creator, Bloomberg\u00a0reports. EU antitrust commissioner Margrethe Vestager emphasizes keeping new markets competitive and open for innovation. Microsoft's integration of OpenAI's products across its businesses has quickly established it as a leading AI company, prompting rivals like\u00a0Alphabet Inc's GOOG GOOGL\u00a0Google\u00a0to intensify their efforts in the sector.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella was personally involved in negotiating Altman's return, highlighting the interconnectedness of Microsoft and OpenAI. This partnership revolves around the immense computing power required for generative AI, making OpenAI a significant customer of Microsoft's cloud services. The EU's investigation also includes a call for feedback on competitive issues in AI and virtual worlds, reflecting the EU's growing interest in the sector's competitive dynamics and the significant venture capital investment in AI in Europe. The U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is also scrutinizing Microsoft's partnership with OpenAI and is considering launching a probe into their collaboration for potential competition issues. This evaluation follows the CMA's approval of Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard. Microsoft, as OpenAI's principal investor, has invested $13 billion in the AI startup, leading to OpenAI's integration into Microsoft's enterprise tools and reliance on Microsoft's cloud services. The European Union (EU)\u00a0is reportedly close\u00a0to reaching an agreement that could result in extensive regulation of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, including ChatGPT and Google Bard, marking a crucial step in global AI policy.
