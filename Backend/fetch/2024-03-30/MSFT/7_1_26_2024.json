The agency is looking specifically at three separate multi-billion-dollar investments, including Microsoft and OpenAI, Amazon and Anthropic, and Google and Anthropic. \u201cHistory shows that new technologies can create new markets and healthy competition. As companies race to develop and monetize AI, we must guard against tactics that foreclose this opportunity,\u201d Lina Khan, the FTC chair, said in a statement Thursday. \u201cOur study will shed light on whether investments and partnerships pursued by dominant companies risk distorting innovation and undermining fair competition.\u201d The FTC is seeking information on specific investments or partnerships, including agreements and the strategic rationale behind them; the practical implications of specific partnerships; analysis of the transactions\u2019 competitive impact; competition for AI inputs and resources; and information provided to any other government entity. Sidelining the venture capitalists who typically back startups, the partnerships provide generative AI developers access to tech giants\u2019 resources such as expensive GPUs and cloud computing to train and run advanced AI models. On the other hand, startups provide big tech companies a \u201cland grab to secure their position\u201d in market share and the ability to showcase their own products\u2014for example, Microsoft and copilots. The agency said companies will have 45 days from the date they receive the order to respond. None of the companies mentioned outright own the AI startups, though Microsoft and OpenAI\u2019s partnership comes closest to that. Microsoft owns a 49% stake in the latter, giving the Seattle-based tech giant access to OpenAI\u2019s technology. M&A has proven difficult given greater antitrust scrutiny, so these companies find ways to work with startups rather than buy them outright, Brendan Burke, an analyst at PitchBook, previously told Quartz. Last year saw a flurry of new AI deals: Microsoft invested $10 billion into OpenAI, bringing its total investment to $13 billion, while Google poured $2 billion into OpenAI\u2019s rival Anthropic. Meanwhile, Amazon agreed to commit up to $4 billion in Anthropic. Thanks to the partnership with OpenAI, Microsoft has remained a leader in the AI space, helping propel the company\u2019s market cap to the $3 trillion club. \u201cIf Microsoft\u2019s relationship with OpenAI was severed or OpenAI disappeared, then it would set them back,\u201d Gil Luria, DA Davidson analyst, said in an interview with Yahoo Finance in December. Across the pond, the UK\u2019s Competitive and Markets Authority (CMA) said in December it was gathering information on Microsoft and OpenAI to decide whether their partnership threatens competition in the UK, which is home to Google\u2019s DeepMind. At that time\u2014hoping it would resonate with antitrust regulators\u2014Microsoft wanted to make clear that it didn\u2019t own a stake. \u201cMicrosoft does not own any portion of OpenAI and is simply entitled to share of profit distributions,\u201d Frank Shaw, the company\u2019s chief communications officer, noted in a statement.
