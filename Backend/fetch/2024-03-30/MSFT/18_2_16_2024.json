    "text": "Microsoft is the world\u2019s largest company by market capitalization, with an outsized presence in multiple sectors, including cloud computing, gaming, productivity software, and, lately, artificial intelligence. Microsoft\u2019s broad array of products and services, as well as the recent stock price increase, begs the question of how high MSFT could reach in the future. According to different growth models, Microsoft stock is forecasted to surpass $1,000 by 2040 and potentially reach five digits by 2050. In this article, we are going to examine Microsoft stock forecasts for the medium and long term, accounting for the historical growth of important market indices and MSFT\u2019s own historical performance. But first, here\u2019s an overview of Microsoft stock\u2019s price growth under various relevant growth scenarios. *The values in the table were calculated using MSFT\u2019s price of $406.39 (as of February 16th).\n**S&P 500 has averaged 11.13% CAGR since 1973, QTEC 15.2% over the last 15\u00a0years, and MSFT 9.32% over the last 25 years. Buy Microsoft Stock Your capital is at risk. When the company first started trading in 1986, Microsoft (MSFT) stock price was about 10 cents per share (accounting for several stock splits over the years). Now, more than 35 years later, MSFT is trading at $406, over +406,000% above its original price. Meanwhile, Microsoft\u2019s market cap sits at $3.02 trillion.  Interestingly, MSFT price first reached $50 in 2000 but it would take more than 15 years before the stock revisited that price point in 2016. After that, Microsoft stock became a hot commodity, and the price exploded, reaching an all-time high of $382 in November 2023. At the time of writing, Microsoft accounts for 6.9% of the entire weight of the S&P 500, an index measuring the value of the 500 largest US companies trading on the stock market. For context, the combined value of companies indexed by the S&P 500 is $40.04 trillion.  According to our Microsoft stock price prediction algorithm, MSFT\u2019s price will face significant volatility in the next 12 months. The price is projected to decrease below\u00a0$300 in the next six months and proceed to correct upwards, eventually establishing support around the $290 mark. MSFT stock is forecasted to conclude 2024 with mostly bullish price action and reach a new all-time high above $440 in early 2025. Microsoft stock price could hit $511 in 2025 and reach the quadruple-digit territory in 2028, increasing by over +151% and hitting $1,020.  Our Microsoft stock forecasts for 2025 through 2030 are based on the average yearly growth of Microsoft stock in the last 10 years. While this kind of analysis does have its drawbacks, it still provides valuable insight into how the stock might act in the future, particularly if the trends that have been present over the last 10 years persist going forward. Microsoft stock\u2019s price increased from roughly $27 at the start of 1999 to $291 more than two decades later \u2013 that means that MSFT\u2019s annualized return over the trailing 25-year period has been 10.7%.  Going by its historical growth to calculate long-term profits, Microsoft's stock price could increase to $2,443 by 2040. Interestingly, Microsoft\u2019s CAGR of 9.32% comes very close to the long-term average of the S&P 500 Index, which has on average gained +11.13% every year since 1973. Although the S&P 500 can be a helpful gauge of a large-cap company's performance over a lengthy period, it evaluates businesses across various industries, ranging from finance to healthcare. Hence, it may not be the most appropriate indicator for forecasting the expansion of a technology company. Given that Microsoft primarily operates in the tech industry, it is more fitting to rely on a tech-focused index fund like the NASDAQ-100-Technology Sector Index Fund (QTEC) to anticipate the future growth of one of the largest technology firms.  Over the last 15 years, QTEC has been growing at a 15.2% CAGR. If we use QTEC\u2019s historical growth to project Microsft\u2019s future growth, the price of MSFT would increase\u00a0to $4,504 in 2040. Using Microsoft\u2019s historical stock price performance as the basis for the long-term MSFT stock price prediction, Microsoft shares could reach $7,021\u00a0by 2050.  Accounting for such a stock price, the market cap of Microsoft would grow beyond $45\u00a0trillion, which is over 15 times higher than it is today. While this seems extremely unlikely at first glance, there are indications that the global economy could expand sufficiently to support such market capitalizations in the future. For context, the global gross domestic product (GDP) grew from 12 trillion in 1985 to $101 trillion in 2022, a 742% increase in 27 years. If that same GDP growth were to persist in the next 26 years, the global GDP would reach $850 trillion. Buy Microsoft Stock Your capital is at risk. Stock price forecasts for MSFT are notably bullish \u2013 there are several credible growth scenarios that put the price target for MSFT into quadruple digits. Given Microsoft\u2019s encouraging business results in the past couple of years and its massive investment in AI (that is already paying off with the success of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT), we can easily see why the company\u2019s stock surpassing $1,000 is not out of the question.
