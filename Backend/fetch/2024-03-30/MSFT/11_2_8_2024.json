Microsoft\u2019s plan to build a new data centre in Centurion, in Tshwane, shows the group\u2019s commitment to extending the commercial cloud services available to South African companies and represents a significant new investment in the country. That\u2019s the view of Jon Tullett, senior research manager at International Data Corporation (IDC), who said: \u201cWe tend to be blas\u00e9 as there are so many data centres going up in Africa now, but this is a sign of commitment from Microsoft. It\u2019s an investment, and any new infrastructure like this is like an aircraft carrier \u2013 it brings with it jobs and skills and all sorts of attendant industries.\u201d Tullett said a data centre takes years of planning, and that this move will have been made a couple of years ago in response to market demand. \u201cOne of the difficulties with the cloud is that it\u2019s billed in US dollars, so there is volatility built into the pricing \u2013 and so far no one has responded to the pressure for local pricing except, for the first time, Alibaba Cloud, last year. \u201cSo, I would say one of the reasons Microsoft is expanding in Centurion is perhaps to meet this customer need, as well as cater to growing customer demand. Historically, Microsoft as a service has been strong, but it may well be responding to competition from other strong players like Amazon.\u201d Tullett suggested that the new data centre might start out life as a facility ring-fenced to handle government business, or specific financial services, before developing into a general-purpose cloud centre, but he emphasised this is speculation. He is certain of pent-up demand for a government-focused service, however. \u201cCloud is in a high growth phase in South Africa. It is undergoing modernisation and growing in complexity and maturity, and growing at a rate of 20%/annum. All of this is great to see,\u201d he said. Microsoft has a 30-year history in the country and the company said it is committed to accelerating the pace of technology transformation by investing in infrastructure and skills. It already has several data centres in Johannesburg and Cape Town. A recent IDC report on the state of cybersecurity in South Africa showed that nearly half (48%) of organisations in the country are using cloud as a platform and driver of digital innovation.\u00a0 \u2013 \u00a9 2024 NewsCentral Media Google opens its first Africa cloud data centre \u2013 in Joburg  Get the best South African technology news and analysis delivered to your e-mail inbox every morning.
