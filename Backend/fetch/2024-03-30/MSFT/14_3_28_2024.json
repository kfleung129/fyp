    "text": "Technicity Satellite SeriesJoin us on\u00a0March 6, 2024\u00a0for an exclusive, interactive virtual experience After the Microsoft keynote with CEO Satya Nadella at the Gartner Symposium 2015 ITExpo, we set out in search of a Windows 10 demo. We managed to get an inside view of Windows 10 from a product manager who did a great demo for us. We video recorded the whole demo and after some negotiation with the powers that be, we were allowed to release this very early demo of Windows 10. \u00a0At least as long as we warn you that a lot can change between now and the final build. We can also tell you that there is a program that you can join if you want to give some feedback on this, but Microsoft is looking for power users who can devote the time and have a second machine to work on. With that caveat, here\u2019s our sneak peek at Windows 10. ORLANDO \u2013 We managed to get this look at Windows 10 and permission to show it to ITBusiness.ca readers. \u00a0We can even mention the \u201cinsider program\u201d where Microsoft is looking for feedback from sophisticated users. \u00a0This was no small feat. \u00a0What we couldn\u2019t do was get an answer to the main question that we talked about. \u201cWhat happened to Windows 9? Did we sleep through it?\u201d That mystery aside, we were thrilled to get a look at the interface that will drive Windows 10. I\u2019m a confessed mainly Mac user for my day to day work. I went running to Mac after Vista. But I confess that I\u2019ve been lured by the Surface interface and intrigued by Windows 8. In my Windows machines, I\u2019ve only very recently given up on XP \u2013 which I loved as an operating system. I\u2019m not a luddite. I work on a number of platforms from Linux to Android on mobile. But while I could do enough to keep up on Windows as a work exercise \u2013 I didn\u2019t picture that I\u2019d ever do another honest day\u2019s work on a Windows machine \u2013 despite the fact that I\u2019ve been a Windows user since the first version of Windows. Today that might have changed. In the demo interface that we saw \u2013 Microsoft has got it right. The Windows 10 interface is more friendly, more intuitive and if the early reports are true \u2013 more easy to install than many of the past versions we\u2019ve all endured. Right from the Start (pun intended) Microsoft has done the unthinkable. It has swallowed its\u00a0pride and really listened to its audience. Microsoft has\u00a0restored a number of features that we\u2019ve all known and used for years. If you are as old as me, you remember when Windows 95 introduced the Start button. We laughed at it then because of its incongruity \u2013 Start was how you stopped the system to shut it down. But over the years we came to understand and count on these features. When Windows XP came around, many of us loved it. It was elegant, to some degree intuitive and where it was not, we all had enough history to learn the new commands. In Vista, Windows 7 and other failed attempts at advancing the interface, Microsoft abandoned these key elements and replaced them with confusing and difficult user interface controls. These had only one thing in common \u2013 they were difficult to understand and hard to use. In one fell swoop, Microsoft has done a 180 degree turn and restored the best of its previous interfaces. As noted, the Start function (if not the button) is back. As are the list views of folders and files. As well, the search function is back where we are used to finding it. The new \u201ctiled\u201d interface is there as well, but its set just beside the list view. As a result, it\u2019s far less threatening. You have the option of doing it the old reliable way or clicking on the new tiled view. With the option of \u201ctaking care of business\u201d when you are busy, the exploring of the new tiles seems far less intimidating. Its sort of like the old days of IVR systems when you knew that if you pressed zero you could get help. \u00a0With that option, you tended to explore more and try new things. In the new Windows, I felt the same way. I\u2019d be more likely to try new things knowing I could always use the old list view in a crunch. Another great piece of design in Windows 10. The traditional and modern apps work the same way. In earlier versions your traditional apps like Word and Excel opened one way \u2013 new applications like Money opened another. Windows 10 gives a consistent way of bringing new and old apps into the same UI constructs. As a result, we only have learn one way to cope \u2013 or to prosper. Apps in Windows 10 all open in the same Window structure. They all obey a consistent set of rules. They are, in other words \u2013 consistent. The UI and user experience are obviously at the height of Microsoft research these days. We don\u2019t need a killer app. We need killer productivity. Windows 10 gives us a new interface and a structure which allows our partner like Gartner to see the solutions in real time and in a real marketing role. It\u2019s a real focus on user interface and who can help us solve these \u201cwicked\u201d problems. I think to some extent that this is true. It\u2019s not a big worry. Windows 10 does what every design model should be doing. It provides a product as well as as design and philosophically it gives us a new view of the external organization and the customer.
