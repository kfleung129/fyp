What\u2019s been billed as a Windows event is, predictably, focused on AI efforts, with Copilot taking the wheel. A pair of refreshes to the Surface line announced at the event are, predictably, putting the software giant\u2019s chatbot front and center. The new Surface Pro 10 for Business and Surface Laptop 6 for Business both sport a devoted Copilot key wedged between the Alt key and arrows. In a post published this morning, Surface general manager Nancie Gaskill writes, \u201cThe new Copilot key on Surface Laptop 6 makes accessing the power of AI even easier, with a quick button press to invoke Copilot in Windows to help customers to plan their day, find a document using natural text, analyze a website and more with commercial data protection built in.\u201d Image Credits: Microsoft The key is the core of what the company is referring to as \u201cthe first Surface PCs optimized for AI.\u201d Certainly, building Copilot directly into its keyboards marks a level of commitment for what is still a new project, with MS having only launched Copilot for Microsoft 365 a year ago this month. And I\u2019m not going to spoil the mood by pointing out that Cortana keys were also a thing at one point. The systems arrive just under four months into what a handful of highly paid branding executives have deemed the \u201cAI PC.\u201d That and the \u201cAI smartphones\u201d like the Samsung Galaxy S24 are fairly meaningless labels. Intel has spent the last several months pushing \u201cthe AI PC powered by Intel,\u201d while Apple recently declared M3 MacBook Airs \u201cthe best consumer laptops for AI.\u201d While such language ultimately matters very little to the consumer at the end of the day, \u201coptimized for AI\u201d strikes a healthy balance of riding the new trend without overpromising. At the end of the day, a Copilot key is simply a physical shortcut that surfaces one particular service. It is, however, a commitment of sorts, given that space is at an ultra premium on a laptop/tablet keyboard. Image Credits: Microsoft As far as out-of-the-box Copilot functionality, Microsoft is highlighting things like handwriting analysis for OneNote. That the key has been added to a pair of business-focused devices highlights how much the company is considering Copilot an important enterprise play. The Surface Laptop 6 for Business sports an Intel Core Ultra 5 or 7 processor, coupled with the Intel Boost NPY (neural processing unit), 8\u201364GB of RAM and up to 1TB of storage. The display comes in 13.5- and 15-inch touchscreen varieties, which sport a stated 18.5 and 19 hours of battery life, respectively. The Surface Pro 10 for Business sports a 13-inch touchscreen, powered by either the Intel Core Ultra 5 or 7 and the Intel AI Boost NPU. (Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp. is trying to make it harder for people to trick artificial intelligence chatbots into doing weird things.

The new iPad Pro models will have Apple's latest M3 chip and will come with redesigned versions of the Magic Keyboard and Apple Pencil, the report said.  This update would represent Apple's first overhaul to that lineup since 2018. Apple will finally launch new iPads in early May, according to Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman. Expected are a new iPad Pro with an OLED display and a faster iPad Air, including a 12.9-inch model for the first time in that lineup.
