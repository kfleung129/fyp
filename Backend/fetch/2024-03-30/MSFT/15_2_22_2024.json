If you want to skip our overview of the different kinds of trading strategies and some latest stock market news, then you can take a look at the 5 Best Momentum Stocks To Buy Now. When it comes to trading, a strategy can typically follow two different directions. One of the more commonly understood trading strategies is trading by the fundamentals. This strategy looks at a firm's ability to make money, and it analyzes the income statement and the balance sheet to take stock of costs, assets, and other financial metrics that could hint at growth in the future and the corresponding share price appreciation. The second direction or strategy is played by the technical indicators. As opposed to looking at fundamentals such as earnings per share or dividends, a technical trading approach instead analyzes share price trends and movements. It takes stock of a variety of factors such as the volume of shares traded, whether a stock is overbought or oversold if its share price is above or below long term averages, and the percentage of returns delivered by the price. By combining these factors, technical analysts believe that they capitalize on emerging market trends before they blow up and make a profit. One kind of technical trading strategy is called momentum trading. For those out of the loop, analyzing a stock's momentum is unrelated to its balance sheet. Instead, it involves looking at the share price movements to see whether further upside or downside is present to merit an investment decision. Inside the momentum trader's toolkit are several 'tools' such as average directional indexes, moving averages, stochastic oscillators (also called a relative strength index (RSI)), and simple trend lines that gauge whether current share price levels are part of a broader upward or downward trend. Together, these allow for informed decision making. For instance, let's consider a hypothetical stock A. A has an RSI reading of 19, a long term upward share price trend, and an ADX reading of 40. This might lead an investor to correctly conclude that since the RSI reading indicates that the stock is oversold, and the share price is trending upwards, then a high ASX reading could potentially present a chance for a profit since it indicates the presence of a trend. Of course, just as all investment decisions should be made after consulting a qualified investment professional, trying to read the technical tea leaves can yield better results if conclusions like the one in our example are also evaluated along with a fundamental reading. So if Stock A has high debt and falling revenue, then unless insiders or institutional investors know something that the broader market does not, it might not be worthwhile to wager holding A for a long time period. With that out of the way, one way in which momentum stocks benefit is through the effects of macroeconomic news, events, and developments on the stock market. Throughout 2022 and 2023, the market has been held hostage by these events if we're being honest. Whether it's predictions of a recession, interest rate hikes, or high inflation, the market has seen investors flip between being bears and bulls depending on the nature of the data set. Right now, all eyes are on the Federal Reserve and the inflation readings for January 2024 that will help investors decide when the Fed might start cutting interest rates to ease business conditions and provide a further boost to the market.
