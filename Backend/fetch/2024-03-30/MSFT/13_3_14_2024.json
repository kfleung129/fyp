    "text": "Microsoft is set to expand the availability of its artificial intelligence-powered tool for cybersecurity professionals, known as 'Security Copilot'. The tool is designed to assist analysts by allowing them to run queries through a prompt box for tasks such as summarizing incidents, analyzing vulnerabilities, and sharing information with co-workers. The company has announced that Copilot for Security will be generally available worldwide starting from April 1. The AI solution adopts a consumption-based licensing model, implementing a 'pay-as-you-go' strategy. This model is aimed at reducing the barriers of entry for customers, allowing them to start quickly and scale usage as needed. In terms of language support, Copilot for Security can process prompts and respond in eight different languages. It also features a multilingual interface with options of 25 languages. The AI assistant for security products will be available in a standalone portal and will also be embedded in existing security products from Microsoft. This move is part of Microsoft's continued investment in AI integration with its products, following its previous $13 billion investment in OpenAI. Traders and investors use our platform.
