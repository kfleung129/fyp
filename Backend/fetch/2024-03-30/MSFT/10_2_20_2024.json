The latest investment comes hot on the heels of the major investment commitment Microsoft made in Germany last week, when it said it would spend \u20ac3.2bn over the next two years to double its cloud and AI infrastructure in the country. Less than three moths ago, Microsoft also made its largest-ever investment in the UK after committing \u00a32.5bn over the next three years to expand its AI data centre footprint and foster research in the technology. Microsoft had a\u00a0strong second fiscal quarter, according to its latest earnings posted last month, with a significant growth to both revenue and net income \u2013 largely thanks to its AI push. Revenue from the company\u2019s Intelligent Cloud division \u2013 which includes Azure \u2013 grew by 20pc to $25.9bn. The company is a frontrunner in the AI race, getting a significant boost from its partnership with ChatGPT-creator OpenAI. The focus on AI helped Microsoft briefly hit the $3trn valuation\u00a0and\u00a0challenge Apple for the title of most valuable company in the world.
