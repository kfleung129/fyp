    "text": "Microsoft's fiscal Q2 earnings are anticipated to benefit from the ongoing strength of Azure and M365, despite weaker PC shipments. A 1% increase in constant currency to its Q2 revenue forecast of $60.9 billion is predicted. This increase is expected due to currency providing a 2% point boost to Q2 growth, compared to the 1% projections at the start of the period. Growth in the average selling price from M365 Copilot attach is also anticipated, which is likely to push Office growth towards 20%. For Azure, a 1% increase to its estimated growth of 26.5% in constant currency is expected. This expectation is based on feedback indicating a continued migration of new workloads and sustained adoption of the Microsoft security stack. The price objective for Microsoft has been raised to $450 from $430 and the buy rating has been maintained. Total revenue growth is expected to accelerate to high teens from the current mid-teens level. Traders and investors use our platform. Top website in the world when it comes to all things investing.
