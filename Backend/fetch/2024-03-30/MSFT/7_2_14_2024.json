Read more Key notes Slack, a popular work-friendly communication platform, is now joining the AI hype train. Slack AI has finally dropped, and from the look of it, Copilot on\u00a0Microsoft Teams\u00a0may be getting a new competitor in town. The AI, as\u00a0described by the company, can deliver answers that you search for, recap channels by generating key highlights, and create summaries for long threads to help you catch up \u2013 just like on Teams and even a thread summarizer on Outlook. And it looks promising, too, as seen in its demo. If you\u2019re working on a project and you\u2019re out of the loop with the conversation, you can simply type \u201cWhat is project x,\u201d and then Slack AI will search through the channel\u2019s conversation and pull out a simplified answer. As for the thread summarizer feature, an AI button will appear in the top right corner, allowing you to summarize unread messages, messages from the past week, or custom date ranges. But it\u2019s not free. Slack AI is currently rolling out for Enterprise users as a paid add-on and it\u2019s only available in English. Supports for other languages and other plans will be announced in the future. Copilot for Microsoft Teams, on the other hand, also does not come for free. It\u2019s included in the\u00a0Copilot for Microsoft 365\u00a0plan, which costs $30 per user per month. This plan grants access to the AI features not only in Teams but also in other applications like Word and Excel.
