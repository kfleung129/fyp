To help address these questions and more, we are excited to introduce Microsoft AI University \u2013 or AIU \u2013 a new video series delving into the transformative potential of AI, led by technology experts from around the world, to help organizations adapt and thrive in the age of AI.

According to a McKinsey Global Survey, the global AI market in 2023 was $136.6 billion and the AI adoption rate increased to 35%. However, for many organizations, questions remain about cybersecurity and the risk of threat exposure as they adopt these new technologies. But AI can be used to enhance security while mitigating the risks of cyberattacks. For instance, generative AI, found in solutions like Microsoft Security Copilot, is helping organizations and security teams to respond at the speed of today\u2019s attacks, levelling the playing field and strengthening their defense. In this Microsoft AI University episode, futurist and tech founder Sinead Bovell explores the top cybersecurity-related considerations for businesses adopting AI, including how organizations can strengthen their cybersecurity efforts today. She also shares best practices and tips for leveraging AI responsibly and securely. Boosting business enablement with AI AI represents not merely a technological shift but also a cultural transformation, influencing how individuals accomplish their tasks. Using AI to delegate operational tasks, leaders can redirect their attention to high impact work that empowers their workforce. The potential for time saving is significant. In fact, one of the most exciting aspects of generative AI lies in its potential to free workers from repetitive and time-consuming tasks, so they can focus on more strategic and creative endeavors. For example, with Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365, which integrates AI into the apps people use every day, individuals and teams can save time, create meaningful connections with their customers and supercharge their productivity. In this Microsoft AI University episode, tech expert M\u00f4nica Magalh\u00e3es emphasizes how the possibilities with AI are not just momentary hype.

Driving productivity and competition with AI AI is leading some of the most profound changes we have seen in the world of work in recent decades, similar to the arrival of the internet. Helping to streamline operations, advance customer engagement, or ushering in new opportunities for businesses across every sector and industry \u2013 the impact of AI is far-reaching.

AI\u2019s impact on businesses and individuals is vast when guided by the creativity and ingenuity of the people who wield it. But as AI becomes increasingly accepted and widely adopted, it is essential that organizations prioritize responsible adoption to ensure positive outcomes. At Microsoft, we identify and apply in our own practices and technologies six principles that guide us toward Responsible AI: Fairness, Reliability and Safety, Privacy and Security, Inclusion, Transparency and Accountability.\u202fWe follow these principles to guarantee the equitable treatment of all individuals by the AI technologies we develop and advise other organizations to do the same. Now, it\u2019s your turn to leverage AI responsibly \u2013 to gain a competitive advantage, increase creativity and achieve more efficient work \u2013 as it serves as your ally in reaching your full potential.
