Microsoft last week published an advertisement in a number of newspapers providing details of its intention to build the data centre campus situated in Kosmosdal in Centurion, Gauteng. Still in the early phases of development, Microsoft said it aims to build its cloud infrastructure in new areas of South Africa to meet \u201cgrowing demand\u201d from the public sector and private organisations for cloud and AI services and solutions in Africa. In March 2018, Microsoft became the first hyperscale public cloud provider to provide services from data centres in Africa. \u201cWe look forward to working with the municipality, local organisations, and the residents of Kosmosdal as we develop our data centre plans in a sustainable way,\u201d Microsoft said. Microsoft has a 30-year history in South Africa. The software giant said it is committed to accelerating the pace of technology transformation and digital enablement in the country, through key investments in infrastructure, innovation, and skills and enterprise development, to benefit all South Africans. \u201cThis data centre campus represents the next step in Microsoft\u2019s commitment to enabling and accelerating the pace of digital transformation in South Africa, and Africa, in an inclusive, trusted, and responsible manner.\u201d ALSO READ: AI tools will manage time, boost work, but won\u2019t take over jobs, Microsoft says Microsoft already has two current two data centres \u2013 located in Johannesburg and Cape Town In 2022, the company expanded the cloud service offerings in both SA locations, adding the Dynamics 365 and Power Platform.
