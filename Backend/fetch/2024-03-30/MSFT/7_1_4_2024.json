    "text": "Hi there, it\u2019s Rachyl Jones with the tech team. The first major change in three decades is coming to Windows computer keyboards. In the coming days and weeks, Windows 11 PCs from Microsoft and its partners will include a physical Copilot button that activates the company\u2019s artificial intelligence assistant, the company said in a blog post on Thursday. The new key\u2014which sports an icon that looks a bit like a folded piece of origami\u2014means users can summon AI features with a quick tap of the button instead of clicking through the taskbar on-screen. \u201cAI will be seamlessly woven into Windows from the system, to the silicon, to the hardware,\u201d Yusuf Mehdi, Microsoft\u2019s consumer chief marketing officer, said in the blog post. \u201cThis will not only simplify people\u2019s computing experience but also amplify it, making 2024 the year of the AI PC.\u201d Whether the key will make any material difference in PC sales is unclear, but the move underscores Microsoft\u2019s investment in Copilot as the future of how consumers interact with computers. Built on ChatGPT technology\u2014which Microsoft has played a key role in funding\u2014Copilot began as a feature for Bing and Edge in February 2023. It has since become available throughout Windows 11 and Microsoft 365 products for both business and personal use, marketing as \u201cyour everyday AI companion.\u201d The most recent significant change to Microsoft\u2019s keyboards was nearly 30 years ago when it added the Windows button to launch the \u201cStart\u201d menu. Depending on the product, the new Copilot key will either stand in the place of the Menu key or the right Control key, CNBC reported. Larger computers will have enough keyboard space for both the Copilot button and the right Control key, according to CNBC. While Microsoft Windows remains the dominant PC operating system globally, the company\u2019s Surface computers (which will integrate the new key) have failed to reach more than a few percentage points of market share. Any Windows PC maker, including industry leaders Lenovo, Dell, and HP, can offer keyboards with the new Copilot button of course. But the Copilot button will give Microsoft one more way to tout the AI capabilities of its Surface computers. At a presentation for journalists and industry professionals in September, Microsoft Surface marketing director Adrienne Brewbaker ran a live demonstration comparing the speed of a Surface PC against Apple\u2019s MacBook Pro. In the presentation, the Microsoft product rendered GPUs, graphic processing units essential to run generative AI, twice as fast. And while Bloomberg has reported Apple is working on its own large language model, the closest product Apple has at the moment is Siri (which does not have a special button on MacBooks). With that, here are more of today\u2019s top tech stories. Rachyl Jones Want to send thoughts or suggestions to Data Sheet? Drop a line here. American-made chips. The Biden administration will award $162 million in federal grants to Microchip Technology, an Arizona-based semiconductor company, the New York Times reports. The grant is the second of its kind from the U.S. government in recent months under a new program to ensure American companies have a stable supply of chips. The funds will support the production of cars, airplanes, medical devices, and military products. TikTok\u2019s U.S. shopping plans. TikTok, the social platform owned by Chinese company ByteDance, intends to grow its U.S. e-commerce business tenfold to as much as $17.5 billion in 2024, Bloomberg reports, citing people familiar with internal conversations. Such growth could alarm online shopping giants like Amazon and Chinese behemoths Shein and Temu, which are all popular among American shoppers. In a statement to Bloomberg, TikTok said the figure is inaccurate. New money in an old search industry. Jeff Bezos has invested in Perplexity, an AI startup that could threaten Google\u2019s empire by changing the way people search the internet. In addition to the Amazon founder, investors in the $70 million round include IVP, Databricks Ventures, ex-Twitter executive Elad Gil, Shopify chief Tobi Lutke, and Nvidia. The round values Perplexity at $520 million, according to TechCrunch. \u201cThis is not a static, point-in-time picture. The ecosystem contains thousands of companies, and they\u2019ll continue to adapt and optimize over time.\u201d \u2014Google vice president Anthony Chavez said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal, responding to claims from advertisers that Google has not done enough to prepare them for the elimination of cookies, which help marketers target and track customers. On Thursday, Google will start restricting cookies on Chrome with the goal of eliminating all cookies by the end of 2024.

Here\u2019s how it got preempted by the U.S. and U.K., why it almost got derailed by ChatGPT, and how it will shape regulation in 2024, by David Haber SpaceX workers who criticized CEO Elon Musk for being a \u2018distraction and embarrassment\u2019 were illegally fired in retaliation, NLRB alleges, by Josh Eidelson, Loren Grush, and Bloomberg Gavin Newsom tackles a $68 billion deficit for the world\u2019s fifth largest economy, the AI explosion and the Hollywood implosion, by Tran Nguyen, Adam Beam, and the Associated Press What news is worth. OpenAI, the company behind the large language model ChatGPT, offered some publishers as little as between $1 million to $5 million per year to license news articles and train its artificial intelligence models, The Information reports. While that might make a difference for small publishers, that\u2019s a measly amount for bigger news sites, given the effect AI could have on the news industry. The news comes just days after the New York Times filed a lawsuit against Microsoft and OpenAI for copyright infringement, claiming the companies copied tens of thousands of its articles without permission to train their AI models, as Jeremy Kahn wrote about in Fortune\u2019s Eye on AI newsletter.
