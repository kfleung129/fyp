Read more Key notes Microsoft has been going all out in promoting the\u00a0new Teams app\u00a0and even goes as far as saying that it\u2019s so much lighter and faster, yet more energy and cost-efficient. But, in a rather surprising news, Microsoft is apparently extending Teams Classic app. The Redmond-based tech giant\u00a0has quietly confirmed an extension\u00a0(MC718748) for the Teams Classic app, allowing Commercial and Educational users who haven\u2019t finished their transition. This news comes amidst the ongoing rollout of the new Teams client, initially slated for mandatory adoption by the end of March 2024. However, Microsoft seems to be acknowledging user feedback and their the need for additional time for some organizations to complete the transition. Now, if you still face issues meeting requirements for the new Teams, you won\u2019t be blocked from using Teams Classic until at least July 1, 2024. \u201cThis will give admins more time to address any issues encountered during this process,\u201d Microsoft says. With over 300 million active users, Microsoft Teams is still one of the most popular collaboration apps around. But now, with the introduction of the Copilot AI tool that\u2019s exclusively available through the\u00a0Copilot for Microsoft 365\u00a0subscription plan, it wouldn\u2019t be surprising to see more numbers coming in the next months.
