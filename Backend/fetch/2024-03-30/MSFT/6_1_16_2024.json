FAQ - New Privacy Policy Wall Street Alliance Group partner Aadil Zaman and Peapack Private Wealth Management managing principal David Dietze react to Sam Altman returning to OpenAI five days after his firing on Making Money. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said Tuesday that he has no issue with the governance structure of its artificial intelligence partner OpenAI two months after its non-profit board temporarily ousted CEO Sam Altman two months ago. OpenAI\u2019s non-profit board forced out Altman as CEO over an alleged communication breakdown between him and board members in a surprise move that spurred a crisis at the startup behind ChatGPT. After employees revolted and threatened to resign and Microsoft moved to hire Altman and other executives, the two sides reached a compromise that restored Altman as OpenAI\u2019s CEO. \"I\u2019m comfortable. I have no issues with any structure,\" Nadella said at a Bloomberg News event on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum\u2019s annual meeting in Davos. Microsoft is a key partner and financial backer of OpenAI, having invested billions of dollars in the firm.

Quora CEO Adam D\u2019Angelo was the lone holdover, while Bret Taylor and Larry Summers joined the board. At a separate Bloomberg event in Davos on Tuesday, Altman said that OpenAI is working to fill out the board\u2019s membership and that once that process is completed, the new look board of directors will consider potential changes to OpenAI\u2019s governance structure, including the non-profit board that oversees its operations. \"I expect us to make a lot of progress on that in the coming months. And then after that, the new board will take a look at the governance structure,\" he explained. \"We\u2019ll look at it from all angles.\" WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)? Nadella said that the partnership between Microsoft and OpenAI helps protect competition.

The relationship between Microsoft and OpenAI has reportedly attracted scrutiny from regulators in Europe and Britain, in addition to the U.S. Reuters reported citing a person briefed on the terms of the agreement between the two tech companies that it guarantees Microsoft will receive large chunks of the startup\u2019s profits depending on whether certain conditions are met.
