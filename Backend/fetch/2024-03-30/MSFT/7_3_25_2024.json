Read more Key notes Microsoft is reorganizing its Windows and Surface teams under a single leader, Pavan Davuluri, in a move that is a \u201cholistic approach\u201d to building silicon, systems, experiences, and devices for the AI era. The changes come after Panos Panay\u2019s surprise departure to Amazon last year, which had split the Windows and Surface groups under two different leaders In an internal memo obtained by The Verge, Rajesh Jha, Microsoft\u2019s head of experiences and devices, announced that both Windows and Surface will now fall under Davuluri\u2019s responsibility, as Parakhin \u201chas decided to explore new roles.\u201d Personally, I am gutted by this move. Mikhail Parakhin is a very active person on the internet, sharing insightful information all the time; I hope we get something similar from Davuluri or maybe his team. The reorganization comes just days after former Inflection AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman joined Microsoft as the CEO of a new AI team that will handle the company\u2019s consumer-facing AI products like Copilot, Bing, and Edge. According to Jha\u2019s memo, the Windows team will work together with the Microsoft AI team on AI, silicon, and experiences, but there could be potential overlaps as the AI team now looks after Edge, a key part of the Windows experience. Davuluri, who has worked at Microsoft for over 23 years and was deeply involved in the company\u2019s work with Qualcomm and AMD to create custom Surface processors, will report directly to Jha.
