As Customer Zero, we are the first enterprise to do so at scale. As of this week, nearly everyone at the company has it. We\u2019re seeing immediate and wide-ranging benefits. \u201cOur employees are putting it to work for them right away,\u201d says Claire Sisson, a principal group product manager in Microsoft Digital (MSD), the internal IT organization at Microsoft. \u201cIt immediately starts giving you smart insights that help you get on top of your work.\u201d We\u2019re pioneers in using AI in our products. We\u2019re the first enterprise in the world to launch Copilot at scale, and we\u2019re capturing a ton of insights. \u2014 Claire Sisson, principal group product manager, Microsoft Digital So, what is Copilot for Microsoft 365, exactly? It\u2019s our new productivity solution that uses the power of AI and large language models (LLMs) to help us be more productive. It\u2019s part of our Microsoft Copilot offering that creates a single, seamless user experience across Microsoft 365, Copilot in Windows, Bing, the Microsoft Cloud, and other Microsoft applications. Here at Microsoft, we got Copilot for Microsoft 365 early as part of our role as the company\u2019s Customer Zero, which allows us to test our products at enterprise scale. \u201cWe\u2019re pioneers in using AI in our products,\u201d says Sisson, who is leading the rollout of Copilot for Microsoft 365 internally at Microsoft. \u201cWe\u2019re the first enterprise in the world to launch Copilot at scale, and we\u2019re capturing a ton of insights.\u201d Sharing the feedback that we get from our early adopters is helping the company create the best possible version of Copilot for Microsoft 365 for our customers. \u201cWe\u2019re learning so much,\u201d Sisson says. \u201cWe\u2019re learning how to deploy it at enterprise scale, how to make sure we put in the right protections for our employees and for Microsoft, and then ensuring our employees start using it in productive ways that reap all the new benefits of Copilot.\u201d Copilot for Microsoft 365 gets its power from seamlessly integrating with data in Microsoft 365 Graph and the various Microsoft 365 applications and services that we all\u2014our employees and our customers\u2014use to get work done, including Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and Teams. It helps you in numerous ways, ranging from summarizing action items from an important meeting, to helping you conduct on-the-spot analysis of data that has just come your way, to instantly crafting high quality content that helps you land an important project. \u201cIts capacity to boost productivity and produce high quality work for our employees enables them to dedicate their attention to their core work and big aspirations,\u201d Sisson says. \u201cAnd frankly, that\u2019s what\u2019s happening\u2014our employees are getting time back to work on the things they love, and that\u2019s the high value work that drives this company forward.\u201d [Learn how we\u2019re getting the most out of generative AI at Microsoft with good governance. See how we\u2019re responding to the AI revolution with an AI Center of Excellence. Check out how we\u2019re embracing AI at Microsoft with new AI certifications. Find out how we\u2019re enabling and securing Microsoft Teams meeting data retention at Microsoft.] We know that Copilot for Microsoft 365 is evolving day by day. As the company\u2019s IT organization, we work to understand those changes, document them, and translate them into communications and readiness assets for our employees. As we work to build a better product, the speed of these cycles accelerates awareness and improvement. Each of the main Microsoft 365 applications has a Copilot that you can use. Here are some of the ways you can use Copilot in each of the apps: Copilot in Teams Microsoft 365 Chat Copilot in PowerPoint Copilot in Word Copilot in Excel Copilot in Outlook Copilot in Loop Copilot in Whiteboard \u201cWe\u2019re\u00a0constantly\u00a0engaging our employees,\u201d Sisson says. \u201cEvery application within Microsoft 365 has its own product team developing Copilot features and experiences. We\u2019re working with these teams to provide valuable feedback, and while doing that, we, like our customers, benefit from the product getting better and better.\u201d As the company\u2019s Customer Zero, it\u2019s our job to make sure that our products are human-centric, and that using them makes sense in consistent and coherent ways. Culture, religion, and political beliefs are a few considerations that we\u2019re using to evaluate how Copilot for Microsoft 365 is working for and interacts with our employees. To help with this, Copilot is available in eight languages with a plan to add more shortly. \u201cThe\u00a0level\u00a0of\u00a0complexity that we\u2019re dealing with is very high,\u201d Sisson says. \u201cWe\u2019re capturing and responding to very diverse feedback from employees who are spread across the globe.\u201d We also prioritize trust, security, and compliance. We\u2019re working with the product teams, a broad set of regulatory bodies, and regional works\u2019 councils to ensure that we\u2019re looking out for the best interests of our employees and our company. \u201cThe true potential of Copilot for Microsoft 365 lies not just in its current capabilities but in its future possibilities,\u201d Sisson says. By continuously integrating feedback, staying attuned to global best practices, and harnessing the latest in AI research, Copilot for Microsoft 365 is poised to redefine the boundaries of workplace productivity. One of the ways we provide valuable Customer Zero feedback to the product group is via our partnership with our works councils in the European Union. They\u2019re currently helping us examine the regulatory and ethical boundaries for Copilot usage across the company. Our works councils and other employee representation groups are providing valuable feedback on how AI should work to augment human capabilities, not replace them. They\u2019re evaluating our internal deployment and considering Copilot for Microsoft 365 use cases to ensure compliance with local laws as well as how AI can increase productivity and job satisfaction among their members. They\u2019ve also provided critical insights that help us respect cultural nuances and ensure language accessibility. \u201cOur strong relationship with our works council in Germany helped us get the approvals we needed to deploy Copilot quickly,\u201d says Anna Kopp, director of business programs for MSD in Germany. \u201cBecause of our proactive outreach, our works council almost immediately moved into a state of \u2018tolerance\u2019 for Copilot\u2014which basically means that they haven\u2019t blessed it, but they\u2019re not blocking it either.\u201d It was about working together early and often. \u201cWe gave our works council members early access to Copilot for Microsoft 365 so they could test it and give feedback,\u201d Kopp says. \u201cTheir feedback helped us improve the product in numerous ways, especially around potential uses for behavioral assessment, which is not allowed in Germany. Giving them early access enhanced trust and enabled them to help us improve the product for all our customers with works councils.\u201d While AI technology has recently generated considerable attention and excitement, questions and concerns also exist. Our teams have strong governance measures in place that aim to protect our employees and the company while not getting in the way of our powerful new AI tools. We build trust and are transparent with our employees as part of adhering to our Responsible AI and governance guidelines and are committed to working with our global employees who are represented by labor unions and works councils. \u201cIt\u2019s important that our employees\u2014and the larger Copilot for Microsoft 365 user base\u2014understand that we\u2019re implementing AI as an enhancer and accelerator, not a replacer,\u201d Sisson says. \u201cSuccessful use of AI lies in helping humans make better decisions, not in replacing those decisions altogether.\u201d We\u2019ve done a lot of work\u00a0to put strong governance measures in place here at Microsoft, and that early work is helping us to deploy Copilot for Microsoft 365 quickly. Three tips for accelerating works\u2019 council reviews of Copilot for Microsoft 365: \u201cCopilot for Microsoft 365 governance and compliance lies within the underlying data that it uses to deliver its insights and take action,\u201d says David Johnson, the principal PM architect in MSD who leads our governance efforts. \u201cThe data discovery that Copilot does is built on a good data governance structure. We have strong permission systems in place that make sure our AI tools don\u2019t share insights based on data that an employee shouldn\u2019t have access to.\u201d Johnson and his team are working with the Microsoft Copilot product teams to ensure that these data governance practices and standards are used across all Copilot deployments. This includes deploying governance measures\u2014highlighted by our robust and matrixed labeling measures\u2014designed to prevent oversharing of data, to educate employees on appropriate AI use cases, and to continually assess how Copilot uses our data and how we use the data that Copilot is serving up to us. \u201cIt\u2019s all working together to create an environment where Copilot for Microsoft 365 can be a trusted, practical companion for productivity and empowerment for our employees,\u201d Johnson says. Getting Copilot for Microsoft 365 in the hands of our employees is only the first step\u2014now we want to get them to start using it in the flow of their work. It\u2019s about showing them that they can use it to do more high-level work and have more impact by doing things for them like analyzing Excel data sets and creating PowerPoint presentations from Word documents. We use a robust, tried-and-true adoption approach built on the pillars of envisioning, where you build a strong plan for getting your employees to adopt a new product, on onboarding, where you launch your adoption effort, and on driving value, where you look to help your employees find value in your product.  Prompting Copilot for Microsoft 365 is the process of giving instructions or asking questions to Copilot in natural language. You can prompt Copilot by typing your request in the Copilot window. Copilot will then respond with relevant output, such as text, images, graphs, or actions. To prompt Copilot effectively, follow these best practices: In\u00a0the\u00a0end, the best way to get your employees to start using a new product like Copilot for Microsoft 365 is to show them how it can make their lives better. \u201cCopilot represents a profound shift in how our employees are working,\u201d says Stephan Kerametlian, a director for employee experience in MSD. \u201cThey\u2019re seeing benefits immediately.\u201d For starters, they\u2019re now using natural language to unlock tools that have been right in front of them for a long time\u2014they just didn\u2019t know that they were there, or if they did, how to use them. \u201cMost people only use a small fraction of the features built into Microsoft 365 apps,\u201d Kerametlian says. \u201cCopilot users don\u2019t need to know precisely where a feature is in the app\u2019s interface\u2014they don\u2019t even need to know that it\u2019s there. They just have to imagine what they want to accomplish, and the Copilot will surface the feature for them.\u201d As a result, our employees are discovering new and creative ways to work. Copilot for Microsoft 365 boosts our employees\u2019 productivity by taking care of their mundane tasks and repetitive processes. \u201cThat lets them focus on ideation, creativity, and strategy, the tasks where they can genuinely add value,\u201d Kerametlian says. It\u2019s also upleveling our employees\u2019 skill sets. \u201cTalking to the Copilot using intuitive natural language interaction leads to easier discovery and accelerated learning,\u201d Kerametlian says. \u201cThis makes our employees better at what they\u2019re good at and helps them quickly become experts at what they\u2019re learning. They can rapidly get comfortable with the handful of commands that help them learn the technology and boost their skill.\u201d In truth, Kerametlian says, Copilot for Microsoft 365 is so powerful that it is unleashing a new era of employee creativity and productivity. \u201cIt\u2019s such a natural thing to do, to ask it for help,\u201d he says. \u201cThe more interesting thing will be to see what our employees do with it. We expect that we\u2019re going to see some very creative, and surprising results.\u201d The future vision for Copilot for Microsoft 365 is bright. The measure of a tool\u2019s success isn\u2019t just in its deployment but its adoption, utility, and the tangible impact it brings to everyday tasks. Our Customer Zero emphasis on capturing user feedback from internal teams and external customers will be instrumental in shaping how we grow into using Copilot for Microsoft 365 over time. \u201cWe\u2019re committed to the evolution of Copilot for Microsoft 365 at Microsoft,\u201d Sisson says. \u201cAs we move forward, our mission continues to be to facilitate a seamless, productive, and enriched work experience for our employees.\u201d We\u2019re charting a path where technology and human ingenuity converge through continuous feedback, rigorous refinement, and adherence to best practices. \u201cWe\u2019re very excited about where we are right now,\u201d Sisson says. \u201cCopilot for Microsoft 365 isn\u2019t just a tool for our employees to use\u2014it\u2019s a testament to the future of work, a future where technology augments human potential, empowering every individual to achieve more.\u201d Here are some things to think about as you consider getting started with Copilot for Microsoft 365: If you want to learn more about Copilot and how to use it, you can check out the following resources: Learn how to get ready for Copilot for Microsoft 365 at your company.
