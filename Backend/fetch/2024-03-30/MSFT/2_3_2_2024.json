Elon Musk sued Microsoft-backed OpenAI for the sake of humanity \u2013\u00a0apparently. What does this mean? OpenAI was originally a non-profit company with a mission to make sure that AI would benefit humanity. It takes a lot of cash to develop world-changing technology, though, so ChatGPT\u2019s owner added a capped profit-making arm in 2019. But Elon Musk believes the company\u2019s veered too close toward a traditional money-making model, arguing that truly working for the benefit of humanity would involve sharing the underlying code with the world. Mind you, plenty of skeptics believe that Musk\u2019s lawsuit is a shrewd competitive move. He has his own rival AI firm, after all. Either way, the Tesla tycoon isn\u2019t afraid to pick a fight: he\u2019s currently battling Google, Disney, and the US government. Why should I care? For markets: Microsoft\u2019s in hot water. Microsoft makes a fortune selling ChatGPT services, a revenue stream that would likely dry up if the latest updates were freely available. Plus, Musk\u2019s lawsuit alleges that OpenAI\u2019s latest model should be classed as artificial general intelligence, the Black Mirror-style type that can do as well as humans on some tasks. Microsoft doesn\u2019t have a deal for that, though, so it could lose its exclusive access. On top of that, the New York Times has also sued Microsoft and OpenAI for copyright infringement, and US, European, and British competition watchdogs are keeping a close eye on the duo. Bear in mind, though, that legal threats have a habit of harboring more bark than bite. The bigger picture: This could be the start of the storm. Economist Carlota Perez has described a necessary \u201creset\u201d that takes place when a revolutionary technology moves from development to deployment. According to Perez, that includes social tensions, government interventions, a shift in political thoughts, and often, a financial crash.
