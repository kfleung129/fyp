    "text": "by Jessica Lucas | Fri, 29 Mar 2024 at 17:58:28  \n    | Tech  Microsoft is rolling out a new preview of Windows 11 for devices currently in the Beta Channel of the Windows Insider Program (build 22635.3420). The official release of Windows 11 update 22635.3420 (KB5035953) announced the reinstatement of the drag-and-drop feature on the breadcrumb on File Explorer, the appearance of the \"Widgets\" icons on the Taskbar, the integration of the Windows Backup feature into your sound settings, and the creation of a QR code on the Share interface for links and cloud files. Microsoft is also working on introducing features that are already available in other preview channels, such as the ability to use Copilot without a Microsoft account, a new weather widget, and additional information on the Lock screen. The Beta Channel is set to introduce the most crucial modifications for Windows 11 testers, with a rollout scheduled for March 29. The ability to drag and drop folders and files in the address bar's breadcrumb is now available, as part of Microsoft's rebuilding of the service, which will allow for the smoothing of files and folders in the same path. Although not a feature of earlier versions of Windows, previous versions of the operating system had the ability to move content in the address bar through dragging and dropping. The Widgets dashboard in Windows 11 will display on the right side of the Taskbar, opposite the System Tray, just like its predecessor in Windows 10, with the \"News and interests\" feature. Microsoft has recently added a feature on the Share interface that allows users to generate QR codes for web links and OneDrive-backed files. Additionally, the experience will no longer be automatically closed when the Share interface is pressed outside of the window, as a precaution against accidental termination. Microsoft is working on extending the Share interface's feature to include the ability to generate QR codes, as previously mentioned in previous versions. The process begins with this flight and includes uploading your sound settings to OneDrive through the Windows Backup feature. Furthermore, the company has unveiled an option to connect through a Microsoft account on the Windows Backup interface. (Previously, the primary method for accessing the backup feature required setting up OneDrive.) The changes mentioned earlier can be implemented gradually on devices that use the option to \"Get the latest updates as soon as they are available\" instead of using the incremental change. The following enhancements can be added to any device regardless of whether it has Windows Update settings. From the update KB5035953, the Lock screen will be updated with different dynamic widgets that provide information on weather, finance, traffic, and other factors. Activate the feature by going to Settings > Personalization > Lock screen and selecting the \"Weather and More\" option from the \"Lock screen status\" tab. In anticipation of version 24H2 release, Microsoft has stated that it will be released through an update in April 2024 for users of Windows 11 and 10. Up to ten times using Copilot when logged in with a local account is now possible without a Microsoft account or Entra ID. While the company has introduced new features for Copilot and Lock screen in this channel, the company has also been making changes for other channels, including the Lock screen version that is now available to Windows 10 users. Along with the visual enhancements, this flight also includes several other enhancements. For example, network administrators can disable the prompt after logging in with an Entra ID. This revision enhances the Remote Desktop Session Host, allowing the selection of the single-directed clipboard redirection option. Additionally, there are improvements made to the Taskbar's \"File taskbar buttons and hide labels\" feature, as well as other problems related to NPUs, policies, applications, time, and other factors. File Explorer and Widgets have been identified by Microsoft as having certain problems. The company has launched a new update, version 26090.112 (KB5037477) in the Canary and Dev Channels, but it's primarily for testing the \"serving pipeline\" and nothing else. Install Windows 11 build 22635.3420 can be done by enrolling your device in the Beta Channel via the \"Windows Insider Program\" settings in the Update & Security section. After completing the enrollment, all that is left is to download the build from the \u201cWindows Update\u201d setting.  23 Most Expensive Vodka Bottles To Drink With Your Friends 23 Amazing Tattoo Ideas That Will Make You Special And Unique 23 World's Most Expensive Headphones Each Audiophile Can't Miss 23 Best Anime Series Ever Made That Are Still Actual For Fans MSNBC Live Stream FOX News Live Stream The List of Four Simple Rules To Have A Flat Stomach How To Get Free Samples By Mail?
