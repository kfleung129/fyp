    "text": " Credit: Adobe Stock Images Microsoft Copilot for Security is scheduled for general availability on April 1, following a private preview of the software giant's AI assistant for security by select customers including MSSPs. Microsoft will offer the technology as both a standalone product and one that is embedded within the security products customers already use. To make Copilot for Security accessible to a wider range of organizations, Microsoft is introducing a provisioned pay-as-you-go licensing model. This is different from the debut of Microsoft Copilot for 365 which came with a $30 per seat licensing fee and a minimum number of seats purchased at 300. Microsoft did not offer not-for-resale licenses to partners for Copilot for 365. Microsoft said the consumption model for Copilot for Security means it will be\u00a0easy to get started quickly and\u00a0on a small scale and\u202f to experiment and learn with no upfront per device or per user charges. Customers will use their existing Azure subscription or\u202fsign up for one if they are not already an Azure customer. They will then be able to provision Azure capacity to support all their Copilot for Security workloads, both\u202fstandalone and embedded. Copilot for Security capacity is anticipated to be billed monthly via a new Security Compute Unit (SCU) at the rate of $4/hr.  Microsoft recommends that customers have MDE P2 or Microsoft Sentinel for a better product experience. Microsoft describes Copilot for Security as a product to complement rather than replace human skills. Noting a recent research study conducted by its Office of the Chief Economist, experienced security analysts using Copilot for Security were 22% faster\u00a0at common security tasks. Their accuracy increased by 7%. And\u00a097%\u00a0of security analysts said they wanted to use Copilot again, Microsoft said. \u201cOur partners bring their experience, skills, and established methods for dealing with vulnerabilities,\u201d Microsoft\u2019s Julie Sanford, vice president of Programs & Experiences, Partner GFM, wrote in her blog post. \u201cThis new tool enables them to apply their expertise to services and offerings that AI solutions without human insights cannot match.\u201d  Sanford said that the solution combines the most advanced GPT4 model from OpenAI with Microsoft-developed AI orchestration. It also consolidates and integrates Microsoft global threat intelligence capabilities, as well as a comprehensive set of security products in one place. Microsoft said Copilot for Security provides a live, comprehensive view of a user\u2019s security estate that lets them consistently evaluate and enhance their protection \u2014 to increase efficiency and cooperation with a simplified, natural language-based user experience. Over the past six months, Microsoft has partnered with more than 100 MSSPs and independent software vendors in a\u00a0Copilot for Security Partner private preview. These organizations have enhanced Copilot\u2019s development by testing and enhancing new scenarios, providing feedback on product development and operations for future releases, and assessing APIs to aid in Copilot for Security extensibility. Microsoft said it will conduct a\u00a0series of sales and technical readiness bootcamps\u00a0in the coming months to equip its entire partner ecosystem with the skills to support customers in meeting their security requirements. \u201cPartners have the opportunity to help with scalability, operational team design and reporting through flexible allocation of analysts, audience-specific reporting, and promoting quick response and cooperation,\u201d Sanford said. \u201cThe benefits of managed security services may also include managed SOC expertise, scenario-based processes, and the design and operation of unified and adaptable teams.\u201d The product launch was preceded by the release of Copilot for Microsoft 365, Copilot for Finance, Copilot for Sales, Copilot for Service, and Copilot for the education market. With respect to Security Copilot embedded in the Microsoft 365 Defender XDR platform, organizations that work with MSSPs and are part of Microsoft\u2019s Early Access Program will be able to extend access to their Security Copilot environment. As such, MSSPs can participate using Security Copilot (Bring Your Own \u2014 MSSP).
