News February 26, 2024 Daphn\u00e9 Leprince-Ringuet and\u00a0Tim Smith 2 min read Paris-based GenAI startup Mistral has today announced a strategic distribution partnership with Microsoft, as it launches its new \u201cmultilingual flagship model\u201d, Mistral Large. The deal sees Microsoft take a small stake in the French startup, Sifted understands, and will mean that Mistral\u2019s AI models will be available on the US tech giant\u2019s cloud computing platform Azure. Mistral is now the second company to forge a distribution deal with Microsoft, which has invested more than $13bn in US startup OpenAI. Announcing the news, Mistral cofounder and CEO Arthur Mensch said that the company is \u201dvery proud to announce the availability of Mistral Large on Azure AI,\u201d and that \u201cMicrosoft's trust in our model is a step forward in our journey to put frontier AI in everyone's hands\u201d. The move represents some validation of Mistral\u2019s strategy to provide a European alternative to powerful AI models developed in the US, by showing a strong commercial appetite for AI built to be multilingual from the ground up. According to the company, Mistral Large \u2014 a large-language model that can power generative AI technologies like chatbots \u2014 is fluent in five languages: French, English, German, Spanish and Italian. OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT can take prompts in languages other than English, but researchers have found that although the system is good at translating into English, it doesn\u2019t perform as strongly when asked to translate English into other languages. Mistral says that based on \u201ccommonly used benchmarks\u201d its new model is the \u201cworld's second-ranking model available through an API alongside GPT-4\u201d. The Paris-based company, which was created in June last year by former Google AI and Meta employees, has made waves in recent months, raising just under \u20ac500m since launching. It is one of Europe\u2019s best-funded startups in the space. It is considered by some as one of Europe\u2019s strongest competitors to OpenAI and became a prominent critic of the EU\u2019s AI Act, which it said risked putting Europe even further behind in the global AI race. The partnership with Microsoft comes as European governments stress the need to develop \u201csovereign\u201d AI technologies that can compete against English-speaking models developed in the US.
