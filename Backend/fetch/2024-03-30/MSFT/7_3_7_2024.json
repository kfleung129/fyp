    "text": "Microsoft has announced that it's holding an event on March 21 that will focus on its upcoming generative AI devices and features. The event entitled \"Advancing the new era of work with Copilot\" will start at 9AM Pacific/12PM Eastern time that date. Microsoft promises to unveil \"the latest in scaling AI in your environment with Copilot, Windows and Surface,\" but it has shared no other details on what its announcements could be. As Windows Central\u00a0had previously reported, the company is expected to launch the Surface Pro 10 and Surface Laptop 6 on March 21. They're apparently slated to be Microsoft's first AI PCs that will be equipped with the new Intel Core Ultra or Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite processors. Both models have neural processing units (NPUs) that boost AI capabilities, which is why the upcoming Surfaces will most likely be the first to support the new AI features coming to Windows 11. Those new AI features could include real-time live captions and translations, upscaling for games and frame rate smoothing. Microsoft is also reportedly working on a feature called AI Explorer that will give users a way to conduct searches across apps, documents, web pages, images and chats using natural language. Windows Central said AI Explorer might have the capability to understand context and suggest actions based on what's on the screen. It could also create a history of the tasks a user does on their computer to make them searchable later on. We'll know for sure if Microsoft truly is launching new Surface devices and new AI features a couple of weeks from now \u2014 we will, of course, keep you updated on what the company reveals.
