    "text": "In a surprise move, Microsoft this week scooped up two top executives and a number of engineers from startup Inflection AI to staff a dedicated new artificial intelligence (AI) unit within the company. But the play raised several questions, such as \u2018why didn\u2019t Microsoft just acquire Inflection altogether,\u2019 \u2018is the company hedging its bets against its OpenAI investment,\u2019 and \u2018what does this mean for the market at large?\u2019  Of course, we don\u2019t like unanswered questions, so we went knocking on a few analyst doors to get their takes on the news. Here\u2019s what they told us. Analysts were split on whether Microsoft poached Inflection\u2019s staff to avoid regulatory scrutiny that might come with an acquisition or simply to gain top-tier talent in a key market. GlobalData Senior Analyst Beatriz Valle told Silverlinings \u201cMicrosoft does have a track record of acquiring smaller rivals to quash competition, and this is an alternative way of going about it to avoid regulatory scrutiny.\u201d  Moor Insights and Strategy Principal Analyst Anshel Sag noted that picking up just the staff and not the whole company \u201cdoes seem like a faster and easier way to acquire talent.\u201d But his boss, Moor Insights and Strategy CEO Patrick Moorhead, wasn\u2019t convinced the move was designed to sidestep regulators. Since smaller companies like Inflection are \u201cnot nearly as difficult\u201d to acquire as larger rivals, he said he doesn\u2019t believe there\u2019s \u201canything funny going on\u201d on that front. AvidThink Founder Roy Chua\u2019s opinion was somewhere in between. Like Moorhead, he said Inflection may not have had sufficient market power to warrant a regulatory review. But he concurred with Sag that \u201cthis was an efficient way of moving high quality talent rapidly into Microsoft\u00a0without much scrutiny.\u201d Another concern associated with the move is that Microsoft is attempting to more or less squash competition. Valle, for instance, noted Inflection is a direct competitor to Microsoft-backed OpenAI. Snagging Inflection\u2019s top talent \u201cwill obviously dramatically lessen any competitive impact on that front.\u201d But Moorhead noted the staff in question also have agency, and they likely want to work for the companies that are best positioned to monetize the technologies they\u2019re building. To that end, he noted \u201cMicrosoft is in the top echelon of companies that you might want to work for if you\u2019re in AI.\u201d Chua added he doesn\u2019t expect Microsoft to run a similar play with French AI startup Mistral, which it recently invested in \u2013 or any other company, really. \u201cI don't think Microsoft is banking on a strategy of pulling out teams from existing AI unicorns the same way,\u201d he told us. Almost unanimously, the analysts indicated Microsoft is looking to build up its internal AI talent, though they differed in the reasons they offered as to why. Valle and Sag pointed to the executive shuffle at OpenAI as both a catalyst for and an indicator of Microsoft\u2019s plans. \u201cMicrosoft must have had quite a fright during the governance crisis at OpenAI,\u201d Valle said. \u201cIt seems that Nadella is hedging his bets and has decided to diversify risk and who can blame him.\u201d She added the move also comes as competition between Microsoft and Google for dominance on the AI front intensifies. Sag noted the fact that Microsoft jumped to hire OpenAI CEO Sam Altman during the latter\u2019s leadership crisis late last year \u201cdemonstrated Microsoft\u2019s desire to have someone that\u2019s already a visionary in AI to lead its consumer AI division.\u201d Of course, Mustafa Suleyman fits the bill, having co-founded not just Inflection AI but also DeepMind. Sag added that the move was significant enough to draw the attention of Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, who called it \"pretty big\" when speaking with analysts at his company's GTC conference this week. As far as what the move means for the future, Chua said the hire of Inflection\u2019s team and the creation of a dedicated unit is indicative of Microsoft\u2019s enormous expectations for AI. \u201cI think this could bode well for Copilot and the human-computer interaction part of Copilot and Microsoft's products \u2014 I'm sure that learning will be ported over and adapted, and that will help with usability,\u201d Chua commented. And for Inflection, the departures are \u201cdefinitely a blow\u201d but Chua noted \u201cit appears that Inflection's investors and other co-founders still believe there's some long-term value in the remaining assets and that they can execute\u00a0a pivot.\u201d The company\u2019s strong relationship with Microsoft could end up being mutually beneficial, he concluded.
