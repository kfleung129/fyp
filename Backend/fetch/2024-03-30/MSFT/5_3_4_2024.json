Read more Microsoft released the Edge 122.0.2365.63 version to its browser, but following its release, multiple users reported that the update caused the browser to crash when accessing websites. Some users quickly found a solution to the issue, and it seems disabling a security option within Edge would make it work again properly. However, not many users managed to actually try to implement this solution, because the Redmond-based tech giant quickly pulled the Edge 122.0.2365.63 version out, and the stable version went back to the 122.0.2365.59 version. On Friday afternoon, however, Microsoft released the 122.0.2365.66, which effectively fixes the Out of Memory issue seen in the 122.0.2365.63 version. The issue affected both Windows 11, and Windows 10 devices, and Reddit users have been complaining about it since early February. The strange thing is that all of these users had well-equipped systems so the lack of RAM power, or CPU was not the problem. However, according to the one that found a fix for the problem, the latest updates to Edge somehow bugged its Enhanced Web Protection feature, and the updates caused it to run into conflicts with the browser. The solution was found by an Edge user, Nails89, and it was posted on the\u00a0official Microsoft Edge forums, explaining: Hi, I don\u2019t know if this will help but the security of the browser is causing this issue with the new update\u2026To fix this issue, Go to \u201cSettings>Privacy, search and services,\u201d scroll down to the \u201cSecurity\u201d section and then turn off \u201cEnhance your security on the web.\u201d setting. This is what helped me, hope it helps you too\u2026 Cheers! Disabling the option would fix the issue entirely, but it would leave users at risk, as the Enhance your security on the web capability is recommended to be enabled when browsing the Internet on Microsoft Edge. However, the latest update entirely fixes the bug without having to turn this option off.
