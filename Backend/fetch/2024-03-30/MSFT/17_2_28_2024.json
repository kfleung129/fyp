Read more Key notes Microsoft is upping the ante to find and fix security vulnerabilities in pre-release versions of its popular productivity suite. The company announced today that it\u2019s doubling the maximum reward for critical bugs found in Microsoft 365 Insider builds, raising the bar to a staggering USD 30,000. This move comes alongside expanding the program\u2019s scope, now encompassing a wider range of vulnerability types and products.

This update highlights Microsoft\u2019s continued commitment to working with the security research community to identify and address potential security issues before malicious actors can exploit them.
