Read more Key notes A few days ago, Microsoft said it\u2019s confident that Copilot will be profitable in the long run even if it\u2019s struggling right now. That\u2019s why it keeps improving the chatbot across all platforms, including the Microsoft Edge browser. One of the major features for Edge\u2019s Copilot Microsoft was spotted working is making it super easy for users to delete the complete chat history. You can access Copilot from Edge\u2019s sidebar to ask questions, generate images, and resume a chat from the chat history. However, while you can delete an individual chat easily, erasing the complete chat history is painful, especially if you have a lot of it. Deleting different chat records one by one is the only way to delete the complete chat history, which takes a lot of time and effort. However, the good news is Microsoft is fixing this in Edge Copilot. As spotted by famed leaker @Leopeva64, Microsoft Edge will allow users to delete the complete chat history with a couple of clicks instead of deleting each record one at a time. According to a demo posted by the leaker, Microsoft Edge will have a three-dot view setting beside the Plug-ins in the Recent section, and clicking on it will give you the Delete all chat history option. You can now delete your entire chat history with a couple of clicks in Edge Copilot, previously you had to delete the different entries one by one, and the layout of the chat box has changed, now all the buttons appear at the bottom and on the right side:https://t.co/8nGPp3h608 pic.twitter.com/nzJuON9Mrw Deleting all chats at once is currently in the testing phase, so even if you\u2019re running the latest version of Edge, you won\u2019t see it. We haven\u2019t been able to get it working in Edge Canary and Dev, either. This could mean two things: either it\u2019s available for select users or Microsoft is internally testing it and hasn\u2019t rolled it out to Edge Insiders. If you\u2019re using Edge Canary or Dev, do see the option to delete all chat history? Let us know in the comments section below.
