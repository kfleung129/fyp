The content of this article is provided for information purposes only and is not intended to be, nor does it constitute, any form of personal advice. Investments in a currency other than sterling are exposed to currency exchange risk. Currency exchange rates are constantly changing, which may affect the value of the investment in sterling terms.

Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock has soared by 50% in the last year, largely buoyed by the buzz around its OpenAI division. The advent of ChatGPT seems to have given Microsoft a golden ticket, packaging AI technology into a subscription-based model. This is no small feat in an industry where many are still stuck in the conceptual phase, offering little beyond buzzwords and pie-in-the-sky AI dreams. But does this make Microsoft a must-buy for my portfolio? Here\u2019s why I don\u2019t think so. A recent analysis by New York University professor of finance and equity valuation Aswath Damodaran pegs Microsoft as the second-most overvalued stock among the so-called Magnificent Seven tech giants. According to the \u2018Dean of Valuation\u2019, Microsoft was 14% overvalued as of 9 February. The Magnificent Seven collectively added a staggering $5.1trn to their market cap in 2023, accounting for over 60% of the S&P 500\u2019s total return that year. The latest quarterly earnings report for Q4 2024 underscores Microsoft\u2019s robust performance. The company posted an 18% increase in revenue to $62bn and a 33% jump in net income to $21.9bn. These figures are impressive, reflecting strong execution and the successful integration of Activision Blizzard into its portfolio. Such achievements highlight Microsoft\u2019s strategic prowess. Particularly impressive has been the company\u2019s ability to leverage AI across its technology stack, securing new customers and driving productivity gains across sectors. Microsoft Cloud\u2019s revenue alone surged to $33.7bn, up 24% year-over-year. There\u2019s no denying Microsoft is a \u2018wonderful company\u2019, as legendary investor Warren Buffett might put it. But is it trading at a \u2018fair price\u2019? With a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 36, significantly higher than its five-year average of 31, the market\u2019s enthusiasm for Microsoft\u2019s growth prospects seems to have reached fever pitch. Source: Simply Wall Street historical P/E data The company\u2019s market cap has ballooned by 280% over the past five years to $3trn. Going forwards, there are natural limits to how quickly it can continue to expand due to its already ginormous size. Moreover, the broader tech landscape is fraught with competition and regulatory challenges. Although Microsoft\u2019s recent performance and strategic investments in AI and cloud computing are exciting, the current hype and valuation raise questions about the sustainability of its stock price growth. The attraction of Microsoft\u2019s success story must be balanced against the realities of its valuation and growth potential. Personally, I\u2019d rather look at less hyped-up areas of the global stock market for undervalued gems. Currently, I\u2019m focusing on the FTSE 100 for basement-bargain deals on growth and dividend stocks.  Should you invest, the value of your investment may rise or fall and your capital is at risk.
