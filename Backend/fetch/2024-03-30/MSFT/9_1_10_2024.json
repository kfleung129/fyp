OpenAI and ChatGPT logos are seen in this illustration taken, February 3, 2023 Dado Ruvic/Reuters BRUSSELS, Belgium \u2013 Microsoft\u2019s financial backing for ChatGPT maker\u00a0OpenAI\u00a0may be subject to\u00a0EU\u00a0merger\u00a0rules,\u00a0EU\u00a0antitrust\u00a0regulators\u00a0said on Tuesday, January 9, underscoring a\u00a0similar warning\u00a0from its UK peer in December. The US software giant, which last year committed to invest over $10 billion into\u00a0OpenAI\u00a0with a non-voting position on the board, has said it does not own any portion of\u00a0OpenAI. The\u00a0European Commission had\u00a0previously said\u00a0it was following developments closely. \u201cThe\u00a0European Commission is checking whether\u00a0Microsoft\u2019s\u00a0investment\u00a0in\u00a0OpenAI\u00a0might be reviewable under the\u00a0EU\u00a0Merger\u00a0Regulation,\u201d the\u00a0EU\u00a0executive, which acts as the\u00a0EU\u00a0competition enforcer, said in a statement. It said some agreements agreed between large digital market players and generative AI developers and providers were being investigated for their impact on market dynamics. It did not name the companies. The Commission on Tuesday also gave interested parties until March 11 to provide feedback on competition in virtual worlds and generative artificial intelligence. It also sent requests for information to several large digital companies on the two topics. \u201cWe are inviting businesses and experts to tell us about any competition issues that they may perceive in these industries, whilst also closely monitoring AI partnerships to ensure they do not unduly distort market dynamics,\u201d\u00a0EU\u00a0antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager said. \u2013 Rappler.com Error.
