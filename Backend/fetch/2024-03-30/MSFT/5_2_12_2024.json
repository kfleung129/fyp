The explosion of interest and investment in AI recently has had a significant impact on nearly every facet of society. Companies in virtually every sector are continously competing to develop and build upon their own AI products and services, with a particular focus present in the world of Big Tech. One particular company that has launched full force into the AI scene is Microsoft. The tech giant has placed a considerable amount of attention and effort into its AI offerings, boosted by its partnership with AI powerhouse OpenAI, as well as investing heavily in the sector. This AI focus appears to be paying off for Microsoft, as it recently became the second company ever to briefly reach the $3trn valuation, a feat that previously had only been achieved by Apple. Last September, Microsoft revealed its AI assistant, Microsoft Copilot, an AI chatbot for everyday use that brings all of the company\u2019s AI offerings under one umbrella brand. Since its reveal, Copilot has received numerous updates and upgrades, such as being infused with OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT-4 Turbo model and the Dall-E 3 image generator, as well as the reveal of a premium version of the chatbot. Microsoft also announced the addition of a Copilot key on Windows 11 PCs, which will reportedly begin appearing this year. But how does Copilot fit into the broad spectrum of digital assistants and chatbots? According to Phillip Fitzpatrick, director of Microsoft Services at BearingPoint Ireland, Copilot has \u201cjumped the curve\u201d of what digital assistants are capable of. \u201cIt is so far beyond the simple command interfaces that we have got used to \u2013 and frustrated with \u2013 that is just can\u2019t be categorised with them,\u201d says Fitzpatrick. \u201cIt is helping me quickly summarise long documents in Word, draft emails in Outlook, analyse data in Excel and generate PowerPoints to help me share the stories of what I have discovered.\u201d A common concern around the use of AI chatbots and assistants \u2013 particularly in a corporate setting \u2013 is the level of understanding that this technology has in terms of context and user intent, with distinct worries about hallucinations. Fitzpatrick says that these hallucinations can be avoided when the AI has enough context, and that Copilot is consistently aware of users\u2019 corporate context through the use of Microsoft Graph, a service that securely connects data across the Microsoft 365 landscape. \u201cMicrosoft Graph creates a Semantic Index across your documents\u00a0on OneDrive , your company\u2019s documents in SharePoint, your Teams channels and across your Outlook content,\u201d explains Fitzpatrick. \u201cThis means that no matter what area of Microsoft 365 you are working in, Copilot knows the context you are in and can determine the nuance of the message. \u201cAs an example, if I ask Microsoft 365 Chat to \u2018summarise recent emails from Gary\u2019, it already has a good idea [of] who Gary is because it knows that there is a Gary who I frequently correspond with.\u201d Fitzpatrick also emphasises the importance of extensibility. \u201cFor example, Microsoft are enabling connectivity to other systems, so companies will be able to bring data into the Semantic Index from third-party products such as Jira or ServiceNow.\u201d With the increased focus on development and deployment in the AI chatbot scene, we also wanted to find out what trends are directly impacting this innovation. \u201cWe have already seen that the new generation of generative AI chatbots are surpassing the simple command or two-word query ability of their limited predecessors,\u201d says Stephen Redmond, a director and head of the data analytics and AI team at BearingPoint Ireland. \u201cThis is enabled by the natural language processing (NLP) abilities of the underlying large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4. I think that 2024 will be the year of the Copilot!\u201d Redmond predicts that every system used in a work environment will utilise a digital assistant that answers questions and performs in-context tasks to improve productivity. He says that through the presence of constantly improving LLMs and enhanced dialogue management techniques, these assistants will become more conversational, resulting in quicker answers and ultimately benefit the user\u2019s productivity. \u201cImprovements that we will see emerging in the dialogue management will be the additional ability to handle multiple topics, switch between different modes of interaction and provide feedback and guidance to the user,\u201d says Redmond. \u201cModes of interaction for users will include seamless switching between voice, text and images. \u201cWhat will be really interesting to observe is what happens as the interaction extends to other models using APIs \u2013 bots talking to bots, with intelligent orchestration!\u201d Redmond also believes that there will be a \u201cwhole new set of thinking\u201d around user experience in terms of these chatbots and assistants, such as the way people use this tech and how it can be designed to seamlessly integrate into various contexts. \u201cPeople often think in complex ways, and as we get more comfortable with this new generation of chatbots then we will expect them to handle more complex queries \u2013 without us having to learn to be prompt engineers!\u201d One can\u2019t discuss this emerging tech without discussing the various ethical concerns that arise with its integration. Redmond stresses that privacy and compliance with existing regulations are important and \u201cshould go without saying in the design of any modern technology\u201d, and that AI-specific issues such as transparency, fairness and accountability are \u201cgoing to be key\u201d. \u201cAny time that someone is engaging with a chatbot, it should be transparent to the user that it is an AI that they are dealing with,\u201d says Redmond, adding that the AI should be able to disclose information such as its identity, purpose and capabilities to a user on request. \u201cThe bot should never pretend to be human or try and deceive the user,\u201d he says. \u201cThis also goes to the topic of respecting human dignity. The AI chatbot has got to respect the autonomy, rights and values of the person using the system, and should not manipulate, coerce or exploit them in any way.\u201d Redmond says that fairness in AI is a \u201ccritical topic\u201d and that efforts need to be made to avoid discrimination and bias being perpetrated by a chatbot, which has occurred in the past. \u201cFrom an accountability perspective, chatbots should obviously always follow the laws, regulations and ethical standards that apply, including the new EU AI Act and any other laws that may come from other jurisdictions. And they should also be subject to monitoring, evaluation and feedback.\u201d Find out how emerging tech trends are transforming tomorrow with our new podcast, Future Human: The Series.
