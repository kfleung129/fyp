Customers like Visa, BP, Honda, and Pfizer, and partners like Accenture, KPMG, and PwC are already using Copilot to transform the way they work, and 40% of the Fortune 100 participated in the Copilot Early Access Program. We are updating our Microsoft Copilot product line-up with a new Copilot Pro subscription for individuals; expanding Copilot for Microsoft 365 availability to small and medium-sized businesses; and announcing no seat minimum for commercial plans\u2014making Copilot generally available to individuals, enterprises, and everyone in between. Read on for all the details. Copilot for Microsoft 365 enables users to enhance their creativity, productivity, and skills. Take the power of AI on the go with the copilot app First, we are announcing an update to our Copilot product line-up: Copilot Pro\u2014a new Copilot subscription for individuals priced at $20 per individual per month. Copilot Pro has foundational capabilities in a single experience that runs across your devices and understands your context on the web, on your PC, across your apps, and soon on your phone to bring the right skills to you when you need them. And it has web grounding, so it always has access to the latest information. When you\u2019re signed into Copilot with your Microsoft Entra ID, you get commercial data protection for free\u2014which means chat data isn\u2019t saved, Microsoft has no eyes-on access, and your data isn\u2019t used to train the models. Copilot Pro provides priority access to the very latest models\u2014starting with OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 Turbo. You\u2019ll have access to GPT-4 Turbo during peak times for faster performance and, coming soon, the ability to toggle between models to optimize your experience how you choose. Microsoft 365 Personal and Family subscribers can use Copilot in Word, Excel (currently in Preview and English only), PowerPoint, Outlook, OneNote on PC, and soon on Mac and iPad. It includes enhanced AI image creation with Designer (formerly Bing Image Creator) for faster, more detailed image quality as well as landscape image format. And Copilot Pro gives you the ability to build your own Copilot GPT\u2014a pre-customized Copilot tailored for a specific topic\u2014in our new Copilot GPT Builder (coming soon) with just a simple set of prompts. Microsoft Copilot Studio While Copilot Pro is our best experience for individuals, Copilot for Microsoft 365 is our best experience for organizations. Copilot for Microsoft 365 gives you the same priority access to the very latest models. You get Copilot in Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, OneNote, and Microsoft Teams\u2014combined with your universe of data in the Microsoft Graph. It has enterprise-grade data protection which means it inherits your existing Microsoft 365 security, privacy, identity, and compliance policies. And it also includes Copilot Studio, so organizations can customize Copilot for Microsoft 365 and build their own custom copilots and plugins as well as manage and secure their customizations and standalone copilots with the right access, data, user controls, and analytics.
