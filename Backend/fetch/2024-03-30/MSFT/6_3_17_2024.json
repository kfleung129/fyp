UK has a long but promising road towards becoming an 'AI superpower', Microsoft report says New research has found that 87% of UK businesses are unprepared for the age of AI due to their vulnerability to cyberattacks. A report from Microsoft found just 13% of UK businesses can be described as \u2018resilient\u2019 to cybercrime, putting over three quarters of firms at a higher risk of crippling and costly ransomware attacks. Investments made into integrating AI into cyber defences could contribute \u00a352 billion back into the UK economy due to the increased resilience AI can provide. The UK has some significant hurdles to overcome if the government is to meet its commitment to become a \u2018global AI superpower\u2019 within 10 years, as the Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport intends. Microsoft's research found thousands of businesses in the UK could be susceptible to a devastating cyberattack, with 48% ranked as \u2018vulnerable\u2019 while a further 39% are ranked as \u2018at high risk\u2019. Therefore, businesses need to do more to integrate AI into their cyber defences in order to \u2018fight fire with fire\u2019, as hackers increasingly turn to AI in order to boost both the quality and quantity of their attacks. The research was conducted by Dr Chris Brauer of the University of London in collaboration with Microsoft, and surveyed over 1,000 cybersecurity experts, employees, and senior leaders of private and public sector organisations.

Britain currently sits at the top in the global rankings of cybersecurity, but much more needs to be done to secure businesses, and the potential \u00a352 billion annual dividend that could massively benefit the UK economy. In order to get there though, 69% of those surveyed believe that in order to become an \u2018AI superpower\u2019, Britain also needs to bolster its defenses to meet this goal. Effectively, an AI superpower must also be a cybersecurity superpower. \u201cCyber criminals, some armed with the resources of a nation state, are \u2018tooling up\u2019 with AI to increase the sophistication and intensity of their attacks,\u201d said Paul Kelly, Director of the Security Business Group at Microsoft UK. \u201cThis research outlines 52 billion reasons for organisational leaders to \u2018fight fire with fire\u2019.\u201d \u201cThe same AI technologies can help leaders better secure their organisation and tip the balance back in their favour. AI has the potential to make your business and data more secure, but also, if a cyberattack were to occur, to lessen the impact on your bottom line.\u201d Alongside the research, the report also provides five opportunities for the UK to meet the goal of becoming both an AI and cybersecurity superpower: Benedict Collins is a Staff Writer at TechRadar Pro covering privacy and security. Before settling into journalism he worked as a Livestream Production Manager, covering games in the National Ice Hockey League for 5 years and contributing heavily to the advancement of livestreaming within the league. Benedict is mainly focused on security issues such as phishing, malware, and cyber criminal activity, but he also likes to draw on his knowledge of geopolitics and international relations to understand the motives and consequences of state-sponsored cyber attacks.  He has a MA in Security, Intelligence and Diplomacy, alongside a BA in Politics with Journalism, both from the University of Buckingham. His masters dissertation, titled 'Arms sales as a foreign policy tool,' argues that the export of weapon systems has been an integral part of the diplomatic toolkit used by the US, Russia and China since 1945. Benedict has also written about NATO's role in the era of hybrid warfare, the influence of interest groups on US foreign policy, and how reputational insecurity can contribute to the misuse of intelligence.  Outside of work Ben follows many sports; most notably ice hockey and rugby. When not running or climbing, Ben can most often be found deep in the shrubbery of a pub garden.
