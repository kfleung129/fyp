BBy now it\u2019s clear: AI will transform work for everyone. But some business leaders have moved to the front of the pack. In the past year, people in industries around the world have adopted Copilot for Microsoft 365, testing how it can revolutionize the way they work. The early results show Copilot users spend less time on mundane, energy-sapping tasks and more time on high-level, high-value work, allowing leaders to reimagine their business models and pursue once-impossible bold opportunities.

In the past year, people in industries around the world have adopted Copilot for Microsoft 365, testing how it can revolutionize the way they work. The early results show Copilot users spend less time on mundane, energy-sapping tasks and more time on high-level, high-value work, allowing leaders to reimagine their business models and pursue once-impossible bold opportunities. One company even used AI to help develop a product that boosts crop yields. We asked six early adopters\u2014from advertising executives to accounting experts\u2014how their companies are using Copilot for Microsoft 365 today. Julie Sweet, Chair & CEO, Accenture What Accenture Does: Accenture is a global professional services company that creates tangible value at speed and scale by helping businesses, governments, and other organizations build their digital core, optimize their operations, accelerate revenue growth, and enhance citizen services.Sweet\u2019s Role: In just nine years, she rose from a general counsel role to become the first female CEO in the firm\u2019s 35-year history. Her Experience With Copilot: Sweet made it her mission for Accenture to become one of the first companies to adopt Copilot; this year, she says, Accenture is set to train 250,000 of its 700,000 workers on AI. \u201cWe first of all wanted to unlock the personal productivity for our own people. But every minute of productivity they get they\u2019re using to enable our clients.\u201d Sweet\u2019s big push has already paid off. \u201cThe first users told us they saved at least 30 minutes a day, and sometimes up to three hours,\u201d she says. And, while some companies might just dip a toe in the water with a small pilot program, Accenture dove straight in. \u201cWe didn\u2019t start with our most junior people,\u0000\u0000\u201d she says. \u201cWe started with our most senior leaders in the first cohort, including me. Now that\u2019s sometimes counterintuitive. But the real power of AI is reinvention, and in order to reinvent, you have to have leaders who understand the power of it themselves.\u201d Florian H\u00e4se, Research Scientist, Bayer What Bayer Does: Best known as the creator of aspirin, today it\u2019s one of the largest companies in the world, with core competencies in the life science fields of healthcare and nutrition.H\u00e4se\u2019s Role: Working in the company\u2019s Computational Life Science department, H\u00e4se combs through reams of research to support the search for that one molecule that could lead to a new crop protection product to enable plants to thrive and boost yields.His Experience With Copilot: Bayer Crop Science is focused on finding new ways for farmers to produce more food for the growing world population. To do that, H\u00e4se has been using Microsoft Copilot to help pick through research data the company has gathered over the years and even decades. \u201cNot only does it assist me in finding that information, but it also shows how to extract that information from unstructured data sources, whether they\u2019re reports or slide decks,\u201d he says. Copilot also helps him keep up with the latest research, which is essential in a fast-moving field. \u201cIt can be quite a challenge to figure out who knows what at which point in time, and getting that contact you need to solve the task at hand,\u201d he says. Before Copilot, he used to spend days and weeks finding that information. \u201cThe process has certainly sped up,\u201d he says. \u201cNow you don\u2019t miss out on opportunities to connect with the colleagues you should be talking to.\u201d James Thomas, Global Head of Technology, Dentsu Creative What dentsu Does: Global ad agency dentsu connects brand, content, commerce, and experience for some of the world\u2019s largest brands, including Kraft Heinz, Netflix, and T-Mobile. Thomas\u2019 Role: Thomas is focused on growing dentsu\u2019s Global AI Centre of Excellence (CoE) to help the company harness technology to create innovative, award-winning content for clients. His work used to involve getting input from clients, researching, brainstorming, and \u201cmaybe days, weeks, even months later, we\u2019d come back with creative illustrations of the client\u2019s ideas.\u201d His Experience With Copilot: He says that the process of transforming ideas into images has been reduced from weeks and months to minutes. \u201cWe can be ideating, we can have someone in the corner prompting, and by the end of that session, we\u2019ve already got visuals,\u201d Thomas says. Those visuals lead to quicker, more effective communication with clients\u2014a critical step to keeping clients excited and ensuring that the best new ideas prevail. \u201cThe more creative the idea, the harder it is to translate,\u201d he says. \u201cBeing able to visualize a lot of these ideas really helps you know if you\u2019re going down the wrong route or the right one. It really gets us where we need to go a lot faster.\u201d Vicki Holman, Collaboration Platform Owner, Hargreaves Lansdown What Hargreaves Lansdown Does: The UK-based financial services powerhouse helps 1.6 million customers save, invest, and retire.Holman\u2019s Role: She\u2019s the point person helping Hargreaves Lansdown with its cloud transformation and ensuring that teams get the most from it. Her Experience With Copilot: Early users have been discovering new ways to cut hours of drudgery out of their workweeks, from generating first drafts of a PowerPoint presentation by pulling material from an existing Word doc to crafting smarter, clearer emails when the words just won\u2019t come. \u201cThe average respondents are saving two to three hours a week,\u201d Holman says. \u201cAnd 90 percent of them felt they would save even more time over the coming months as the product matures and they get a better understanding of how to use it.\u201d One of the unexpected advantages of Copilot, Holman says, is the positive impact it\u2019s had on the company\u2019s neurodivergent workers. \u201cI hadn\u2019t anticipated it, but the impact we\u2019ve seen on people who have workplace accessibility needs has been incredible,\u201d she says. Workers who can\u2019t maintain focus through hour-long meetings, she says, can record meetings and listen to them later, or get summaries of what they\u2019ve missed. \u201cThere\u2019s the reduction of stress, making it more enjoyable to be at work when you\u2019re not struggling to do your tasks and find the information you need.\u201d Coskun Cavusoglu, Financial Services Tax AI Go-to-Market Leader, EY Americas What EY Does: This \u201cBig Four\u201d professional services organization provides assurance, consulting, law, strategy, tax, and transaction services to clients in more than 150 countries. Cavusoglu\u2019s Role: Utilizing leading-edge technology, he collaborates with clients to boost operational efficiency and help manage risks. He is dedicated to transforming the tax function into a crucial element that helps drive value and foster business growth. His Experience With Copilot: The EY Global Tax team collaborated with our team at Microsoft to build a Copilot plugin proof of concept on a developer tenant, which Microsoft provided. With it, they can directly ask questions of EY sample data, expediting analyses and report creation. The plugin is intended to redefine the report creation experience for EY Global Tax senior executives. \u201cWhen implemented, our senior leaders will be able to query all these databases by effortlessly asking questions in natural language and then generating reports,\u201d Cavusoglu says. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be able to have not only productivity gains but insights that are going to be served to us in near real time.\u201d Anup Purohit, Group CIO, Wipro Limited What Wipro Does: A leading technology services and consulting company with 245,000 employees across 65 countries, Wipro builds innovative solutions that address clients\u2019 most complex digital transformation needs.

Purohit says that Copilot has already transformed every aspect of his workday, freeing up time to deliver great results for his clients. \u201cI use it when I wake up to check my calendar\u2014it\u2019s totally reinventing the way I look at my daily schedule,\u201d he says. \u201cI use it to summarize emails, especially if there is a long thread with multiple interactions. It helps me to focus on key actions discussed in calls, and I use it to create follow-on actions for my team within 10 minutes of the call completion. It even helps me plan my business trips and personal holidays.\u201d AI Tips Work Trend Index Special Report "
