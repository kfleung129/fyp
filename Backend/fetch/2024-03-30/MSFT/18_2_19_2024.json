Read more Key notes Do you use AirPods and Macs? If so, we may have a piece of good news for you: you will soon be able to mute/unmute your microphone when using Microsoft Teams for Mac. AirPods users on iPhones have enjoyed this convenient mic mute/unmute control since iOS 17 on models older than iPhone XS/XR. While this capability took a while to arrive on Macs, Microsoft recently announced on\u00a0its 365 roadmap site\u00a0it will be available in March 2024 for users with macOS Sonoma, which is primarily available on iMac models released in 2019 or later and MacBook Air/Pro models released in 2018 or later. Before this, you would need to manually mute/unmute yourself on Microsoft Teams. Once this update rolls out, you can just tap on your AirPods\u2019 Touch control on the stem, just like how you play or pause songs. And then, to resume playback, simply press it again. In fact, there have been a few interesting crossovers between Microsoft and Apple products recently. Just this month, Apple launched a new app called\u00a0Apple Devices\u00a0for Windows PCs, in a move towards splitting the popular iTunes app for Windows into three different apps depending on functionality. You can do things like\u00a0backing up your iPhone data\u00a0to your computer or even\u00a0transferring photos from PC\u00a0to iPhone with this new app. Rafly Gilang Tech Reporter Rafly is a reporter with years of journalistic experience, ranging from technology, business, social, and culture.
