    "text": "Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks The European Union is looking into Microsoft\u2019s partnership with OpenAI and whether it may warrant a formal merger investigation, EU officials said Tuesday. The announcement highlights growing scrutiny of OpenAI, one of the most influential companies in the artificial intelligence industry, after a high-profile\u00a0leadership crisis\u00a0last year resulted in the abrupt firing and reinstatement of the firm\u2019s CEO, Sam Altman, and Microsoft (MSFT) gaining a non-voting seat on OpenAI\u2019s board. The tech giant also has a multi-billion-dollar investment in OpenAI. The EU move follows a similar announcement by\u00a0UK antitrust officials last month, and a report by Bloomberg that the US Federal Trade Commission was\u00a0conducting\u00a0a preliminary probe. Microsoft has previously said it does not own any portion of OpenAI and that gaining a seat on OpenAI\u2019s board is not the same as a merger. OpenAI, for its part, has said the board seat does not give Microsoft control over the startup\u2019s operations. The New York Times sues OpenAI and Microsoft for copyright infringement The European Commission, the EU\u2019s executive arm, said in a release Tuesday that it \u201cis checking whether Microsoft\u2019s investment in OpenAI might be reviewable under the EU Merger Regulation.\u201d The inquiry is part of a wider effort to assess competition in the AI field, and officials are also reviewing some of the business contracts that other AI startups have with large tech companies, the commission noted. Many of these agreements\u00a0tend to involve commitments to use only one or two cloud providers, or investments by Big Tech companies in the form of free cloud computing credits that critics say risk \u201clocking in\u201d AI developers as customers. The European Commission added that it was soliciting public feedback on the state of competition in AI, as well as in the virtual reality industry, and had asked \u201cseveral large digital players\u201d for information related to the study. \u201cVirtual worlds and generative AI are rapidly developing,\u201d said Margrethe Vestager, a top EU antitrust official. \u201cIt is fundamental that these new markets stay competitive, and that nothing stands in the way of businesses growing and providing the best and most innovative products to consumers.\u201d Microsoft\u2019s investment into OpenAI includes cloud credits and it has also moved to integrate OpenAI\u2019s technology into Microsoft services. \u201cThere is no OpenAI without Microsoft leaning in, in a deep way, to partner with this company on their mission,\u201d Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella told CNN contributor Kara Swisher on Swisher\u2019s podcast in November, quickly adding: \u201cWe love their mission; we even love their independence. We have no issues with it.\u201d The EU announcement comes as Vestager is\u00a0expected to meet with a number of tech CEOs in the United States this week to discuss competition issues.
