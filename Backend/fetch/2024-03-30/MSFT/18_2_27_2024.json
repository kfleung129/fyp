    "text": "The Financial Express X CEO Elon Musk has raised new concerns with his new post on Microsoft. Musk recently took to the social media platform to share his issues about the new Windows laptop PC he purchased, reaching out directly to Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella via text message. Musk expressed discomfort with the mandatory requirement of a Microsoft account on Windows PCs, questioning its necessity for basic functionalities and raising concerns about potential access to Microsoft\u2019s AI. Just bought a new PC laptop and it won\u2019t let me use it unless I create a Microsoft account, which also means giving their AI access to my computer! This is messed up.There used to be an option to skip signing into or creating a Microsoft account. Are you seeing this too? In his X post, Musk suggested that the mandatory use of Microsoft services for basic computer functionality gives Microsoft the ability to effectively shut off a user\u2019s computer. This sparked discussions on social media, with some users supporting Musk\u2019s concerns regarding data privacy and potential AI influence. However, others pointed out that creating a Microsoft account is a standard practice for Windows PCs, offering various features such as cloud storage, app downloads, and system updates. Numerous individuals provided alternate solutions to Musk in response to his post, including suggestions from X\u2019s \u2018fact-check\u2019 feature Community Notes, which indicated that setting up the latest version of Windows without a Microsoft account is still possible. Musk countered this by asserting that the fact-checking tool was incorrect, stating, \u201cCommunity Notes is failing here. This option no longer exists.\u201d After a series of tweets, Musk eventually revealed that he successfully accessed his Windows laptop PC without creating a Microsoft account. He shared a workaround suggested by a user on X, explaining that he was able to skip the account creation step by deselecting the automatic connection to a local WiFi without a password. Musk expressed gratitude for the solution, highlighting the importance of user feedback and collaborative problem-solving.
