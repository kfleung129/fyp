    "text": "In January, the Microsoft Security Team detected a nation-state attack on its corporate email systems by a Russian state-sponsored actor, Midnight Blizzard, also known as Nobelium. In this attack, emails and documents from staff accounts were stolen. In an update to the above breach, the Redmond giant on Friday said the hackers are still trying to access its systems and successfully stole \u201csome of the company\u2019s source code repositories and internal systems\u201d using authentication secrets stolen during the January cyberattack. \u201cIn recent weeks, we have seen evidence that Midnight Blizzard [Nobelium] is using information initially exfiltrated from our corporate email systems to gain, or attempt to gain, unauthorized access,\u201d Microsoft said in a\u00a0blog post update\u00a0on Friday. \u201cThis has included access to some of the company\u2019s source code repositories and internal systems. To date we have found no evidence that Microsoft-hosted customer-facing systems have been compromised.\u201d Microsoft said that Midnight Blizzard is attempting to use secrets of different types it has found, of which some of the secrets were shared between customers and Microsoft in email, which are likely passwords, certificates, credentials, and authentication keys. The company has already begun contacting the affected customers to assist them in taking mitigating measures, as it discovers this information in its exfiltrated email. Further, the company says that Midnight Blizzard has increased the volume of some aspects of the attack, such as password sprays, by as much as 10-fold in February, compared to the already large volume seen in January 2024. The company said password sprays are a type of brute-force attack in which a hacker uses a few commonly used passwords to try to access multiple target accounts (usernames). \u201cMidnight Blizzard\u2019s ongoing attack is characterized by a sustained, significant commitment of the threat actor\u2019s resources, coordination, and focus. It may be using the information it has obtained to accumulate a picture of areas to attack and enhance its ability to do so,\u201d Microsoft said. \u201cThis reflects what has become more broadly an unprecedented global threat landscape, especially in terms of sophisticated nation-state attacks,\u201d it added. Microsoft says it has increased its security investments, cross-enterprise coordination and mobilization and has enhanced its ability to defend itself against advanced persistent threat actors \u201cWe have and will continue to put in place additional enhanced security controls, detections, and monitoring. Our active investigations of Midnight Blizzard activities are ongoing, and findings of our investigations will continue to evolve. We remain committed to sharing what we learn,\u201d Microsoft concluded. Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.  Read More "
