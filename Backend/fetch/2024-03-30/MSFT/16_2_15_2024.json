    "text": "Microsoft reportedly aims to invest $3.4 billion in Germany\u2019s artificial intelligence infrastructure. President Brad Smith announced the plans Thursday (Feb.15) during a news conference in Berlin with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Bloomberg reported. \u201cGerman companies are rapidly adapting AI-related technologies,\u201d Smith said, per the report. \u201cWe\u2019re expanding our data processing centers in the region.\u201d He added that this will mark the tech giant\u2019s largest direct investment into Germany and will be used to construct new data centers in North Rhine-Westphalia and around Frankfurt, as well as train workers, the report said. Microsoft is focused on cloud infrastructure and data centers in its bid to become an AI powerhouse through its work with OpenAI. Enthusiasm for the mission has helped make Microsoft the world\u2019s most valuable company, with a market capitalization over $3 trillion, surpassing Apple. As PYMNTS wrote last week, milestones like this are \u201cincreasingly par for the AI course,\u201d with OpenAI surpassing $2 billion in annualized revenue late last year \u2014 making it one of the fastest-growing firms in history \u2014 and Google announcing this month that its Gemini Advanced chatbot has more than 100 million subscribers. PYMNTS looked at the rapid rise in demand for generative AI tools such as OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT earlier this month in an interview with Andy Hock, senior vice president of product and strategy at Cerebras. \u201cThe ChatGPT light bulb went off in everybody\u2019s head, and it brought artificial intelligence and state-of-the-art deep learning into the public discourse,\u201d Hock told PYMNTS. \u201cAnd from an enterprise standpoint, a light bulb went off in the heads of many Fortune 1000 CIOs and CTOs, too,\u201d he added. \u201cThese generative models do things like simulate time series data. They can classify the languages and documents for applications, say, in finance and legal. They can also be used in broad domains to do things like help researchers develop new pharmaceutical therapies or better understand electronic health records and predict health outcomes from particular treatments.\u201d Perhaps the largest leap AI has made over the past year, PYMNTS added, is the technology\u2019s ability to parse visual, verbal, audio and textual data all together multimodally. \u201cHyper-personalized, really immersive experiences are going to be so important going forward,\u201d Ed Chandler, senior vice president and head of Commercial and Money Movement Solutions for Europe at Visa, told PYMNTS in an interview in August.
