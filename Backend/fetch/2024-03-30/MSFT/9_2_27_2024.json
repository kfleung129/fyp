A Microsoft-backed generative AI company, Mistral, on Monday\nunveiled a new model that the company's founder Arthur Mensch, a former Google employee, said can perform some\u00a0\u201creasoning\u201d tasks comparably with OpenAI GPT-4, and Gemini Ultra. Mistral\u2019s GAI model, Mistral Large, is open-sourced and being made available on its platform and through Microsoft Azure Cloud services, the company's first distributor\npartner. Brad Smith, Microsoft president, announced new AI Access Principles at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. This was part of the effort to address Microsoft\u2019s growing role\nand responsibility as an AI innovator and market leader. \u201cThis new AI economy is creating not just new opportunities for existing enterprises, but new companies and entirely new business\ncategories,\u201d Smith wrote in a blog post. \u201cThe principles we\u2019re announcing today commit Microsoft to bigger investments, more business partnerships, and broader programs to promote\ninnovation and competition than any prior initiative in the company\u2019s 49-year history.\u201d advertisement advertisement This occurred several days after Google faced a\u00a0backlash in response to its AI chatbot Gemini generating ethnically diverse\nimages of historical characters such as Vikings, popes, and even the founders of the company. Smith announced the investment in Mistral and said the investments and programs announced\nMonday put the company\u2019s principles into practice -- not only in Europe and in the United States, but worldwide. Mistral Large has native multilingual capacities. It strongly outperforms\nLLaMA 2 70B on HellaSwag, Arc Challenge and MMLU benchmarks in French, German, Spanish and Italian. In terms of \u201creasoning\u201d -- the ability to think logically and reach conclusions\n-- Mistral said the model reaches top-tier reasoning capabilities, and can be used for complex multilingual reasoning tasks including text understanding, transformation, and code generation. Mistral Large achieves strong results on commonly used benchmarks, making it the world's second-ranked model available through an API next to GPT-4. Ericsson, a telecommunications services\ncompany, describes machine reasoning as an \u201cattempt to implement abstract thinking\u201d and \u201capply human-like common sense to analyze large amounts of data Mistral has raised\nmore than $500 million from investors based on that ability. The investors also include\u00a0Andreessen Horowitz. And while the funding amount is much less than competitors like OpenAI --\nwhich as of December 2023 raised $100 billion -- its chances of sailing\u00a0 through privacy and regulatory issues seems more promising. The company is based in France. Mensch told The\nWall Street Journal his model cost less to train -- about \u20ac20 million -- which is the equivalent of roughly $22 million in U.S. currency. No doubt GAI models in time will become less\nexpensive to build, operate and train, bringing the price down for any business that wants to use the technology. OpenAI Chief Executive\u00a0Sam Altman\u00a0said last year after the release\nof GPT-4 that training his company\u2019s biggest models cost between $50 million and $100 million. Mistral has also partnered with enterprise-software company\u00a0Salesforce and Nvidia,\nwhich makes graphics processing units of GPUs that are used to build AI systems.
