    "text": "By  Tom Warren, a senior editor covering Microsoft, PC gaming, console, and tech. He founded WinRumors, a site dedicated to Microsoft news, before joining The Verge in 2012. Microsoft president Brad Smith wasn\u2019t happy with the UK\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) last year after the regulator blocked Microsoft\u2019s giant Activision Blizzard deal. Now that Microsoft has restructured its deal and won approval in the UK, Smith has kinder words for the CMA, describing the regulator as \u201ctough and fair\u201d in an interview with BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today program. Smith originally criticized the CMA and said confidence in the UK had been \u201cseverely shaken\u201d after the regulator moved to block Microsoft\u2019s $68.7 billion deal in April last year. He called it the \u201cdarkest day\u201d for Microsoft in its four decades of working in Britain and went a step further, saying \u201cthe European Union is a more attractive place to start a business\u201d than the UK. \u201cI certainly learned a lot personally,\u201d admitted Smith on Radio 4 yesterday. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t step back necessarily from all of the concerns I raised when I talked way back in April, but I might choose slightly different words to make my point.\u201d The CMA forced Microsoft to restructure its Activision Blizzard deal, giving up key cloud gaming rights in the UK and many other markets worldwide. \u201cThe CMA held to a tough standard and I respect that. In my view it was tough and fair,\u201d added Smith. \u201cIt pushed Microsoft to change the acquisition that we had proposed for Activision Blizzard, to spin out certain rights that the CMA was concerned about with respect to cloud gaming.\u201d While Smith has had a change of heart over his criticism of the CMA, the regulator was less than impressed with Microsoft\u2019s tactics. \u201cBusinesses and their advisors should be in no doubt that the tactics employed by Microsoft are no way to engage with the CMA,\u201d warned CMA CEO Sarah Cardell in October. \u201cMicrosoft had the chance to restructure during our initial investigation but instead continued to insist on a package of measures that we told them simply wouldn\u2019t work. Dragging out proceedings in this way only wastes time and money.\u201d Microsoft\u2019s concession to the CMA allowed the deal to close in October, following months of regulatory scrutiny worldwide. The Federal Trade Commission is still pursuing its case against Microsoft\u2019s deal in the US, with a decision on an appeal over the FTC v. Microsoft case expected from the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals soon. The FTC is also still pursuing a separate administrative case against Microsoft\u2019s deal that\u2019s set to commence shortly after the appeal decision unless the FTC abandons its case entirely. / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.
