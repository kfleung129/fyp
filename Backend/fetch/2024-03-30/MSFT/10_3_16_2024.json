    "text": "Sundry Photography/iStock Editorial via Getty Images The LinkedIn experience is expected to get a whole lot better as the social media platform owned by tech giant Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is planning to introduce puzzle-based games within its platform, the company announced Saturday. \"I can confirm that we're playing with adding puzzle-based games within the LinkedIn experience to unlock a bit of fun, deepen relationships, and hopefully spark the opportunity for conversations,\" a company spokesperson told Seeking Alpha. \"Stay tuned for more!\" The move marks the latest attempt by media companies to lean on puzzle-based games to boost user experience. The New York Times (NYT) has added millions of players to its viral word-guessing game, Wordle, since its acquisition in 2022. The news came after Nima Owji, an app researcher, shared images showing LinkedIn's plans on Twitter, currently known as X. According to Owji, one of its ideas includes plans to organize player scores based on users' place of work. However, the images Owji shared were inaccurate, a spokesperson for the social media platform told TechCrunch, which first reported the news. With more than 900M users, LinkedIn will be another avenue for Microsoft (MSFT) to expand its gaming business. For Q2, MSFT reported $7.1B in revenue from its gaming division, which accounted for more than a tenth of its topline and exceeded its Windows revenue for the first time. "
