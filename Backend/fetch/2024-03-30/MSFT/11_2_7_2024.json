    "text": " Don't let growing uncertainty surrounding the MSFT stock forecast scare you Advertisement Source: gguy / Shutterstock.com Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) experienced a brief hiccup after last month\u2019s earnings release. Uncertainty is rising when it comes to my MSFT stock forecast. Bullishness about Microsoft\u2019s AI growth catalyst has not yet given way to bearishness, but there are concerns the market has already priced this in. The stock may perform poorly or experience a correction before the end of the year. While concerns are valid, don\u2019t assume the stock\u2019s impressive performance will decline. In fact, there\u2019s plenty in play to make this year another banner one for MSFT. Read on, as I explain why. On Jan. 30, Microsoft released its results for the company\u2019s fiscal second quarter (ending Dec. 31, 2023). During the quarter, revenue came in at $62 billion, up 18% compared to the prior year\u2019s quarter. Diluted earnings per share came in at $2.93, a 33% increase compared to the EPS reported during last fiscal year\u2019s December quarter. Both revenue and earnings also came in ahead of sell-side forecasts. As for guidance, management made several promising statements. The company expects higher growth for Azure this quarter and higher margins this fiscal year, despite increased spending on AI and cloud infrastructure. MSFT shares briefly slipped post-earnings and have essentially traded sideways since. Although sentiment has yet to shift, the continued strength of Microsoft and other top AI stocks does have a growing number of market participants concerned. There are now worries that AI stocks have entered \u201cbubble territory\u201d once again. However, while some popular AI plays could be at that point, I argue that it\u2019s premature to conclude that the MSFT stock forecast is dire. After surging 58% over the past twelve months, I\u2019ll admit that another 50% (or higher) rally for MSFT in the twelve months ahead is questionable. Much of the stock\u2019s prior mega-rally took care of pricing-in the company\u2019s initial efforts to monetize the generative AI technology it has acquired through its strategic partnership with ChatGPT developer OpenAI. Still, that doesn\u2019t mean that, by adding well over $1 trillion to Microsoft\u2019s market cap, the market has overly priced-in all (or even more) of the company\u2019s potential to benefit from long-term growth trends, especially the AI growth trend. As I pointed out previously, analysts like BNP Paribas\u2019 Stefan Slowinski have argued that major free cash flow improvements related to Microsoft\u2019s gen AI commercialization could happen starting in the next fiscal year, which begins in July. Hence, why my MSFT stock forecast is optimistic. Investors could go from \u201cwatch and wait\u201d mode back to bullish, all in a matter of months. Results for Q1 2025, or even the outlook for that quarter provided with the Q4 2024 earnings release, may indicate that the company could handily beat current EPS forecasts ($12.69). In turn, driving another wave of outsized price appreciation for shares. In the near-term, market sentiment, including sentiment about the future direction of interest rates, could play a big role in MSFT\u2019s price performance. It\u2019s even possible that Microsoft shares do indeed experience a brief sell-off. For instance, if the market overall sells off, or if concerns about overconcentration in \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d stocks leads to a sell-off specifically for these names. But despite the uncertainty, there\u2019s still a very good reason to stay bullish. A few quarters from now, it may be revealed that the impact of gen AI integration into Microsoft\u2019s software, cloud, and search businesses is having an even greater impact on growth and profitability than currently expected. In short, here\u2019s my MSFT stock forecast: while strong FY2025 numbers may not result in another 50%+ run, such an event could nonetheless result in more-than-satisfactory gains relative to current prices.
