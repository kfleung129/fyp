Read more The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) invests in Microsoft Azure Quantum to create a scalable quantum computer. In fact, Microsoft just announced on their blog that DARPA is continuing their commitment with the Redmond giant.. A scalable quantum computer is a device that can handle an expanding number of tasks while increasing its stability as well. Thus, with the help of Microsoft, DARPA tries to create such a device. To build it, Microsoft will use topological quantum bits. After all, they are far better than normal qubits due to their built-in error protection. If Microsoft manages to develop a fault-tolerant prototype, the device could mark the beginning of\u00a0quantum computing. Furthermore, with time, they might be able to develop the utility-scale quantum computer that\u2019s supposed to work with real-world applications. However, the FTP will have to process multiple tasks before establishing a baseline for a quantum computer. On top of having access to the designs of the prototype for the scalable quantum computer, DARPA will closely monitor and verify other discoveries made by\u00a0Microsoft Azure Quantum\u00a0during this process. Ultimately, with a utility-scale quantum computer, it will be possible to lessen the time spent by researchers to test their prototypes. As a result, their focus might shift towards ideas and theories. Thus, the supercomputer will handle the trial-by-error aspects of their work. To find out more, check out the\u00a0Innovator Series.
