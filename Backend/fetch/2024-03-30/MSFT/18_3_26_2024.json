    "text": "CCL, Spark's IT services and hybrid cloud division, has unveiled a game-changing service: a readiness workshop focused on Copilot for Microsoft 365. This offering, designed to equip private enterprises and public sector organisations with state-of-the-art Artificial Intelligence (AI) capabilities, seeks to significantly amplify productivity, stimulate creativity, and bolster connectivity within a securely fortified environment. To fully exploit generative AI, organisations must be conversant with both its potential benefits and its security, privacy and compliance parameters. This knowledge will help them institute a shield of protective measures. Equally critical is the organisation of source data and information, which forms the backbone of how Copilot optimises its functionalities. Speaking about the launch, Richard Adams, CEO of CCL, said, \"We are thrilled to offer this pioneering workshop to our clients, empowering them to leverage Copilot and AI to augment productivity and efficient operation. We are dedicated to guiding organisations to optimise their workspaces to align more closely with their unique business prerequisites and established security frameworks.\" \"Our teams of Microsoft-certified experts and professional services units provide the proficiency and support that's essential to fend off risks arising from unauthorised data exposure when deploying advanced technologies at scale,\" Adams added. Copilot for Microsoft 365 merges avant-garde technologies like Large Language Models (LLMs) and deep learning techniques. Integrated seamlessly with Microsoft 365 apps like Teams, Word, Outlook, PowerPoint, and Excel, it allows Copilot to understand, summarise, anticipate, and generate content customised to the distinctive requirements of individuals and organisations. Vanessa Sorenson, Partner Director for Microsoft ANZ, disclosed, \"Our studies indicate that 95% of New Zealand businesses either have integrated AI or plan to do so in the next year, but many do not know how to initiate this process. For every dollar invested, the standard return on investment is $3.66.\" Sorenson continued, \"A trustworthy ally like CCL helps local organisations maximise initial investments and deliver even more for their teams and clients. The result is a quicker AI settlement process across Aotearoa.\" The Copilot readiness workshop offered by CCL is designed in three phases: Evaluation \u2013 to perform a readiness assessment and overview of technical requirements; Demonstration \u2013 to share real-world examples of how Copilot can enhance the employee experience; and Formulation \u2013 to sketch an actionable plan centred on prioritised scenarios and defined next actions. Against the backdrop of burgeoning global cloud innovation, these advances envisioned by CCL and Spark Business Group could well signify a pivot towards a future where AI-driven productivity enhancements become the norm for both the private sector and public organisations in Aotearoa and beyond.
