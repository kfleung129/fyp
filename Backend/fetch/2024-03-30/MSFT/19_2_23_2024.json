    "text": "Imagine bragging about your own innate racism in a report to shareholders about how diverse and inclusive your company is and continues to strive to be. Also, imagine bragging about discriminating against one race and one gender of people as if it were somehow virtuous. That company? Microsoft. In their 2023 Global Diversity & Inclusion Report, in the section \u201cPay equity,\u201d Microsoft actually admits paying \u201call racial and ethnic minority groups\u201d more than \u201cwhite employees\u2026with the same job title and level and considering tenure.\u201d They even go so far as to break down how much more each minority and ethnic group makes more than white employees. \u201cAs of September 2023, inside the US, all racial and ethnic minority groups who are rewards eligible combined earn $1.007 total pay for every $1.000 earned by US rewards-eligible white employees with the same job title and level and considering tenure. Specifically, for those who are rewards eligible, US Black and African American employees earn $1.004; Hispanic and Latinx employees earn $1.004; and Asian employees earn $1.012 for every $1.000 earned by US rewards-eligible white employees with the same job title and level and considering tenure.\u201d Sure, the difference in pay between people in minority and ethnic groups is about a fraction of a penny more than their white counterparts, but if the difference were insignificant, why brag about it? But, that\u2019s not all. If you\u2019re a white man, you\u2019re really getting the shaft.

In this case, Microsoft\u2019s version of \u201cequity\u201d means screw whitey \u2014 oh, and men. Also, and this might not be important at all \u2014 but isn\u2019t this kind of discrimination illegal? Actually, it is. According to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\u2019s website, the text on \u201cRace/Color Discrimination & Work Situations states the following: \u201cThe law forbids discrimination when it comes to any aspect of employment, including hiring, firing, pay, job assignments, promotions, layoff, training, fringe benefits, and any other term or condition of employment.\u201d You can view Microsoft\u2019s full report here.
