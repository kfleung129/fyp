    "text": "Microsoft MSFT has teamed up with the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (\u201cPNNL\u201d) to develop a new way of building batteries that feature up to 70% less lithium than current offerings.The collaboration illustrates the transformative impact of combining advanced artificial intelligence (AI) with next-generation cloud computing to revolutionize the pace of scientific discovery, particularly in fields critical to addressing global energy and sustainability challenges.Microsoft and PNNL utilized AI, specifically Microsoft's Azure Quantum Elements, in the process. The AI algorithms proposed 32 million candidates, which were then filtered based on stability, reactivity and potential to conduct energy.The AI system reduced the candidates to about 500,000 and further filters were applied using high-performance computing (HPC) for higher accuracy. HPC verified the stability and practicality of the materials.The use of AI and HPC has significantly accelerated the process of discovering new materials, which, in this case, allowed the researchers to identify 23 promising material candidates in a total time of 80 hours.The discovered material, which uses both lithium and sodium, could potentially reduce lithium content by up to 70%, addressing concerns related to the scarcity and environmental impact of lithium-ion batteries.The AI-HPC combination reduced the time spent computing and cloud-based AI tools provided accessibility and flexibility, avoiding the constraints of shared supercomputers.The success of this collaboration suggests that similar approaches could be applied across various scientific fields, addressing urgent challenges in sustainability, pharmaceuticals and more.
