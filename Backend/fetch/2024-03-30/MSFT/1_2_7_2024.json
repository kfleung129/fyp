    "text": "CDW CDW reported fourth-quarter revenue below estimates on Wednesday, hurt by weak demand for its information technology solutions as enterprise clients cut back on tech spending. The company, which provides IT solutions to tech giants such as IBM IBM and Microsoft MSFT, posted net sales of $5.02 billion for the quarter ended Dec. 31, missing analysts' estimates of $5.32 billion, according to LSEG data. Demand across all its segments remained weak due to lower spending by clients and delays in tech-related projects amid a challenging economic environment. Its UK and Canadian businesses also saw a hit. The company provides IT solutions such as cloud and cybersecurity solutions and hardware products to enterprises and government customers and also has a presence in the education and healthcare sectors. CDW posted adjusted earnings of $2.57 per share, compared with estimates of $2.56 per share. Traders and investors use our platform. Top website in the world when it comes to all things investing.
