    "text": "Microsoft\u00a0says\u00a0that the Russian-linked group known as Midnight Blizzard or Nobelium has made repeated attempts to access Microsoft\u2019s systems in recent weeks, escalating its efforts against Microsoft since the company first disclosed in January that Midnight Blizzard had\u00a0accessed\u00a0some of its corporate email accounts. The group first launched its attack on Microsoft in November, with the company disclosing in January that the group had successfully used a \u201cpassword spray attack,\u201d trying a large number of potential passwords on known accounts, to finally access \u201ca very small percentage of Microsoft corporate email accounts.\u201d On Friday, Microsoft announced in both a blog post and an\u00a0SEC filing\u00a0that Midnight Blizzard was using information lifted from that attack \u201cto gain, or attempt to gain, unauthorized access\u201d to the company\u2019s source code repositories and internal systems. Microsoft says that Midnight Blizzard has increased the volume of its attacks \u201cby as much as 10-fold\u201d compared to what the company had already seen in January. While Microsoft maintains that none of its customer-facing systems have been compromised, it noted that Midnight Blizzard may have accessed some emails between customers and Microsoft, and Microsoft has begun reaching out to affected customers. Midnight Blizzard, as Microsoft refers to it, goes by\u00a0several names, including Nobelium, APT29 and perhaps most recognizably Cozy Bear\u2014the name that made headlines when it targeted the Democratic National Convention ahead of the 2016 elections, part of the hack which led to the discovery of Russian efforts to manipulate U.S. politics that year. Midnight Blizzard, reported at the time as Cozy Bear, was one of two\u00a0Russian-linked\u00a0groups cited for the infamous hack of the Democratic National Convention ahead of the 2016 election. The other group, Fancy Bear, is believed to be linked to Russian military intelligence, also known as the GRU, which likely played a \u201cmore active role\u201d in the hack and Russia\u2019s widely reported disinformation campaign, according to Adam Meyers, head of counter adversary operations at CrowdStrike, the cybersecurity firm that\u00a0first investigated\u00a0the DNC hack. Cozy Bear, on the other hand, is associated with the Russian SVR, which is Russia\u2019s external intelligence agency and was likely doing \u201cintelligence collection\u201d in the hack, Meyers said. Cozy Bear has a \u201clong operational history\u201d dating back to the 2010s, Meyers told Forbes, often engaging in campaigns targeting diplomatic and political intelligence collection. The DNC hack wasn\u2019t its only high-profile campaign. The group has been pinned for the 2020 hack of\u00a0SolarWinds, a Texas-based IT firm, which then passed along compromised system updates to thousands of customers\u2014including Microsoft and U.S. agencies, including the Pentagon and the Department of Homeland Security. More recently, the hacks targeting Microsoft and also hacks in January\u00a0targeting\u00a0Hewlett Packard, have brought the group back into public awareness. Microsoft wrote in its filing that its investigation into the attacks is ongoing, that findings will continue to evolve \u201cand further unauthorized access may occur.\u201d Meyers raised concern about Microsoft\u2019s ability to contain the attack, given its warning about potential further unauthorized access. He noted Microsoft was also breached in the SolarWinds attack and\u00a0pointed to access\u00a0from Chinese hackers who accessed emails from State Department officials through Microsoft. He said he believed that Microsoft is a \u201cnational security threat\u201d due to this history of breaches, noting the company\u2019s many contracts with governments around the world\u2014many of whom are electing new leaders this year\u2014and its own advanced artificial intelligence models. \u201cThink about what a Russian threat actor like Cozy Bear can do with some of the most advanced AI models known to man,\u201d Meyers told Forbes.
