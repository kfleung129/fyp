Comparing and reconciling data taken from different systems is a recurring task in finance planning and analysis. This Copilot for finance will initially run a variance analysis, reconcile data in Excel, and speed up the collections process in Outlook, Charles Lamanna, a Microsoft Vice President, said in an interview with CNBC. This tool will draw on information stored in SAP and Microsoft Dynamics 365. Microsoft already has a Copilot for general-purpose industrial use in Office applications.
