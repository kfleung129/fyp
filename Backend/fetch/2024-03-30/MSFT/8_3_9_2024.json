On February 28, Barclays suggested that Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u2019s investments in advertising could present a $50 billion opportunity, especially considering the ongoing antitrust issues surrounding Google\u2019s dominance in search. Microsoft\u2019s revamped search offering, incorporating generative AI features, is seen as a competitive move. The company\u2019s acquisitions, including LinkedIn, PromoteIQ, and Xandr, position it to capitalize on advertising, potentially yielding a $30 billion organic revenue opportunity and an additional $20 billion windfall. Barclays maintained an Overweight rating on Microsoft stock with a price target of $475.

In that earnings report, MSFT delivered better-than-expected revenue (+13%) and earnings (+27%), with growth in both accelerating from the prior quarter. All three major segments grew revenue faster than expected, highlighted by 28% constant currency growth in Azure, the company\u2019s cloud offering.
