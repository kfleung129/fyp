(Kay Nietfeld/dpa via AP)     BERLIN (AP) \u2014 German Chancellor Olaf Scholz welcomed an announcement Thursday by Microsoft that it would invest almost 3.3 billion euros ($3.5 billion) in Germany over the next two years to massively expand its data center capacities for applications in the field of artificial intelligence and cloud computing. \u201cThis is a really good commitment to progress, to growth, to modernity and to global openness as the basis for these opportunities,\u201d he said, adding it was also linked to the \u201cfact that Germany remains very determined to be an open economy.\u201d \u201cNot only are we probably the most successful export economy in the world in terms of the size of our country, but we are also a country that trades with the whole world, that invests everywhere, but also invests in our own country,\u201d he said. Microsoft President Brad Smith made the announcement in Berlin during a presentation with Scholz. The largest single investment in Microsoft\u2019s 40-year history in Germany also includes an AI training program that aims to reach up to 1.2 million people, German news agency dpa reported. Microsoft is looking to be close to major customers, such as the pharmaceutical company Bayer AG and energy company RWE, in order to keep data latency between data centers and applications as low as possible. The central German state of Hesse will also benefit from Microsoft\u2019s investments. Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. "
