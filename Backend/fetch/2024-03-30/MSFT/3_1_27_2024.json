Many analysts believe US stocks are poised to grow, albeit slowly, in 2024 despite uncertainties around the election, inflation and the Federal Reserve's next plan of action. Lori Calvasina from RBC Capital Markets in December said, while talking to CNBC, that the market is poised to grow slowly in the second half of 2024 but for now investors need to rest a little to digest the massive gains seen in the fourth quarter of 2023. Calvasina has a 5,000 target for the S&P 500 for 2024. Buying solid stocks when they are trading at attractive valuations has been the age-old and time-tested strategy of wise investors. Many believe there are many opportunities for under-the-radar stocks and investors should look beyond just the mega-cap tech stocks like Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and\u00a0 Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM). Long-term investors are always on the lookout for bargains in the market since there are always companies that are trading below their intrinsic value. As the legendary value investor Seth Klarman said long ago in one of his letters to investors, value investing outperforms when everything else in the market is not working: \"I must remind you that value investing is not designed to outperform in a bull market. In a bull market, anyone, with any investment strategy or none at all, can do well, often better than value investors. It is only in a bear market that the value investing discipline becomes especially important because value investing, virtually alone among strategies, gives you exposure to the upside with limited downside risk. In a stormy market, the value investing discipline becomes crucial, because it helps you find your bearings when reassuring landmarks are no longer visible. In a market downturn, momentum investors cannot find momentum, growth investors worry about a slowdown, and technical analysts don't like their charts. But the value investing discipline tells you exactly what to analyze, price versus value, and then what to do, buy at a considerable discount and sell near full value. And, because you cannot tell what the market is going to do, a value investment discipline is important because it is the only approach that produces consistently good investment results over a complete market cycle.\" Photo by Kaleidico on Unsplash Methodology For this article we first used a stock screener to identify stocks that are trading near or at their 52-week lows.
