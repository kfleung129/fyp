If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to 5 Fastest Growing Economies in the Last 50 Years. In the last 50 years, the world has witnessed technological miracles. In July 1969, America's Apollo 11 was the first spacecraft to carry humans to the moon. America has always been a key driver to economic growth with its top tech companies at the center of technological advancements. American companies such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) entered the market with their new products in the late 1970s, rocking the tech sector. Later, more tech companies followed such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). Back in the 1970s, the medical, automobile, and oil sectors were on the rise with companies including Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F), Mercedes Benz Group AG (ETR:MBG) and Saudi Arabian Oil Company (TADAWUL:2222), among others, driving growth. Post World War 2, the global reserve currency came into being. In 1944 at the Bretton Woods Conference, the US Dollar (USD) was agreed to be the global reserve currency accepted by forty-four countries at the time. This resulted in the creation of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. After more than half a century of global dominance, the US dollar faces various threats such as the emergence of the BRICS economy. On February 12, FXStreet reported that according to the economists at Scotiabank, the USD has appreciated around 28% over the past 10 years and it may be difficult for the USD to experience additional gains in the medium or longer run. Whereas, some experts also believe that the USD will not lose its status anytime soon. On February 15, Reuters reported that Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said that the increased use of digital assets like stablecoins, which are pegged to the USD, could potentially lead to an improvement in the USD\u2019s international profile. Waller further added: \u201cI do not expect to see the U.S. dollar lose its status as the world's reserve currency anytime soon, nor even see a significant decline in its primacy in trade and finance.\u201d In 1972, exactly 50 years ago, the world\u2019s current GDP stood at $3.84 trillion, as per the World Bank. The United States led the global economy back then, with a GDP (PPP) of $1.28 trillion in 1970. USSR, Germany, Japan, France, and the United Kingdom followed the US as the other leading economies in 1970. In 2024, the US, China, Germany, Japan, and India are the top five largest economies in the world. In the last 50 years, Asia and Africa have been two of the fastest growing regions and continue to grow at a rapid rate compared to the rest of the world. According to the Asian Development Bank, Asia now holds one-third of the global GDP compared to only 12% of the global GDP in the early 1960s. According to the IMF, global growth is projected at 3.1% in 2024 and 3.2% in 2025. While, Asia\u2019s growth is expected to be 4.5% in 2024 and 4.3% in 2025. Africa\u2019s growth is expected to average at 3.8% in 2024 and 4.2% in 2025, as per the African Development Bank Group. Both Asia and Africa\u2019s projected growth rates for 2024 and 2025 are higher than projected global averages. China and India will be the leading economies in Asia, while South Africa and Nigeria will be major economic drivers in Africa. Over the last 50 years, several companies have contributed to the global economy and invented new products and services. We cannot talk about all the companies in this one article so we will stick with the top tech companies including Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). These three tech giants are also the most valuable companies in history. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the pioneer of Macintosh.

Microsoft Corporation\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) cloud segment is experiencing rapid growth with the applications of AI. Here are some of the comments from the company\u2019s Q2 2024 earnings call: \u201cIt was a record quarter driven by the continued strength of Microsoft Cloud, which surpassed $33 billion in revenue, up 24%. We\u2019ve moved from talking about AI to applying AI at scale by infusing AI across every layer of our tech stack, we are winning new customers and helping drive new benefits and productivity gains. Now I'll highlight examples of our momentum and progress starting with Azure. Azure again took share this quarter with our AI advantage. Azure offers the top performance for AI training and inference in the most diverse selection of AI accelerators, including the latest from AMD and NVIDIA, as well as our own first-party silicon Azure Maia. And with Azure AI, we provide access to the best selection of foundation and open-source models, including both LLM and SLMs, all integrated deeply with infrastructure, data, and tools on Azure.\u201d Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) owns the famous internet search engine, Google, and multiple software. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) has been a key player in driving the internet economy, connecting the world through its search engine and other online platforms. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is now one of the leaders in Generative AI and is working on various aspects of the technology. On February 15, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) launched Gemini 1.5 with the ability of new enhanced performance. Since the launch of Gemini 1.0, the company has been testing and refining the capabilities of its AI software. The Gemini 1.5 is more efficient to train and serve with a new Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. With this context, let\u2019s take a look at the fastest growing economies in the last 50 years. 25 Fastest Growing Economies in the Last 50 Years Our Methodology To compile our list of the 25 fastest growing economies in the last 50 years, we gathered countries' real GDP growth rates from 1972 to 2022 from the World Bank database. Real GDP growth rates of countries over the last 50 years were averaged and then sorted in ascending order to rank the top 25 fastest growing economies with the highest growth in the last 50 years. We have excluded countries whose data was not available for at least 40 years. There was an exception for some countries, such as Qatar and Vietnam, whose data was available for less than 40 years on the World Bank database. In that case, we consulted the IMF database for such countries. We have included economies such as Qatar and Vietnam because they are some of the biggest economies in the world and are growing at a rapid rate. We cross-checked the World Bank database with the IMF database to make sure we did not miss any countries. We have also mentioned the GDP (PPP) of countries, as of 2024. The data for GDP (PPP) is taken from the IMF database. By the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds. By using a consensus approach, we identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). Whether you are a beginner investor or a professional one looking for the best stocks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders. Note: The IMF database had a limitation as the data was only available for the last 42 years. That\u2019s why we went with the World Bank data.
