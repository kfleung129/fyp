    "text": "NEW YORK, NY - MARCH 13: A signage of Microsoft is seen on March 13, 2020 in New York City. ... [+] Co-founder and former CEO of Microsoft Bill Gates steps down from Microsoft board to spend more time on the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. (Photo by Jeenah Moon/Getty Images) Microsoft\nMSFT\n Inc. is scheduled to report earnings after Tuesday\u2019s close. The stock just hit a record high of $413.05/share and is currently trading near that level. The stock is prone to big moves after reporting earnings and can easily gap up if the numbers are strong. Conversely, if the numbers disappoint, the stock can easily gap down. To help you prepare, here is what the Street is expecting: The company is expected to report a gain of $2.76/share on $61.03 billion in revenue. Meanwhile, the so-called Whisper number is a gain of $2.91/share. The Whisper number is the Street's unofficial view on earnings. Click on the chart to join MarketSmith Microsoft has benefited greatly from the recent boom in artificial intelligence and other tech friendly trends. Earnings have grown nicely in the last several years. Meanwhile, the return on equity (ROE) has been near 40% in each of the past four quarters. That is very impressive considering how large the company is. Meanwhile, the price to earnings (P/E) ratio is 39 which is higher than the S&P 500. Technically, the stock is in a strong uptrend and just hit a fresh all time high. In the short-term the stock is extended and due to pullback. Stepping back, the stock hit a low in November 2022 $213.43 and is up over 90% since then. That is a massive rally and this can easily become a case of buy the rumor and sell the news. Meaning, the stock had a big run ahead of the news of a strong earnings and then sells off after the news (strong earnings) are released. That doesn\u2019t have to happen but something that can easily happen if the stock falls after reporting earnings.
