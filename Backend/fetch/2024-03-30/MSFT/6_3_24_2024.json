The demand for PCs, data centers, and smart devices has increased sharply as AI products need the hardware and software offered by these devices to unleash their full potential. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) remains a leader in all these categories.

Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Texas-based investment firm Fisher Asset Management is a leading shareholder in Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u00a0 with 25 million shares worth more than $9.5 billion. In its Q4 2023 investor letter, Fred Alger Management, an investment management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) was one of them. Here is what the fund said: \u201cMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a beneficiary of corporate America\u2019s transformative digitization. Microsoft\u2019s CEO expects technology spending as a percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) to jump from about 5% now to 10% in 10 years and that Microsoft will continue to capture market share within the technology sector. The company operates through three segments: Productivity and Business Processes (Office. LinkedIn, and Dynamics), Intelligent Cloud (Server Products and Cloud Services, Azure, and Enterprise Services), and More Personal Computing (Windows, Devices. Gaming, and Search). During the quarter, the company reported strong fiscal first quarter results, where revenues and earnings beat analyst estimates, driven in large part to growing Al demand. Regarding Intelligent Cloud segment, management noted Azure optimizations were similar to the previous quarter, but new Al and traditional workloads are helping drive greater consumption growth, which resulted in their first reacceleration since March 2022. We believe the strong Azure performance suggests diminishing cost optimization headwinds and growing strength in Al service consumption.\u201d You can also take a peek at 13 Most Promising Low-Cost Stocks According to Analysts and 11 Best Shipping Stocks That Pay Dividends.
