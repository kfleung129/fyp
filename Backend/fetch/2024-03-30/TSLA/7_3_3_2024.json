    "text": "Apple, Inc. AAPL was in the news last week for pulling the plug on its self-driving car project, and Bloomberg columnist Mark Gurman on Sunday delved into the potential reasons. Wrong Bet: \u201cApple's belief that it could create a better car than Tesla and the rest of the automotive industry ultimately led to the\u00a0downfall of the project,\u201d said Gurman in his latest installment of the \u201cPower On\u201d newsletter. When Cupertino set out to make a car roughly a decade ago, it was toying with the idea of either building a less ambitious electric vehicle with autonomy features in line with Tesla models or change the world with a \u201cfull-blown self-driving vehicle,\u201d said the columnist. The latter option would mean having a car that could go from one point to another with zero driver intervention, he added. Apple went with the second approach and that proved to be a setback, Gurman said. \u201cAll those years ago, the company thought it could solve a problem (full self-driving) that the auto industry is still struggling to crack today \u2014 all while introducing a groundbreaking design. That challenge proved too difficult for even Apple to overcome,\u201d he said.\u2019 Although introducing a \u201cTesla clone\u201d wouldn\u2019t have revolutionized the industry, such a car would have still \u201creflected Apple's design chops and be fully integrated into the company's ecosystem of products,\u201d Gurman said. Apple realized its mistake a little too late and by that time the design work had already been focused on a car without steering wheels or pedals, and billions of dollars had already been plowed into developing a Level 5 self-driving system, the Apple columnist said. Instead of developing a good-enough car with an Apple user interface, slick Jony Ive-designed interior and exterior and an iPhone-like buying experience, the company bet on autonomy, Gurman said.

The project cost was hefty, which suggested a potentially high price tag for consumers as well. The company would have also had to contend with \u201crazor-thin\u201d profit margins that is typical of the auto industry, he said. \u201cAll of this was compounded by indecisiveness among Apple's executive team and the inherent production challenges in manufacturing a car,\u201d Gurman said. The auto market, the columnist said, is harder to crack than smartphones, computers and MP3 players. It is characterized by far more competitors and complex supply chains, with a huge capital requirement, he said. \u201cIt was a gamble to even try creating a Tesla clone, let alone a vehicle that would transform the industry,\u201d Gurman said. Still, Apple could have worked on the Tesla clone, he said. \u201cWith the car, Apple could have gotten something out on the market, sold hundreds of thousands of vehicles and then collected as much data as necessary to build up a viable self-driving platform,\u201d he added. With Apple looking at a pricing of $100,000 per unit, it could have had a \u201cmultibillion-dollar moneymaker on its hands\u201d even if these sales did not translate to big profits, Gurman said. Apple ended Friday\u2019s session down 0.60% at $179.66, according to Benzinga Pro data. Check out more of Benzinga\u2019s Future Of Consumer Tech by\u00a0following this link.
