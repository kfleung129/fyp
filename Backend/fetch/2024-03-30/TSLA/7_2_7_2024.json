There\u2019s the Delaware court ruling voiding his pay package as Tesla CEO. The report alleging that Tesla board members felt pressured to take illegal drugs to stay in Musk\u2019s good graces. And the drumbeat of negative analyst chatter from the likes of Daiwa and Piper Sandler this week. Separating noise from fundamentals is always tricky. It\u2019s uniquely so at Tesla. Investors have historically been rewarded for ignoring Musk\u2019s shenanigans. But with the stock down 27% this year \u2014 and off more than 50% since its record high in 2021 \u2014 it\u2019s useful to take another look. The main reason that the shares are down has little to do with Musk\u2019s off-campus activities. As he said on Tesla\u2019s last conference call, the company \u201cis currently between two major growth waves.\u201d At the very least, it\u2019s in the aftermath of one. So should investors continue to ignore the noise and wait to catch the next wave, if and when it happens? Some longtime Tesla holders are hanging in. Ross Gerber\u2019s firm, Gerber Kawasaki, had 398,000 shares as of the last filing in December. He\u2019s trimmed that holding, he told Yahoo Finance, but has held on to the bulk of shares on behalf of clients in part for tax reasons, in part because he sees the long-term opportunity. \"The cost of Elon's behavior is really hurting shareholders, and it's really unfortunate because the reason we're holding the stock is the long-term potential of Tesla is immense,\u201d Gerber told Yahoo Finance. \u201cSo, you know, it's this catch-22.\u201d Colin Rusch of Oppenheimer, who has a Market Perform rating on the shares, is waiting for margins to improve and stabilize before he gets more bullish on Tesla. \u201cThe second thing we want to see is evolution of the FSD [full self-driving] technology and real adoption. We still have a fluid environment around the regulatory backdrop. As we get clarity, I think we\u2019ll have a better sense of how this technology performs and how they\u2019ll be able to monetize it,\u201d he told Yahoo Finance. In the meantime, whether the noise around the board\u2019s independence becomes a fundamental issue remains to be seen. Longtime Tesla fanboys\u2019 attitudes have typically been nonchalant: If Musk does drugs, who cares? If the board pays him astronomical sums (and are themselves paid more than board members at other companies), who cares? So he posts a lot on X, so what? He\u2019s building the future! The real question is how much more consistent that future could be, or even how expansive, if Musk got challenged from within once in a while. As Gautam Mukunda, a lecturer at Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy and author of \u201cPicking Presidents,\u201d put it: \u201cThere is no such thing as a person so brilliant that they\u2019re not made better by having people around them who can challenge their ideas and test them and stop them from making mistakes in the worst case.\u201d Related Quotes "
