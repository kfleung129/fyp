Get features like Lawyers who successfully argued that Elon Musk's $55.8 billion package as Tesla CEO was \u2018illegal,\u2019 have now asked the presiding judge to award them more than 29 million (2.9 crore) company shares worth $5.6 billion as 'legal fees.' The request was filed in a Delaware court on Friday, and will be heard by judge Kathleen McCormick, who rejected Tesla's pay package for Musk \u2013 designed in 2018 \u2013 on grounds that the process was \u2018flawed\u2019 and the price \u2018unfair.\u2019 In their appeal, the attorneys for Richard Tornetta, the Tesla investor who challenged the package, explained their \u2018unusual\u2019 request and why they prefer stock over cash. \u201cWe are prepared to eat our cooking.
