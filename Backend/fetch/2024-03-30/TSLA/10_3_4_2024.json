Published: 07:21 04 Mar 2024 EST The three law firms which won the case for Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA, ETR:TL0) shareholders against Elon Musk's $56 billion Tesla compensation package have requested $5.6 billion from the company in stock as legal fees. In January a Delaware judge ruled that the pay package was\u00a0unlawful. The legal team's filing said:\u00a0\u201cWe recognise that the requested fee is unprecedented in terms of absolute size.\u201d For the amount of time the lawyers worked on the case, the fee works out at an hourly rate of $288,888, the filing stated. The three\u00a0firms are Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossmann, Friedman Oster & Tejtel, and Andrews & Springer. They said in the filing that the company should pay in shares as it has \u201cthe benefit of linking the award directly to the benefit created and avoids taking even one cent from the\u00a0Tesla\u00a0balance sheet to pay fees,\u201d\u00a0as well as being tax-deductible to the EV maker. Musk's response to the initial judgment in January was one of frustration:\u00a0\u201cNever incorporate your company in the state of Delaware,\u201d he said in a tweet. The disputed pay package, designed to allow Musk to purchase Tesla shares at a discount upon meeting financial milestones, was challenged for its attainability and Musk's concurrent involvement in other ventures, including SpaceX and the acquisition of X/Twitter. Tesla's directors defended the compensation's scale as necessary to maintain Musk's focus on the company, which has seen its value increase significantly since the agreement.
