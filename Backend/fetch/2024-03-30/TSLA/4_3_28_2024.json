    "text": "It might only be a coincidence, but shares of Tesla were in a fast retreat early Jan. 13 \u2014 a day after news surfaced that a teenager in Germany had perhaps found third-party software flaws allowing hackers to control certain functions of some of the company\u2019s electric vehicles. Whether there will be any lasting economic fallout for the company as a result is, as yet, uncertain.

Colombo also said he can see if drivers are in the cars, turn on sound systems, and flash headlights. He shared screenshots and other documents with Bloomberg that identified the software maker and gave details of the flaws, though he requested that Bloomberg not publish specifics because the affected organization hasn\u2019t published a fix. Colombo claimed he could access more than 25 Teslas in at least 13 countries. He decided to share his findings on Twitter when he couldn\u2019t contact most of the owners directly. Tesla shares sank about 3% early on Jan. 13, badly underperforming the Dow \u2014 which rose as much as 0.4% \u2014 and the S&P 500, which fell less than 0.2%. As of late morning on Jan. 13, no media outlets or analysts had directly connected the stock performance to the hacker news. A Jan. 12 blog post on the InvestorPlace website noted that Tesla traded \u201cincredibly well\u201d after hitting a low on Jan. 10. On Jan. 12, the stock broke back over its 10-day, 21-day and 50-day moving averages. \u201cHowever, bulls will need to see the stock hold the 50-day moving average for it to remain constructive,\u201d InvestorPlace said. \u201cOn the upside, however, a move over the 61.8% retracement opens the door to the December high near $1,172. Above that, and this month\u2019s high is in play near $1,200.\u201d Learn: Tesla Fights California Law That Could Make Solar Energy Costs Soar Explore: Analysts Predict Tesla Stock Could Soar 30% in 2022 \u2014 Here\u2019s Why As for the alleged hacker vulnerabilities: The problem involves flaws in the way the software stores sensitive information required to link cars to the program, Colombo told Bloomberg. The main risk is that the information could be stolen and used by hackers to send malicious commands to the cars, he claimed. \u201cThis shouldn\u2019t happen,\u201d Colombo said. \u201cEspecially if we\u2019re putting cars on the internet and trying to make them secure.
