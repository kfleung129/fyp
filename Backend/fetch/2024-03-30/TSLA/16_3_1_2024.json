    "text": " Tesla has announced a series of limited-time incentives on Weibo for customers purchasing Model 3 and Model Y vehicles before the end of March from existing inventory, with potential savings of up to \u00a534,600 ($4,807 USD). The promotions include an insurance subsidy for the rear-wheel-drive versions of Model 3 and Model Y, offering benefits worth \u00a58,000 ($1,111 USD). Additionally, customers can save up to \u00a510,000 ($1,389 USD) on select vehicle paint options across the Model 3 and Model Y range.  Further savings are available through a low-interest financial policy exclusive to the rear-wheel-drive versions of the Model 3 and Model Y, featuring an annual interest rate as low as 1.99%. This financial offer could lead to maximum savings of approximately \u00a516,600 ($2,340 USD) for Model Y buyers. Tesla\u2019s spring promotion, designed to equip customers with a variety of benefits in one go, is set for a one-month duration. The company highlights the limited availability of vehicles and encourages potential buyers to act quickly to take advantage of the offers. Tesla isn\u2019t done offering discounts on its vehicles in China to spur demand among competition from other EV automakers such as BYD. Tesla cut prices on some Model 3 and Y cars in January and offered cash discounts for some Model Ys in February. "
