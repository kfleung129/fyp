    "text": "       Elon Musk has put\u00a0Tesla investors in a bind with his latest comments on the company's ownership, according to Wedbush. The firm pointed to a recent post from Elon Musk on X, in which the Tesla CEO suggested he wanted a larger stake in the EV-maker, or else he might find it preferable to develop projects in artificial intelligence outside of Tesla. \"I am uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in AI & robotics without having ~25% voting control enough to be influential, but not so much that I can't be overturned,\" Musk said in a post on Monday. \"Unless that is the case, I would prefer to build products outside of Tesla.\" Those comments have created a \"firestorm,\" Wedbush's Dan Ives wrote Tuesday morning, with Tesla stock dipping nearly 3% in pre-market trading. That's because Tesla's AI projects are a key component of Wedbush's bullish thesis for the stock, with the firm recently raising its price target for the EV maker to $350 a share. \"The Street views Tesla correctly (in our view) as a disruptive tech leader and if Musk ultimately went down the path to create his own company (separate from Tesla for his next generation AI projects this would clearly be a big negative for the Tesla story,\" Ives wrote. Musk already launched an artificial intelligence firm last year called xAI, a startup that aims to \"advance our secretive understanding of the universe,\" according to a statement on its website. The firm wants to raise $1 billion in an equity offering, and has already scraped together $135 million from a handful of investors, according to a recent SEC filing. Wedbush maintained its price target and its \"outperform\" rating for Tesla stock. Musk and Tesla board members could potentially sort out the issue over the next six months, Wedbush speculated, which would allow AI projects to be kept within Tesla. \"It's a new era of AI technology coming to Tesla and Musk remains the key asset and heart and lungs of the Tesla story. Musk is Tesla and Tesla is Musk and AI is a key to the future of Tesla,\" Ives said. Musk currently owns around 13% of Tesla. Previously, he owned around 22% of the EV-maker, before selling around $23 billion shares in 2022 in part to fund his colossal purchase of Twitter.
