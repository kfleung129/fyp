As\u00a0Tesla, Inc.\u00a0TSLA continued its stance\u00a0against Super Bowl advertising, a bullish analyst on Sunday criticized the company\u2019s short-sightedness. CEO Elon Musk, of course, had his own take on the ad blitz during the event. What Happened:\u00a0Gary Black\u00a0of Future Fund pointed out that a 30-second Super Bowl ad slot costs $7 million, and to justify this expense, Tesla would need to sell 875 additional cars, assuming a gross profit of $8,000 per car. \u201cAnd the follow up interest from TSLA paying for a Super Bowl ad would be huge. Instead $TSLA cuts price by $1,000 per Model Y in the US for a month ($40M spend),\u201d he said. \u201cShort-term vs. long-term thinking by $TSLA mgmt.\u201d See Also:\u00a0Everything You Need To Know About Tesla Why It\u2019s Important: Despite Tesla\u2019s historical preference for a direct sales model, Black has advocated for advertising on platforms like\u00a0YouTube\u00a0and X \u2014 which the EV maker\u00a0has started doing\u00a0\u2014 to educate potential car buyers about electric vehicles\u2019 benefits and address concerns about range and charging. Tesla supporters defended the company\u2019s absence from the Super Bowl, arguing that the brand is already ingrained in the minds of viewers and that branding ads during the event are unnecessary. Their argument is supported by data showing that Tesla\u2019s popularity spikes when rival companies advertise electric vehicles during the Super Bowl. Automakers like\u00a0BMW,\u00a0General Motors,\u00a0Hyundai\u2018s\u00a0Kia\u00a0sub-brand,\u00a0Stellantis\u2018\u00a0Jeep, and\u00a0Ram\u00a0EV truck maker advertised during the 58th edition of the Super Bowl. Another social media user said, \u201cTesla enters the mind of those who didn't even have them on their radar. It's a good investment for companies with excess cash and excess capacity.\u201d Musk Reacts: Another Tesla influencer reshared Automotive News\u2019 X post about BMW\u2019s ad for its i5 EV, featuring actor Christopher Walken. The influencer commented, \u201cThe ads on the Super Bowl today were all incredibly cheesy and stupid.\u201d \u201cThere was little said about the product, with lots of celebrity appearances and endorsements.\u201d Musk, who watched the Super Bowl live with his son, seemed to share this sentiment. Responding to the post, the Tesla CEO asked, \u201cWere there any half-decent ads?\u201d Price Action: Tesla ended Friday\u2019s session up 2.12% at $193.57, according to Benzinga Pro data.
