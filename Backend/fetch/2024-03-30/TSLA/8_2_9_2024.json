    "text": "EV road trips might soon be getting a little bit easier, thanks to thousands of highway fast-chargers starting this year from a network called Ionna. Ionna, as it\u2019s called, is an EV charging network jointly backed by seven automakers, including an undisclosed amount from BMW Group, General Motors, Honda, Hyundai, Kia, Mercedes-Benz, and Stellantis. The network, which previously called itself out under the banner of \u201cWe Charge North America,\u201d revealed its name Friday, along with a confirmation that it has received regulatory approval and is officially starting up. Led by Seth Cutler, formerly of EV Connect and GE, Ionna aims to establish a minimum of 30,000 high-power EV fast-chargers, strategically located throughout North America to facilitate long-distance journeys. With last summer\u2019s announcement, however, it emphasized that there will be charge points both at urban and highway locations. GM and Pilot Company\u2019s EV charging network The network was announced last July, with plans for 350-kw connectors as a starting point for its experience. At that time, the charging network told Green Car Reports that it aims for reduced charging times, and for \u201chaving the best charging power available on the market and technological state-of-the-art charging at all times.\u201d Amenities and an \u201celevated customer experience\u201d will be a focus of the network, with appealing locations offering restrooms, food service, and retail \u201cnearby or within the same complex.\u201d The first locations will open in the U.S. in 2024, it says, with Canada to be added later. The network also says that stations are \u201cintended\u201d to be powered by renewable energy, so expect more details as this may play a role in automakers\u2019 sustainability efforts. Both GM and Mercedes-Benz have announced separate significant charging-network efforts of their own, and both companies at that time confirmed that those networks are unaffected and independent of this one. Some stations in the Ionna network may be vying for federal NEVI funding alongside those other efforts\u2014and jointly competing with the Tesla Supercharger network, with that network soon more widely open to CCS-standard EVs from other brands. Mercedes-Benz EV Charging Hub in Sandy Springs, Georgia Ionna will be accessible to \u201call electric vehicles with NACS or CCS connectors,\u201d according to the network, and it will \u201cfacilitate seamless integration with participating automakers\u2019 in-vehicle and in-app experiences, encompassing reservations, intelligent route planning and navigation, payment applications, transparent energy management, and additional features.\u201d To that point, Ionna hasn\u2019t yet disclosed how overtly it will be branding the network itself, and how \u201cup front\u201d it will be with its own name at charging locations. The network appears to have much in common with Europe\u2019s Ionity, which was launched by BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Ford, VW, and Audi in 2017\u2014eventually gaining Hyundai and Kia. In that market, the network and its reliability helped build Europe into a stronger EV market than the U.S. 2022 Hyundai Ioniq 5 Limited AWD For the U.S., there\u2019s been no such rival with multiple automaker stakeholders up until now. Electrify America was created with $2 billion from the Volkswagen Group as required by the VW\u2019s diesel-emissions-cheating settlement, and thus far Siemens is its only other corporate investor. Last year, Walmart itself\u2014EA\u2019s earlier venue of choice for its locations\u2014parted ways, announcing its own ambitious coast-to-coast EV charging network. In recent months, Electrify America has instead been also pivoting toward a more upscale experience\u2014with this week\u2019s urban fast-charging location as a template. Put off by failed charging sessions, nearly half of shoppers see public charging as an EV dealbreaker, and an open Tesla Supercharger network is unlikely to fix those issues alone. Upscale experience or not, reliability may ultimately be the factor that determines Ionna\u2019s success\u2014and whether automakers are able to jumpstart EV adoption with it. "
