I\u2019m a Financial Advisor: Here\u2019s the No. 1 Piece of Advice I Would Give My Younger SelfCheck Out: Pocket an Extra $400 a Month With This Simple Hack In fact, in a new book titled \u201cElon Musk,\u201d by Walter Isaacson, the author suggested that Musk is all but addicted to this level of risk. The author even claims to have heard Musk once say, \u201cI want to keep taking risks. I don\u2019t want to savor things.\u201d While it\u2019s easy to note the billionaire\u2019s failures \u2014 buying and nearly tanking the social media site X, formerly known as Twitter; not delivering the fully autonomous Tesla car that he promised; and a SpaceX rocket explosion \u2014 Musk\u2019s bets pay off more often than not. Here are 6 reasons why Musk\u2019s risks lead to financial rewards. Sponsored: Get Paid To Scroll. Start Now Musk has never settled for small ideas. The company he co-founded before he was a household name \u2014 X.com \u2014 was a key player in the formation of PayPal, which now more than 428 million people use worldwide to make digital payments. As CEO of Tesla, he\u2019s made electric cars a popular, and even coveted, choice among consumers. Then there\u2019s SpaceX, formed in 2002, part of Musk\u2019s vision to make space travel possible and affordable, as well as to potentially colonize Mars. Though skeptics doubted it would take off, the company did the unexpected: landed and then put back into flight a Falcon 9 booster in 2017. He even landed a contract with NASA to transport cargo to the International Space Station.

In a \u201cMaster Plan\u201d that he revealed at a company event in Texas, Musk explained that Tesla\u2019s goal is to help eliminate the world\u2019s reliance on fossil fuels and lead the way in sustainable energy on multiple levels. Beyond just cars, Musk aims to produce such things as heat pumps, sustainably fueled planes and boats to create an entirely sustainable civilization. Recently, Musk lowered the price of Teslas to make them more affordable for the average person \u2014 to the disappointment of his shareholders when Tesla stock prices dropped. Musk explained that he\u2019s prioritizing volume of car sales over profits right now, with a vision of generating revenue through software updates down the road, but that getting people into Tesla\u2019s cars is more important right now. Musk is known for constantly pushing his teams to think beyond current goals, even reaching for what others might consider \u201cimpossible\u201d goals. While he might seem crazy to some, he has a way of achieving what detractors say he can\u2019t. Even Tesla was treated skeptically when the cars were first revealed, and yet now they are among the most popular electric vehicles on the market. You don\u2019t get to be the world\u2019s richest man without the media having its way with you. Musk is used to being a topic of discussion, and often a controversial one. He raised a lot of hackles when he bought X and changed not only its name, but how people can use the platform. While others may not like the changes, he claims it is democratizing the platform. In April 2023, SpaceX\u2019s uncrewed spacecraft Starship met with disaster at launch when it exploded, slowing down the development of a rocket whose intent was to eventually carry people to the moon and Mars. However, Musk was not upset by the failure, seeing it as a crucial piece of learning in the process and expressing gratitude that the rocket made it off the launch pad. Anand Mahindra, chairman of the Mahindra Group, posted on X, \u201cMost would be terminally daunted by such a \u2018failure\u2019\u2026 but when you set up each initiative as a learning experiment \u2014 and of course, have raised the resources to do so! \u2014 you essentially extend the frontiers of knowledge and progress.\u201d It doesn\u2019t seem like Musk has any plans to stop taking risks. \u201cIf the odds are probably in your favor, you should make as many decisions as possible within the bounds of what is executable,\u201d Musk has said.
