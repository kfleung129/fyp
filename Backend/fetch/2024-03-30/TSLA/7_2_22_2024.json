    "text": "Tesla Sweden is staying firm against collective agreements amid IF Metall\u2019s strike. The Swedish union has gained support through sympathy strikes, but now, where it matters most: with Tesla\u2019s employees. Some have started to wonder if IF Metall should accept Tesla Sweden\u2019s stance against collective agreements for its employees. After all, collective agreements in Sweden are common but not mandatory. Tesla should be able to say no to collective agreements if that is the case. \u201cCollective agreements are not mandatory, and then a no must be allowed to be a no. It is also possible to question the legitimacy of the union\u2019s actions if even their members do not listen to the strike,\u201d said Lise-Lotte Argulander, F\u00f6retagarna\u2019s expert on employment law. A recent report from Sweden\u2019s Mediation Institute revealed that IF Metall has received underwhelming support from Tesla employees. According to Tesla, over 90% of its 300 workers in Sweden have chosen to remain in their positions and continue working. IF Metall has sought support from other unions in Sweden and Nordic countries in its strike against Tesla. These sympathy strikes have affected employees from other companies and Tesla customers in Sweden more than they are affecting the actual company. Customers in Sweden have been unable to get their Teslas properly serviced since the strike. IF Metall\u00a0temporarily eased restrictions\u00a0on Tesla Sweden\u2019s workshops so customers could get their cars repaired. Meanwhile, in Vetlanda,\u00a020 employees have lost their jobs\u00a0due to their company supporting IF Metall through a sympathy strike. The company, Hydro Extrusions, used to supply aluminum parts to Giga Berlin. IF Metall wanted to hold Giga Berlin production, and Hydro Extrusions supported the Swedish union\u2019s goals. However, the company ended up losing its contract with Tesla, resulting in 20 redundant jobs. While reports have emerged alleging that Giga Shanghai is slowing down on its electric...
