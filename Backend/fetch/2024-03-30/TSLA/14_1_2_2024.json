    "text": " Cathie Wood\u2019s Ark Invest team focused quite a bit on the Tesla brand in late 2023. One of their newsletters admonished GM and Ford, arguing that slowing the path toward EVs is a mistake \u2014 one that will only help Tesla and Elon Musk if these and other legacy automakers don\u2019t plunge into electrification full force and quickly. But that\u2019s not all that Wood and her team have forecast about Tesla\u2019s footprint: they posed another prediction that could increase the company\u2019s stock value exponentially by the end of the decade. Chip in a few dollars a month to help support independent cleantech coverage that helps to accelerate the cleantech revolution! What does that mean for Tesla? The investment management firm\u2019s vision for Tesla gives us a lot to mull over. What\u2019s already brewing within Tesla\u2019s footprint? What else could boost its financial allure and send it out blazing again ahead of competitors, like its EVs did? Maybe it\u2019s the Supercharger network evolution, with NACS pushing the company to new financial levels? Is it the Megapack, which is already cost competitive with conventional energy sources? Perhaps it\u2019s energy storage growth, more generally? Nope. Not even close. To deconstruct Ark Invest\u2019s forecasts, it makes sense to start with Tesla\u2019s successes in transportation electrification. We know that Tesla operates 6 gigafactories located in California, Texas, Nevada, New York, Berlin, and Shanghai. Another planned gigafactory in Mexico is stalled until interest rates drop enough to make construction feasible. Musk mentioned in 2022 that Tesla could produce up to 20 million electric cars per year by 2030, with each gigafactory producing between one and a half and two million units per year. As early as 2006, Tesla claimed that most cars in the future would be electric. Since then, the rise of electric cars has been \u201cstaggering,\u201d according to Bloomberg. Tesla evolved from being the car of the \u201cuber rich\u201d to one that everyday drivers could own. Then other major automakers followed suit, which drove down EV prices and expanded available options. Now Tesla faces real competition from legacy automakers and fresh faces entering the EV space. Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood has long been bullish on Elon Musk and Tesla. After all, Ark Invest projects that EVs should account for ~90% share of the market by 2027. \u201cWe expected a lot of traditional auto manufacturers to see the writing on the wall and rush as quickly as they could into scaling big-time into electric vehicles,\u201d she told Bloomberg Surveillance this week. But that\u2019s not what played out. Instead, General Motors and Ford revealed that they will slow their EV investment trajectories, so that billions of dollars will be filtered out over a longer period of time. Shareholders were panicking about short term price drops, even though it seemed obvious that legacy automakers would have to experience financial restructuring to rebuild and retool so their catalogs could be filled with EVs. Wood has determined that such losses are necessary and to be expected. \u201cBoth GM and Ford have said, \u2018We\u2019re stepping back. We\u2019re not going to do this until it\u2019s profitable.\u2019 The problem with that is in order to be profitable, they need to scale. That\u2019s how this works. These are learning curves that they are writing down, and those are expressed in cost declines\u2026 The fact that they\u2019re pulling back means there\u2019s more share for Tesla and others who choose to go for it.\u201d So the Detroit Three and others really can\u2019t compete with Tesla right now, as EVs account for 84% of Tesla\u2019s revenue. It hurt competitors that Tesla slashed the prices of its EVs by an average of 20% between August 2022 and August 2023; Tesla\u2019s sharp and unexpected price drops to offset 2023 inflation affected other electric cars on the market, so a lot of used EVs were sitting on the lot for longer than normal. Our CleanTechnica editor-in-chief, Zachary Shahan, says the used electric car market in the US now is, \u201ceven broadly speaking, at the whim of Tesla\u2019s supply-vs-demand trends.\u201d Plus The Motley Fool points to Tesla\u2019s economies of scale \u2014 \u201cits gross profit margin is higher than that of any other car maker in the industry, which affords the company pricing power to help fend off competitive threats.\u201d Tesla\u2019s EV sales far exceed any other automaker. Musk has voiced optimism that Tesla EV deliveries can grow 50% annually for several more years. Tesla\u2019s projections were to produce 1.8 million EVs in 2023. Starting with 2024, Tesla plans to increase its sales up to 50% through demand for its vehicles, which means the company expects to possess the capacity to build them. Ark Investment Management\u2019s financial models describe Tesla\u2019s primary source of upcoming financial success, and, guess what? EVs aren\u2019t going to be pulling the Tesla weight by 2027, says Ark. Instead, AI will become the prominent profitability measure for Tesla.\u00a0If you\u2019ve been thinking along the lines of what the Ark Investment folks are thinking, then you\u2019re prescient in a way most of us are not. The Ark team concludes that in 2027 Tesla will generate $1 trillion in annual revenue, with 44% coming from the robotaxi business. In fact, Cathie Wood continues to voice strong sentiment that Tesla stock is the biggest artificial intelligence (AI) opportunity in the world. Tesla\u2019s prospective robotaxi business line is a key driver, the Ark team\u00a0says, contributing 67% of expected enterprise value and 64% of expected EBITDA in 2027. That adds up to $354 billion in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), of which 64% will come from robotaxis and a further 3% from human-driven ride-hailing within Tesla\u2019s network. Tesla\u2019s revenue is on track to come in at $97 billion in 2023, so it would have to grow by 80% per year between now and 2027 to meet Ark\u2019s $1 trillion forecast by 2027. Across their simulation set, the EV sector for Tesla accounts for 47% of revenues in 2027 \u201cat substantially lower margins than robotaxi revenue.\u201d Assuming Ark is correct, that means a majority of Tesla\u2019s profitable assets will emerge from sectors that are not yet fully functioning in 2024. Tesla\u2019s footprint would look entirely different if driven by robotaxis. We\u2019ve known for a while that Tesla believes it can develop industry-leading autonomous self-driving vehicle software. But robotaxis? Really? Is this really going to be the area of focus for the company moving forward? Tesla\u2019s 2023 Annual Report slide deck info reminded us that its Full Self Driving (FSD) Beta has grown to nearly 200 million miles driven since its inception. That number of miles of training shouldn\u2019t come as a full surprise, as Tesla has been developing its full FSD software for over 10 years. Ark Invest estimates Tesla has 2.7 million customer cars on the road testing FSD, which is 10 times more than its nearest competitor. Analysts at the The Motley Fool, while not convinced that the robotaxi gig is the key to long term Tesla success, admit, \u201cNevertheless, if and when Ark\u2019s predictions come true, Tesla could amass a valuation of over $6 trillion! That implies a 770% upside in its stock from where it trades today.\u201d Carolyn Fortuna, PhD, is a writer, researcher, and educator with a lifelong dedication to ecojustice.
