What Happened:\u00a0In an\u00a0interview\u00a0with the German newspaper M\u00e4rkische Allgemeine, Scholz expressed his desire for Tesla to develop in Brandenburg like how Ford did in Cologne. He cited the Ford Cologne plant, which opened in 1931, as producing vehicles for the entire European market, expressing hope for a parallel trajectory for Tesla in Brandenburg. During the interview, Scholz also condemned the recent arson attack on the Tesla factory, labeling it a \u201cterrorist act.\u201d The arson, which occurred in early March, resulted in a power outage and halted production for about a week. The attack was claimed by a far-left activist organization known as the Vulkan Group. \"That was a terrorist act,\" said Scholz. \"Police and security authorities must do everything they can to identify the perpetrators and bring them to justice.\u201d The chancellor also called for increased protection of vital facilities across Germany, including defenses against cyberattacks. Why It Matters: On Thursday, it was reported that Tesla CEO Elon Musk asked Brandenburg politicians that the arsonists be captured. Tesla\u2019s gigafactory in Berlin is its only factory in Europe. As per the company\u2019s 2023 annual report, the factory currently has an installed annual vehicle capacity of 375,000 Model Y vehicles. The company is currently\u00a0looking to expand the plant\u00a0to increase its capacity for battery production to 100-gigawatt hours and car production to 1 million units annually. Tesla representatives have largely discarded the protests against the factory\u2019s proposed expansion claiming that they stem from misinformation. Tesla executive Rohan Patel said last month that the company will continue with its expansion efforts while also working with the community and stakeholders.
