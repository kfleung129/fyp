    "text": "Business Insider Edition The Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi is launching a new Tesla fighter later this month, marking yet another competitor for CEO Elon Musk in the critical Chinese electric-vehicle market. The SU7 model, a high-end electric car, is set to launch on March 28 in China, CEO Lei Jun said Tuesday on X. The announcement of the Chinese tech giant's first EV launch comes just weeks after Apple finally scrapped a decadelong effort to build its own electric and autonomous vehicle. Xiaomi's real competition in the EV market is Musk's Tesla. Lei took direct aim at Musk at the electric car's announcement last year, saying the company's goal was \"to make a dream car that is as good as Porsche and Tesla,\" Bloomberg reported. The SU7 is engineered to compete with the likes of Porsche and Tesla via its \"super electric motor,\" Lei said, which he added could rack up speeds faster than either of the luxury-EV brands' products. Pricing is not yet known for the new EV, which is in preproduction and set to hit the Chinese market in a few months.
