    "text": "Justin Sullivan/Getty Images News Employees at Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) are being put to the test after managers were asked to make a binary decision on whether each of the positions of their direct reports is critical. Sources indicated that Tesla (TSLA) sent out the single-line query to managers for each job after canceling some employees' biannual performance reviews. The development follows Tesla's (TSLA) underwhelming sales and deliveries guidance issued alongside its Q4 earnings report and is consistent with Elon Musk's increased emphasis on cost-cutting efforts following the pandemic period where Tesla (TSLA) was hiring at a rapid pace. In other Tesla (TSLA) news, German media reported that the electric vehicle giant produced 6K cars in a week for the first time out of the Berlin region plant. That production milestone was achieved before a components shortage caused a manufacturing halt in late January. Tesla (TSLA) is waiting for approval on an application to double the plant's capacity to one million cars annually. The Austin-based company is not performing as well in South Korea. Tesla (TSLA) is reported to have only sold a single car in the nation during January amid fading enthusiasm for electric vehicles and some pushback from consumers on buying vehicles assembled in China. Shares of Tesla (TSLA) gained 2.55% in premarket trading on Wednesday to $189.97 vs. the 52-week range of $152.37 to $299.29. The latest breakdown on Tesla (TSLA) from a Seeking Alpha analyst is from Rafa Oliver. The number crunching from Oliver values Tesla at $112 per share, which represents a 40% discount compared to the market price. "
