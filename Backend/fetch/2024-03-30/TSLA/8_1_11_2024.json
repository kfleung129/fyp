    "text": "Hertz Global Holdings Inc.\u00a0plans to sell a third of its US electric vehicle fleet and reinvest in gas-powered cars due to weak demand and high repair costs for its battery-powered options. The sales of 20,000 EVs began last month and will continue over the course of 2024, the rental giant said Thursday in a\u00a0regulatory filing. Hertz will record a non-cash charge in its fourth-quarter results of about $245 million related to incremental net depreciation expense. The dramatic about-face, after Hertz announced\u00a0plans in 2021\u00a0to buy 100,000\u00a0Tesla Inc.\u00a0vehicles, underscores the waning demand for all-electric cars in the US. EV sales growth\u00a0slowed sharply\u00a0over the course of 2023, rising just 1.3% in the final quarter as consumers were put off by high costs and interest rates. \u201cThe elevated costs associated with EVs persisted,\u201d Hertz Chief Executive Officer\u00a0Stephen Scherr\u00a0said in an interview. \u201cEfforts to wrestle it down proved to be more challenging.\u201d Hertz\u2019s shares fell 4.3% to $8.95 as of 10:01 a.m. in New York. The stock declined 32% last year. Going forward, Hertz will keep a close eye on EV demand both at dealerships and within its own operations to decide whether the company should buy more vehicles, Scherr said. That means its\u00a0agreement\u00a0to buy 175,000 EVs from\u00a0General Motors Co.\u00a0over the next four years and another 65,000 from Polestar may take much longer to complete, he said. Hertz plans to use some of the money raised by selling off EVs to buy gas-powered vehicles. \u201cThe company expects this action to better balance supply against expected demand of EVs,\u201d it said in the filing. The shift back to more conventional cars marks a reversal of a strategy centered on EVs, which the company hoped would fetch higher prices at the counter and hold their value.\u00a0Tesla\u2019s price cuts\u00a0over the past year lowered the value of the cars in Hertz\u2019s fleet and with EV sales growth slowing, it\u2019s not clear if consumers will have an appetite for them in the used-car market. Hertz is keen on GM\u2019s plan to sell cheaper EVs, like a future redesign of the Chevolet Bolt, which sold for under $30,000 before ending production last year, and a $35,000 Chevy Equinox that is going into production. Those vehicles could be easier to rent profitably, Scherr said. \u201cWe\u2019re committed to the strategy\u201d Scherr said. \u201cIt will take more time to execute it.\u201d The plan to unload EVs should improve Hertz\u2019s cash flow and earnings this year and next. By year-end 2025, the company expects improved financial results driven by higher revenue per day and lower depreciation and operating expenses. The company sees incremental free cash flow of as much as $300 million in the aggregate over 2024 and 2025. Scherr had signaled this shift would come, saying in October that the company would scale back on EVs, which had made up 11% of its total fleet. Teslas represented 80% of that. Tesla\u2019s price cuts raised his company\u2019s depreciation costs, Scherr said. EVs also come with higher repair costs compared to the rest of its cars, which has hurt its bottom line and played a big role in\u00a0missing\u00a0third-quarter earnings estimates. \u201cEV\u2019s will be slower than our prior expectations,\u201d he said during the company\u2019s third-quarter earnings call. \u00a9 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.
