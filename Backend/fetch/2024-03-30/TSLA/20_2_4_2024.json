    "text": "ARK Invest Founder and CEO Cathie Wood called the Delaware court\u2019s decision to void Elon Musk\u2019s performance-based pay package \u201cunAmerican.\u201d \u201cI believe the Delaware court decision, forcing Tesla to void the March 2018 vote on Elon Musk\u2019s Performance-based pay package, is unAmerican, an assault on investor rights, and an insult to the Board of Directors of one of the most stunningly successful companies in US history,\u201d posted Wood on X. Wood and Ark Invest\u2019s General Counsel analyzed over 200 pages of the Delaware Court decision and concluded that its interpretations missed a lot of points. Judge Kathaleen McCormick from the Delaware Court of Chancery ruled that Musk\u2019s 2018 pay package was\u00a0unreasonable because of its \u201cunfathomable sum.\u201d I believe the Delaware court decision, forcing #Tesla to void the March 2018 vote on Elon Musk\u2019s performance-based pay package, is un-American, an assault on investor rights, and an insult to the Board of Directors of one of the most stunningly successful companies in US history. \u201cOn behalf of our clients, ARKInvest voted for Elon Musk\u2019s compensation, as did ~80% of shareholders. Nearly five years later, a Delaware judge has overruled the Board and shareholders, the latter [of] whom had the benefit of ample debate about the incentive plan\u2019s probability,\u201d added Wood to her post. Following the Delaware court\u2019s decision regarding the 2018 pay package, Elon Musk posted a poll on X, asking the public if the company should\u00a0change its state of incorporation to Texas. The company\u2019s shareholders have also written to the Tesla Board of Directors, supporting a change in Tesla\u2019s state of incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The letter also includes a request to explore options to keep Elon Musk\u2019s 2018 pay package active and in place. Furthermore, the shareholders are asking the Board to design a\u00a0new CEO compensation plan\u00a0\u201calong the lines of the 2018 Plan.\u201d If you have any tips, contact me at\u00a0maria@teslarati.com\u00a0or via X\u00a0@Writer_01001101.
