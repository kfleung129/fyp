What Happened: Black emphasized that although Wall Street acknowledges Tesla\u2019s progress with the FSD software, it will not impact the valuation until the software achieves fully autonomous driving. Presently, Black views the FSD software as a remarkable driver assist tool rather than a fully autonomous driving solution. He stated that for the software to truly deliver autonomous driving capabilities, Tesla must assume full liability for any injury or damage incurred. \u201cSince I don't see that happening anytime soon, WS won't add incremental value beyond the normal take rate math in every analyst's TSLA valuation model,\u201d Black said. To date, Tesla has attributed responsibility for all incidents involving FSD to the driver, emphasizing that the software remains in its testing phase and requires active driver supervision. Earlier this week, Tesla said all its U.S. vehicles with FSD compatibility will have the feature enabled free for a month. Why It Matters:\u00a0Tesla CEO\u00a0Elon Musk\u00a0previously stated that FSD \u201cshould be really shining bright\u201d by late April or May, as the company plans to roll out three significant improvements to the software every two weeks. Additionally, Black has advocated for Tesla to consider\u00a0adding a fourth segment\u00a0focused on its artificial intelligence endeavors to its earnings reports to garner greater investor attention for its FSD project and other initiatives such as FSD licensing, robotaxis, Optimus, and Dojo. Currently, all attention is on Tesla\u2019s\u00a0first-quarter delivery\u00a0numbers, expected next week, according to Black. He believes that any figure surpassing last year\u2019s delivery number of 423,000 will be well received, with his own estimate sitting around 425,000 units.
