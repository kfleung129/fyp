    "text": " X has canceled a high-profile partnership with former CNN host Don Lemon to stream a video talk show on the platform. Lemon said that the company canceled his contract hours after he interviewed X\u2019s billionaire owner Elon Musk for the first episode of \u201cThe Don Lemon Show,\u201d which was scheduled to stream on the platform this Monday. \u201cElon Musk is mad at me,\u201d Lemon said in a video posted to X on Wednesday. \u201cApparently, free speech absolutism doesn\u2019t apply when it comes to questions about him from people like me.\u201d Lemon\u2019s announcement came a day after company CEO Linda Yaccarino declared that X was becoming a \u201cvideo first\u201d platform. It announced the partnership with Lemon in January as part of a larger strategy to stream more original content on the service. This included striking deals with former representative Tulsi Gabbard and sports radio commentator Jim Rome to stream their own shows on the platform. Last year, X reportedly made a similar deal with Tucker Carlson after he was fired from his hosting duties at Fox News. X\u2019s decision to cancel Lemon\u2019s show raises questions about the company\u2019s strategy. \u201cThe Don Lemon Show is welcome to publish its content on X, without censorship, as we believe in providing a platform for creators to scale their work and connect with new communities,\u201d X said in a statement. \u201cHowever, like any enterprise, we reserve the right to make decisions about our business partnerships, and after careful consideration, X decided not to enter into a commercial partnership with the show.\u201d Lemon said that he will now stream the first episode of \u201cThe Don Lemon Show\u201d on X, YouTube and other podcast platforms, and is preparing for a legal fight in case X refuses what is reportedly a multi-million dollar payout. \u201cDon has a deal with X and he expects to be paid for it,\u201d a spokesperson for Lemon told Variety. \u201cIf we have to go to court, we will.\u201d However, two anonymous sources claimed to Semafor that Lemon may not have actually signed a contract with X. Musk has a history of withholding payments. A group of former Twitter executives including the company\u2019s ex-CEO Parag Agrawal are suing Musk and X over millions of dollars in unpaid severance benefits. Lemon\u2019s interview with Musk, which was recorded on Friday, spanned a wide range of topics including the presidential election, and, reportedly, the billionaire\u2019s alleged ketamine use, the subject of a Wall Street Journal story published earlier this year. \u201cHardcore questions were asked,\u201d Lemon told an X user. In a written statement, Lemon said that he had a \u201cgood conversation\u201d with Musk, but the billionaire clearly didn\u2019t seem to think so. Musk wrote that Lemon\u2019s approach was \u201cbasically just \u2018CNN, but on social media\u2019, which doesn\u2019t work, as evidenced by the fact that CNN is dying,\u201d in response to a user asking X about specific reasons for terminating the partnership with Lemon. \u201cAnd, instead of it being the real Don Lemon,\" Musk sniped, \"it was really just [former CNN President] Jeff Zucker talking through Don, so lacked authenticity.\u201d Lemon was fired from CNN nearly a year ago after making on-air remarks against former Republican presidential contender Nikki Haley that many considered sexist and ageist, as well as reports showing he engaged in misogynistic behavior over his 15-year tenure at CNN.
