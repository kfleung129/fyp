The Tesla Analyst: Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives maintained an Outperform rating on the stock and cut his price target from $315 to $300. Twin Troubles: Tesla has been haunted by both demand and supply-side issues, said Ives in a note. The first quarter has been nightmarish for Tesla as China demand remained very soft from the beginning of the quarter, and factory planned downtimes and the Berlin fire have impacted supply, he said. \u201cThere is no denying this has been a quarter to forget for Musk and Tesla,\u201d the analyst said. The weakness may have been exacerbated by the Model 3 Highland upgrade issues in the Fremont factory and flattish sales in Europe, he added. As such, the analyst reduced his first-quarter delivery estimates from 475,000 units to 425,000 units, citing a \u201cperfect storm\u201d of demand issues that hit the quarter, which in turn hurt delivery and sales.

The analyst said as opposed to the 2.1 million-unit estimate for the year, a 2-million number now looked more like a \u201crealistic\u201d target. China deliveries may have been down 3-4% year-over-year in the first quarter, Ives said. Negative Narrative Justified? As such, the first-quarter deliveries will not be a \u201cmoment of celebration for the bulls and instead be a rip the band-aid quarter for Tesla investors,\u201d Ives said. \u201cWe believe the Tesla narrative is as negative as we have seen in the last few years with [Elon] Musk/Tesla getting attacked by the bears from all directions,\u201d the analyst said, adding \u201cBut unlike other times, now it\u2019s warranted as growth has been sluggish and margins showing compression with China a nightmare.\u201d \u201cFor Musk, this is a fork-in-the-road time to get Tesla through this turbulent period. Otherwise, darker days could be ahead,\u201d Ives said. The analyst is, however, confident in the long term. \u201cWe have a high level of confidence in the FSD/autopilot strategy at Tesla and ultimately this holds the future promise and valuation support that remains at the epicenter of this disruptive tech story,\u201d he said. For a turnaround, the analyst recommended the following: Ives said. \u201cWe remain bullish on Tesla over the next few years\u2026Our view is that Tesla\u2019s stronghold of the EV market will accelerate and margins will trough with FSD/AI software growth key going forward.\u201d \u201cHowever, getting through this white knuckle period will be a defining chapter for Musk & Co. and the future of Tesla.\u201d Tesla Price Action: Tesla ended Wednesday\u2019s session up 1.22% at $179.83, according to Benzinga Pro data. The stock is down nearly 28% for the year-to-period.
