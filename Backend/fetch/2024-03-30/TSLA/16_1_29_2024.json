    "text": "By Will Feuer Tesla expects to spend more than $10 billion in capital expenditures in the current fiscal year, but expects that figure to decline in the following two years. The Elon Musk-led electric vehicle maker disclosed the guidance in a regulatory filing containing its annual report. For fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2026, Tesla said it is targeting capital expenditures of $8 billion to $10 billion. In the previous year's report, Tesla projected capital expenditures between $7 billion and $9 billion in fiscal 2024 and 2025. The company cautioned that various factors, including potentially shifting company priorities and the addition of new projects, could affect the guidance. Tesla also said it expects to be able to fund itself and its expansion \"as long as macroeconomic factors support current trends in our sales.\" Tesla said it is likely to see heightened levels of capital expenditures over certain periods due to various factors such as labor availability, supply-chain issues, material prices and trade conditions.
