    "text": "A Tesla Inc.  TSLA bull on Wednesday took stock of his investment thesis for the electric vehicle giant\u2019s stock as it remains\u00a0stuck in a lackluster trading range. What Happened:\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve been wrong on $TSLA for three years now,\u201d said Future Fund\u2019s\u00a0Gary Black, adding that the stock has been his \u201cworst-performing long\u201d during the period when Tesla fell 19% compared to a 32% gain for the Nasdaq 100 Index. Future Fund has Tesla as the third-highest holding of its\u00a0Future Fund Active ETF\u00a0FFND. Black conceded that he was wrong about volume trajectory. Tesla\u2019s volume growth has slowed despite its massive price cuts and electric-vehicle credits, he said. The company estimated 15% year-over-year volume growth for 2024, down from the 38% growth seen in 2023, he noted. \u201cWhere I've been massively wrong is not anticipating that TSLA would start a price war, which has caused TSLA 2024 and 2025 earnings power to collapse (-45% over past 12 months),\u201d the Tesla investor said. \u201cThis has been my greatest research mistake,\u201d Black said. The rumored $25,000 Model 2, which he believed could satisfy the affordability issue, has been pushed back to late 2025 at least, he said. \u201cSo price cuts to drive volumes were in hindsight inevitable,\u201d he said.

Despite FSD improving significantly as a driver-assist tool, its take rates languished in the low teens, the fund manager said. The technology, the analyst said, currently added 14 cents per share to the estimated earnings per share for 2024. Still Bullish:\u00a0Black said he still thinks he will be vindicated on his Tesla price target of $290. He premised his optimism on his expectations that the other EV makers would either give up or cut back on their EV investments. He, however, cautioned against further price cuts. \u201cFurther TSLA price cuts would crush my investment thesis that auto gross margins bottomed at 16.3% in 3Q and are now headed upward as TSLA mgmt learns that they got little from last year's price cuts.\u201d \u201cWhen I make a bad trade as I have with $TSLA, I have only myself to blame. The\u00a0shorts have done little to cause $TSLA price to decline;\u00a0the damage to the stock has been largely self-inflicted which I should have foreseen.\u201d To get to his $290 price target, the Tesla management should learn to use marketing tools other than price, Black said. Despite the current fundamental problems, the fund manager remains firmly bullish on the stock. \u201cBut I am optimistic and remain a $TSLA bull,\u201d he said.
