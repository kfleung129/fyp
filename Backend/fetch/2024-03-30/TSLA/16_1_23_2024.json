Let\u2019s look at its financial metrics to know more\u2026. Jan 23, 2024 Against a backdrop of the rising prominence of Electric Vehicles (EVs), automaking giant Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) is expected to post its fourth-quarter results tomorrow. The company already reported delivering approximately 1.81 million vehicles last year, indicating a 38% year-over-year growth. However, TSLA\u2019s decision to cut prices on its popular Model Y vehicles, aligning with the price war it has initiated in the EV market, has weighed on investor sentiments. The stock closed its last trading session at $208.80, lower than the 50-day moving average of $237.49 and 200-day moving average of $231.68. Furthermore, Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas cut TSLA\u2019s price target from $380 to $345, which is a significant drop. Jonas anticipates TSLA\u2019s 2024 volume and profitability outlook to be modest. The company also faces increasing competition from other automakers. Amid this, TSLA would have to stall production at its German factory from January 29 to February 11 as vessel attacks in the Red Sea have led to a lack of components supplied through that route. Another question clouding the company\u2019s outlook is Chief Executive Elon Musk stating that he would be uncomfortable growing TSLA as an Artificial Intelligence (AI) leader if he did not have 25% voting control. Given this situation, let\u2019s look at the trends of TSLA\u2019s key financial metrics to understand why it might be wise to exercise caution and avoid the stock now. Analyzing Tesla\u2019s Financial Performance: From March 2021 to September 2023 The trend and fluctuations of the trailing-12-month net income of TSLA from March 2021 to September 2023 can be summarized as: 10 STOCKS TO SELL NOW! From this data series, it\u2019s clear that TSLA\u2019s net income has been on a general upward trend from March 2021 to December 2022, with fluctuations in 2023. The growth rate, computed by assessing the final value from the first, indicates an expansion of approximately $9.64 billion. Please note that greater emphasis has been placed on more recent data in accordance with the given instructions.  The reported gross margin of TSLA indicates a general increasing trend from the start to the middle of the series (March 2021 to June 2022). This period observed the gross margin improving from 21.2% in March 2021 to a peak of 27.1% by June 2022. However, after this period, a consistent downward trend is evident, with the gross margin decreasing from 27.1% in June 2022 to 19.8% by September 2023. Key notes: The growth rate of the gross margin, taking the last value from the first value, was negative, which indicates a decrease, though there were periods of increase in the initial part of the series. The overall trend showcases a decline in the gross margin for TSLA from mid-2022 to late 2023. This suggests an increased cost of goods sold or decreased net sales during this latter period. It\u2019s crucial for stakeholders to monitor these shifts over time to evaluate business performance and adjust strategies accordingly.  The ROIC (Return on Invested Capital) trend for TSLA shows a fluctuating pattern over the period given.

Emphasizing the more recent data, there appears to be a reverse in the previous upward trend. Transitioning from the fourth quarter of 2022 to the third quarter of 2023, the ROIC reduced, potentially indicating a negative change in the company\u2019s profitability in this last quarter.
