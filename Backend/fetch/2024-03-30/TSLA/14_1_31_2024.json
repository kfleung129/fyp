    "text": "At last: a judgment that injects a dose of sanity into the process of handing out executive rewards  \u201cWas the world\u2019s richest man overpaid?\u201d begins Kathaleen McCormick in her ruling from the Delaware court of chancery. You bet. An incentive package worth up to $55.8bn for Elon Musk at Tesla in 2018 was over the top, unnecessary to secure the great man\u2019s services and thus \u201cunfair\u201d to other shareholders because of the dilutive effect on their holdings. Read the 200-page judgment and it\u2019s hard to disagree with any step in her argument. Musk and his fanclub are enraged, naturally. \u201cI recommend incorporating in Nevada or Texas if you prefer shareholders to decide matters,\u201d said Tesla\u2019s chief executive. And it\u2019s true that shareholders approved the scheme by a 73% majority back in 2018. Some said on Musk\u2019s X that they\u2019d happily do so again today because he hit his performance-related targets and Tesla\u2019s value improved by a turbo-charged $600bn. (Back in 2018, remember, the electric vehicle company was worth $50bn-ish and there was a lively debate in the investment world about whether it would soon run out of money.) Yet the objection that shareholders signed off the whole thing misses the nuances, and careful stages, in McCormick\u2019s ruling. Step one was to show that Musk\u2019s 22% stake in Tesla gave him controlling status, meaning enormous influence. That wasn\u2019t hard to show: Musk was chairman and \u201csuperstar CEO\u201d and \u201cenjoyed thick ties with directors tasked with negotiating on behalf of Tesla\u201d. Step two was to ask, given the controlling status, whether the incentive package was fair. Delaware courts can shift the burden of proof when a transaction is approved by a \u201cfully informed\u201d vote of other shareholders, but that\u2019s where Tesla and the defendants started to fall down. The company\u2019s proposal \u201cinaccurately described key directors as independent and misleadingly omitted details about the process\u201d. The judge is surely spot-on about the lack of independence. Ira Ehrenpreis, the lead director negotiating for Tesla, had a 15-year business relationship with Musk. Another member of the working group, Antonio Gracias, had a 20-year one and regularly went on holiday with Musk\u2019s family. A third member was the company\u2019s general counsel, Todd Maron, who was Musk\u2019s former divorce lawyer and \u201cwhose admiration for Musk moved him to tears during his deposition\u201d. That set-up just looks too cosy. It was also a reason why McCormick concluded that the process behind the award was \u201cdeeply flawed\u201d. In essence, Musk proposed the size and structure of his potential rewards and the compensation committee achieved concessions that weren\u2019t true concessions in the judge\u2019s view. Thus the argument moved on to the fairness of the award in terms of price. The board members argued that they wanted to set Tesla up for transformational growth and that Musk\u2019s continued leadership was essential. McCormick knocked down the \u201chigh level\u201d appeal of that argument with a series of commonsense points. First, given Musk\u2019s one-fifth stake, he already had \u201cevery incentive\u201d to attempt transformation because a $50bn increase in Tesla\u2019s market value would be worth $10bn to him. Second, he had no plan to leave. Third, the incentive scheme didn\u2019t even require him to devote a set amount of time to Tesla. \u201cSwept up by the rhetoric of \u2018all upside\u2019, or perhaps starry eyed by Musk\u2019s superstar appeal, the board never asked the $55.8bn question: was the plan even necessary for Tesla to retain Musk and achieve its goals?\u201d asked the judge. Yes, that\u2019s the nub of it. In being so lavish, the directors short-changed ordinary shareholders. The court order says the share options must be voided. Tesla may appeal or produce a new proposal (with correct disclosures on independence, one hopes). In the meantime, though, applaud a judgment that injects a dose of sanity into the process of awarding executive rewards at quoted companies \u2013 a process that has become so inflationary, in part, because independent directors have taken timidity to new depths.

It\u2019s the cocker spaniel that gets taken home,\u201d another rich man, Warren Buffett, said a few years ago. Absolutely right. The job of independent director is meant to be about representing the interests of all shareholders. If you can\u2019t act independently, you should not be there. Do not behave like members of a cult, which is roughly what happened at Tesla. Come on \u2013 $55.8bn was always absurd. "
