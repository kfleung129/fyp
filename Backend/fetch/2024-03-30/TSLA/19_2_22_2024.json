By Russ Amy Updated Feb 22, 2024 at 11:53AM If you\u2019re an active investor, it is likely that you\u2019ve considered investing in Tesla. And if you\u2019re new to investing, you may not have learned how to invest in Tesla in the first place. Over the past few years, Tesla\u2019s (Nasdaq: TSLA) stock has been climbing at an alarming rate. However the stock has seen a drop in 2022. Tesla stock hit an all-time high of $1,222.09 back in November of 2021. Since then the stock has dropped nearly 40%.  One of the frequent criticisms you might hear about Tesla is that the stock is priced based on the company\u2019s future potential and not on actual results. In 2020, in this article, our very own Jody Chudley said \u201cTesla\u00a0is the most overvalued stock on the market today.\u201d He went on to say \u201cTesla\u2019s\u00a0market valuation \u2013 relative to what the underlying business has actually accomplished \u2013 has gone from absurdity to outright madness. There is nothing fundamental going on at this company that merits this (stock price) in 2020. This will end badly for people buying shares today.\u201d Now since the company\u2019s recent drop, many investors are considering this a time to buy low and take advantage of one of the best companies the market has to offer. Regardless of whether or not you think Tesla is a good investment\u2026 these four simple steps will teach you how to invest in Tesla, or any other stock for that matter. First you need to sign up for a brokerage account. Fidelity, Vanguard, Schwab, Webull and Robinhood are good options with low or no-cost fee structures. You can access their brokerage account options via their website or mobile app. Or check out our Alternatives to Robinhood Article here. Investments are made directly through your retirement accounts. You might already have a 401(k) or an IRA set up through your employer. Additionally, a 529 college savings account can be a good way to start investing in Tesla. It is also important to read all the information presented in your brokerage account. This could be anything from fee structures to promotions and more. Now that your account is approved and active, you\u2019ll need to link your bank account to your brokerage account. There are usually a couple ways you can do this, depending on the broker. Once your bank account is linked, you can transfer funds into your brokerage account. It may take some time for the cash amount to register, but some trading platforms grant you \u201cbuying power\u201d to start making trades right away. Depending on whether this is a retirement account, college savings account or individual brokerage account, your investment approach should vary. We recommend setting a budget for how much you\u2019ll invest each month. Now that you\u2019ve made your deposit, it\u2019s time to place your first order. You\u2019ll need to decide how many shares you\u2019d like to purchase and at what price. You have two options here\u2026 a market order or a limit order. We recommend ALWAYS using a limit order. A limit order sets a specific price (limit price) that is the highest a buyer will pay or the lowest a seller wants to receive. The buyer will accept a price at or lower than the limit and a seller will accept a price at or higher than the limit. If the stock or option hits that price during the day, your order will be filled. If not, the order is canceled and you have the option to invest in Tesla the following day. Whether it\u2019s your house, your car, your health or your investments\u2026 keeping a close eye on things is important. As it is with everything in life\u2026 things change. Sometimes a stock will fail because of poor leadership, low earnings or even unforeseen external forces. On the other hand, many stocks thrive and surpass company growth expectations. It\u2019s important to understand the changing nature of the market and how that will impact your investments in the long run. Now that you\u2019ve learned how to invest in Tesla\u2026 whether or not you actually do so is completely up to you. Whether it\u2019s Tesla, Google (Nasdaq: GOOG), Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN), Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) or some other stock\u2026 you now have all the tools you need to start investing and building wealth.
