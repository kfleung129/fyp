So, in the past year, the car industry had its fair share of challenges \u2013 from a dip in electric vehicle sales to strikes in U.S. factories and all the way to supply chain headaches and pricey materials. But hey, it wasn\u2019t all doom and gloom! Car and commercial vehicle sales hit a high of over 90 million with some impressive double-digit growth. India even stepped up to become the fourth-largest market for light vehicles. And despite a bit of a hiccup in electric vehicle sales, things are looking up for 2024. Over in the U.S., electric vehicle sales are set to rise by 16% year-over-year in 2024, while in China, we\u2019re looking at an 11.1% growth rate. China\u2019s leading the way in global electric vehicle sales, snagging a 60% share with their slick supply chains and top-notch innovation. They\u2019re on track to capture 12% of Europe\u2019s electric vehicle market by 2025. Luxury cars are shifting gears too, with SUVs becoming the hot choice for the wealthy. And electric vehicles are revving up their engines in the luxury market, aiming for 15-17% of sales by 2024. In contrast, the used car market in the Asia-Pacific region is on a roll, with sales hitting 94-96 million vehicles in 2023 and expected to grow by 5-6% in 2024. The business-to-consumer segment is gaining ground, eyeing over 50% market share in Asia-Pacific and North America. Looks like things are shaping up for a well-organized market. That was a quick recap on the automotive market's standing as of 2024; now before we move on to our list of 15 Best Selling Car Brands in the World, we must shed light on some of the biggest players in the automotive industry. Namely, we are going to discuss General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) and Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY). So, let\u2019s talk about General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) - you know, that big American car company based in Detroit, Michigan. They\u2019re the brains behind popular car brands like Chevrolet, GMC, Cadillac, and Buick. Now, here\u2019s the scoop: GM is gearing up to roll out a bunch of medium-duty trucks that run on hydrogen fuel cells. This whole gig is part of a test run backed by the U.S. Department of Energy. The aim? To show off hydrogen as a promising alternative to good old diesel vehicles. The project is getting a sweet $65 million budget boost, with $26 million chipped in by the DOE and the rest covered by GM and its partners. This move is tied to the SuperTruck program, a plan to cut carbon emissions from heavy- and medium-duty vehicles. Looks like GM is revving up innovation in the green vehicle game! Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) is a big German company behind all kinds of wheels - from cars to motorcycles and everything in between. Guess what? Volkswagen and JAC Motors are teaming up to amp up their shared venture in China. They disclosed just recently in March 2024, their intentions of aiming to beef up the venture's capital from $1.03 billion to $1.94 billion, with some cash coming from JAC and the rest from Volkswagen. This boost won't change their 25% and 75% ownership stakes, though. Volkswagen's eyeing a comeback in the Chinese market after facing a bit of a setback with tensions between the West and Beijing. They're also feeling the heat to pull out of their Urumqi production site in Xinjiang. An overhead view of a factory floor, teeming with robotic arms assembling cars.
