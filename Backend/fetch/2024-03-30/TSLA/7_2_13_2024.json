    "text": "By  Andrew J. Hawkins, transportation editor with 10+ years of experience who covers EVs, public transportation, and aviation. His work has appeared in The New York Daily News and City & State. In 2015, the then-lead of Google\u2019s self-driving car project Chris Urmson said one of his goals in developing a fully driverless vehicle was to make sure that his 11-year-old son would never need a driver\u2019s license. The subtext was that in five years, when Urmson\u2019s son turned 16, self-driving cars would be so ubiquitous, and the technology would be so superior to human driving, that his teenage son would have no need nor desire to learn to drive himself. Well, it\u2019s 2024, and Urmson\u2019s son is now 20 years old. Any bets on whether he got that driver\u2019s license? One of the hallmarks of the race to develop autonomous vehicles has been wildly optimistic predictions about when they\u2019ll be ready for daily use. The landscape is positively littered with missed deadlines. In 2015, Baidu senior VP Wang Jing said the tech company would be selling self-driving cars to Chinese customers by 2020. In 2016, then-Lyft president John Zimmer claimed that \u201ca majority\u201d of the trips taking place on its ride-sharing network would be in fully driverless cars \u201cwithin five years.\u201d That same year, Business Insider said that 10 million autonomous vehicles would be on the road by 2020. GM said it would mass produce driverless cars without steering wheels or pedals by 2019. Ford, slightly more conservative, predicted it would do the same in 2021. And in a perfect encapsulation of mid-2010s autonomy hype, Intel in 2017 predicted a $7 trillion industry \u2014 more than double what the global auto industry does now \u2014 around autonomy by 2050. Of course, no one has been more bullish than Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who has turned making wrong predictions about the readiness of autonomous vehicles into an art form. Of course, no one has been more bullish than Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who has turned making wrong predictions about the readiness of autonomous vehicles into an art form. \u201cBy the middle of next year, we\u2019ll have over a million Tesla cars on the road with full self-driving hardware,\u201d Musk said in 2019. Tesla\u2019s Full Self-Driving (FSD) feature would be so reliable the driver could \u201cgo to sleep.\u201d Teslas with the company\u2019s FSD software are not autonomous, and drivers would be well advised to not sleep in their cars. Sure, there are some self-driving cars on the roads today. They\u2019re in San Francisco, Phoenix, Los Angeles, Hamburg, and Beijing, among other cities. They\u2019re operated by some of the biggest, most well-capitalized companies in the world. You can even ride in some of them. But they\u2019re stuck. Not stuck in the sense that a Tesla Cybertruck gets stuck in less than an inch of snow. But confined within geofenced service areas, held back by their own technological shortcomings, opposed by labor unions and supporters of more reliable modes of transportation, and restricted from driving on certain roads or in certain weather conditions. \u201cThe autonomous vehicle industry \u2014 particularly the companies developing and testing robotaxis \u2014 has gotten away for too long with selling a vision of the future that they should know perfectly well is never going to come to pass,\u201d Sam Anthony, co-founder and CTO of Perceptive Automata, a now-defunct AV company, wrote in his newsletter in 2022. We assumed the robots would be able to drive as freely as we do. After all, we built a world in which we humans can \u2014 and do\u00a0\u2014 drive anywhere, all the time. So why did we get it so wrong? Before we examine why the industry collectively whiffed the rollout of driverless cars, it\u2019s instructive to look at why these predictions were made in the first place. Why set these goal posts if they never really mattered? Of course the answer is money. By promising that driverless cars were \u201cjust around the corner,\u201d and on the cusp of taking over our roads, companies were able to rack in hundreds of billions of dollars to fund their experiments. The amount of money flowing into the autonomous vehicle space also had the knock-on effect of convincing regulators to take a lax approach when it comes to self-driving cars. AV boosters warned that too many rules would \u201cstifle innovation\u201d and jeopardize future gains, whether that was safety or job creation. And it turns out that regulators were very receptive to those arguments. The federal government \u2014 whether under Obama, Trump, or Biden \u2014 has done very little to stand in the way of companies testing their tech on public roads. A bill in Congress that would accelerate the rollout of cars with steering wheels and pedals has stalled over disagreements about liability, but you wouldn\u2019t know it looking at these fundraising hauls. Some states, like California, have done their best to spin up some sort of regulatory playbook. But most were eager to attract companies under the belief that driverless cars were the future. And who wants to stand in the way of the future? For nearly a decade, AV operators were able to raise money almost without restriction. For nearly a decade, AV operators were able to raise money almost without restriction. They did it through normal fundraising channels, or by tying themselves to big tech and car companies. Cruise Automation was acquired by General Motors. Ford invested $1 billion in Argo AI. Google, always slightly ahead of the rest, spun out its self-driving car project as Waymo. Amazon bought Zoox. Hyundai allied itself with Motional. Some have estimated over $160 billion has flowed into the industry over the past dozen or so years. And after the pandemic, the companies that weren\u2019t able to cozy up to big automakers or tech giants found a new way to quickly raise cash: SPACs. Traditional IPOs were slow, and special acquisition companies were quick, so dozens of mobility-focused startups went public by merging with these so-called \u201cblank check\u201d companies in order to access more money faster. And despite a number of setbacks, like crashes and lawsuits and investigations, the cash kept coming in. It wasn\u2019t until 2021, when the industry pulled in $12.5 billion led by GM\u2019s Cruise raising a massive $2.75 billion, that funding for AV companies peaked. The predictions about the imminent arrival of safe, reliable self-driving technology helped speed the flow of money. And once those predictions failed to materialize, the money started to dry up. Why did the predictions fail? The technology, while incredibly effective at getting us most of the way there, stumbled as it got closer to the finish line. In the AV world, this is called the \u201clong tail of 9s.\u201d It\u2019s the idea that you can get a vehicle that is 99.9 percent as good as a human driver, but you never actually get to 100 percent. And that\u2019s because of edge cases, these unpredictable events that flummox even human drivers. When training an AI program on driving, you can predict a lot of what to expect, but you can\u2019t predict everything. And when those edge cases eventually emerge, the car can make mistakes \u2014 sometimes with tragic consequences. When training an AI program on driving, you can predict a lot of what to expect, but you can\u2019t predict everything. Take the example of Cruise. In October of last year, a woman was hit by a human driver while crossing the street in San Francisco. The impact sent her flying into the path of a driverless Cruise vehicle, which immediately braked after also striking her. The Cruise vehicle then attempted to pull over to the side of the road, not realizing the woman was still trapped beneath the vehicle, injuring her further in the process. One of the first things Cruise did in the wake of the incident was to recall all 950 vehicles it had on the road in the US. This took the form of an over-the-air software update to the collision detection subsystem so the vehicle remains stationary during certain crash incidents, rather than pulling over to the side of the road. Cruise encountered an edge case, and it quickly issued a correction for it. But how many more edge cases are lurking in the shadows? And how many more people will be injured \u2014 or even killed \u2014 before these cars are seen as more reliable? Waymo has been on the forefront of trying to convince the public and regulators that its vehicles are as safe, if not safer, than humans. It\u2019s released a number of studies and statistical analyses in recent years that it says proves its vehicles get in fewer crashes, cause less damage, and improve overall safety on the roads. But for every Waymo, there\u2019s an Elon Musk, whose misleading predictions about the imminent readiness of self-driving cars muddy the waters for everyone else who knows that the reality is much further away than previously thought. Waymo also assumes legal liability for crashes involving its vehicles \u2014\u00a0something Tesla has so far refused to do. But Waymo isn\u2019t driving the public\u2019s perception of self-driving cars; Tesla is. Broken promises and failed predictions are what\u2019s fueling the growing skepticism about self-driving cars in the public which, as the years plod by, gets more and more turned off by the idea of relinquishing control of their vehicles to a robot. Without passengers, there\u2019s no business. But without safe, reliable technology, there\u2019s no future for autonomous vehicles. / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.
