    "text": "In a dramatic turn of events, Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), has witnessed a significant reduction in his fortune. His wealth has plunged by approximately $40 billion since the beginning of 2024. According to Bloomberg's Billionaires Index, Musk\u2019s net worth suffered a substantial blow because of Tesla's falling stock price. The index now estimates Musk\u2019s wealth to be $189 billion, positioning him third after French business magnate Bernard Arnault and Amazon.com Inc. Founder, Jeff Bezos. Trending: Market makers trigger a Tesla stock anomaly on Thursdays \u2014 here\u2019s how to exploit it. The decrease in Musk\u2019s wealth is primarily linked to Tesla\u2018s share price, which has seen a decline of nearly 29% in 2024. Investors are reportedly apprehensive about weak sales in China and the rising competition from local electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers such as BYD Co. Ltd. Other factors contributing to Musk\u2019s financial setback include a $55 billion compensation package rejection by a Delaware court and issues with his social network X, formerly known as Twitter. Since Musk took over in late 2022, the platform has seen a withdrawal of advertisers, a scarcity of revenue and legal problems arising from laid-off employees and allegations of overdue rent by landlords. The decline in Musk\u2019s wealth is a reflection of the challenges Tesla is facing in the global market. The company\u2019s declining sales in China, a key market for EVs, and increasing competition from local manufacturers are significant concerns for investors. The legal and financial troubles surrounding Musk\u2019s social network add to the uncertainty around his business ventures. This series of events has led to a significant erosion of Musk\u2019s wealth and has implications for his standing among the world\u2019s richest people.
