(TSLA Quick QuoteTSLA  -  Free Report)     plans to produce Tesla Semi, its electric semi truck, at Gigafactory Berlin. Elon Musk, CEO of TSLA, revealed this plan during his visit to Gigafactory Berlin following an arson attack on the factory, which resulted in a halt in production.Tesla is currently manufacturing Model Y at Gigafactory Berlin.Musk did not provide a specific timeline for the project. The company had not yet unveiled any new vehicle production programs for the factory beyond the Model Y.The automaker\u2019s announcement to produce the Tesla Semi at Gigafactory Berlin reflects Elon Musk\u2019s commitment to expanding the European factory despite facing massive resistance from Gr\u00fcnheide locals.Per the expansion plan, Gigafactory Berlin aims to build another plant to increase the annual production capacity of the factory to 1 million units from the current capacity of 500,000 units. Although Tesla Semi's contribution to Gigafactory Berlin\u2019s 1 million unit goal would be limited, it suggests progress in the right direction.Lars Moravy, the company's vice president of vehicle engineering, confirmed that the fleet of Tesla Semi has increased to around 100 units.Per Moravy, TSLA has partnered with Pepsico, which is using Tesla Semi for delivery to monitor the durability of Class-8 trucks. The data provided by PepsiCo is crucial to enable the volume production of the Semis scheduled to commence this year.Currently, Tesla Semi is in low-volume production in a plant outside Gigafactory Nevada. In January 2023, the EV pioneer announced its plan to expand Gigafactory Nevada to integrate the production of Tesla Semi trucks and 4,680 battery cells. The company also announced its plan to develop the factory to its originally intended size. \u00a0However, there was no progress reported on the expansion plan of Gigafactory Nevada for a year. In January 2024, the company started working on the project but is yet to start the volume production of semi trucks in the United States. In Europe, regulations do not endorse big trucks. Long-nose trucks have been wiped out of European roads due to a current length limit of 18.75 meters. Utilizing valuable cargo space for the truck's engine is not productive, so cab over truck dominates the European market. Tesla Semi would be considered as an outlier, given the regulatory requirement unless the legislation states otherwise. Discussion is in progress to allow longer and more aerodynamic cabs without compromising cargo volume in case of electric trucks.Per an ING report dated December 2023, the composition of European truck sales is set to transform in the next 10 years. Europe has been pushing auto manufacturers to decarbonize the continent\u2019s fleet quickly because of which the manufacturers are scaling up the production of electric trucks.Considering Europe\u2019s efforts to decarbonize the auto sector, Tesla Semi would be a perfect choice for the continent. However, there\u2019s no clarity on whether the automaker would revamp Tesla Semi for the European market.

This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1988 it has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +24.15%  per year. These returns cover a period from January 1, 1988 through March 4, 2024. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple, equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zacks Ranks stocks can, and often do, change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available, pricing information was not collected, or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations.
