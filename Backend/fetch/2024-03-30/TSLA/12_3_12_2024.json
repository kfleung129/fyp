Power has been restored to electric car manufacturer Tesla's factory near Berlin about a week after an outage believed to have been caused by arson, a network operator says. Grid operator E.DIS said in a statement that Tesla was reconnected to the network at 8:45 p.m. Monday, March 11, 2024, after days of repairs. A network operator says power has been restored to electric car manufacturer Tesla\u2019s factory near Berlin after a nearly one-week outage believed to have been caused by arson. Grid operator E.DIS said in a statement that Tesla was reconnected to the network at 8:45 p.m. Monday after days of repairs. There had been expectations that the factory, Tesla\u2019s first in Europe, might remain without power until the end of the week. Production at Tesla\u2019s plant in Gruenheide, just outside the German capital, came to a standstill last Tuesday. Tens of thousands of residents, nearby hospitals, nursing homes and a big logistics center for a German grocery chain also were affected initially.
