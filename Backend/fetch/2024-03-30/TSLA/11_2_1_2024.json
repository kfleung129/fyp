If they\u2019re so passionate they can\u2019t control their emotions, though, you might be in trouble. That\u2019s exactly what happened to Elon Musk in a recent court case. Todd Maron, former General Counsel for Tesla and the billionaire\u2019s former divorce attorney, broke down crying over his love for Elon during a deposition about how much the billionaire got paid. The waterworks came amidst the most devastating financial blow of Musk\u2019s career. On Tuesday, a Delaware court struck down his $56 billion compensation package at Tesla. In a scathing opinion, Judge Kathaleen McCormick said the process of approving the CEO\u2019s pay was \u201cdeeply flawed\u201d and unfair to Tesla\u2019s shareholders. \u201cMusk controlled Tesla\u201d through a series of incestuous relationships with the same people who were supposed to be representing the company\u2019s interests, McCormick wrote. McCormick cited Maron\u2019s weeping as a key example. Maron wrote many of the documents that Musk\u2019s legal team highlighted to show the process of negotiating his compensation was fair. But Maron was so beholden to the CEO that his \u201cadmiration for Musk moved him to tears during his deposition,\u201d McCormick wrote. That\u2019s a problem. A company\u2019s General Counsel isn\u2019t the CEO\u2019s lawyer; they\u2019re supposed to represent the company\u2019s interests. It seems like that wasn\u2019t the situation at Tesla, however. In fact, Maron was the primary middleman between Musk and the committee that determined his pay, and Maron didn\u2019t seem clear whether he was on Tesla\u2019s side or Musk\u2019s. Maron didn\u2019t just cry at the deposition. Apparently, he was holding back tears when he testified about leaving Tesla during the trial, calling it \u201cthe most difficult decision\u201d he ever made in his life. Maron and Tesla did not immediately respond to requests for comment. It wasn\u2019t just Maron. Musk had a 15-year relationship with Ira Ehrenpreis, who chaired the committee that determined the CEO\u2019s compensation. Antonio Gracias, another member of the compensation committee has a 20-year business relationship with Musk, and they\u2019re such good friends that the two even go on vacation together. All that could make for a conflict of interest. According to the judge, that\u2019s exactly what happened. A publicly traded company has a legal responsibility to maximize the money it\u2019s making for shareholders. Presumably, that includes negotiating the lowest possible salary for an employee\u2014or at least a reasonable one\u2014whether that employee is the CEO or a janitor. But the negotiation for Musk\u2019s compensation was a \u201ccooperative\u201d process, Maron told the court. \u201cWe were not on different sides of things,\u201d Ehrenpreis said, and Gracias admitted there was no \u201cpositional negotiation\u201d over the size and structure of Musk\u2019s compensation. That\u2019s surprising given the fact that when Tesla awarded Musk 20.3 million stock options in 2018, worth $55.8 billion dollars at the time, it was the biggest compensation package in the history of business. Judge McCormick said this \u201cunfathomable sum\u201d wasn\u2019t calibrated to match what Tesla got in return. McCormick said Musk alone determined the value of his compensation, a figure that had \u201cno relation to Tesla\u2019s goals.\u201d A lot of Tesla\u2019s shareholders, many of whom bought into the company because of their passion for Elon Musk, were perfectly fine with how much the CEO got paid. But Richard J. Tornetta, a drummer in a thrash metal band and a man who owns Tesla stock, thought the compensation for Musk and the rest of the board was unfair. He sued Tesla, and after a lengthy court battle, the Delaware court system agreed. A lot of businesses are incorporated in Delaware because, among other benefits, the state has a generous tax system. But a peculiarity of Delaware law allowed the case against Musk and Tesla to go through, something that might not have happened in other states. That\u2019s something Musk latched onto after the news about the case. \u201cNever incorporate your company in the state of Delaware,\u201d Musk said in a tweet on Tuesday. He posted a poll, asking X/Twitter users what they thought about the matter, a classic decision-making process recommended by most business schools. \u201cShould Tesla change its state of incorporation to Texas, home of its physical headquarters?\u201d Musk asked in the poll. Just over 87% of the 1.1 million people who voted said yes. \u201cThe public vote is unequivocally in favor of Texas!,\u201d Musk tweeted. \u201cTesla will move immediately to hold a shareholder vote to transfer state of incorporation to Texas.\u201d This article originally appeared on Gizmodo.
