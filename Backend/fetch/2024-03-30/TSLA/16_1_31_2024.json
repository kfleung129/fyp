    "text": "Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks The 303 million split-adjusted stock options that Musk had received are worth $51 billion as of Tuesday's share price. Attorneys for Musk and the Tesla board argued the pay package was approved by a shareholder vote. The judge in the case ruled Musk and rest of Tesla board failed to prove the compensation plan was fair. A Delaware state court judge has thrown out the 2018 pay package that helped to make Tesla CEO Elon Musk one of the richest people in the world. Delaware Chancery Court Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick, who oversaw the bench trial that concluded in November 2022, ruled Tuesday\u00a0that Musk and the Tesla board \u201cbore the burden of proving that the compensation plan was fair, and they failed to meet their burden.\u201d The 303 million split-adjusted stock options that Musk had received as part of the package are worth $51 billion today, when calculated using Tuesday\u2019s closing price, less the modest exercise price of $23.34 a share. The case was argued in Delaware, where Tesla and many other major US corporations are incorporated. While Musk did not have an immediate comment on the decision, he did tweet Tuesday, \u201cNever incorporate your company in the state of Delaware.\u201d \u201cI recommend incorporating in Nevada or Texas if you prefer shareholders to decide matters,\u201d he said in a second tweet. He also put up a poll on X asking if Tesla should change its state of incorporation to Texas, where its headquarters is based. As of 7 am ET, 88% of those responding to the poll were voting yet. Attorneys for the shareholders who brought the suit had argued that the package of stock options was excessive and that the directors on Tesla\u2019s board were not truly independent and were too close to Musk to protect shareholders\u2019 interests. They also argued that the financial targets the company had to hit for Musk to qualify for each of the 12 separate blocks, or \u201ctranches,\u201d of stock were not the \u201cstretch performance goals\u201d as the company told shareholders when seeking their approval of the package. Instead, they argued the milestones were essentially the same as the company\u2019s internal growth projections that were being shared with banks and rating agencies. \u201cWe are enormously grateful for the court\u2019s thorough and extraordinarily well-reasoned decision in turning back the Tesla board\u2019s absurdly outsized pay package for Musk,\u201d said a statement from Greg Varallo, one of the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys in the case.\u00a0He said Tesla investors will benefit from the decision by having the \u201cdilution from this gargantuan pay package erased.\u201d Attorneys for Musk and the Tesla board argued the pay package was approved by a shareholder vote. Excluding the votes owned by Musk and his brother, 73% of the shares voting in that election supported the pay package. They also argued that the shareholders had seen their Tesla shares massively increase in value since it was granted. The company\u2019s market cap was valued at $54 billion at the time the pay package was approved. It had risen to $607 billion as of the close of trading Tuesday, a gain of more than 1,000%. The Tesla attorneys argued that Musk was a key to that rise in the company\u2019s value and that the pay package was therefore reasonable compensation. The Tesla attorneys also argued that Musk, who does not receive a cash salary or bonus, would be uncompensated if the package was thrown out. But McCormick rejected the argument that Musk would be uncompensated if the package was thrown out, writing, \u201cMusk\u2019s preexisting equity stake provided him tens of billions of dollars for his efforts.\u201d McCormick also found that the Tesla board was not acting as the check on Musk and his pay that it was supposed to be, arguing that Musk was calling the shots on the pay package. While CEO compensation is supposed to be determined in a good-faith negotiation between a company\u2019s governing board and the executive who both have different goals, \u201cMusk launched a self-driving process, recalibrating the speed and direction along the way as he saw fit,\u201d she wrote. The entire process was \u201cdeeply flawed,\u201d the judge wrote, with compensation committee members including Antonio Gracias, a personal friend of Musk\u2019s that often took family vacations with the Tesla CEO, as well as Todd Maron, \u201cMusk\u2019s former divorce attorney and whose admiration for Musk moved him to tears during his deposition.\u201d \u201cGiven the collection of people tasked with negotiating on Tesla\u2019s behalf, it is unsurprising that there was no meaningful negotiation over any of the terms of the plan.\u201d Musk recently said it is important that his stake in Tesla be increased, as a protection against outside investors getting control of the company. \u201cI am uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in AI & robotics without having ~25% voting control. Enough to be influential, but not so much that I can\u2019t be overturned,\u201d Musk wrote in a\u00a0post on X. \u201cUnless that is the case, I would prefer to build products outside of Tesla.\u201d He said at that time the Tesla board was waiting for the court to make a decision in this case before it moved ahead with a new pay package. Unless the decision is overturned on appeal, it will strip Musk of the 303 million options he now holds to increase his Tesla stake, plaintiff\u2019s attorney Varallo told CNN late Tuesday after the decision. The Tesla board can agree to a new pay package for Musk, according to Varallo, but it can\u2019t deceive shareholders about financial milestones of that package being more difficult to achieve than they actually are, or that it is an independent committee negotiating the terms when Musk is calling the shots, as the judge ruled happened in this case. And he said he doesn\u2019t think that changing Tesla\u2019s incorporation to another state will make it easier to get approval. \u201cI think most states corporation systems have the idea you don\u2019t lie to people,\u201d he said. He owns about 13% of the company\u2019s shares outright. With the options he has now lost, he would have controlled\u00a0about 20.6% of the shares. He said he wanted to control at least 25% of the shares of the company. The decision can be appealed to the Delaware Supreme Court. Some investors and analysts have suggested it would be a good idea for Tesla to offer Musk a new pay package in order to keep him focused on Tesla\u2019s success rather than distracted by his other interests. He is the CEO of SpaceX, a privately held space exploration company of which he is the primary shareholder, and he purchased Twitter in 2022,\u00a0rebranding it X in 2023. He also has a company called the Boring Company that is developing ways to drill tunnels more cost effectively and an AI company called xAI, which he started last year. He is also the primary owner of Neuralink, which has been working toward using implants to connect the human brain to a computer. Robyn Denholm, the chair of Tesla\u2019s board, testified that the pay package was all about keeping Musk focused on Tesla. \u201cIt was around motivating him to achieve things that were bold and audacious and him putting his time and energy into that as opposed to his other interests,\u201d Denholm said in testimony in the case. \u201cQuite honestly, I don\u2019t know how much it costs to do any inter-planetary travel. It\u2019s not a hobby of mine,\u201d Denholm said in response to questioning about Musk\u2019s uses for the money. \u2013 CNN\u2019s Matt McFarland contributed to this report This story has been updated with additional context and developments.
