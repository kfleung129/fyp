But nearly four years since it launched, Tesla Insurance has faced significant challenges and questions over its viability. A slew of consumer complaints drew lawsuits and regulatory scrutiny last year, and the brakes appear to have been put on Tesla Insurance\u2019s launch in Europe, originally slated for 2023. One analyst Insurance Business spoke to said the EV giant seems to have run into the same problems that other tech firms fall into while trying to enter insurance. At the same time, Tesla may have struggled in handling the operations of its insurance arm. We are actually looking for revolutionary actuaries for Tesla Insurance! Please inquire, if interested. \u201cFirst of all, when Tesla first came into the industry, they didn\u2019t actually keep the risk themselves; they were just a distribution channel,\u201d said Adam Denninger (pictured), global industry leader for insurance at Capgemini. \u201cWhat you\u2019ve seen for a long time is that a lot of technology companies coming into the industry on the distribution side \u2013 offering new agent experiences, new mechanisms of gathering data, even occasionally doing the underwriting piece as well \u2013 all have had a similar experience. They lost a lot of money.\u201d Denninger cited high-profile insurtechs like Hippo and Lemonade as examples of startups that have had a similar experience to Tesla Insurance. \u201c[These companies] came in thinking that the technology was the hard part, and thinking insurance is this old, slow backwater industry,\u201d Denninger said. \u201c[They thought] it\u2019s not that complicated, and they could solve it. But they realised [insurance] was pretty complicated, and it\u2019s difficult to do it without losing your shirt. I think that\u2019s what happened to Tesla.\u201d Experts earlier claimed that Tesla\u2019s pioneering use of advanced telematics would significantly help it price risk better and bring down auto insurance premiums for its policyholders, in a market where traditional insurance players were raising their rates. However, accounts of high auto insurance premium quotes by EV drivers soon surfaced in media reports, appearing to contradict Tesla founder Elon Musk\u2019s assurances of affordable rates. In December 2023, a California judge ruled that the tech firm\u2019s insurance arm would face a class action lawsuit from drivers who claimed they were overcharged for their premiums which Tesla allegedly based on \u201cfalse\u201d crash warnings instead of actual driving behaviour. Danger ahead for Tesla insurance: faulty forward collision warnings inflate premiums, triggering a class-action lawsuit.

As you look forward, that probably will happen.\u201d However, critics have argued that Tesla\u2019s reliance on in-house data may not align with industry standards, potentially leading to inaccurate risk assessments and mispriced insurance premiums. The US class action against Tesla Insurance also raised concerns about the sensor technology they\u2019re using and whether these are \u201cmisreading\u201d driving events. But Denninger maintained that Tesla\u2019s fundamental insurance pricing model is sound. \u201cPeople are saying, \u2018your car isn\u2019t scoring me correctly because the things you\u2019re dinging me for scoring are incorrect\u2019. So, there\u2019s a technology fail,\u201d Denninger said. \u201cBut the underlying model that they\u2019re using to price insurance, there\u2019s nothing wrong with it at all. People do variations of that using smart devices. \u201cThe question is really whether the technology is doing it correctly and whether Tesla has a liability associated with that. That\u2019s an interesting question, and I don\u2019t know where it\u2019s going land.\u201d Though there are technology and operational concerns on the table from some corners, Denninger also points out that increased scrutiny over Tesla Insurance could also be part of the \u201cElon Musk effect.\u201d \u201cWhen I look at all this stuff around Tesla, and all the noise around it, I think some of it is just that Elon Musk is larger than life. People react to him, and they try to jump on any bad news,\u201d said Denninger. An appeals court has ruled that Elon Musk will not have to testify in a wrongful death lawsuit after two teenagers were killed in a Tesla Model S going 116 miles per hour in 2018\u2014after a Tesla technician removed speed limiting software on the vehicle. https://t.co/Sl6EkLeSvg Its controversial CEO aside, Tesla seems to be making all the right moves in its insurance strategy, according to the Capgemini leader. \u201cWhat they\u2019re doing is cutting-edge. It\u2019s exactly where the rest of the insurance industry is going for telematics. Everybody wants to feed data off their cars,\u201d Denninger said. \u201cAs for retaining the risk themselves, other technology companies have tried to do this. It\u2019s not new, and all of them lose their shirts when they do it, and they end up partnering with traditional insurance companies at some point. There\u2019s nothing new here from an insurance industry perspective.\u201d But is there hope for redemption for Tesla Insurance? Denninger told Insurance Business that the tech giant is likely already \u201cdigging their way out.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019re fixing it because the company is incredible when you think about what they\u2019ve done,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in the meantime, it\u2019s causing them all kinds of public relations problems.\u201d What are your thoughts on Tesla Insurance\u2019s rollout?
