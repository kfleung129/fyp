Jennings Follow DataDrivenInvestor -- Share Chinese carmaker BYD (SHE: 002594) overtook Tesla (TSLA) in electric vehicle sales in the fourth quarter of 2023. Thus, BYD is now the world\u2019s largest electric vehicle manufacturer. BYD claims to have sold 526,000 battery-only vehicles in the fourth quarter of 2024, the BBC reports. In contrast, Tesla claims to have delivered 484,500 vehicles in the fourth quarter of 2023. Conversely, CEO Elon Musk claims Tesla could sell two million vehicles in 2023. Thus, BYD has passed Tesla in electric car manufacture. Hence, investors will wonder if BYD is a value investment. Notably, BYD is far cheaper than Tesla. For example, BYD shares trading at \u00a5181.17 ($2.55) on the Shanghai Stock Exchange on 8 February 2024. Conversely, Mr. Market paid $188.44 for Tesla on 8 February 2024. However, Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) sold over 60% of its BYD shares in 2023, Markets Insider reports. Berkshire bought 225 million shares of BYD in 2008. Hence, Buffett owned 9.9% of BYD or 25% of its Hong Kong listings. Thus, the world\u2019s most famous value investor could have lost faith in BYD. Like Tesla Motors (TSLA), BYD has extraordinary manufacturing capabilities. For example, BYD became the world\u2019s largest manufacturer of PPE face masks during the COVID-19 pandemic. BYD was producing over 50 million PPE masks a day during the pandemic, a press release claims. BYD built 3.02 million electric vehicles in 2023, Statista estimates. Conversely, 1.4 million of those vehicles were hybrids. Yet most of BYD\u2019s production is electric. It built 1.62 million battery-only vehicles in 2023. They sell around 90% of those vehicles in China. However, BYD is expanding its exports fast. For example, there are five BYD models in European showrooms. BYD exported 243,000 cars in 2023, the China Passenger Car Association estimates. BYD has ambitious expansion plans. The company has launched its own ship the BYD Explorer \u21161 which can carry 5,000 vehicles to market. The BYD Explorer \u21161 set sail for the Middle East in January 2024. BYD plans three new European\u2026 -- -- DataDrivenInvestor Daniel G. Jennings is a writer who lives and works in Colorado.
