Tesla Inc. had a blockbuster 2023, as its shares more than doubled in 12 months, but 2024 is starting on a different note, with Elon Musk\u2019s electric-vehicle maker off to its worst start to any year \u2014 ever.  The company has lost more than US$94 billion in market valuation in just the first two weeks of 2024. It\u2019s not hard to figure out why, as the Austin, Tex.-based EV maker has been pounded by a barrage of negative news: an about-face on EVs from car rental giant Hertz Global Holdings Inc., yet another price cut for its cars made in China and signs of rising labor costs.

All this comes in the face of slowing growth in demand for EVs, especially in the United States.  \u201cInvestors\u2019 main concern on Tesla is stagnating growth,\u201d TD Cowen analyst Jeffrey Osborne said. The price cuts in China only fan those concerns, because it is starting to look like \u201ca race to the bottom for the EV industry given intense competition in that market.\u201d  The hit to Tesla\u2019s market capitalization to start the year is the biggest the company has had over a similar period since it went public in 2010. In percentage terms, Tesla\u2019s 12 per cent drop since the start of January is the worst since 2016, when the stock fell 14 per cent over the first nine trading days of the year.   To make matters worse, the odds of an imminent turnaround for the EV maker don\u2019t look good.  Tesla has been cutting prices on its cars aggressively since early 2023 in an effort to boost demand. But the result has been a steady erosion of its once-hefty profit margin. Tesla\u2019s automotive gross margin ex-regulatory credits for the third quarter fell to 16.3 per cent from 27.9 per cent a year ago. And the pressure is only mounting now that production workers at Tesla\u2019s U.S. plants are getting pay raises. Canada's best source for investing news, analysis and insight.

Tesla first warned about the deceleration in EV demand during its October third-quarter earnings report. Almost immediately after, automakers and suppliers across the globe chimed in with their own downbeat forecasts. Many carmakers dialed back their plans for expansion.  Then, earlier this month, Tesla reported its fourth-quarter delivery numbers. While they were better than what analysts expected, they put the company behind China\u2019s BYD Co. Ltd. in global electric-car sales.  The result has been a rude awakening for Tesla investors. Last year, the stock was the eighth-best performer in the S&P 500. So far this year, it\u2019s the eighth worst.  Naturally, Musk is taking a big hit personally. The world\u2019s richest person, who gained more wealth in 2023 than anyone else on the planet, has seen his net worth shrink by US$23 billion so far this year, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Musk regained the top spot on Bloomberg\u2019s wealth index last year, overtaking Bernard Arnault, but now Jeff Bezos is rapidly closing in, with US$179 billion to Musk\u2019s US$206 billion as of Jan. 12\u2019s close.  The bulk of Musk\u2019s net worth comes from his 13 per cent stake in Tesla and about 304 million exercisable stock options. He also owns about 42 per cent of Space Exploration Technologies Corp., which is valued at about US$53 billion, according to Bloomberg\u2019s wealth index.   With all that said, Tesla remains a key player in the global transition from gas-powered vehicles to largely electric ones. The reason: It\u2019s so far ahead of its potential rivals. China\u2019s BYD may have surpassed Tesla in the number of units sold, but it still lags in revenue and profits. And BYD doesn\u2019t sell cars in the U.S., where Tesla remains the market leader.  In many ways, Tesla\u2019s biggest problem may be its past success and the hope it generated. As investors piled into the stock, Tesla\u2019s market capitalization ballooned, making it way larger than any other car company in the world. However, with the shares priced for perfection, that also made them highly vulnerable to big reactions to any negative news.   That\u2019s why so many Tesla proponents argue it shouldn\u2019t be compared to regular car companies. To them, the ultimate true value of the company rests in the future and its hope to develop the first truly self-driving vehicles. The only problem is Tesla has been promising this for years, and most experts say the technology is still years, maybe even decades, away.  \u201cTesla has not been able to deliver on fully autonomous driving and AI promises, which are already embedded in the valuation,\u201d Delevska said. \u201cBeing simply another automotive manufacturer is not going to cut it for a US$750-billion valuation.\u201d  \u2014 With assistance from Matt Turner, Kristine Owram and Ed Ludlow.
