Tesla currently looks like a \u201cgrowth company without growth.\u201d The stock could see a double-digit decline, reflecting increasing headwinds to sales and earnings, analysts at Wells Fargo wrote this week. In a statement on Wednesday, the bank downgraded its rating on Tesla from \u201cneutral\u201d to \u201cunderweight\u201d and lowered its price target for the stock from $200 (about 183 euros) to 125 dollars (about 115 euros) per share. That represents a decline of about 23 percent from Thursday afternoon\u2019s level, when the stock was trading at $163.09 (approximately 150 euros) at 1:57 p.m. ET.

We see headwinds from disappointing deliveries and further price cuts, which will likely result in negative EPS revisions,\u201d Wells Fargo analysts said in their note.

Meanwhile, Tesla\u2019s expected launch of the lower-priced Model 2 may disappoint investors as the vehicle\u2019s profitability is low and the timing of the launch appears to be \u201crushed.\u201d Read too Tesla could prevent its stock from crashing by replacing Musk as CEO, an investor says The electric car manufacturer still has a few good arguments.
