    "text": " Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) Share prices are down 56% from their 2021 highs. A series of product price cuts to maintain demand in a weak automotive environment, on top of increasing competition in the electric vehicle (EV) market, has worn out the stock market\u2019s patience put to the test. While the lack of near-term growth catalysts has weighed on the stock\u2019s performance, at least one Wall Street analyst remains bullish on Tesla. Morgan Stanley Analyst Adam Jonas recently maintained an Overweight (Buy) rating on the stock, although he lowered his price target from $345 per share to $320.  The new price target still represents a significant 80% upside from the current share price of $178. The stock hit an all-time high of $414 in early November 2021, and has been on a volatile downward spiral ever since.  Given the current headwinds weighing on Tesla, it could take a while for the stock to find its way to new highs.  Jonas said he doesn\u2019t see Tesla making much progress yet, as he cited an oversupplied EV market in China as the biggest problem that will continue to cause price competition and therefore weigh on Tesla\u2019s sales growth in the short term. Long-term investors will have to be patient with Tesla this year.  Even CEO Elon Musk has warned in previous earnings calls that rising interest rates will be a headwind for the company. But if you have a time horizon of at least five years, the price drop could prove to be an excellent buying opportunity.  Tesla is far from finished growing in the EV market.  Last year the company delivered 1.8 million vehicles, which is a small percentage of total car sales. Moreover, Tesla is already a profitable manufacturer, but it is also building potentially lucrative revenue streams from software and artificial intelligence for its self-driving cars, which are being overshadowed by weak electric vehicle sales.  Investors who ignore the short-term obstacles and patiently hold the stock should come out ahead.
