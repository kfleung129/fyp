    "text": "Intrigue deepened late Sunday about how Elon Musk's big stake in Twitter will affect the social media platform. Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal tweeted shortly before midnight EDT that \"Elon has decided not to join our board.\" The announcement follows a wild week between Twitter and Musk, after the Tesla and SpaceX founder who has more than 80 million followers disclosed his 9% stake in the company, sending the stock skyrocketing by up to 25%. The appointment was to take effect April 9, \"but Elon shared that same morning that he will no longer be joining the board. I believe this is for the best.\" FACT CHECK: Fact check: Fake Twitter employee tweet about Elon Musk spreads online CYBER RODEO: Inside Elon Musk's big, weird Texas party: Music, robots \u2014 and even a petting zoo Elon has decided not to join our board. I sent a brief note to the company, sharing with you all here. pic.twitter.com/lfrXACavvk \u2014 Parag Agrawal (@paraga) April 11, 2022 Before Agrawal's announcement, Musk over the weekend tweets a handful of ideas about Twitter, including making the site ad-free. Nearly 90% of Twitter\u2019s 2021 revenue came from ads, the Associated Press noted. Agrawal told the company that \"there will be distractions ahead\" and that with Musk as the company's biggest shareholder, \"we will remain open to his input.\" Musk, since disclosing his stake, has tweeted about inactivity in several widely followed accounts, asking \"Is Twitter dying?\" And, in one of a few tweets since deleted, he suggested that Twitter headquarters in San Francisco could be converted to a homeless shelter. \"... no one shows up anyway,\" he said, in reference to the company's remote work option. That drew partial agreement from fellow billionaire Jeff Bezos. Or do portion.

His plans now are unknown. Musk's tweets, sometimes off the wall, have gotten him in trouble before, the AP noted. He called a British cave explorer a \u201cpedo guy\u201d in a tweet that led to a failed defamation suit. In 2018 the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission required Musk to pay $40 million in civil fines and for Musk to have his tweets approved by a corporate lawyer after he tweeted about having the money to take Tesla private at $420 per share, which caused Tesla\u2019s stock price to jump. The Washington Post reported last week that Musk may have made as much as $156 million on his failure to disclose having crossed the 5% ownership threshold on Twitter stock, an SEC requirement. That enabled him to buy more Twitter stock at an artificially low price, the Post said, because the disclosure would have boosted the price sooner.
