    "text": "BREAKING: Core PCE Inflation In Line With Views     Tesla (TSLA) said Tuesday night that the updated Model 3 is now available in North America. TSLA stock edged lower early Wednesday. The EV giant made the announcement via Elon Musk's X social site Tuesday night. Tesla in the fourth quarter began delivering the \"Highland\" Model 3 in China and Europe. The refreshed Model 3 has limited exterior changes and some internal refinements. Tesla is selling Rear Wheel Drive and Long Range variants of the updated Model 3, for $38,990 and $45,990, respectively. That's unchanged from the original Model 3's latest prices. The RWD and LR trims are not eligible for IRA tax credits of $7,500 due to tougher battery sourcing rules. Tesla, for now, is no longer offering a Model 3 Performance. The old Performance had a $50,990 price tag, but only $43,490 including tax credits. In fact, the updated Tesla Model 3 Long Range is more expensive than all the Model Y variants after the tax credit is included. TSLA stock fell 0.8% to 233.13 in Wednesday morning trade. Tesla stock sank 2.3% on Tuesday to 234.96, undercutting the 50-day moving average but still holding above the 200-day line. The U.S. EV giant still has a 265.13 handle buy point from a double-bottom base. But the relative strength line is approaching October lows, according to MarketSmith.
