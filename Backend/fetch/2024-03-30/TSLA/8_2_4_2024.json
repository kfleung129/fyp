Billionaire Elon Musk posted on X this week that he's asking Tesla shareholders to move the company's state of incorporation from Delaware to Texas. This comes on the heels of a Delaware judge invalidating his $56 billion pay package this week. But Texas is starting up its own business courts this year, active on September first of this year. While this is a first in the Lone Star State, it's actually the 31st state to create courts specially for big business matters. It comes at a time when high-profile businesses, like Tesla, may end up incorporating there. Last year, the state legislature passed House Bill 19, which created the Texas business courts \u2013 a new system of courts that is expected to begin taking cases later this year \u2013 but only certain complex business cases. \u201cSuch as shareholder derivative actions, breaches of duties by certain managers or excuse me, directors, security actions and certain business transactions over $10 million,\u201d Saba listed as examples. In a nutshell, it is some of the more complicated dealings of big businesses. As of last September, there have been judges in Austin, Houston, Dallas, Waco and San Antonio, and within a few years, including 11 judges across the state. Those judges will be appointed by Gov. Greg Abbott, not elected by voters. \u201cWould you say it\u2019s more a matter of having a specialized court system where issues will be understood better and maybe track through faster versus any political intention?\u201d KEYE asked Saba. \u201cYeah, I think it\u2019s the former. I think there will be more efficient and economical for large dispute resolutions,\u201d he answered. Saba says it will lighten the dockets in district courts as well, making regular civil matters move more quickly. But as for how much of a role is House Bill 19 playing in big business decisions right now: \u201cI think you\u2019d have to ask Elon.\" There can be jury trials, and cases filed after the courts are active that fit the criteria can be removed to the business courts, and cases can be appealed.
