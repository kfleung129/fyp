    "text": "Billionaire tech CEO Elon Musk has taken to the social media platform X to express his deep concerns about the United States facing the risk of bankruptcy. Musk's warning comes in the wake of discussions around the allocation of taxpayer money to service the national debt, rather than investing in critical public infrastructure and initiatives. The alarm was first sounded by a user on X, @WallStreetSilv, who highlighted that a 100% of US taxpayer funds could be funnelled into paying off interest on the national debt in the near future. Another X user, @RealEJAntoni, revealed that in February 2024, a substantial 63% of all personal income taxes were utilized solely to cover the interest on the mounting national debt. Musk echoed these concerns in his post, stating, \"Overspending must stop or America will go bankrupt.\" The overarching worry is that the escalating debt burden may hinder the nation's ability to invest in essential sectors like roads, military, schools, and social security. The apprehensions about the country's financial health coincide with President Joe Biden's unveiling of a $7.3 trillion budget proposal for the fiscal year 2025. The proposal, revealed on March 11, outlines plans for increased services, tax breaks for the middle class, and price controls. However, the feasibility of these plans faces uncertainty in a divided Congress. President Biden's budget proposal strategically targets voters, aiming to garner support for his agenda in the lead-up to the November election and throughout 2025. The proposed budget includes monthly tax credits to assist homeowners, subsidies for childcare, and measures to lower prescription drug prices. Funding for these initiatives would be generated through significant changes to the tax system, including raising corporate taxes and implementing a new minimum tax rate for billionaires and large corporations. Political Strategy: Crafted to appeal to voters, Biden aims to gain support for his agenda amid debates over the debt ceiling and the expiration of Trump's tax cuts.Budget Breakdown: Allocates $1.671 trillion for discretionary spending, including $895 billion for defense-related programs and $621 billion for domestic spending.Additional Measures: Includes a $63 million increase in the Justice Department's antitrust budget and plans to discuss his vision in various states.Taxation: Ensures individuals earning under $400,000 annually won't face increased federal payments, offsetting costs through corporate tax rate hikes and increased taxes on high-income earners' capital gains.Addressing Climate Change and Energy: Redirects funds from oil and gas industry incentives toward combating climate change and supporting zero-emission power. However, the budget has faced criticism from Republicans for its projected deficits and debt, exacerbated by higher interest rates. Critics argue that the proposed spending reflects a lack of fiscal responsibility, with Biden's budget projecting a substantial $16.3 trillion addition to deficits over the next decade. Despite an anticipated decline in the deficit for the next year, concerns linger as US debt owed to the public is expected to rise significantly, creating a backdrop of financial uncertainty and prompting industry leaders like Musk to voice their anxieties.
