From established players such as Tesla, Inc. TSLA to startups such as Fisker, Inc. FSR, companies have faced challenging conditions in the industry. Here are the key events that happened in the EV space during the week: Tesla Analysts Temper Targets, FSD Free Trialing And More: This week, more sell-side analysts reduced their first-quarter deliveries target for Tesla. Bullish analyst Daniel Ives from Wedbush reduced his target  from 475,000 units to 425,000 units, citing a \u201cperfect storm\u201d of demand issues that hit the quarter, which in turn hurt delivery and sales. The analyst also lowered his price target for the stock from $315 to $300. RBC Tom Narayan from Capital Markets revised his first-quarter sales estimate from 500,000 units to 446,000 units. He attributed this adjustment to a demand pull forward from the expiration of certain Model 3s\u2019 IRS tax credits and the shutdown of Giga Berlin for approximately two weeks. Tesla executive Rohan Patel was active on social media, promoting Tesla\u2019s 30-day complementary trial of the company\u2019s full-self driving software. \u201cPlease encourage your friends and family who may have a Tesla to try this free 30-day trial of Supervised FSD,\u201d  Patel\u00a0said on X, formerly Twitter. Patel, who is vice president of public policy and business development at Tesla, said that the progress made by Tesla on the artificial intelligence front is \u201cmind-blowing\u201d and that users will be inspired to either buy the software or subscribe to it after experiencing it during the free trial. RBC\u2019s Narayan said recently that the free trial will help to drive volumes higher in the second quarter. \u201cHigher FSD attach rates are also central to our investment thesis on the stock,\u201d he said. Cathie Wood\u2019s Ark Invest accumulated Tesla shares this week amid their volatility. On Thursday, the firm bought about $14 million worth of the stock, on top of the over $28 million worth of shares it added on Monday. The total purchases for the week amounted to about $42 million. Fisker Sharply Reduces EV Prices: Struggling EV startup Fisker announced this week a sharp reduction in its EV prices. The 2023 Ocean Extreme trim\u2019s manufacturer\u2019s suggested retail price was reduced by $24,000 to $61,499, the Ultra trim\u2019s from $52,999 to $34,999, and the Sport\u2019s from $38,999 to $24,999. \u201cFisker is strategically positioning the all-electric Ocean SUV to be a more affordable and compelling EV choice,\u201d the company said in a statement. The development came amid rumors of the company hurtling toward bankruptcy. After announcing that it was in talks with a major automaker \u2014\u00a0allegedly Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. NSANY \u2014 for a strategic partnership that would include a cash infusion, Fisker hasn\u2019t shared any updates on further progress. Nikola Amid Positive News Flow:  Alternative energy truck maker Nikola Corp. NKLA, which pulled out its battery EV trucks out of the market due to fire incidents, teased their return. \u201cNext stop \u2013 California! Our battery-electric truck is returning to duty as BEV 2.0, heading on a zero-emissions journey provided by the Nikola hydrogen fuel cell electric truck. One truck, two powertrain options,\u201d the company said in a post on X. The company also announced this week the opening of its inaugural HYLA high-pressure modular refueling station and facility in Southern California. Separately, Nikola said Blackjacks Roadhouse\u00a0unveiled Alberta's first commercial hydrogen fueling station, and the project was supported by Nikola\u2019s Canadian subsidiary. Canoo Buys Assets Of Bankrupt Arrival: Canoo Inc. (NASDAQ:\u00a0 GOEV) said it completed the acquisition of a substantial portion of the advanced manufacturing assets that were previously owned by Arrival Automotive UK Limited. The latter filed for bankruptcy in February. Canoo said the purchased assets would be collected into more than 20 containers and shipped by sea to its manufacturing facilities in Oklahoma. In January, the company announced the acquisition of essentially all of the new and like-new assets owned by Arrival Automotive USA, Inc. These assets were transported from Arrival's North Carolina facility and received at Canoo's Oklahoma facility, where commissioning is underway, the lifestyle EV manufacturer said.
