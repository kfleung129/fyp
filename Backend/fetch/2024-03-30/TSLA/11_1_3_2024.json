Key Takeaways Get your free solar installation quote Sunrun earned\u00a04.3 out of 5 stars\u00a0based on our methodology and is our pick for solar leases. Sunrun offers both a\u00a0prepaid\u00a0and\u00a0monthly\u00a0solar lease option, so you can either pay upfront and lock in 25 years of solar savings or pay month by month. You can finance your solar panels with the company\u2019s\u00a0BrightAdvantage\u00a0solar loan program, which requires no upfront costs. We also like that Sunrun offers a wide range of solar services, including EV chargers and backup batteries. Customers also have access to system monitoring. Sunrun offers three financing options: cash purchase, loan or lease. Sunrun customers who left positive reviews wrote about responsive customer service and friendly employees. \u201cMy solar system was connected last week and I couldn\u2019t be happier with the company and its employees. Everyone I dealt with was courteous, efficient and professional. The whole process was so easy. [Sunrun] handled the necessary paperwork, installation and scheduled all of the required inspections. I recommended Sunrun to friends, relatives and neighbors without hesitation. It\u2019s nice to know there are companies that place a priority on customer care, [and] Sunrun is a wonderful example.\u201d\u00a0\u2014Viola U. via the BBB \u201cI\u2019m very happy with my rep that helped throughout the whole process and really liked being able to get answers quickly through a text. Also, I like how [Sunrun] broke down the entire program and helped us understand our arrangement plan.\u201d \u2014Dan Y. via the BBB Unhappy Sunrun customers reported that customer service was slow to respond and resolve system issues. \u201cSunrun has a terrible response time with resolving issues. I am approaching one month with no solar service and have not received notification the problem will be resolved anytime soon. Meanwhile, my utility bill doubled and I still have to pay the monthly lease for a service I am not getting. I wish [Sunrun] would arrive and take [its] equipment so I could join a solar company that is more efficient. I have gone through customer service three times and I still have not heard back in three business days!\u201d \u2014Christoper C. via the BBB A Powerwall costs $11,500 with a solar installation through Tesla. If you want to install a Powerwall onto your existing solar system or are using another solar provider, the cost of a Powerwall without installation is $9,200 (though you\u2019ll still need a Tesla Certified professional to install it). These figures do not account for the 30% federal solar tax credit and other incentives. Of course, how many Powerwalls you buy will determine your final cost. You can add up to 10 Powerwalls to your solar system, but Tesla recommends most homeowners install between two and four units to have enough stored energy during an outage. If you want to go completely off-grid, you may want to consider even more. Most solar installers recommend installing two or three Tesla Powerwalls. The more batteries you install, the longer you\u2019ll be able to power your home with stored energy. Therefore, you can determine how many Powerwalls you need based on your energy consumption and the number of hours or days of backup power you want. You can add a Powerwall (or several) to your Tesla solar roof or any solar panel installation. As you can see in the chart below, the cost of each unit decreases when you purchase more tesla powerwall. The quote you will get for your average cost of a Tesla Powerwall is inclusive of installation pricing. The following prices include installation costs through Tesla and do not reflect solar incentives. The cost of equipment, labor and installation qualify for solar incentives like the federal tax credit, which can significantly lower your final price. You can get an individualized estimate for your Powerwall when you request a solar installation on the Tesla website. If you already have a solar panel system or are installing panels with another solar company, you can still purchase a Tesla Powerwall. The cost of a single Powerwall before installation is $9,200. You can order a Powerwall directly from the Tesla website, but you\u2019ll still need a certified Tesla installer to connect it for you. If your Tesla Powerwall stops working properly and is still under warranty, you can get your battery repaired or replaced at little or no cost. If you\u2019ve had your battery for more than 10 years, you will have to pay for a replacement out-of-pocket. You\u2019ll also have to consider the cost of removing and disposing of your old Powerwall, which could cost several hundred dollars. The Tesla Powerwall is a home battery you can connect to your solar panels to store energy. This highly popular energy storage solution can keep your home running during power outages and allows you to use your own solar energy at night. The Tesla Powerwall is compatible with any brand of solar panels, not just Tesla. You can also retrofit a Powerwall onto an existing solar energy system, so you don\u2019t have to install it concurrently with your panels (although many people do). Tesla produces two types of solar batteries: the Powerwall 2 and the Powerwall+. The main difference is that the Tesla Powerwall+ is both a solar battery and a solar inverter, whereas the Tesla Powerwall 2 is just a battery. A solar inverter is a necessary solar system component that helps generate usable energy from your panels, so which model Powerwall you need will depend on whether you already have an inverter. If you\u2019re unsure which Powerwall model fits your needs, we recommend speaking with your solar installer or a Tesla representative. Compare the specs of each model below: The Powerwall offers a round trip efficiency of 90%, meaning you can use 90% of the energy you put into the battery as energy outputted. With Tesla\u2019s depth of discharge, you can use 100% of the battery\u2019s capacity before recharging it (although not recommended). Unlike the Tesla Powerwall, most solar batteries require a recharge before being completely depleted. There are several major providers that install the Tesla Powerwall, including ADT Solar and Sunrun. Tesla also offers a search tool on its website to find certified installers near you. You can order a Powerwall through the Tesla website. But Tesla \u201chighly recommends\u201d you contact an installer for a quote and to review your design and installation before placing an order. Most installation companies can both order and install your Powerwall for you. You can select one of the following Tesla Powerwall installers below to get started. All Tesla Powerwalls come with a 10-year manufacturer warranty, the industry standard for solar batteries. This warranty has no cycle limit, so it is still valid no matter how many times the battery is charged and discharged. However, the lifespan of a Tesla Powerwall is between 20 and 25 years. Tesla Powerwall Batteries also have a 70% end-of-warranty capacity guarantee, so even after your 10-year warranty ends, your battery will maintain 70% of its capacity. Additionally, Tesla Powerwalls include a four-year workmanship warranty covering labor and shipping costs for repair and replacements. Connecting your Tesla Powerwall to your solar energy system (or another renewable system) qualifies for the 30% federal solar tax credit and most other state and local incentives for solar equipment. Your local Tesla Certified Installer can help you apply for solar rebates and incentives in your area. Keep in mind that the cost of each Powerwall decreases when you buy more than one. For example, a single Powerwall costs $9,200, but if you buy three at once, each unit only costs $8,400.

It is possible to achieve complete energy independence from the electric grid with enough Powerwalls \u2014 even a single Powerwall can power a typical home for several hours. So if you want to achieve energy independence, would like protection from power outages or do not have the benefit of net metering where you live, a Tesla Powewall would be worth it. We recommend speaking with a Tesla installer like ADT Solar or Sunrun\u00a0to help you decide if a Powerwall is worth it for you.  The Tesla Powerwall is a rechargeable lithium-ion battery that uses Nickel Manganese Cobalt (NCM) battery cells. It is similar to the type of battery used in Tesla vehicles. Tesla is now headquartered in Austin, Texas after moving from California in 2021. We closely evaluate solar installation companies with a focus on the factors most important to homeowners like you. We based our solar company methodology on input from multiple homeowner surveys, discussions with industry experts and research into the renewable energy market. Our review process involves assessing each company on the following criteria, which we then use to calculate a rating out of 5 stars. \n\nCost and payment options (20 points): Cost is one of the most important factors when installing a solar energy system. Solar providers that offer cash purchases and in-house loan financing earn full points in this category. Companies also receive bonus points for offering solar panel leasing or power purchase agreements (PPAs).\nServices (20 points): In addition to solar installations, companies offering backup battery and electric vehicle charger installations, energy efficiency audits and system monitoring earn the most points in this category. Companies can also receive points for completing installations in-house, as opposed to using third-party contractors.\nReputation (20 points): To assess the reputation of each company, we consider Google star ratings, Better Business Bureau (BBB) scores and reviews, and NABCEP certification status. We also look at customer complaint rates on sites like the BBB and weigh how the company responds.\nWarranty (15 points): We verify that each company offers workmanship, product and performance warranties on all of its solar installs. A provider earns more points for extending warranties that meet or exceed industry standards, including 10 years for system workmanship and products and 25 years for panel performance.\nCustomer Support (10 points): Solar companies that offer virtual consultations, a mobile app, 24/7 customer support and high customer satisfaction with backend support earn the most points in this category.\nIndustry Experience (10 points): Providers with 10 or more years of experience in the solar installation industry earn a perfect score in this category.\nSustainability (5 points):To measure sustainability, we assess each company based on whether it shares a detailed sustainability statement or ESG disclosures on its website. We also conduct research to see if companies offer end-of-life panel disposal programs or have eco-friendly community partnerships. Faith Wakefield is a writer based in North Carolina.
