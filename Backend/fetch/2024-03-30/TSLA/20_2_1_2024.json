Soon after Tuesday\u2019s ruling about his 2018 salary package \u2014 worth about $51 billion at current stock prices \u2014 Musk put up a\u00a0poll on X asking if Tesla (TSLA) should move its registration from Delaware to Texas, where it is already headquartered. Hours later, the Tesla CEO wrote that the \u201cpublic vote is unequivocally in favor of Texas.\u201d The poll results showed Texas\u00a0had won the backing of more than 87% of about 1.1 million votes.

Someone you\u2019ve probably never heard of It is seen as a desirable place to seek approval for mergers and litigate disputes, and doesn\u2019t levy sales tax or tax on profits from intellectual property. While Musk has not commented directly on the judgment on his pay package, he tweeted\u00a0Tuesday: \u201cNever incorporate your company in the state of Delaware.\u201d \u201cI recommend incorporating in Nevada or Texas if you prefer shareholders to decide matters,\u201d he said in another\u00a0tweet. Attorneys for the Tesla shareholders who brought the suit had argued that the package of stock options was excessive and that the company\u2019s directors were too close to Musk to protect their interests. The 303 million split-adjusted stock options that Musk had received as part of the package are worth $51 billion today, when calculated using Tuesday\u2019s closing price, less the modest exercise price of $23.34 a share. Delaware Chancery Court Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick, who oversaw the bench\u00a0trial that concluded in November 2022, ruled Tuesday\u00a0that Musk and the Tesla board \u201cbore the burden of proving that the compensation plan was fair, and they failed to meet their burden.\u201d Most stock quote data provided by BATS.
