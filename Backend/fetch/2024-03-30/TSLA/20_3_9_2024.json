    "text": "March 09, 2024 Elon Musk, the owner of Tesla and X, has lost\u00a0$40 billion of his net worth in 2024, which is regarded as a crucial fall amongst the world's top 10 rich list. Musk was once the richest man in the world, however, now he ranks at the third place with a net worth of\u00a0$189 billion, as per the Bloomberg Billionaire Index on Saturday. The top place is held by\u00a0Louis Vuitton's Bernard Arnault with a net worth of\u00a0$201 billion. After him, the second place is designated for Jeff Bezos with\u00a0$198 billion net worth. Musk was defeated by Bezos as the latter became the richest man earlier this week, however, he was also replaced by Arnault. The 21% Tesla shares contribute towards a major chunk of Elon Musk's wealth. However, the falling share prices have severely impacted his net worth. Tesla experienced a share-decline of 29%, as the company had disappointing sales in China earlier this week. Moreover, Tesla's factory near Berlin stopped production after witnessing a sabotage. The recent setbacks for Musk also include a court order striking down his $55 billion pay package at Tesla. In addition, a court order striking down Musk's\u00a0$55 billion pay package at Tesla also decreased his wealth. "
