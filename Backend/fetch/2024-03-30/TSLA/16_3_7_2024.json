    "text": "Buyers who approached a federal court alleging that\u00a0Elon Musk-led\u00a0Tesla Inc\u00a0TSLA falsely stated the range of their\u00a0vehicles\u00a0have been recommended to pursue their complaints in individual arbitrations as opposed to a class action lawsuit. What Happened: On purchasing a Tesla car, the drivers entered into an arbitration provision with the EV giant in case of disputes, U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers said, according to a Reuters report. The plaintiffs claimed that Tesla had fraudulently induced consumers to purchase its cars by overstating the distance they could travel on a single charge. The lawsuits also alleged that Tesla misrepresented the driving range on vehicle dashboards. Despite the ruling, Judge Rogers did not dismiss the lawsuits and suggested that she could potentially issue an injunction against Tesla if the drivers successfully arbitrated their claims under California\u2019s unfair competition law and other provisions, according to the report. Why It Matters: Earlier this year, Tesla revised its range estimates for certain variants of Model S, X, and Y, following a new government vehicle-testing regulation requiring automakers to advertise range closer to real-world performance. The range estimates were subsequently lowered, with some vehicles showing as much as a 37-mile drop in range.
