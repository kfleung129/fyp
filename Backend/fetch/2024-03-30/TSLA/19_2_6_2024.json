    "text": "Kimbal Musk, the younger brother of Elon Musk, is a proud owner of multiple Tesla vehicles. He possesses the Model S, Model Y, and Model 3, while also cherishing his first-generation Tesla Roadster. In addition, he has a Cybertruck awaiting him in Austin at the Giga Texas. Interestingly, their father Errol, who resides in South Africa, does not own a Tesla. Kimbal Musk and Elon Musk collaborated on the first-generation Tesla Roadster in the late 2000s. This groundbreaking car propelled the Musk brothers into the A-list category, garnering attention and priority wherever they went. Kimbal Musk shared this anecdote during an interview on the Graham Besinger\u2019s show. To secure financing for the Model S, the brothers had to sell 200 electric vehicles based on the Lotus Elyse. Although they incurred losses on each car sold, the risk was worthwhile. At the time, their startup was experiencing significant financial strain, but they persevered. Despite having slightly different business approaches, it is evident that the two brothers share a similar business model. Kimbal Musk refers to Elon\u2019s views as \u201cstratospheric.\u201d When Elon approached him for financial assistance, Kimbal\u2019s immediate thought was that he would regret not aiding Tesla for the rest of his life. Despite facing potential bankruptcy, he supported the company, and his gamble paid off. Kimbal Musk\u2019s daily driver is the Tesla Model S, primarily due to its size. Standing at 6\u20195\u2033 (1.95 meters), he humorously describes himself as a \u201cgiraffe coming out of a cocoon\u201d when driving the Tesla Roadster. However, this is no longer an issue with the Model S. According to Kimbal Musk, the Model S is not only the best car on the road but also the best in the market since the Ford Model T. His electric sedan is equipped with Full Self-Driving (FSD) capabilities and features a yoke steering wheel. Kimbal confidently predicts that steering wheels will become obsolete within the next five years as cars become fully autonomous. To showcase the impressive capabilities of his Tesla, Kimbal sets it to navigate to one of his restaurants, which is part of a chain operating in Colorado and Chicago. The car effortlessly drives to the desired destination, attentively stopping for pedestrians and safely changing lanes. Kimbal Musk admits feeling astonished whenever he drives a car powered by an internal combustion engine (ICE). He likens the experience to using a Blackberry compared to an iPhone, emphasizing the superiority of electric vehicles. Aside from his ventures in the automotive industry, Kimbal Musk is an avid country music enthusiast. He began playing the guitar at the age of eight and, although he doesn\u2019t write his own songs, he passionately performs Johnny Cash\u2019s music as if it were his own.
