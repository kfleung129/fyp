FAQ - New Privacy Policy 'Varney & Co.' host Stuart Varney discusses the consequences of a Delaware judge striking down Elon Musk's $56 billion compensation package. Billionaire Elon Musk's cybernetic implant company, Neuralink, has changed its location of incorporation from Delaware to Nevada, state records show. The move comes about a week after Musk said Tesla would hold a shareholder vote to transfer its state of incorporation to Texas from Delaware after a judge voided his $56 billion pay package. \"Never incorporate your company in the state of Delaware,\" Musk posted on X, formerly Twitter, after that ruling came down. Neuralink did not immediately respond to FOX Business' request for comment. TESLA TO TEXAS?

In response to that ruling, Musk polled X users, asking, \"Should Tesla change its state of incorporation to Texas, home of its physical headquarters?\" The results of the poll were 87.1% \"Yes\" and 12.9% \"No\" after more than 1.1 million users voted. \"The public vote is unequivocally in favor of Texas!\" Musk declared on Feb.1. \"Tesla will move immediately to hold a shareholder vote to transfer state of incorporation to Texas.\" However, switching the state of incorporation for Tesla could come with hurdles such as investor lawsuits, particularly if it was seen as a move to secure his pay package, legal experts told Reuters.
