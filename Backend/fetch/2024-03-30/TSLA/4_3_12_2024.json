    "text": " Tesla has unveiled a unique offer for its long-term shareholders: an opportunity for early delivery of the much-anticipated Foundation Series Cybertruck. Interested shareholders must sign up here by 11:59 PM CDT on Friday, March 22, 2024, to be eligible for this program. Eligible participants will receive an email with further details prior to delivery. This special offer is limited to one reservation per customer and is currently available only in the United States and Canada. Participants must ensure their Cybertruck reservation is under their name and was made before March 1st, 2024. Additionally, they should not have already taken delivery of a Cybertruck. A critical requirement involves presenting brokerage statements, which must show that the participant owned Tesla (TSLA) shares on February 28, 2021, and held a minimum of 500 TSLA shares on February 29, 2024. At the current price of $178 USD per share, that works out to just under $90,000 USD in market value for 500 shares. Furthermore, Tesla says these statements must verify that, as of February 29, 2024, participants still owned at least half of the TSLA shares they had on February 28, 2021. For verification purposes, these statements should clearly display the participant\u2019s full name, the statement date, and the number of Tesla shares owned, with the allowance to redact all other information.
