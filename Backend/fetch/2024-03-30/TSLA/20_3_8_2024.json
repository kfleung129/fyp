    "text": "  Tesla has removed the rear seats in some France-sold Model Y SUVs so business owners can qualify for a tax loophole. Drivers who own one of the vehicles can take advantage of commercial vehicle taxation that requires participants to drive a utility vehicle in a professional context with two or three seats in the front and zero in the back. Cl\u00e9ment Maguet, a Senior Account Manager at Tesla in France, said: \u201cFrance currently has a fleet of around 6.3 million commercial vehicles, mostly powered by diesel. \u201cFaced with this reality, Tesla has developed a 2-seater Model Y with a storage capacity of 2,158 liters and offers a range of 565 km (351 miles, cycle WLTP); this model is eligible for commercial vehicle taxation. \u201cThis environmentally friendly and efficient solution offers an additional alternative to professional mobility, whether for the transport of goods or as an emergency vehicle,\u201d Teslarati reports.

A more technical description of the law from Manageo reads: \u201cThe purchase of a utility vehicle represents an investment expense for the company. \u201cThe depreciation corresponding to the acquisition may be fully deducted from the taxable income without any cap of any kind.
