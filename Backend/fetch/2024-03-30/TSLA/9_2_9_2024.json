    "text": "Local News Choice Hotels announced a deal with Tesla on Tuesday to install electric vehicle chargers at its hotels nationwide. \u201cThis agreement with Tesla allows our brands to further stand out by increasing access to EV charging for guests and potentially drive incremental topline revenue for hotel owners,\u201d said Dominic Dragisich, Executive Vice President of Operations and Chief Global Brand Officer for the hospitality company. The company said over 40% of its properties offer electric vehicle charging. And expects all of its hotels to offer at least one charging station by the end of the year. Choice Hotels also said its headquarters in Pike & Rose includes charging infrastructure. Consumers can use the Choice Hotels website and app to find properties with charging stations, the company said. Montgomery County leads Maryland in the number of registered electric and plug-in vehicles, according to data from the Maryland Department of Transportation. Choice Hotels moved to North Bethesda from their Rockville Metro Plaza location in 2013. They previously operated out of Silver Spring, and have been Maryland-based since 1968, MoCo360 reported.
