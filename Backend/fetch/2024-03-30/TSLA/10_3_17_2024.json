Fed funds futures say there is a 99% chance that the Federal Open Market Committee keeps interest rates on hold.This past week\u2019s hot inflation data has cemented that belief and put the focus on the Summary of Economic Projections, also known as the dot plot. For now, the market is still pricing in a first quarter-point rate cut in June. But if FOMC members push out their forecasts, the higher-for-longer narrative will gain steam again. Investing Group Leader James A. Kostohryz says based on the February CPI, \"the Fed needs to seriously increase the hawkish tone of its communications in order to dampen expectations regarding the timing and extent of Fed rate cuts in 2024.\"Along with the Fed, there will be a host of housing numbers to consider. The NAHB Housing Market Index for March, the February starts and permits figures and February existing home sales are all due.
