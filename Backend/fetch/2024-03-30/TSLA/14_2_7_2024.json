    "text": "Ford CEO Jim Farley noted during the automaker\u2019s Q4 2023 earnings call that the company has a dedicated \u201cskunkworks\u201d team that has been developing a new electric vehicle platform focused on cost reduction. Recent reports have now indicated that Ford\u2019s skunkworks team is being led by an alumni from Tesla, Alan Clarke. Clarke\u2019s position in Ford\u2019s EV skunkworks team was initially mentioned in a\u00a0TechCrunch\u00a0report. A look at Clarke\u2019s LinkedIn page seems to confirm his role in the veteran automaker, as he is currently listed as an Executive Director Advanced EV Development at Ford. Clarke\u2019s LinkedIn page indicates that he had worked at Tesla for over 12 years, starting as a Senior Design Engineer in September 2009 and departing the automaker in January 2022 as a Director of New Programs Engineering. Considering his long tenure at the Elon Musk-led electric vehicle maker, Clarke definitely seems to be a good fit to lead Ford\u2019s EV skunkworks team. Apart from Clarke\u2019s tenure at Tesla,\u00a0TechCrunch\u2018s report also noted that Ford\u2019s skunkworks team includes engineers from Auto Motive Power (AMP), which was acquired by the veteran automaker in November 2023. Interestingly enough, AMP founder Anil Paryani is also an alumnus of Tesla. Paryani\u2019s LinkedIn page indicates that he worked for Tesla as a Senior Engineer for over five years, from September 2007 to March 2013. The role of Ford\u2019s EV skunkworks team is expected to be substantial in the coming years. As noted by Farley during Ford\u2019s Q4 2023 earnings call, the company\u2019s Gen 2 electric vehicles would be designed to reach profitability in the first 12 months of their launch. This should help make Ford\u2019s electric vehicle business more profitable, and thus, more sustainable. \u201cWe made a bet in silence two years ago. We developed a super-talented skunkworks team to create a low-cost EV platform. It was a small group, small team, some of the best EV engineers in the world, and it was separate from the Ford mothership. It was a startup. And they\u2019ve developed a flexible platform that will not only deploy to several types of vehicles but will be a large installed base for software and services that we\u2019re now seeing at Pro,\u201d Farley said.
