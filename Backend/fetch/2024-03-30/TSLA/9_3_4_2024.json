Tesla sold 60,365 China-made vehicles in February, down 19%\nfrom a year earlier and the lowest since December 2022,\naccording to data from China Passenger Car Association. China's Lunar New Year holidays fell in February, reducing\ncar purchasing activities. Tesla is also battling rising\ncompetition from Chinese rivals such as BYD. Tesla, which in January cut prices on some models in China,\nlast week unveiled new incentives including insurance subsidies\nto woo consumers in the world's largest auto market.
