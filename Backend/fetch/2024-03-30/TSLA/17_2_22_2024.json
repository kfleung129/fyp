    "text": "The latest news to hit Tesla\u2019s TSLA stock is that Ford F is cutting prices on its 2023 Mustang Mach E crossover by anywhere from $3,100 to $8,100, depending on the version. With all the price cuts on EVs, it\u2019s a great time to buy one, but the TSLA stock analysis suggests it\u2019s not so good for EV stocks. Tesla might have been the first company to lower prices, but it\u2019s got plenty of company. \u201cThis year also marks the beginning of a fierce competition that may end in a \u2018bloodbath\u2019 (or as I prefer to call it, the brutal \u2018knockout round\u2019) among Chinese auto makers,\u201d Xiaopeng wrote in the employee memo,\u201d CNBC reported CEO He Xiaopeng\u2019s comments in a memo to employees.\u00a0\u201cXPeng has engaged in this cutthroat competition right from the outset, thus accumulating considerable experience. Our guts, grit and perseverance, I firmly believe, will lead us to victory.\u201d Bring it on, Tesla, Xiaopeng appears to be saying. That\u2019s terrible news for Tesla shareholders.\u00a0You might want to hold tight if you\u2019re considering buying TSLA stock. Here\u2019s why. Cybertruck: A Bridge Too Far I recently argued that Nio\u2019s NIO expansion plan made no sense, given it already had nine models compared to five for Tesla. From Tesla\u2019s perspective, it\u2019s made money by keeping its model number low and its margins high. Of course, with the slashing of prices, Tesla\u2019s Q4\u00a02023 operating margin fell by 50% to 8%. Wall Street expects it won\u2019t be much better in the first quarter, coming in at 9%, well below its 2022 level of 17%. There is no question Elon Musk believes that a prolonged price war with its competitors in China will enable it to capture future market share as its competitors go out of business. So far, that hasn\u2019t happened with Xpeng and others following Tesla down the price-cutting hole. I suspect that Tesla\u2019s undoing won\u2019t be because of price cuts. Instead, it will be the Cybertruck that takes it down. In terms of vehicle development, it is a bridge too far. Recently, Cybertruck owners posted photos of the truck rusting on social media. That\u2019s not a good look for a vehicle that can cost $100,000 and looks anything but attractive. Tesla employee Wes Morrill suggested the photos showed \u201crust dust,\u201d that had collected on the vehicle as they transported it to its final destination. One can use a blue, non-scratch Scotch Brite pad to wipe it off. Maybe so, but I\u2019ve always wondered why Tesla went with such a wild-looking vehicle when the most popular type in America is the crossover SUV, which accounts for more than 45% of all vehicles sold. If price cuts were inevitable, it would have been helpful to use lower prices for an affordable crossover SUV, not an expensive, ugly monster truck with limited appeal and demographics. TSLA Stock Analysis: Cybertruck Is a Drag It would be different if the EV market were going gangbusters right now. That\u2019s not the case with companies worldwide unloading excess inventory because of lower demand caused by higher interest rates. Wall Street often talks about \u201ccatalysts\u201d for moving stocks higher. Tangible information and news that suggests revenue and profit growth are on the horizon. Gabelli Funds portfolio manager Brian Sponheimer recently told Yahoo Finance that now is not a good time to buy EV stocks. \u201cWe are value investors, and while the automakers are statistically inexpensive, investors face prospects for considerable CAPEX, reduced margins, and an uncertain outcome as it relates to electric vehicle market share,\u201d\u00a0Sponheimer recently told Yahoo Finance. With Tesla trading at 200x earnings, Sponheimer suggests that Tesla\u2019s too expensive right now for value investors like himself. That doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t consider TSLA stock at current prices because the future looks bright for EV development. However, despite Tesla being down 22% in the first two months of 2024, it needs to fall further for Sponheimer to think about buying. I\u2019m neither buying nor selling TSLA stock at the moment. If you own it, don\u2019t sell it. If you don\u2019t, according to my TSLA stock analysis, wait for a better entry point.
