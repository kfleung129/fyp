In a Wednesday post, Tesla CEO Musk seemed unreasonably invested in how Scott has been spending the billions she was awarded in her 2019 divorce from Amazon founder Bezos. Responding to an X user whining about Scott donating to organizations that focus on \u201cissues of race and/or gender,\u201d Musk declared, \u201cSuper rich ex-wives who hate their former spouse\u201d should \u201cbe listed among \u2018Reasons that Western Civilization died.\u2019\u201d By Thursday morning, the thrice-divorced father of eleven\u2019s post had been removed, but was still available to be seen\u00a0via the Internet Archive\u2019s Wayback Machine. This wasn\u2019t the first time Musk appears to have projected his anxieties onto Scott. In a 2022 tweet explaining why he planned to vote Republican, Musk accused Democrats of being cold to his businesses due to the influence of\u00a0\u201cMackenzie\u2019s donation to PACs posing as charities.\u201d Suggesting her philanthropy was motivated by spite in another post, Musk said, \u201cIt\u2019s safe to say that Mackenzie [ahem] Scott is not exactly a big fan of her ex-husband.\u201d Painting himself as collateral damage, he added, \u201cUnfortunately, a lot of others are getting caught in the crossfire.\u201d Last December, Scott announced she had donated a total of $2.1 billion across 360 organizations during 2023. The list of organizations reveals a wide range of missions and includes groups that focus on early learning, access to affordable housing, race and gender equity, health equity, civic and social engagement and more.
