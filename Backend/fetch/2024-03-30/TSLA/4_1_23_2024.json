    "text": "Tesla\u2019s self-described ChatGPT moment may finally have arrived\u2014but prepare to be underwhelmed. Last spring, Elon Musk promised Tesla vehicles across the country would soon come to life and drive themselves with no one behind the wheel, causing them to quintuple in value as they earned money driving taxi passengers around while their owners slept. \u201cI think Tesla will have sort of a ChatGPT moment\u2014maybe if not this year, I\u2019d say no later than next year,\u201d he told CNBC\u2019s David Faber following the company\u2019s annual shareholder meeting. \u201cSuddenly 3 million cars will be able to drive themselves.\u201d This bold prediction is now being put to the test. On Monday, the latest version of his Full Self-Driving software was shipped to select U.S. customers in a very limited release right before Tesla\u2019s quarterly earnings call with investors this week. This iteration, v12, is unique in that Musk promised FSD would finally graduate from its incomplete designation after\u00a0more than three years\u00a0of \u201cbeta\u201d testing on U.S. roads. \u201cVersion 12 won\u2019t be beta,\u201d he stated in\u00a0late June. Well, it\u2019s finally arrived, but thus far it looks as if Musk may have once again overpromised and underdelivered. One of the select early recipients, a San Francisco\u2013based Tesla influencer by the name of Omar Qazi, said engineers warned him it was still a \u201crough early build.\u201d After initial testing, the man behind the Whole Mars Catalog account\u2014with nearly 420,000 followers on Musk\u2019s X\u2014estimated on Monday it would not likely be given wide release in the U.S. until March. \u201cThere\u2019s major improvements in virtually every aspect people care about,\u201d Qazi told a Spaces, before adding, \u201cit\u2019s not really ready for the public.\u201d FSD Beta 12 showcases the impressive capability of the new end to end design, but still has a few rough edges. Expecting wide release in february or march What he did not say, however, is that it improved enough to handle driving in well over 99.99% of the cases, generally considered the level of reliability needed before a vehicle can drive without a human chaperone behind the wheel at all times. And that is the risk\u2014that Musk\u2019s \u201cChatGPT moment\u201d fizzles, because v12 will not shed its beta designation. Or if it does lose the beta label, it is only because the original goal of a fully autonomous robo-taxi worth five times the car\u2019s purchase price has quietly been buried. \u201cPlease slow down the FSDBeta v12 enthusiasm,\u201d cautioned Chuck Cook, a respected FSD driver in the Tesla community known for posting videos of\u00a0unprotected turns. \u201cDon\u2019t project autonomy on this build yet.\u201d FSD was once the company\u2019s calling card, justifying Musk\u2019s back-of-the-envelope-math $1 trillion valuation. But after revelations emerged that the 2016 video that launched Tesla\u2019s ambitions was\u00a0dishonestly staged, customers have grown\u00a0increasingly disillusioned\u00a0that Musk\u00a0will ever deliver\u00a0on his promise. Tellingly, he\u00a0dropped his asking price\u00a0by $3,000 after long predicting it would only ever rise. During the October Q3 investor call, Musk went so far as to play up the credentials of his creation by calling FSD nothing less than a rudimentary form of artificial general intelligence. Please slow down the FSDBeta v12 enthusiasm.  It will be great to see it come to fruition.  But it will be an evolution from v11.  I don't have it yet, but I can predict where it will be \u2026. Better .. maybe smoother .. but don't project autonomy on this build yet. \u201cIt\u2019s basically\u00a0baby AGI. It has to understand reality in order to drive\u2014baby AGI,\u201d he explained. Not even Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, has described ChatGPT in such a fashion. Yet Musk asserts that when it comes to functionality outside of predictive speech using large language models,\u00a0no one beats his company. \u201cTesla has the best real-world AI team on earth, period,\u201d he told investors in October. \u201cAnd it\u2019s getting better.\u201d But the narrative has begun to tire for many now, and Tesla stock is down 16% since the year began. Even as many of its peers notch new all-time highs, Tesla has traded sideways on balance since December 2020. More importantly, many investors\u00a0regret missing out\u00a0on AI chipmaker Nvidia tripling in value, because their money was tied up in Tesla stock. At this point, Musk will need to show his AI team really is as good as he claims by finally delivering on his ChatGPT moment. Otherwise, he risks more investors losing their faith. \u00a9 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.
