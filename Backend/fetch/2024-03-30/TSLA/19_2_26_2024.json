In addition to weighing in on the hot-button issue of immigration, in recent\u00a0months, Musk has replied to and engaged with accounts that post about racial IQ gaps and other data related to race. Will Stancil, a metro policy researcher, pointed out that Musk has had frequent interactions with an account named\u00a0@eyeslasho. The anonymous account has dozens of posts about IQ test scores by racial group, crime rates by race and more. Musk has replied to the account about 20 times, all in the last few months, according to X\u2019s advanced search. Musk\u2019s replies include exclamation points, \u201cWell said\u201d and more. \u201cRace gaps in IQ exist (scientific consensus), IQ at an individual level has predictive validity for important outcomes (100s of supporting studies), only 16% of group diff researchers believe gaps contain no genetic influence,\u201d @eyeslasho posted two weeks ago. However, scientists who study genetics disagree with the claim that genetics are the determining factor in IQ or intelligence. Sasha Gusev, a statistical geneticist at Harvard Med School, outlines data that shows that IQ scores and intelligence appear to be less influenced by genetics as research improves and more data is considered. \u201cSo we've gone from 51% to 20% to 14% as the field has learned how to apply these methods more precisely and address confounding,\u201d Gusev said in a thread about the data related to genetics and IQ scores.

Musk replied with a simple exclamation point to the post, amplifying the post\u2019s reach to Musk\u2019s large audience on X.com. Musk has also come under recent fire for multiple reports regarding his illegal drug use. Some of the reports even allege that board members, including Larry Ellison, urged Musk to travel to Hawaii to do a \u201cdry out\u201d from his drug usage. Other friends encouraged Musk to attend some sort of rehab, according to The Wall Street Journal. Tesla\u2019s board of directors has also been silent regarding Musk\u2019s $55 billion compensation package, which was shot down by a Delaware court last month. Ross Gerber, a fund manager, called out Tesla\u2019s board of directors on CNBC earlier this month and argued that some should be replaced with independent members who do not have financial ties to Musk. Other investors, like hedge funder, Tom Hearden, also spoke out against Tesla\u2019s leadership.\u00a0\u201cZERO response from the $TSLA BOD and Chairman regarding multiple published accounts of the CEO's drug use, the Delaware case, or reporting of board member's conflicts and drug use with the CEO,\u201d Hearden posted on X. \u201cIt certainly bolsters the case that it's an impotent and beholden board.\u201d Price Action: Tesla\u2019s board is under scrutiny as the company\u2019s stock has struggled throughout the last few months. While the overall stock market is hitting new all-time highs, Tesla\u2019s stock is down more than 50% from its all-time highs. The S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY is up more than 4% since the start of 2024. Tesla\u2019s stock is down almost 20% in that same time frame.
