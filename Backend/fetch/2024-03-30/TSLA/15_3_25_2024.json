    "text": "Tesla (TSLA) shares rose by nearly 700% in 2020, and the year was capped off by their entry into the S&P 500. The \u201cludicrous speed\u201d continued into 2021 \u2014 where shares went up another 18%. That means the automaker\u2019s price-to-earnings ratio is an eye-rubbing, nose-bleeding 1,601. For context, the P/E of the S&P 500 is 30, itself, well above the historical average of 15. The next-highest tech valuation in the index belongs to Western Digital (WDC), with a P/E of 860. All of which is to say Tesla might be a bubble. Rob Arnott, founder and CEO of giant investment advisor Research Affiliates, certainly thinks so. He spoke to Yahoo Finance about the \u201cheroin-like\u201d monetary and fiscal stimulus that has found its way into stocks, creating bubbles. His prime example is Tesla. \u201cWhen you have Tesla trading for more than the entire rest of the auto industry, excluding companies that deal exclusively in electric vehicles... what you\u2019re looking at is an extraordinary spread in valuations,\u201d he said. First, it\u2019s important to define a bubble, he said. He and colleagues did so in a 2018 article, which he boiled down in an interview: \u201cOne, you\u2019d have to use implausible assumptions in a discounted cash flow model or some similar model for valuation \u2014 implausible assumptions to justify today\u2019s price. Part two of the definition \u2014 the marginal buyer doesn\u2019t use those tools and doesn\u2019t care about them,\u201d he said. That is, they\u2019re buying because they believe in the story to the exclusion of the numbers. Of course, there are plenty of Tesla bulls who don\u2019t consider their assumptions to be implausible. One of them is Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, who expects the company\u2019s production to reach 1 million vehicles annually by 2022. Last week, he raised his price target on the stock to $950, with a \u201cbull-case\u201d target of $1,250 a share. The cornerstone of that case is demand in China, where Tesla on Tuesday began deliveries of its Model Y. Arnott doesn\u2019t argue that investors need to avoid Tesla, and said he\u2019s using it as an \u201cillustrative example. I don\u2019t mean to single it out. There\u2019s lots of bubbles percolating right now.\u201d The challenge, he said, is to be prepared for the inevitable burst. \u201cIf you want to buy Tesla, buy Tesla,\u201d Arnott said. \u201cHave an exit strategy. Have a reason in mind in advance for what\u2019s going to cause you to sell.\u201d Julie Hyman is the co-anchor of Yahoo Finance Live, weekdays 9am-11am ET.
