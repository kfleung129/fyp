    "text": "Elon Musk\u2019s $55 billion pay package at Tesla Inc. was struck down by a Delaware judge after a shareholder challenged it as excessive, a ruling that would take a giant bite out of Musk\u2019s wealth and put the fate of his companies in question. That is if the ruling survives a likely appeal. The\u00a0decision\u00a0Tuesday, which amounts to his first major loss in court, means that more than five years after the electric carmaker\u2019s co-founder was granted the largest executive compensation plan in history, Tesla\u2019s board will have to start over and come up with a new proposal. Musk never attempted to exercise his options since they\u2019d been challenged in Delaware Chancery Court. Tesla\u2019s share price slid about 3% in after-hours trading on the news. Musk has repeatedly urged Tesla\u2019s board to arrange another massive stock award for him, years after he sold a significant chunk of his shares in the company to acquire Twitter. The billionaire has said he needs a bigger stake in Tesla to maintain control of the electric-car maker and expand further into artificial intelligence.

Worth some $51.1 billion, the options were one of his most valuable assets. Without them his net worth would drop to $154.3 billion, making him the third-richest person in the world after spending most of the past couple of years as No. 1, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Evan Chesler, Musk\u2019s New York-based lawyer, didn\u2019t immediately respond to an email and a call seeking comment late Tuesday on the decision. Following a trial that ended more than a year ago, Delaware Chancery Court Chief Judge Kathaleen St. J. McCormick sided with an investor who complained Tesla directors didn\u2019t make proper disclosures about the 2018 executive compensation package and the performance benchmarks required of Musk. She also found that conflicts of interest marred the board\u2019s consideration of the pay plan. \u201cIn the final analysis, Musk launched a self-driving process, recalibrating the speed and direction along the way as he saw fit,\u201d the judge wrote in a 200-page ruling. \u201cThe process arrived at an unfair price. And through this litigation, the plaintiff requests a recall.\u201d Musk, 52, has topped Bloomberg\u2019s wealth list thanks to his stake in Tesla, the world\u2019s most valuable auto company. The stock options from his compensation plan have vested in increments over the past few years as performance targets were achieved, but he hasn\u2019t exercised any of the options, regulatory filings show. The billionaire was quick to react to the ruling on his social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter. He recommended \u201cincorporating in Nevada or Texas if you prefer shareholders to decide matters.\u201d Never incorporate your company in the state of Delaware Musk, who prides himself on snubbing corporate norms, has usually prevailed in court battles, including a shareholder suit over his acquisition of renewable-power provider SolarCity. In the compensation case, lawyers for Tesla shareholder Richard Tornetta argued board members failed to exercise independence as they drew up the pay package for the company\u2019s chief executive officer and allowed him to improperly engineer the details of his pay plan to his liking. Musk dictated the \u201cframework and financial terms, which remained fundamentally unchanged\u201d throughout the board\u2019s approval process, Tornetta\u2019s lawyers argued in briefs. In her decision, McCormick noted that Musk acknowledged he was basically \u201cnegotiating against myself\u201d in the back-and-forth over his pay. \u201cThe most striking omission from the process is the absence of any evidence of adversarial negotiations between the board and Musk concerning the size of the grant,\u201d the judge wrote. The decision was delayed, in part, by the judge\u2019s back surgery last year. Musk\u2019s defense failed to explain why the \u201chistorically unprecedented compensation plan\u201d was necessary to motivate the CEO to achieve \u201ctransformative growth.\u201d Musk had no intention of leaving Tesla, and his ownership stake was sufficient motivation to keep him focused on growth, the judge said. \u201cSwept up by the rhetoric of \u2018all upside,\u2019 or perhaps starry eyed by Musk\u2019s superstar appeal, the board never asked the $55.8 billion question: Was the plan even necessary for Tesla to retain Musk and achieve its goals?\u201d she wrote. During an earnings call last week, Musk was persistent in his pursuit for a bigger stake in Tesla, portraying the issue as all about his command of the carmaker rather than money. \u201cI don\u2019t want to control it, but if I have so little influence at the company at this stage, I could be voted out by some random shareholder advisory firm,\u201d he said.

It remains unclear whether Musk will appeal Tuesday\u2019s ruling or Tesla\u2019s board will draw up a new pay package. Musk has spent years\u2014and pledged a large part of his wealth\u2014in pursuit of his ambitions to go to Mars through SpaceX, which has become the world\u2019s second-most valuable startup and a juggernaut in the commercial space industry. He vowed to use options from the 2018 package to fund the Mars colonization if it was upheld. \u201cColonizing Mars is an expensive endeavor,\u201d the judge wrote. \u201cMusk believes he has a moral obligation to direct his wealth toward that goal, and Musk views his compensation from Tesla as a means of bankrolling that mission.\u201d Read More: What Elon Musk Really Believes In a post on Twitter in 2018, he said \u201cabout half my money is intended to help problems on Earth & half to help establish a self-sustaining city on Mars to ensure continuation of life (of all species) in case Earth gets hit by a meteor like the dinosaurs or WW3 happens & we destroy ourselves.\u201d The case is Tornetta v.
