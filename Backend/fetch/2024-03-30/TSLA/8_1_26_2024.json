    "text": "Although Tesla Inc.\u2019s stock already took a sound beating after yet another disappointing earnings report this week, one analyst believes it wasn\u2019t punished nearly enough. The EV giant\u2019s stock \n        TSLA,\n        -2.25%\n       had tumbled 12.1% on Thursday, after the company reported a fourth-quarter profit and revenue miss and provided a downbeat 2024 outlook late Wednesday. That marked the fourth straight quarter the stock has suffered sharp one-day post-earnings-report selloffs; the stock has dropped an average of 10.2% on those days. Read: \u2018Train wreck\u2019 earnings call has even the bulls begging Tesla\u2019s executives to behave like adults. But as longtime bear J.P. Morgan analyst Ryan Brinkman said, even after Thursday\u2019s selloff, \u201cthe stock to us seems in comparison to have hardly noticed,\u201d which to him suggests \u201cplenty of further downside potential.\u201d He reiterated the underweight rating he\u2019s had on Tesla\u2019s stock for at least the past three years, and trimmed his price target to $130 from $135. The new target implies 29% downside from Thursday\u2019s closing price of $182.63. The stock bounced 1.2% in morning trading Friday. Brinkman\u2019s biggest beef is that investors haven\u2019t \u201ccriticized\u201d Tesla\u2019s stock enough for its strategy to cut prices, and sacrifice profit for vehicle sales. When traditional automakers did the same thing in the past, Brinkman noted they were \u201crightly criticized,\u201d as discounting and \u201cdumping\u201d vehicles into rental car fleets to boost sales in effect destroyed residual values of used vehicles, future vehicle margins and brand equity.

The stock rocketed 101.7% in 2023, even as the FactSet consensus for 2024 net income sank 45%, to $13.65 billion at the end of 2023 from $24.94 billion at the end of 2022. The consensus has fallen further in January, to $11.35 billion. And Brinkman argues that since October 2022, when 2024 profit expectations peaked just before Tesla adopted the price-cutting strategy, the stock has roughly been little changed while profit expectations have tumbled about 60%. Brinkman is certainly in the minority on Wall Street, as only seven of the 49 analysts surveyed by FactSet who cover Tesla are bearish. Among the others, 19 are bullish and 22 are neutral. Meanwhile, the average stock price target of those surveyed is $221.25, which implies 23% upside from Thursday\u2019s close, and is 70% above Brinkman\u2019s target. Tesla\u2019s stock has declined 10.1% over the past three months, while Global X Autonomous & Electric Vehicles ETF \n        DRIV\n       has gained 10.1% and the S&P 500 index \n        SPX\n       has advanced 18.5%. In 2021, Glen Taylor agreed to sell the Minnesota franchise for $1.5 billion. The team is now likely worth at least $2.5 billion.
