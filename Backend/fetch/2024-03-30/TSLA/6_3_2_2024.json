    "text": "It\u2019s a strange sight: Ford F-150 Lightning trucks and Mustang Mach-E crossovers lined up at a Tesla Supercharger, plugged into the familiar red-and-white posts. After years of driving a Model 3, and greeting only other Teslas at our charging stops, I can\u2019t quite get used to the visual. Yet I must, because a new phase of EV charging has arrived. In the year-plus since Tesla transformed its proprietary plug into an open standard and invited the other automakers to adopt it, they did. Company after company pledged to adopt the renamed North American Charging Standard (which has since been given the technical name J3400) over the tech they\u2019d been using, which would allow their EV customers to use Tesla\u2019s bigger and more reliable network of fast chargers. This week, Ford, the first company to go all-in with Tesla\u2019s plug, gained access to the Supercharger network. Around 15,000 Tesla chargers will be compatible with Ford EVs and will show up as part of the BlueOval charging network that appears in the cars\u2019 infotainment screens. The Detroit giant is helping out its early adopters by offering free adapters that would normally cost more than $200, at least for now. (Future Fords will be built with the NACS plug and require no dongle). With many more brands to follow Ford\u2019s lead, we\u2019re about to see Supercharger access change America\u2019s charging dynamic in several ways. For one thing, buying a non-Tesla EV just got more appealing. Loren McDonald, CEO of the analyst website EVAdoption, says horror stories about busted third-party chargers or the lack of sufficient plugs have dissuaded many on-the-fence drivers from going electric. When he asked his own brother-in-law, who wasn\u2019t a total stranger to electrics, about switching to an EV, the reply was: So if I take that road trip across Idaho, I've heard there's no place to charge. And what if I run out of battery? \u201cI think that was really eye-opening for me,\u201d he says. Tesla, meanwhile, has held a sales advantage thanks to the closed access of Superchargers. Lots of buyers, myself included, bought a Tesla over another EV because its network was vast, fast, and reliable, which made it possible to drive an electric vehicle as the primary or only car. Once Ford EVs (or Rivians, or Chevys, or Hyundais) can use the Tesla network, too, those cars suddenly become more viable options. Just look at Tesla\u2019s updated website and check out all the Supercharger locations suddenly open to other cars with NACS plugs. It might be annoying for Tesla drivers like me to give up our exclusivity; I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll mutter under my breath the first time I wait for an F-150 to finish charging. But it\u2019s certainly good for electrification at large if expanded plug access gives more people the confidence to go electric. Tesla, of course, isn\u2019t opening its network out of the goodness of its heart. Even as the company loses its dominant market share in EVs, its triumph in the charging standard wars means that Elon Musk\u2019s company gains new customers who\u2019ll be paying Tesla for electricity. Ford sold more than 70,000 EVs in 2023, for example, all of whom became potential Supercharger users this week. With NACS having succeeded in becoming the industry standard, we\u2019re talking about millions of vehicles around the world ready to buy Tesla\u2019s power. Those new customers might be paying extra, too. Electrek reports that Tesla is charging Ford drivers a 30% premium per kilowatt hour. Ford owners can get around that fee by purchasing a $12.99 per month Supercharger subscription that would see them pay the same kWh price as Tesla drivers. Of course, that model incentivizes those drivers to subscribe indefinitely and to maximize their investment by choosing Superchargers as often as possible. Fortunately, the new charging paradigm could benefit those who don\u2019t care to pay for yet another subscription. Ford\u2019s electric drivers could get along just fine by doing nearly all their charging at home or at stations run by Electrify America or EVgo. Then, if they need a little juice somewhere with only a Tesla supercharger, they could pay a premium and be on their way. On the other hand, Tesla\u2019s new power in the charging market means it could go the other direction, too \u2014 say, by starting a price war like it did in the EV market, which kneecapped the profitability of EV efforts by traditional carmakers like Ford. Once again, it\u2019s Tesla\u2019s competitors who might be in trouble.
