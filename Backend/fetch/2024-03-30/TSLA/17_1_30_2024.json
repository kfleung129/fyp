    "text": " Profile Sections tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News There are no new alerts at this time A Delaware judge on Tuesday voided the $56 billion pay package of\u00a0Tesla\u00a0CEO\u00a0Elon Musk, ruling that the company\u2019s board of directors failed to prove \u201cthat the compensation plan was fair.\u201d Tesla\u2019s share price slid about 3% in after-hours trading Tuesday following news of the decision in the Delaware Chancery Court lawsuit filed by Richard Tornetta, a shareholder in the electric automaker. The pay package that Tesla granted Musk in 2018 was the\u00a0largest compensation plan\u00a0in public corporate history, the judge noted, making the Tesla and SpaceX boss a centi-billionaire and the richest person on the planet. The plan offered Musk the chance to secure 12 tranches of Tesla stock options, which would vest if the company\u2019s market capitalization increased by $50 billion and Tesla achieved a revenue target. \u201cWas the richest person in the world overpaid?\u201d asked Chancery Court Judge Kathaleen McCormick in her 200-page ruling. \u201cThe stockholder plaintiff in this derivative lawsuit says so. He claims that Tesla, Inc.\u2019s directors breached their fiduciary duties by awarding Elon Musk a performance-based equity-compensation plan.\u201d In her decision, McCormick found that Tornetta had proved that Musk \u201ccontrolled Tesla,\u201d and that the process leading to the board\u2019s approval of his compensation was \u201cdeeply flawed.\u201d Musk had \u201cextensive ties with the persons tasked with negotiating on Tesla\u2019s behalf,\u201d including management members who were beholden to Musk: among them General Counsel Todd Maron, who was his former divorce attorney. \u201cIn the final analysis, Musk launched a self-driving process, recalibrating the speed and direction along the way as he saw fit, the judge wrote. \u201cThe process arrived at an unfair price. And through this litigation, the plaintiff requests a recall.\u201d \u201cThe plaintiff is entitled to rescission,\u201d McCormick wrote. \u201cThe parties are to confer on a form of final order implementing this decision and submit a joint letter identifying all issues, including fees that need to be addressed to bring this matter to a conclusion at the trial level,\u201d McCormick said. Musk, his lawyer and Tornetta\u2019s attorney did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the decision. In a tweet Tuesday afternoon, Musk wrote, \u201cNever incorporate your company in the state of Delaware.\u201d McCormick noted her ruling hinged on a finding that Musk, rather than its board of directors and shareholders, controlled Tesla, at least when it came to the question of setting his compensation. The judge wrote, \u201cIn addition to his 21.9% equity stake, Musk was the paradigmatic \u2018Superstar CEO,\u2019 who held some of the most influential corporate positions (CEO, Chair, and founder), enjoyed thick ties with the directors tasked with negotiating on behalf of Tesla, and dominated the process that led to board approval of his compensation plan.\u201d Tesla and Musk\u2019s attorneys, the court decided, \u201cwere unable to prove that the stockholder vote was fully informed because the proxy statement inaccurately described key directors as independent and misleadingly omitted details about the process.\u201d Earlier this month, Musk began angling for 25% of\u00a0voting\u00a0control over Tesla. He currently owns about 13% of the company\u2019s stock outright. \u201cI am uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in AI & robotics without having ~25% voting control. Enough to be influential, but not so much that I can\u2019t be overturned,\u201d he wrote in a post on X, the social media site formerly known as Twitter. Musk owns X and runs it. \u00a9\u00a02024 NBC UNIVERSAL "
