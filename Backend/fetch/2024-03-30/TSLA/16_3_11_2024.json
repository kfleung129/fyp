    "text": "Tesla Inc. is likely years away from fully ramping a new lower-cost model, which will take the company longer than Wall Street is assuming, Evercore analysts said after touring the carmaker\u2019s Texas factory. \u201cTesla increasingly is a \u20182027 story,\u2019\u201d Evercore analysts led by Chris McNally wrote in a report Monday. He questioned whether the best-case scenario for a cheaper vehicle colloquially referred to as Model 2 is more like 500,000 units in 2026, rather than consensus for 1 million-plus. McNally has the equivalent of a hold recommendation on Tesla and hasn\u2019t rated the company a buy since he initiated coverage in January 2020, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The stock has risen 310% in that span. Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk has said Tesla is \u201cbetween two major growth waves,\u201d with the first underpinned by the Model 3 sedan and Model Y crossover, and the second expected from a cheaper next-generation electric vehicle. The company expects to start production of this EV toward the end of 2025 at its plant in Austin. The next-gen model\u2019s bill of materials will decline from $28,000 to $20,000, and likely have around 250 miles of range and no glass roof, McNally wrote. A \u201cbig debate\u201d will be whether Tesla\u2019s driver-assistance hardware will be standard, he said, citing his team\u2019s belief that the hardware could cost $2,000 to $3,000. Evercore now expects Tesla to deliver around 2.7 million vehicles in 2026, meaning its estimate for earnings per share that year is 18% to 20% below consensus. \u00a9 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.
