    "text": "Billionaire Elon Musk has made some mistakes in his career. Some would count the purchase of Twitter \u2014 and subsequent renaming of the beloved platform as \u201cX,\u201d as one of his biggest. His frequent social media rants, ignoring Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations and smoking a joint live on a podcast also rank up there with potential mistakes the richest man in the world may (or may not) regret.

After all, during his May 2021 monologue on \u2018Saturday Night Live,\u2019 Musk said, \u201cI re-invented electric cars and I\u2019m sending people to Mars in a rocket ship. Did you also think I was gonna be a chill, normal dude?\u201d That said, despite his many faux pas, brushes with legal action and impulsive behaviors, there are some things you can learn from Musk, including which investment strategies and regrets to avoid.

The Tesla Roadster fell short of expectations in the company\u2019s earlier years, prompting BBC broadcaster Jeremy Clarkson to describe it as \u201ca poorly-run science project,\u201d according to in.investing.com. It\u2019s never a good idea to invest in companies that manufacture sub-par products. Tesla stock took a dive following the launch and nearly went bankrupt. However, those who invested in Tesla\u2019s earlier years, when the IPO launched at $17 per share, would be sitting pretty today. If you invested $10,000 during the IPO and held tight through ups, downs, and two splits, you\u2019d have an investment of roughly $1.7 million (at $194 per share) today. That\u2019s largely because Musk learned from his mistakes and went on to create EVs of the highest quality and continues to innovate in the industry. Investing in Tesla back then was a tremendous risk. Yet one of Musk\u2019s favorite and most famous quotes offers a bit of investing advice that applies to the situation: \u201cWhen something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor.\u201d Musk believes that saving the planet \u2014 and escaping the planet via SpaceX \u2014 are both important enough to risk it all. Taking calculated risks in investing, especially when it\u2019s a company you believe in, can pay off. Of course, rather than flailing blindly into any investment that sounds exciting, you also want to understand the risks you\u2019re taking \u2014 whether that might be with your money or your life. In 2018, Musk said in an Axios interview that he forecasted he had a 70% chance of going to Mars on one of his SpaceX rockets. Denying that Mars would be a retreat for the wealthy, he added, \u201cYour probability of dying on Mars is much higher than Earth.\u201d Musk knows the risks, and, to him, they are worth the chance for future generations to colonize space. Musk has been studying space and rockets since his younger days, when he became captivated by science fiction. When he says he believes his rockets can take humanity to Mars, his declarations are grounded in knowledge, study and business experience. When SpaceX delivered astronauts to the International Space Station in 2020, it was the first time since the last shuttle launch in 2011 that humans entered orbit in an American-built spacecraft. It was also the first time in history NASA astronauts launched from U.S. soil in a commercially built and operated American crew spacecraft. Yet, when Musk purchased Twitter, the company dropped in value by $25 billion, taking Musk-owned Tesla along with it in a nosedive that caused the EV manufacturer\u2019s stock price to drop 23%. Billionaire investor Warren Buffett has said, \u201cNever invest in a business you cannot understand.\u201d Musk might do well to heed that advice, especially considering how many times his Tweets have landed him in hot water. If there\u2019s one thing Musk isn\u2019t afraid of, it\u2019s failure. Perhaps that\u2019s one reason his business history is fraught with mistakes to learn from. He is always pushing the envelope on what he believes is possible. \u201cFailure is an option here,\u201d he has said about SpaceX. \u201cIf things are not failing, you are not innovating enough.\u201d Learn More: I\u2019m a Financial Advisor: I\u2019d Invest My First $5,000 in These 6 Stocks With that in mind, the biggest mistake any investor can make is not learning from their mistakes. Of course, you should always understand your risk tolerance and never invest more than you can lose. But you can always learn from past failures, no matter how low or high the stakes are.
