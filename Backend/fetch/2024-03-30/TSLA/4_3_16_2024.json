    "text": "Chinese electric vehicle maker BYD (BYDDY) surpassed Tesla (TSLA) to become the world\u2019s top seller of electric vehicles in 2023, demonstrating a remarkable turnaround for a company that was worried about survival just a few years ago. Yet, BYD executive vice president Stella Li insists there is no gloating to be had. \u201cWe have a high respect for Tesla,\u201d Li said to Yahoo Finance Live (video above). \u201cThey\u2019re a market leader. They\u2019ve given a great education to the market. Without them, I think the global EV market could not [advance] so rapidly. I think they are a partner \u2026 pushing the whole auto industry to transition to the future electric car.\u201d BYD edged past Tesla at the end of 2023 after selling more than 3 million cars, with more than 80% of sales in China. The milestone highlighted BYD\u2019s fast track to the top, as the company grew sales by a million cars in each of the last two years. Read more: Are electric cars more expensive to insure? That rise coincided with the explosive expansion in China\u2019s EV market. New energy vehicles (NEV), which include plug-in hybrids and battery electric vehicles, accounted for less than 5% of the country\u2019s automobile sales in 2019. Today, that rate has soared to 35.7%, according to data from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. Founded in 1995 as a battery manufacturer for cell phones and other consumer electronics devices, BYD has spearheaded the Chinese EV transition by building a business model reliant on vertical integration. Roughly 75% of the parts and components that go into its vehicles are manufactured in-house, allowing the company to control costs and timelines, according to Li. Li said BYD operates on an 18-month road map from concept to market, far faster than the years it takes for Western rivals to develop cars. Government subsidies and tax breaks introduced to kick-start EV adoption have also played a key role in BYD\u2019s expansion, along with that of other Chinese carmakers. At a conference earlier this year, Ford (F) CEO Jim Farley said the Chinese held a \u201c20% to 30%\u201d cost advantage, noting that BYD produced its entry-level Seagull EV for $9,000 to $11,000 in materials. But Li dismissed BYD\u2019s reputation as a cheap car manufacturer, saying the company has evolved and improved its technology to compete head-to-head with Western rivals on innovation. Its lineup ranges from a $10,000 vehicle to the ultra-luxury Yangwang brand, which recently introduced a sports car that retails for $233,000 in China. \u201cIn China, the message is strong,\u201d Li said. \u201cIf you are not investing in electric cars, you are out. You will die. You\u2019ll have no future.\u201d The Chinese automaker has also gotten backing from Berkshire Hathaway's Warren Buffett, who took a 10% stake in the company in 2008. BYD has been competing directly with Tesla in its home market since the US carmaker entered China in 2020. While Tesla CEO Elon Musk initially mocked BYD as a competitor back in 2011, during Tesla\u2019s most recent earnings call, he warned about the global expansion of Chinese EV makers, saying they are \u201cextremely good.\u201d \u201cFrankly, if there are not trade barriers established, they will pretty much demolish most other car companies in the world,\u201d Musk said. The US maintains a 27.5% tax on cars made in China and imported into the US. Li likened the threat of Chinese competition raised by auto executives like Musk to the narratives that followed the entry of Japanese cars into the US market. She added that, despite Tesla\u2019s success in China, Musk\u2019s firm and BYD have \u201cless than a 15%\u201d overlap in buyers. \u201cOur real competition is the ICE car,\u201d Li said, referring to internal combustion engine vehicles. \u201cThe more people jump in to produce EVs or [plug-in hybrids], the better for the industry.\u201d Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance A large fire has broken out at an Indonesian military ammunition facility outside the capital Jakarta.
