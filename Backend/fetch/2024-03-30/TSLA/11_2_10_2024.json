But that\u2019s Elon Musk for you. Musk\u2019s troubles with Tesla keep compounding. Not long ago, a shareholder sued Musk and the company\u2019s executives over his exorbitant $56 billion in compensation. A Delaware court eventually tossed out the pay package, calling it \u201cunfathomable\u201d and criticizing the board for approving it. Tesla\u2019s stock, meanwhile, has been sliding so rapidly that it is the worst performer in the S&P 500 this year. Musk\u2019s net worth, tied up significantly in Tesla\u2019s fortunes, is shrinking as well; he has lost at least $24 billion this year, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires index. The latest news about Musk\u2019s drug use illustrates the singular tension between Musk and his board on the one hand, and Tesla shareholders on the other. Musk has appointed what one shareholder, in a different lawsuit, called \u201ca completely subservient board.\u201d Its eight members are so handsomely compensated (more on that below) that they would be loath to lose their seats. At the same time, Musk clearly worries them\u2014both because of his erratic behavior and because Tesla is, as its annual report admits, \u201chighly dependent on [his] services.\u201d Meanwhile, the company\u2019s troubles continue to mount. Tesla has lost more than $150 billion in shareholder value this year alone, and Musk has already sounded warnings about slower growth ahead. Production at the gigafactory in Germany had to be put on hold because of the Red Sea shipping crisis. And the recalls keep coming\u2014most recently, 2.2 million vehicles in the US, including Cybertrucks, over a problem with their warning lights. That\u2019s practically all the vehicles Tesla has sold in the country. Words may not suffice. So Quartz brings you Tesla\u2019s torrid time, in charts and numbers. In 2024, Tesla is the worst-performing stock in the S&P 500. As Quartz\u2019s Melvin Backman points out, that index includes Boeing, whose planes are losing their doors in midair and their wheels on the tarmac. $329,351: The average total compensation for board members in the 200 largest US companies, as of 2023 $650 million: How much Tesla\u2019s eight-person board, not including Musk, has earned over the years by selling shares from the stock options awarded to them by way of compensation The fact that Tesla sold a single, solitary car in South Korea in January isn\u2019t entirely its own fault. Koreans are facing high inflation, newfound anxiety over battery fires, and a persistent lack of fast EV chargers across their country. Still, the crash in sales from a mere four months ago, when the Tesla Model Y was the best-selling imported car in South Korea, has been dramatic. And the bottom line doesn\u2019t care if it\u2019s the company\u2019s fault or not. Quartz did the math for you. If you add up all the Tesla vehicles recalled since 2013, it sums up to more than 7.2 million. As of 2023, the Tesla Model Y was the most recalled car in the US, according to data compiled by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The latest recall of Teslas in the US involved, of all things, a font issue. \u201cOn affected vehicles,\u201d the recall notice read, \u201cthe letter font size of the Brake, Park, and  Antilock brake system (ABS) visual warning indicators is smaller than  3.2 mm (1/8 inch), as prescribed in FMVSS Nos. 105 and 135.\u201d The fonts have to be expanded by 5%\u2014easily achieved through an over-the-air software update. In that sense, Tesla\u2019s \u201crecalls\u201d don\u2019t always require cars to be taken back to be retooled or repaired. Sawyer Merritt, a Tesla investor, claims that 99% of Tesla\u2019s recalls last year in the US called for just over-the-air fixes, with only 21,455 vehicles needing to be physically recalled.
