    "text": "BREAKING: Core PCE Inflation In Line With Views     Following a monster year for the S&P 500 in 2023, investors might expect some bonanza profit growth. Not so from Tesla (TSLA). The much-watched electric vehicle maker is on deck to report fourth quarter profit results Jan. 24. But analysts expect a surprisingly poor period, especially compared with giant growth from other S&P 500 big-caps like Amazon.com (AMZN). Analysts think Tesla's adjusted profit per share will drop 38.2% during the period. If that's right, it means Tesla's fourth-quarter profit growth results will be the 434th lowest in the S&P 500. And that's a point worth noting, as it's the ninth most important holding in the S&P 500 in terms of market value. Coming off the stock's 102% jump in 2023, analysts might be looking for big things from Tesla. But the fourth quarter isn't likely to deliver, analysts say. The car company's forecast 38.2% profit growth in the quarter is miles behind the leaders. Amazon.com's growth is the one to beat, with analysts calling for a 2,540% growth rate. No other S&P 500 company comes close. And all told, the online retailer is expected to make $8.4 billion during the fourth quarter, ranking it ninth in the S&P 500 in terms of sheer profit. Chipmaker Micron Technology (MU) ranks next to dead last in terms of the amount of profit it's expected to make in the fourth quarter. But even it is seen growing faster than Tesla. The company is forecast to boost its bottom line by 2,424% in the fourth quarter. If Tesla's profit growth rate isn't all that impressive, what about the size of the profit it brings in? It's not that amazing either. If Tesla ends up making $2.6 billion in the quarter as analysts predict, it would rank just 30th in the S&P 500 in terms of total profit. Apple (AAPL), the S&P 500's most profitable company, is seen making $32.7 billion just in the fourth quarter. That's 1,149% more than Tesla is seen making. Microsoft (MSFT) is on deck to be the second-most profitable company in the quarter making $20.6 billion. That's not to say Tesla's accomplishments aren't impressive. But when it comes to the bottom line, the fourth quarter isn't likely to turn heads like its vehicles often do.
