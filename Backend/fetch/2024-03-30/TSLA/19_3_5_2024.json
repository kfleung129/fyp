    "text": "       Meta's chief technology officer, Andrew Bosworth, said he wasn't a car guy \u2014 but he likes his Mercedes AMG EQS a lot. \"I didn't know cars could be this nice,\" Bosworth said in a podcast interview Sunday. The tech executive said he wasn't trying to flex but that the Mercedes-Benz AMG EQS was a step up for him since he grew up driving used cars that were constantly breaking down. More recently, he drove a Honda Accord for 10 years and then a Tesla Model S for another decade, Bosworth said. Related stories His Tesla Model S, Bosworth said, \"had a thing happen to it while it was parked.\" He didn't elaborate but said it prompted him to get a new electric car \u2014 and he knew he wanted something \"nice.\" Springing for a Mercedes AMG EQS isn't cheap: The 2023 luxury sedan has a retail price of $147,550. That's likely more than Bosworth paid for his Model S. Teslas fluctuate in price, but a Model S today ranges from about $74,990 to over $110,00 for a maxed-out Plaid version with Tesla's Autopilot and Full-Self-Driving software included. Mercedes says the AMG EQS can accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in 3.4 seconds and hit a top speed of 155 mph. The EV is also packed with tech tools, including a head-up display, a surround-view camera system, and automatic features such as emergency braking and steering assistance. For Bosworth, the camera system is a game changer. \"It is the best augmented-reality product I think you could buy in the market today,\" Bosworth said. The exec said he was especially impressed by the 3D camera used when making turns. The display faces forward from the rear above the roof and changes when approaching obstacles. Read next Jump to "
