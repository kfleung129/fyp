    "text": "Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. Tesla\u00a0managers have been asked whether each of their employees\u2019 positions were critical, stoking layoff fears in the company, Bloomberg News reported Wednesday. Tesla sent out a single-line query for each job after canceling some employees\u2019 biannual performance reviews, some of the people familiar with the matter\u00a0told\u00a0Bloomberg. The electric automaker did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. It had 140,473 employees globally as of Dec. 31 last year. Tesla shares rose 1% on Wednesday. They have slumped more than 25% so far this year. The report comes after CEO Elon\u00a0Musk\u00a0warned sales growth would slow this year despite price cuts that have already hurt margins at the world\u2019s most valuable automaker and fueled investor concerns about soft demand and Chinese competition. Despite a renewed discounting push led by Tesla,\u00a0new energy vehicle sales\u00a0in top auto market China recorded its first month-on-month drop in January on slowing demand. The US automaker also lost its spot as the\u00a0top EV maker\u00a0by sales to China\u2019s BYD\u00a0in the fourth quarter. "
