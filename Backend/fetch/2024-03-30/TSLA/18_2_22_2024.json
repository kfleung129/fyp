    "text": "Update font size. Reset Elon Musk\nLongtime tech analyst, Deepwater Assest Management\u2019s Gene Munster, says that Gene Munster: Elon Musk\u2019s xAI will rival Tesla and SpaceX as his greatest source of wealth creation with a decade, thanks to his purchase of Twitter. Gene Munster via X:\n \u200e It\u2019s getting more clear. @elonmusk is 80% genius, 20% master of good luck. In a decade, his purchase of Twitter will power #XAI to rival $TSLA and #SpaceX as his greatest source of wealth creation. The reason is Twitter\u2019s data is powerful (best source of real time intention), and he\u2019ll use the data to train xAI to be a top three Foundation Model. Those models should be valued in the hundreds of billions of dollars.  Bloomberg estimates his current net worth at around $210B. \u200e\nMacDailyNews Take: Generative AI is only as good as what it\u2019s trained on \u2013 Garbage In, Garbage Out \u2013 so, Twitter becomes a tremendous asset (much more so than a mostly ad-supported, trying-to-sell-subscriptions social network) simply for its wealth of data thanks to a continuous stream of free speech inputted for free from myriad, uncensored sources. Apple, too, thanks to its more than 2.2 billion active devices, could also be a source of very valuable data upon which to train AI.\n \u200e\nPlease help support MacDailyNews.

With Twitter as its source, it\u2019s guaranteed garbage out. I trust the guy who is worth 200 billion and was willing to buy Twitter for billions for this data stream over the loser brigades I trust the guy who advocates for true-free-speech, in contrast to the previous that collaborated with the govt to present ONLY speech that fit with their narrative.  Besides, if the article pans out, he bought a dying ship that will not only survive, but prevail.  Culture = better.  Biz = prosperous. Tell us you don\u2019t know how X works without telling us you don\u2019t know how X works.

Thanks for playing, dudette. disposableidentity, do you remember how much better this country was when people as stupid as you were locked away in mental institutions?
