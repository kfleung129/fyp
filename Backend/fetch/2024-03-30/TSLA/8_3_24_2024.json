What Happened:\u00a0Gary Black, managing partner of\u00a0Future Fund, highlighted the risk of Tesla\u2019s first-quarter volume falling well below the consensus estimate, which currently stands at 468,000 units. Black anticipates the number to be around 425,000 units, roughly on par with the year-ago volume of 423,000 units. He mentioned that Tesla\u2019s Investor Relations-compiled consensus would be released on Friday or Saturday, with the company likely to announce the number on April 2. See Also:\u00a0Everything You Need To Know About Tesla Stock What About Soft Numbers?\u00a0Black suggested that Tesla investors may overlook the first-quarter shortfall due to the Model 3 upgrade at the Fremont factory. He estimates the shortfall to be around 30,000 units compared to the previous year. However, Black expressed concern about the second quarter, which saw 466,000 units sold last year. He believes it may be challenging to surpass this figure, potentially leading the company to further reduce prices. Black\u2019s firm, which manages the flagship exchange-traded fund\u00a0Future Fund Active ETF\u00a0FFND, recently\u00a0significantly reduced its exposure\u00a0to Tesla. Addressing Investor Concerns: Black delved into the key investor concern amidst the softness in Tesla\u2019s performance. He raised questions about the price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple investors might assign to a company experiencing minimal or no volume growth. Despite being recognized as a tech company, Tesla\u2019s earnings and volume growth outlooks for 2024 and 2025, respectively, appear \u201cvulnerable,\u201d he noted. \u201cThe issue becomes what P/E multiple do investors put on a company with little or no volume growth? This is not about whether TSLA is a car company or a tech company (it's clearly a tech company) but without earnings or volume growth, TSLA's 2024 P/E of 57x on WS 2024 EPS of $3.01, and 2025 P/E of 42x on WS 2025 of $4.02 looks vulnerable,\u201d he said. Regarding the potential solution to the valuation issue, Black discussed the possibility of Tesla\u2019s full self-driving technology achieving Level 4/Level 5 automation, where the company assumes liability for FSD injury or damage. However, he indicated that, in his opinion, Tesla\u2019s management has not yet reached that point. Market Reaction:\u00a0Tesla closed Friday\u2019s session down 1.15% at $170.83, according to\u00a0Benzinga Pro data, amidst rumors of production cuts at its Giga Shanghai factory. Year-to-date, the stock has experienced a decline of over 31%.
