Tesla, like many other Fortune 500 companies, is incorporated in Delaware. When shareholders brought a lawsuit against Musk\u2019s $56 billion pay package from Telsa, they had to bring it to Delaware\u2019s Chancery Court. The court rejected Musk\u2019s compensation plan. Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick ruled that the Tesla pay package was a result of the directors being influenced by his star power and personal ties rather than a necessary corporate plan to achieve its goals. Tesla\u2019s board has eight members, including Musk. Musk also has a personal relationship with other members of the board, like Musk\u2019s brother, Kimball, and Rupert Murdock\u2019s son, James. To give some perspective, Musk\u2019s compensation package of over $56 billion is not in line with comparable CEOs of car or tech companies. Most CEOs receive some salary, but the primary compensation is through stock awards. The\u00a0Associated Press\u00a0reported that in 2022, the total compensation for the CEO of GM, Mary Barra, was $29 million, and Jim Farley, CEO of Ford, received $22 million that year. Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, received $63.2 million in 2023. As a result of the January 31, 2024 ruling, Musk lost his top spot on the\u00a0Forbes Top 10 Richest People in the World. Musk immediately took to social media platform X posting \u201cNever incorporate your company in the state of Delaware.\u201d Later, he posted that the company would \u201cmove immediately to hold a shareholder vote\u201d on whether to reincorporate Tesla in favor of Texas. Now\u00a0Musk is accusing Delaware of locking its doors, preventing companies from leaving Delaware. Musk is known for moving to more favorable states. He moved the carmaker\u2019s headquarters from California to Texas to get away from high labor costs and stringent regulations. It also doesn\u2019t hurt that now Musk moved to Austin, he does not have to pay state income tax. Tesla investors may not want to move out of Delaware. Unlike some states, Delaware does not tax corporate income earned outside of the state and has a set body of laws for corporate governance, ones that are generally considered business-friendly. Delaware is unique in that it has a Court of Chancery with special jurisdiction to hear corporate matters. The judges have experience in complex corporate lawsuits so that companies can have issues resolved in a timely manner. And because there are no juries, the outcomes of legal disputes are more predictable. While most companies favor Delaware as the best place to incorporate, some do not like this jurisdiction. In recent cases, Delaware has held that shareholders can hold corporate officers accountable for their actions. Corporations fear that\u00a0Delaware may be \u201ctoo friendly to shareholders.\u201d Recently, the head of TripAdvisor\u2019s parent company, Gregory Maffei, sought to move TripAdvisor\u2019s corporate home from Delaware to Nevada in an effort to shield directors from shareholder lawsuits for breach of fiduciary duties. Nevada codified a\u00a0business judgment rule\u00a0that presumes officers and directors act in good faith and should only be liable when their misconduct is intentional, fraudulent, or in known violation of the law. Shareholders are trying to block TripAdvisor\u2019s reincorporation in Nevada, claiming the move will help Maffei escape potential liability for self-dealing. No. It is ultimately up to the shareholders to decide on reincorporation. In fact, Delaware passed a law in 2022 allowing companies to leave Delaware with the approval of a majority of shareholders. Previously, actions to move out of Delaware required a unanimous vote. It is too early to know if Tesla\u2019s shareholders will want to move its state of incorporation to Texas. While Musk may be the largest shareholder, Nasdaq reported that\u00a0in 2023, Musk held close to 13% of Tesla\u2019s stock, he may not be able to sway the vote.
