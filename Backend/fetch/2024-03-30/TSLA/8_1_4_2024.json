    "text": "Despite being just about one-tenth the size of Tesla (in terms of market capitalization), its rival BYD has done something not many around the world would have expected. getty Warren Buffett-backed\u00a0BYD\u00a0has just pulled ahead of Tesla\u00a0to become the world\u2019s largest manufacturer of electric vehicles. Not even record sales could prevent Elon Musk\u2019s\u00a0Tesla\u00a0from losing the crown. Its\u00a0Chinese rival\u00a0BYD,\u00a0in the final months of 2023,\u00a0overtook Tesla for the first time ever\u00a0in a quarter. And given the fast pace of growth at BYD, it doesn\u2019t seem likely that Musk will reclaim the title easily. The vast volume of its sales in China, combined with a growing number overseas, has meant that BYD overtook its American rival Tesla in the December quarter. The\u00a0526,409 EVs sold over the period by BYD pipped Tesla\u2019s December quarter sales of 484,507, as per a Bloomberg report. Also, Elon Musk's Tesla sold nearly 1.81 million cars in 2023, which is higher than BYD's number, which delivered 1.59 million fully electric vehicles in 2023. The news of BYD overtaking\u00a0Tesla\u00a0has resulted in not only Elon Musk's net worth falling $7 billion in a single day, but even Tesla stock has bled too. Tesla shares fell 4% yesterday on NASDAQ, which hurt its CEO Musk's net worth too.\u00a0Tesla's market cap stands at $747 billion\u00a0currently, whereas\u00a0BYD's market cap stands at $78 billion\u00a0(CNY\u00a0558.19 billion). fortune To many, BYD still remains a little-known car brand, more familiar from media coverage citing\u00a0Warren Buffett\u2019s 2008 investment\u00a0in the Chinese EV maker.\u00a0A subsidiary of Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway had made a\u00a0$230 million investment in BYD\u00a0in 2008,\u00a0buying a 10 percent stake in it. Fast forward to 2023; after the partial stake sale in the October quarter,\u00a0Berkshire Hathaway's holdings in BYD's shares stood at 7.98%. it had\u00a0sold 820,500 Hong Kong-listed shares of BYD for HK$201.73 million ($25.78 million) back then. It's noteworthy that\u00a0Warren Buffett has not yet invested in Elon Musk's Tesla, despite the world's richest person once hinting at his conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway to invest in Tesla. getty Also Read:\u00a0How Elon Musk Had Almost Sold\u00a0Tesla\u00a0To\u00a0Google\u00a0For $6 Billion If its current growth trajectory continues, BYD\u2019s relatively little-known status outside China seems set to change drastically. In 2024 and the coming years,\u00a0BYD certainly holds the potential to join the ranks of Tesla, Hyundai, Toyota, Ford, and Volkswagen in the league of big brands in the auto sector.
