But what\u2019s caught other carmakers around the world off-guard is something else about BYD, which is backed by Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway: its low prices. \u201cNo one can match BYD on price. Period,\u201d Michael Dunne, CEO of Asia-focused car consultancy Dunne Insights, told the Financial Times. \u201cBoardrooms in America, Europe, Korea and Japan are in a state of shock.\u201d BYD can keeps its costs low in part because it owns the entire supply chain of its EV batteries, from the raw materials to the finished battery packs. That matters because a battery accounts for about 40% of a new electric vehicle\u2019s price. While BYD cars are not yet a common sight on American roads, many experts believe it\u2019s only a matter of time, despite the high tariffs that help keep them at bay for now. Currently in the U.S., made-in-China EVs are subject to a 25% tariff, which goes atop a 2.5% tariff on imported cars. But if BYD or other Chinese carmakers were to come in with a $20,000 car, noted Dunne, they\u2019d still be a \u201cgood position\u201d despite the high tariffs, given that the average price of a new car in the U.S. this year is about $48,000. BYD launched an EV called the Seagull with a cutthroat price of about $11,000 last year in China, where it quickly became one of the bestselling EVs. \u201cBut it is overseas that the EV could be a truly disruptive force,\u201d wrote the UK-based market intelligence firm Autovista Group. Even today, BYD\u2019s Dolphin hatchback starts at $33,000 in Britain, according to Reuters, or nearly 30% below the starting price of the VW\u2019s rival ID.3 hatchback. But BYD is planning to export much cheaper models to markets around the world, including Europe, South America, and Southeast Asia. And over the past three years, China\u2019s EV exports have jumped 851%, the New York Times reported in October. As for the U.S., BYD may enter from south of the border. In Mexico, the company is scouting locations for a new manufacturing plant, according to the FT. Mexico has a free trade agreement with the U.S. and Canada. In November, House lawmakers warned about Chinese giants like BYD \u201cgaining a back door to the U.S. market\u201d through the southern neighbor. Last year, Ford Motor executive chairman Bill Ford Jr. warned that American automakers are \u201cnot quite yet ready\u201d to compete with Chinese rivals on EVs. \u201cThey developed very quickly, and they\u2019ve developed them in large scale, and now they are exporting,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cThey are not here, but they will come here we think at some point.\u201d BYD also has the advantage of its founder and CEO Wang Chuanfu, a relentless cost-cutter whom the late Charlie Munger\u2014Buffett\u2019s long-time partner at Berkshire\u2014described in one of his final interviews last year. On the Acquired podcast, Munger said that Wang could look at somebody\u2019s part in the morning \u201cand in the afternoon he could make it. I\u2019ve never seen anybody like that\u2026He is a natural engineer and a get-it-done-type production executive, and that\u2019s a big talent to have in one place.\u201d He added, \u201cThe guy at BYD is better at actually making things than Elon is.\u201d This story was originally featured on Fortune.com Related Quotes "
