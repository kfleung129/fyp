Straight Facts.\u2122 Close Menu Simone Del Rosario Business Correspondent Feb 9 By Simone Del Rosario (Business Correspondent), Brent Jabbour (Producer), Emma Stoltzfus (Editor), Heath Cary (Senior Motion Graphics Designer) After a Delaware judge struck down Elon Musk\u2019s $56 billion Tesla compensation package, Musk put the state in his crosshairs with a series of posts encouraging companies to flee America\u2019s corporate kingdom, as he hopes to do with Tesla. Given Musk\u2019s influence, are his actions a real threat to Delaware? Download the SAN app today to stay up-to-date with Unbiased. Straight Facts\u2122. Point phone camera here Around 2 million companies are incorporated in Delaware, including 68% of Fortune 500 companies. Incorporated businesses outnumber people in Delaware by a ratio of 2-to-1. \u201cThe business of this state is corporate regulation; a good chunk of our tax revenue comes from that. It\u2019s in the state\u2019s interest to get the answer right,\u201d said Charles Elson, a leading authority on corporate governance and founding director of the Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware. The big reason so many companies choose to incorporate in Delaware is the Court of Chancery, Musk\u2019s latest target. Never incorporate your company in the state of Delaware Elson said Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick\u2019s decision to void Musk\u2019s CEO pay package is unusual and surprising but not unfounded. \u201cThe judge\u2019s concern was that the disclosure to the shareholders about this package was inadequate, that there are serious flaws she felt in the process, the independence of the directors, how the thing came together,\u201d Elson said. \u201cAnd she felt that had disclosure been more accurate, the shareholders may not have approved it.\u201d In 2018, 73% of shareholders approved the CEO\u2019s pay package, excluding votes by Musk and his family. After hitting set targets in the coming years, the deal\u2019s value hit around $56 billion, which McCormick called \u201can unfathomable sum.\u201d That\u2019s roughly the market cap of all of Tesla back when shareholders first approved the compensation plan. Tesla\u2019s market cap is now more than 10 times that. \u201cIs it really, quote-unquote, a transfer of funds for services rendered? Or is it more of a gift?\u201d Elson said. \u201cThe larger the amount becomes, the more questionable the compensation for services rendered becomes.\u201d McCormick cited Musk\u2019s extensive ties to members of Tesla\u2019s board of directors in her decision, questioning the board\u2019s independence. Then, the Wall Street Journal published an expos\u00e9 on the money and drugs that tie Musk to some directors. Musk hit back at the newspaper, calling them liars and trash not fit to line a birdcage. He noted that he has passed every random drug test in the past three years as part of an agreement between NASA and SpaceX. After that one puff with Rogan, I agreed, at NASA\u2019s request, to do 3 years of random drug testing.Not even trace quantities were found of any drugs or alcohol. @WSJ is not fit to line a parrot cage for bird \ud83d\udca9 Since his court defeat, Musk has not only vowed to incorporate Tesla in Texas with shareholder approval but has strongly encouraged other companies to leave Delaware as well. With 172 million followers on his platform X, it is realistic to question whether his influence will impact Delaware\u2019s status as the country\u2019s corporate paradise. \u201cI think whether you win or lose in Delaware, you do get a fair shake,\u201d Elson said. \u201c[Musk] didn\u2019t seem too upset with Delaware when he won the Solar City case a few years ago.\u201d Learn more about our emails.

The Delaware Court of Chancery dates back to 1792 but didn\u2019t hit its corporate stride until more than a century later.\u00a0In 1899, Delaware copied favorable business laws from New Jersey, which at the time was the country\u2019s de facto corporate home. In 1913, future President Woodrow Wilson, then New Jersey\u2019s governor, passed a series of laws perceived to be anti-business. In response, corporations fled across the river to Delaware, where they remain today. \u201cNorth Dakota has a corporate statute that some say is more shareholder-friendly than Delaware; Nevada has a corporate statute that some say is a little more managerial-friendly than Delaware,\u201d Elson explained. \u201cBut you still haven\u2019t seen a flocking of companies to those jurisdictions because a statute can\u2019t lay out every rule and regulation for corporate conduct. It has to really be interpreted by judges through a common law process.\u201d In Delaware and its dedicated business court system lies a large body of precedent developed over many years, Elson said. \u201cThere are not that many situations here that haven\u2019t come up before,\u201d he added. But now Delaware is coming up against a CEO who happens to be one of the richest people in the world (Musk dropped to No. 2 on Forbes\u2019 Billionaires List after his compensation package was voided). Now, Musk is looking to Texas for a fresh start. \u201cI think it would be rather insulting to Texas judges to suggest that they would have done something differently had they found the same facts. You can\u2019t go forum shopping, if you will, for a friendly judge, or if you do, it\u2019s not the right thing to do,\u201d Elson said. Musk eyeing Texas comes at an interesting time. Last year, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed a law to create specialty business courts to rival Delaware. But those courts won\u2019t be in session until September 2024 at the earliest.
