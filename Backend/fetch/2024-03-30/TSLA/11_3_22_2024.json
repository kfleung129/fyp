Apple shares had fallen in their biggest drop since August, slumping more than 4% and wiping away $113 billion of the tech giant\u2019s value. At market close Friday, the company had gained back a small (in Apple terms) but significant $15 billion. While Apple has faced antitrust probes in the past, those were limited to the App Store. The new lawsuit focuses on \u201cvirtually every part of Apple\u2019s business,\u201d DA Davidson Managing Director Gil Luria told Yahoo Finance in an interview Thursday. The DOJ not only cited Apple\u2019s iPhone and Apple Watch businesses, but also the company\u2019s dominance beyond those services, pointing to its advertising, news subscriptions, and FaceTime. \u201cThis could be a significant drag on the company,\u201d William Kovacic, a law professor of George Washington University, told Bloomberg on Friday. Apple isn\u2019t the only tech company to be probed by regulators for antitrust practices. Google is in an ongoing battle with the Department of Justice over antitrust actions after losing a legal fight with Epic Games in December. Meta and Amazon have been engaged in ongoing disputes with the Federal Trade Commission over similar concerns. Still, Meta, Amazon, and Google have continued to rise on the stock market. Not to mention, Apple\u2019s legal battle will play out over the long term, meaning the impacts of the suit to its business won\u2019t be immediate. While Wedbush analysts told Business Insider the suit could be settled over the next 12 to 18 months, others put that timeline at three to five years. So investors should continue to shake off the immediate shock from headlines of the suit and play the \u201cwait and see\u201d game as litigation continues. Deepwater Asset Management Managing Partner Doug Clinton told Yahoo Finance that investors \u201cwill ultimately shrug this off,\u201d and that none of the issues in the suit \u201care going to be big enough changes to crack Apple\u2019s dominance in the smartphone market.\u201d Apple\u2019s fellow Magnificent Seven member that shared its Thursday woes, Tesla, had a different fate on Friday. Tesla stock continued to sink on news of production cuts in China. Tesla shares fell another 1.2% Friday after sinking 1.6% the day before. Tesla stock is down more than 30% year-to-date \u2014 another sign that the Magnificent Seven may not be so magnificent, or at least, it probably should drop some of its members from the all-star team.
