Tesla officials visited India several times in recent months, with Musk also meeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi last year. Companies that meet the investment and manufacturing requirements will be allowed to import a limited number of EVs at a lower tax of 15% on cars costing $35,000 and above. India currently levies a tax of 70% or 100% on imported cars and EVs depending on their value.\nTesla\u2019s cheapest vehicle, the Model 3, starts at $38,990 in New York, according to the carmaker\u2019s website. The company did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.\n\u201cThe policy is designed to attract investments in the e-vehicle space by reputed global EV manufacturers,\u201d the commerce ministry said in a statement. \nIndia\u2019s EV market is small but growing with domestic carmaker Tata Motors dominating sales. Electric models made up less than 2% of total car sales in India in 2023 and the government wants to increase that to 30% by 2030. \nThe new policy will open the door for global automakers beyond Tesla to tap the world\u2019s third-largest car market. Vietnamese EV maker VinFast has said it plans to invest $2 billion in India and last month began construction of a local factory in the southern state of Tamil Nadu.\nVinFast had also asked the government to reduce import duties on EVs for about two years so customers can get familiar with its products while its local plant comes on stream. \nIndia was working on this policy for several months, Reuters has reported, despite lobbying from Tata Motors and rival Mahindra & Mahindra which fear the lowering of import taxes on EVs would hurt the domestic industry and its investors.\nThe objective of the new policy is to \u201cstrengthen the EV ecosystem by promoting healthy competition among EV players leading to high volume of production, economies of scale, lower cost of production,\u201d the commerce ministry said.\nEV imports at a lower tax rate will be allowed for a maximum of five years and the total number will be capped at 8,000 a year.\nThe duty foregone by the government on the total number of EVs allowed for import would be limited to the investment made by the company or close to $800 million, whichever is lower.\nThe investment commitment made by the company will have to be backed up by a bank guarantee equivalent to the custom duty forgone. The bank guarantee will be invoked in case the company fails to comply with the policy\u2019s mandates, the government said.\n($1 = 82.8577 Indian rupees)\n (Reporting by Tanvi Mehta and Aditi Shah; additional reporting by Aditya Kalra and Aftab Ahmed in New Delhi; editing by YP Rajesh, Jason Neely and Kim Coghill)\nDisclaimer: This report is auto generated from the Reuters news service.
