The fresh lows for Nio\u2019s stock \n        NIO,\n        -3.64%\nNIO,\n        +0.42%\n       came after Tesla reportedly cut prices on two models in China, as the Texas-based EV giant faces increasing competition. Tesla followed that move by reportedly cutting prices in Germany.

Nio\u2019s U.S.-listed stock sank 2.6% in morning trading, as it headed for its lowest close since June 12, 2020. It has tumbled 25.1% amid a nine-day losing streak, putting it in danger of tying the current record loss streak of nine sessions that ended March 9, 2020. Besides increasing competition, the stock\u2019s weakness comes amid growing concerns over China\u2019s economy. Over the long weekend, the People\u2019s Bank of China disappointed many investors by leaving interest rates unchanged. J.P. Morgan analysts wrote in a recent note to clients that the argument for the PBOC to cut rates was clear. \u201cHousing-market corrections have led to a spike in defaults by developers and spilled over to drag on debt-service ability by local government financing vehicle (LGFV) entities,\u201d analysts wrote. \u201cDeflation pressure, weak corporate profits and weak household-income expectations also jointly call for rate cuts to reduce debt-repayment burden.\u201d Among other China-based EV makers, shares of XPeng Inc. \n        XPEV,\n        -1.66%\n9868,\n        \n       dropped 3.9% toward a seven-month low and Li Auto Inc.\u2019s stock \n        LI,\n        +0.33%\n2015,\n        +3.23%\n       slid 4.1% toward an eight-month low. The U.S.-listed shares of BYD Co. \n        BYDDY,\n        -1.63%\n002594,\n        -2.55%\n       took a 4.1% hit, putting them in danger of their lowest close in 10 months. Meanwhile, Tesla\u2019s stock slumped 3.1% toward a 10-week low. It has tumbled 18.4% over a 13-session stretch in which it has declined 11 times. Tesla\u2019s stock, which has shed 2.6% this week, was on track to suffer a fifth straight weekly loss. That would be the longest such streak since the five-week stretch that ended in May 2021. Meanwhile, the Global X Autonomous & Electric Vehicles ETF \n        DRIV\n       fell 1.9% in morning trading toward a two-month low, the iShares MSCI China ETF \n        MCHI\n       lost 2.9% toward a 15-month low, and the S&P 500 index \n        SPX\n       eased 0.5%.
