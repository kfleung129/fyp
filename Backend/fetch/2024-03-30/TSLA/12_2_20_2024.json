Americas+1 212 318 2000 EMEA+44 20 7330 7500 Asia Pacific+65 6212 1000 By Jennifer Kay Elon Musk now has some guidelines for moving Tesla Inc.\u2018s incorporation to Texas from Delaware, thanks to a Tuesday decision in a lawsuit finding that TripAdvisor Inc. can reincorporate in Nevada. That\u2019s if he can follow the procedures laid out by Vice Chancellor J. Travis Laster of the Delaware Court of Chancery. TripAdvisor may move its incorporation, a plan challenged by investors who said it benefited company directors\u2014including Greg Maffei, chairman of TripAdvisor\u2019s parent company\u2014at the expense of shareholders. But Laster said the travel review and book site still has to face the investors\u2019 lawsuit, as monetary damages could be warranted. It\u2019s an opinion expected to influence how easily Tesla and corporations can exit Delaware for other states where laws offer more insulation from litigation for officers and directors. Delaware has been the country\u2019s premier venue for corporate litigation, with nearly 70% of Fortune 500 companies calling the state home. Musk vowed to move Tesla to Texas after repeated losses in Chancery Court. \u201cThe roadmap for Musk is what you see in this opinion\u2014he can go if he wants but may have to pay an exit tax,\u201d said Brian Quinn, a Boston College law professor focused on corporate law. The TripAdvisor case entered the spotlight last month after the Chancery Court\u2019s chief judge, Kathaleen St. Jude McCormick, voided Musk\u2019s $56 billion Tesla pay package as unfair to shareholders. Musk has cited the TripAdvisor case in his criticism of Delaware courts. The tech leader has threatened to move publicly held Tesla\u2019s incorporation to Texas, and has already started to move the incorporations of his other, privately held companies\u2014SpaceX and Neuralink\u2014out of Delaware. While Laster wouldn\u2019t stop TripAdvisor from leaving Delaware, saying an injunction was \u201coff the table,\u201d he said the investor litigation challenging the company\u2019s planned relocation as rife with self-interest could proceed. Nevada offers laws that better shield company directors\u2014including Greg Maffei, chairman of TripAdvisor\u2019s parent company\u2014from shareholder lawsuits. A \u201cmonetary award could be crafted\u201d to compensate the investors who sued, should the court ultimately rule against TripAdvisor down the line, Laster said. Laster also said the litigation rights provided to shareholders by Nevada law \u201care inferably less than what Delaware provides,\u201d calling into question the fairness of the move. Musk responded to McCormick\u2019s ruling against him by venting on social media, writing: \u201cNever incorporate your company in the state of Delaware.\u201d It\u2019s also the state where Musk surrendered in his fight to back out of his $44 billion offer to buy the social media platform Twitter Inc., which Musk subsequently took private, renamed X, and reincorporated in Nevada. Nevada does things differently than Delaware, but it\u2019s debatable that it\u2019s inherently anti-shareholder. It\u2019s \u201cpotentially unsettling\u201d that Laster\u2019s opinion suggested Nevada law could be worse for shareholders, said Jill Fisch, a University of Pennsylvania law professor who teaches about corporate law and litigation. \u201cIf you\u2019re a Delaware judge you probably think that, but why wouldn\u2019t it work the other way?\u201d she said. States vary in terms of how much protections they offer to shareholder, and there\u2019s no clear way for shareholders to determine which state is better for them when a corporation or board wants to move, she said. \u201cCharacterizing this as potentially self-dealing and conferring a material benefit on the directors, that seems to be the big step that Vice Chancellor Laster is making here,\u201d Fisch said. The decision largely denying TripAdvisor\u2019s motion to dismiss sets some guidelines for Delaware-incorporated companies, such as Tesla, where a controlling stockholder such as Musk wants to leave Delaware for another state offering officers and directors more protection from shareholder lawsuits. \u201cYou need a truly disinterested special committee, and you need a disinterested shareholder vote, and you\u2019ve got to commit to the fact that you\u2019re not going to move unless you get both of those things up front,\u201d Fisch said. Musk could still be tripped up in his attempt to move Tesla to Texas, said Carliss Chatman, who teaches corporate law at Southern Methodist University\u2019s Dedman School of Law. In the lawsuit over his Tesla pay package, McCormick found conflicts of interest marred the board\u2019s consideration of the pay deal. Musk has repeatedly urged Tesla\u2019s board to arrange another massive stock award for him, years after he sold a significant chunk of his shares in the company to acquire the social-media company once-known as Twitter. The billionaire has said he needs a large Tesla stake to maintain control of the carmaker and expand further into artificial intelligence. Some experts have questioned whether Musk\u2019s focus on Tesla will be weakened without another super-sized pay package. \u201cIf he really wants to move to Texas, it\u2019s fine. He just needs to abstain from voting on some things, which I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to do,\u201d she said. \u201cHe also needs to not pressure people, which he\u2019s probably not going to do.\u201d Laster, known for making groundbreaking rulings that often side against billionaire shareholders, successfully avoided making Delaware into a kind of \u201cHotel California\u201d where companies can incorporate but never leave, said University of Iowa law professor Robert Miller, who has written about the development of Delaware corporate law. The company can leave Delaware whenever it wants, \u201cbut the controller is liable for any harm arising from unfairness,\u201d Miller said. \u201cAnd Laster even has a smart way of measuring that\u2014the declining value of the company as shown by market prices in an efficient market.\u201d \u2014With assistance from Matthew Bultman.
