    "text": "A city official confirmed that the truck is coming to the tunnel transport system in the near future It looks like that the Tesla Cybertruck is not only making waves above ground with its unique design and innovative features but also preparing to make an impact below ground. According to a government official, it is set to become available for rides in The Boring Company\u2019s underground tunnel in Las Vegas. The Vegas Loop, as it\u2019s called, is a network of tunnels that connect multiple stations under Las Vegas. Originally, autonomous vehicles were meant to ferry passengers from station to station. Today, it exists instead with a human behind the wheel of a number of Tesla models. Now, the Cybertruck appears poised to enter the rotation. Back in late December, The Boring Company posted pictures of the Cybertruck in the tunnel system and at one of the stations. Then, on Monday, the city of Las Vegas itself posted a short clip of a Cybertruck entering the tunnel system. Neither Tesla nor The Boring Company has confirmed that the truck would be available for passenger rides though.

It\u2019s a really useful vehicle, with the bed of a pickup truck being useful to move things around.\u201d How much cargo hauling is required in the tunnel system is yet to be seen. What\u2019s clear though is that these rides aren\u2019t about to start happening immediately. \u201cIt has to be approved as a new vehicle in the system by the county and that hasn\u2019t happened yet,\u201d Hill said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t anticipate that it would be long, since it\u2019s an approved vehicle on the roads. But they have to go through that process to make it available in the system.\u201d We expect Tesla or the Boring Company or both to make a statement once passengers can hop in a Cybertruck in the Vegas Loop.
