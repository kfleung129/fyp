Two Tesla Cybertruck owners\u00a0voiced their concerns over their discovery that their expensive electric trucks had quickly developed \u201ccorrosion\u201d and \u201corange rust marks.\u201d Tesla-owner Will posted on the\u00a0Cybertruck Owners Club\u00a0forum that he began documenting the \u201ccorrosion\u201d on his new Cybertruck. He said he noticed his new vehicle had developed rust marks after just eleven days of ownership. He said that he had 381 miles on it when he first discovered the odd specks. \u201cI received my AWD Cybertruck on February 1, 2024,\u201d Will said. \u201cThroughout the LA rain, I noticed the corrosion was forming on the metal like other people have noted, so I decided to start documenting it and bringing it to Tesla\u2019s attention. I figured it was already on their radar, but I want it attended to under the warranty.\u201d The Tesla owner said he brought his truck to a service facility and that they\u00a0washed the exterior\u00a0to ensure the marks were not merely \u201cspecks of dirt\u201d but actual rusting. At the facility, the man said that he was told by a Tesla employee that while they had a procedure on how to fix the rusting issue, they did not have the tools on hand to immediately fix it. He was told they would give him a call when the supplies arrived at the service facility. Another Cybertruck-driver, named Max, echoed Will\u2019s experience. In the same Tesla forum, Max wrote that he picked up his new Cybertruck in Dublin, California and drove it up to Sacramento in the \u201cpouring rain\u201d on Feb. 1. Upon completing the over 2-hour drive, he claimed that he found a \u201cbunch of tiny orange specks and a few water spots\u201d along the exterior of his\u00a0brand-new vehicle. \u201cI picked it up in Dublin yesterday, it was pouring raining, drove it up to Sacramento and there\u2019s a bunch of tiny orange specks and a few water spots,\u201d Max said. \u201cThe orange dots aren\u2019t huge, they\u2019re very tiny, but they\u2019re apparent. Sure I haven\u2019t washed the car yet but it\u2019s only been two days in the rain.\u201d He said that he was \u201cexplicitly\u201d told that the trucks \u201cdevelop orange rust marks in the rain and that required the vehicle to be buffed out.\u201d \u201cI know I heard the story of never take out your Delorean\u00a0in the rain, but I just never read anything about rust and Cybertrucks,\u201d Max wrote.

According\u00a0to Tesla\u2019s website, the electric truck boasts an \u201cultra-hard stainless-steel exoskeleton\u201d where every \u201ccomponent is designed for superior strength and endurance, from stainless-steel structural skin to Tesla armor glass.\u201d The monochrome exoskeleton is also designed to reduce dents, damage and long-term corrosion, Tesla said. According to Tesla, the Cybertruck\u2019s low center of gravity will give drivers \u201cextraordinary traction control and torque\u201d, allowing the vehicle to accelerate from 0-60 mph in 2.9 seconds with up to 500 miles of range. The truck was also designed to handle up to 3,500 pounds of payload with\u00a0a towing capacity\u00a0of over 14,000 pounds for both the \u201crugged to refined\u201d, Tesla said, while including on-board power and compressed air. Tesla did not respond to Fox Business\u2019 request for comment. Advertisement "
