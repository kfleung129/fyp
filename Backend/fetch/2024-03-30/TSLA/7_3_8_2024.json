    "text": "Feedback Novo\u00a0Nordisk\u00a0NOVOb.CO\u00a0on Thursday surpassed\u00a0Tesla\u00a0Inc\u00a0TSLA.O\u00a0in market\u00a0valuation\u00a0after the maker of the popular weight-loss\u00a0drug\u00a0Wegovy announced positive early trial\u00a0data\u00a0for a highly anticipated new\u00a0obesity\u00a0drug. Shares surged more than 8% to record highs, shooting\u00a0Novo\u00a0Nordisk up in global rankings to the 12th most valuable company from 14 previously, after it told investors a Phase I trial of the pill version of\u00a0experimental\u00a0drug\u00a0amycretin showed participants lost 13.1% of their weight after 12 weeks. That compares to a weight loss of about 6% after 12 weeks and 15% after 68 weeks in trials for Wegovy, its blockbuster\u00a0obesity\u00a0drug. Investors welcomed the news as indicating\u00a0Novo\u00a0had more in its pipeline beyond its hugely successful Wegovy. Its shares have soared since launching the weekly injections in the United States in 2021. Novo's shares have risen more than three-fold since June 2021 when it launched Wegovy in the United States, last year becoming Europe's most valuable listed company, ahead of LVMH. On Thursday, its market\u00a0valuation\u00a0reached $566 billion, ahead of\u00a0Tesla\u00a0and Visa\u00a0V.N, according to LSEG\u00a0data. \"Novo\u00a0has made clear that the amycretin molecule likely will form the foundation of the company's rapidly growing pipeline,\" said Guggenheim analyst Seamus Fernandez. Nearly half of\u00a0Novo's current\u00a0valuation\u00a0is based on the company's pipeline of new\u00a0experimental\u00a0drugs such as amycretin, according to calculations by Berenberg analysts last week. Markus Manns, a portfolio manager at Union Investment in Germany and\u00a0Novo\u00a0shareholder, said the early read-out also compared favourably with other weight-loss pills in development, such as rival Eli Lilly's\u00a0LLY.N\u00a0orforglipron. Lilly's mid-stage trial showed\u00a0its\u00a0experimental\u00a0pill led to 14.7% weight loss after 36 weeks for people who were obese or overweight. The U.S.\u00a0drugmaker's shares slipped\u00a0on the upbeat\u00a0Novo\u00a0update while shares in Zealand Pharma\u00a0ZELA.CO,\u00a0which is testing a similar treatment, jumped\u00a0more than 9%. Wegovy belongs to a class of\u00a0drugs known as GLP-1 agonists, originally designed to treat type 2 diabetes, that have been shown to reduce food cravings and empty the stomach more slowly. Following the success of these\u00a0drugs, companies are working on other promising weight-loss therapies such as amycretin which targets a hormone called amylin in the pancreas that affects hunger. Wegovy was the first of a new group of highly effective weight-loss\u00a0drugs to be launched.\u00a0Novo\u00a0and Lilly are so far the leaders in the\u00a0obesity\u00a0drug\u00a0market, forecast by analysts to be worth $100 billion by 2030.  HEART DISEASE Novo\u00a0Nordisk Chief Executive Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen said the\u00a0obesity\u00a0drug\u00a0roll-out will be dominated\u00a0\u00a0by injectable medicines, with oral versions introduced later in higher-priced markets. Pills require large amounts of active ingredients, making them costly to produce. Earlier in the day, he also\u00a0announced the company was expanding its focus on diabetes and weight-loss therapies to include cardiovascular disease treatments. The change comes after the\u00a0drugmaker last August said a large study.\u00a0had shown Wegovy also had a clear cardiovascular benefit, boosting efforts by the company to move Wegovy beyond its image as a lifestyle\u00a0drug. \"Any company that is so heavily exposed to one therapeutic area needs to try to develop other pillars to stand on,\" said Wolfgang Lickl, portfolio manager at KB-Verm\u00f6gensverwaltung. \"The sheer success in diabetes and\u00a0obesity\u00a0will make that difficult, but the cardiovascular field makes sense because of the many synergies,\" he said. Following the August trial,\u00a0Novo\u00a0has been trying to convince sceptical medical insurers that the long-term benefits of Wegovy are enough to reduce the overall burden on healthcare systems and the cost of treating heart disease in overweight and obese people. It expects Wegovy to be approved\u00a0\u00a0for sale in China as soon as this year, which would be its second-biggest market after the United States. Copyright\u00a92024 Living Media India Limited.
