For years, Tesla has been synonymous with electric vehicles, enjoying a dominance in the sector that carmakers the world over have desperately been trying to shake. Days into 2024, a Chinese rival has succeeded in doing just that. BYD, a Shenzhen-based EV giant, sold 526,000 fully electric vehicles to Tesla\u2019s 484,000 in the last three months of 2023, according to figures released by both companies this week, outpacing the U.S. carmaker headed by billionaire Elon Musk for the first time ever. BYD\u2019s rapid ascent, while no surprise to industry experts, is a product of China\u2019s yearslong push to build up its automotive manufacturing base and stake out a position in the global car market. That effort has largely been successful\u2014China surpassed Japan last year as the world\u2019s biggest automobile exporter, according to multiple industry estimates; market research firm Canalys expects EVs will have made up around 40 percent of those exports. Beijing has poured billions of dollars and immense resources into EV manufacturing, and BYD\u2014which stands for \u201cBuild Your Dreams\u201d\u2014has been one of its foremost champions. \u201cThe government in China went all in on EVs,\u201d said Erica Downs, an expert in Chinese energy markets at Columbia University\u2019s Center on Global Energy Policy. \u201cThis was an industry that they wanted to develop, and they made sure that they had the different building blocks needed for success in place\u2014so there were subsidies to EV manufacturers; there were subsidies to EV buyers; and they\u2019ve been working on making sure there is adequate charging infrastructure.\u201d That strategy has long rattled Washington and Brussels, where tech competition with Beijing dominates foreign-policy concerns and policymakers fear that an influx of Chinese-made vehicles could strain their domestic markets. To curb China\u2019s technological advancement in strategic sectors such as semiconductors and artificial intelligence, Washington has imposed export controls and unveiled new legislation, such as the Inflation Reduction Act, aimed at strengthening domestic capabilities and attracting more manufacturing to U.S. shores. Under the Biden administration, boosting the U.S. EV sector has been a key prong of that strategy. Worried about China\u2019s EV exports, Washington is reportedly mulling hiking up tariffs on Chinese EVs, the Wall Street Journal reported in December; they already face a 25 percent tariff. \u201cThere\u2019s real concern in the United States about having Chinese EVs come into the market and dominate and put domestic producers at a disadvantage,\u201d Downs said. Similar fears have also swept the European Union, which launched an investigation into Chinese EV subsidies last fall as concerns grew over Beijing\u2019s EV ambitions. Over the last three years, Beijing\u2019s global EV exports have soared by a stunning 851 percent\u2014with the bulk of the cars going to Europe. Brussels\u2019s probe, which is still ongoing, could result in additional tariffs on Chinese exports. \u201cGlobal markets are now flooded with cheaper Chinese electric cars,\u201d European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen declared when the probe was first announced. \u201cAnd their price is kept artificially low by huge state subsidies.\u201d Beijing has two key advantages in its quest to lead the global EV race. One is the sheer size of its own sector: China is home to the world\u2019s biggest automotive market, by both manufacturing output and annual sales. The industry is only set to grow, with the country\u2019s domestic production projected to soar to 35 million vehicles by 2025, according to the U.S. Commerce Department. Eager to harness this market, even Tesla has spent billions of dollars building a \u201cgigafactory\u201d in Shanghai, where it produced more than half of its cars in 2022. Other legacy companies such as Volkswagen and Volvo have also made major investments and even entered into joint ventures with Chinese counterparts, which in turn has helped China enhance its own carmaking chops. \u201cYou have to be there to capture the market. It\u2019s very hard to decouple,\u201d said Xiaomeng Lu, a director in the Eurasia Group\u2019s geotechnology practice. \u201cIt just defies logic for them not to be there, and I think that\u2019s why this particular sector is kind of the glue among the European companies, American companies, and the Chinese market.\u201d The second advantage is China\u2019s grip on global battery supply chains. After a decades-long push, Beijing overwhelmingly commands the supply chains for the critical minerals powering EV batteries and other clean energy technologies, including graphite, lithium, and cobalt. That dominance is particularly pronounced with rare earths, the powerful elements underpinning offshore wind turbines, missile guidance systems, and much more. In the rare-earth sector, 85 percent of processing and 92 percent of magnet production are currently controlled by China. \u201cRight now, Europe and the United States aren\u2019t even in the game when it comes to rare earths, battery cell manufacturing, rare-earth mining and refining,\u201d said Tu Le, the managing director of the consultancy Sino Auto Insights. BYD is a prime example of how Chinese companies have leveraged these dynamics to gain an important edge. Before emerging as an EV giant, the Chinese firm was primarily a battery manufacturer, and it still makes its own batteries\u2014a background that has given it a deep expertise and major leg up in the global EV market. \u201cThey have a real competitive advantage there,\u201d said Colin McKerracher, the head of transport and automotive analysis at BloombergNEF. \u201cNot only do they have a cost advantage from the vertical integration that they have by both making the batteries and the vehicles, but they are also making better batteries than a lot of the other groups out there, just in terms of cost and in terms of performance and safety.\u201d And while market power and rare-earth dominance both constitute levers that China could pull to make life difficult for Western companies, its own slumping economy means it would take a significant emergency for Beijing to break that glass. \u201cThe Chinese economy is weaker, so I think really exerting force would probably alienate countries that they\u2019re really trying to build bridges with,\u201d Le said. The interconnectedness of the global automotive supply chain also means that it\u2019s hard to cut off access without unpredictable global knock-on effects that could hurt everyone. \u201cI think [the Chinese] realize that if they take out the big hammer, they\u2019re going to hit themselves in the foot,\u201d said Lu of the Eurasia Group. The big question now facing BYD is one that eventually comes for all successful Chinese firms: Can it parlay its domestic success into global dominance? The company has already made inroads in cost-sensitive markets such as India and Southeast Asia and will look to expand further if it isn\u2019t stymied by Western protectionism and concerns around Chinese tech. A battle with Tesla is shaping up here as well\u2014both companies are seeking manufacturing expansions around the world, with BYD announcing new factories in Hungary and Brazil, while Tesla has announced a new facility in Mexico and is reportedly mulling an India expansion. Things could get more complicated if countries are forced to pick sides. \u201cEven if there are major tariff barriers erected in developed-country markets, BYD\u2019s product portfolio means that it can expand significantly in developing-country markets, where its supply chain vertical integration gives it some major cost advantages,\u201d said Paul Triolo, a China analyst and tech policy lead at the Albright Stonebridge Group. Tesla\u2019s heavy dependence on China, paradoxically, could end up evening the scales. \u201cThere\u2019s risk with having 52 percent of my manufacturing come from one place,\u201d said Le of Sino Auto Insights. \u201cMaybe that balances out or zeroes out the growth that BYD has outside of China.\u201d For now, however, experts say the immediate geopolitical impact of BYD\u2019s latest achievement will largely be limited to a major public relations victory for China. The electric car race is somewhat analogous to the smartphone industry, with Apple and South Korea\u2019s Samsung duking it out at the top and everyone else trying to catch up. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any real risk here for U.S. competitiveness. The U.S. has Tesla; China has BYD. They\u2019re the two leading EV companies in the world,\u201d McKerracher said. \u201cThey are so far ahead of everyone else that it\u2019s not like either of those are being left behind.\u201d  Rishi Iyengar is a reporter at\u00a0Foreign Policy.
