    "text": "Elon Musk has responded to lawyers in the recent Delaware case regarding his Tesla compensation package, after the attorneys this week requested legal awards of 29 million Tesla shares \u2014 worth almost $6 billion. Musk\u2019s pay package at Tesla was rejected in late January by Judge Kathaleen McCormick of the Delaware Court of Chancery, as part of a 2018 case brought forward by shareholder Richard Tornetta. Following the decision to void Musk\u2019s $55.8 billion compensation package just over a month ago, Tornetta\u2019s lawyers argued in a filing on Friday that they deserve over 29 million Tesla shares as their legal fees, worth around $5.95 billion at the company\u2019s current valuation (via Bloomberg). In the filing, the lawyers also explained why they requested the fee in Tesla stock instead of cash. \u201cWe are prepared to \u2018eat our cooking,\u2019\u201d Tornetta\u2019s lawyers wrote. \u201cThis structure has the benefit of linking the award directly to the benefit created and avoids taking even one cent from the Tesla balance sheet to pay fees. It is also tax-deductible by Tesla.\u201d Tesla and Elon Musk to appeal $56B pay package decision  Tornetta\u2019s case was brought to the court on behalf of shareholders, so roughly 267 million Tesla shares that would have been a part of Musk\u2019s pay package are now expected to be returned to the company, according to the filing. Tulane University Corporate Law Professor Ann Lipton says the legal team\u2019s payout could be the largest attorney fee ever requested, at least that she\u2019s familiar with. \u201cNow, to be fair, the case involved the largest compensation award ever to an executive,\u201d Lipton added to Bloomberg. \u201cI assume the plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys figured if they sought $6 billion in cash in fees it could cripple Tesla,\u201d she says. \u201cSince the case involved a stock award to Musk, they thought it would be appropriate to ask for the fee in shares so it wouldn\u2019t be as rough for Tesla shareholders. That makes a lot of sense to me.\u201d Following the filing, multiple Tesla executives responded, including Musk himself. In a flurry of posts on X on Saturday, Musk criticized the request, calling it \u201cutterly disgraceful,\u201d \u201cironic,\u201d \u201ccriminal,\u201d and saying that the the lawyers were \u201cevil\u201d in two separate replies. You can see just a couple of his posts below. The lawyers who did nothing but damage Tesla want $6 billion. Criminal. https://t.co/JI6eQPTxQ2 \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 2, 2024  The system is broken. Best to get out of Delaware as soon as possible possible. \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 2, 2024  Rohan Patel, Tesla\u2019s Vice President of Public Policy and Business Development, also responded to the reports, noting that he believed other employees at the company would be \u201cequally disgusted\u201d by the news. Nearly every single @Tesla employee is an owner/shareholder of the company.  Tens of thousands of them have had a life-changing experience as a result of the company/stock growth.  Some truly inspiring stories\u2026our employees work very hard and are positively changing multiple\u2026 https://t.co/gB9WlVlTG2 \u2014 Rohan Patel (@rohanspatel) March 2, 2024  After Judge McCormick\u2019s decision to void Musk\u2019s compensation package, made on January 30, the multi-company executive has motioned to move the incorporations of SpaceX, The Boring Company and Neuralink out of Delaware, and he\u2019s expected to do the same with Tesla. Musk has also been outspoken since the decision, noting that Tesla plans to appeal the decision and pointing to how much the lawyers representing Tornetta could profit from this trial. In response to an early February report, Musk said it was \u201cso deeply and utterly wrong that a law firm that harmed Tesla could stand to gain billions.\u201d THIS TIME LAST YEAR: Elon Musk\u2019s lawyers to make closing arguments in CEO\u2019s pay package case  What are your thoughts?
