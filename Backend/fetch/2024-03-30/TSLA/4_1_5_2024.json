    "text": "Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Tesla is recalling 1.6 million vehicles in China to fix problems with its Autopilot driver-assistance system and reduce the risk of collisions, a Chinese regulator said Friday. The issues can be fixed through over-the-air software updates, according to a statement from China\u2019s State Administration for Market Regulation, the nation\u2019s top market regulator. The Autopilot recall covers 1.61 million Tesla (TSLA) cars in the company\u2019s second biggest market, including imported Model S, Model X and Model 3 sedans as well as Chinese-made Model 3 sedans and Model Y SUVs. The vehicles were made between August 26, 2014 and December 20, 2023. In these vehicles, drivers might\u00a0\u201cmisuse\u201d the Autopilot functions, which could increase the risk of collisions, the regulator said in the statement. The Chinese recall follows the recall of nearly all 2 million Tesla cars on US roads last month after the US safety regulator found the Autopilot system could be used in ways that posed an increase risk of crashes. Here\u2019s what you need to know about BYD, the Chinese EV giant that just overtook Tesla As examples, the US regulator cited using Autopilot on local streets, rather than limited access highways, or without drivers paying attention or having their hands on the steering wheel. That recall came after analysis of roughly 1,000 US crashes involving Tesla with Autopilot in use. Tesla will update the software system for the recalled vehicles, including adding controls and alerts to \u201cfurther encourage the driver to adhere to their driving responsibility,\u201d the Chinese regulator added. The limitations on Autopilot serve as a blow to Tesla\u2019s efforts to market its vehicles to buyers willing to pay extra to have their cars do the driving for them. A second Chinese recall \u2014 covering 7,538 imported Model S sedans and Model X SUVs \u2014 relates to the risk that doors could unlatch and open during a crash, the regulator\u2019s statement said. These vehicles were manufactured between October 26, 2022 and November 16, 2023. Most stock quote data provided by BATS.
