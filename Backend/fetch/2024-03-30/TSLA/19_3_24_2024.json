The deal to buy Tesla shares after confirming the penetration of the downtrend The deal to buy Tesla shares after confirming the penetration of the downtrend If you can get back above 884 with confirmation id consider that my confirmation on an extremely bullish continuation. Arguable whether or not the D point is actually your confirmation low after initially testing the .786 as the PCZ, of if we will get another test of the lows to confirm the .886.  One thing is clear, thats the bottom. \n\nHolding 819 would be ideal,... We\u00b4ve had  a solid bullish movement since Feb 24th, but are currently facing a very strong resistance at $885, and the 4-hour candles are giving us some short-term bearish indications. \n\nI would only go long after a healthy pullback or after a break and retest of $885.\n\nAt current levels, I\u00b4d only trade short scalps. Hello traders,\n\nas we can see, Tesla bounced rapidly up from the 0.78 fib and also the 0.61 fib is holding. keep patient and take your profits step by step !

DOWNTREND\nIf you think my analyzes are successful and meaningful, please contribute by commenting and liking. The trendlines on chart make it clear.  Price broke white support line and came back up to retest it at shorter orange line.  Longer orange line creates a downtrending support based on price dips.   I expect that TSLA will start another move lower as it is in a channel for now and should return to lower line.  RSI will confirm if it stays below 50. The PEAD projected a Bullish outlook for $TSLA after a Negative Under reaction following its earnings release placing the stock in drift D with an expected accuracy of 90%. tesla just made a break out so we buy the market in short small correction to check the wave count. just for fun. randomly going through charts. for educational purposes only.
