    "text": "San Francisco: OpenAI\u2019s CEO Sam Altman has said that Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk thought that the ChatGPT-maker company would fail and \u201che chose to part ways\u201d. In an interview with podcaster Lex Fridman, Altman said that \u201cMusk thought OpenAI was going to fail. He wanted total control to turn it around. We wanted to keep going in the direction that now has become OpenAI. He also wanted Tesla to be able to build an AGI effort\u201d. \u201cAt various times, he wanted to make OpenAI into a for-profit company that he could have control of or have it merge with Tesla. We didn\u2019t want to do that, and he decided to leave, which is fine,\u201d he added. Moreover, the CEO suggested that the company is still committed to its original cause as it is putting powerful technology in the hands of people for free, as a public good. \u201cWe don\u2019t run ads on our free version. We don\u2019t monetise it in other ways. We just say it\u2019s part of our mission. We want to put increasingly powerful tools in the hands of people for free and get them to use them,\u201d Altman said. Recently, Musk sued OpenAI and Altman, alleging they breached their original contractual agreements around AI. OpenAI then hit back at Musk\u2019s lawsuit, saying as the company discussed a for-profit structure in order to further the mission, \u201cMusk wanted us to merge with Tesla or he wanted full control\u201d.
