A plethora of savvy drivers have taken to social media to share why buying a Tesla was a smart financial idea. One X user, Bilal Sattar posted about his experience. READ MORE! Multi-million dollar Tahoe estate is being sold with a Tesla Cybertruck included to lure in buyers He even shared his electric bill to demonstrate the cost of running his Tesla for six months. More specifically he showed how much he paid to recharge on the approximate 10,000 miles he drove \u2013 and it\u2019s impressive. Unbelievably, the total cost comes to $573.55. That\u2019s a snip compared to what it would\u2019ve cost to run a gas-guzzling car for the same distance \u2013  around $2,392. Sattar\u2019s post also contains screenshots directly from the Tesla app. This give a side-by-side comparison to underline the financial smarts of switching from a gas-powered car to an EV. 6 months and roughly 10k miles I've spent only $573 to charge. Anequivalent gas car at $4/gallon would have cost roughly $2400. I saved ~$1800 pic.twitter.com/8mQuOroCAK But, if the truth be told, Sattar has done a good job driving that distance at such a low cost. A quick looks at his X feed suggests that Sattar is clever with his destinations, often picking stopping points where there are free chargers. That alone is rare, as free chargers often only act as pilots for new charging locations. In other news, Tesla owners have run into trouble amid freezing temperatures. Nevertheless, the real key to Sattar\u2019s success is evident in an electric bill his shared last October, showing he actually put wattage into the grid rather than taking it out. My electricity bill was $ -55.88 last billing cycle. This is with 3 EVs and 5 residents \ud83e\udd2f pic.twitter.com/xxDJWu1V9a It appears Sattar uses solar charging to offset his energy usage or even account for it completely. It\u2019s another case underlining how a home solar setup can have you driving around at little to no cost, which is likely to convince plenty of people that should add panels to their home if they can. At the end of the day, if someone offered you the chance to rack up 10,000 miles and only pay $573 for it, you\u2019d probably snap their hand off.
