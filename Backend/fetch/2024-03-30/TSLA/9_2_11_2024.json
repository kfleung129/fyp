    "text": " The TSLA stock forecast might not be good, but its EV leadership counts for something Advertisement Source: Roschetzky Photography / Shutterstock.com Life is getting more complicated for Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Elon Musk as the TSLA stock forecast gets hazier by the day. Once the darling of the Magnificent Seven, if the stock price keeps up its poor performance throughout 2024 ( it\u2019s down more than 20% year-to-date) it could be kicked out of the prestigious club. Quartz\u2019s Feb. 5 headline said it all. Tesla is the worst-performing stock in the S&P 500 this year. The subhead wasn\u2019t much better. Worse than Etsy. Worse than Boeing. Simply the worst. And to make matters worse, the drumbeat revolving around CEO Elon Musk\u2019s drug use continues to grow louder. While the board\u2019s proven to be subservient when disciplining the billionaire, it can\u2019t allow his erratic behavior to continue. Three months ago, TSLA stock was considered a Moderate Buy (3.44 out of 5), according to Barchart.com. Today, 29 analysts cover Tesla, rating it Hold (3.28 out of 5), with a target price of $218.62, 15% higher than where it\u2019s currently trading. If the TSLA stock forecast is correct, Tesla can\u2019t possibly be 2024\u2019s worst-performing S&P 500 stock, can it? Oh, it can, reminding investors that being an a**hole to virtually everyone on the planet has genuine bad karma attached to it. Here are three areas to watch that could affect the outcome. The billionaire\u2019s $56 billion compensation package granted in 2018 came crashing down on Jan. 30 when Delaware judge Kathaleen St. Jude McCormick argued the board did little to justify its decision to give Musk a virtual blank check. \u201cPut simply, neither the Compensation Committee nor the Board acted in the best interests of the Company when negotiating Musk\u2019s compensation plan. In fact, there is barely any evidence of negotiations at all,\u201d CNBC reported McCormick\u2019s comments on her decision. \u201cRather than negotiate against Musk with the mindset of a third party, the Compensation Committee worked alongside him, almost as an advisory body.\u201d Ironically, the judge\u2019s decision comes days after Musk threatened that he would take his AI ball and play somewhere else if the board didn\u2019t give him more shares to bring his ownership up to 25%, a level he felt would ensure his various projects could remain within Tesla. I argued on Jan. 23 that Musk had already been more than fairly compensated for his efforts. He simply isn\u2019t worth another ridiculous pay package. In the weeks ahead, investors should pay close attention to what the board does to replace the rescinded pay package. It could be the straw that breaks the camel\u2019s back, launching an activist showdown with the board and Musk. Ultimately, this, more than anything, could alter the trajectory of TSLA stock. Reuters reported at the end of December about Tesla\u2019s quality control issues. \u2018 Specifically, there were 260 complaints by Tesla owners to the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in 2023. General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Toyota (NYSE:TM) had 750 and 230, respectively. Toyota has a 15% market share in the U.S. A big reason for that is its tremendous quality control. The low number of complaints doesn\u2019t lie. As for GM, it had almost 3x as many complaints as Tesla. Of course, it has 21x Tesla\u2019s market share. It\u2019s common knowledge that Tesla\u2019s quality has been questionable for years. In the J.D. Power 2020 Initial Quality Study (IQS), the automotive publication ranked it last with 250 problems per 100 cars. I\u2019ve always thought Jaguar and Land Rover had crappy quality, but Tesla takes the cake. Its problems per 100 cars was 1.5x the industry average of 166. The Cybertruck is the most recent Tesla creation to get raked over the coals for its quality, or lack thereof. It reminds me of the Ron Howard film Gung Ho, about a Pennsylvania auto plant that gets taken over by a Japanese company. The big boss comes from Japan to tour the plant. Cars rolled off the line with no engines, etc. Unfortunately, for Tesla owners, their issues aren\u2019t in a movie. They\u2019re happening in real life. Despite Tesla\u2019s rating by analysts falling to Hold, many have remained bullish about the company and its stock. There are seven Strong Buys and two Moderate Buys compared to four Strong Sells. You would think analysts would be more negative given X, his ridiculous compensation, quality control issues, falling market share and profits, his alleged drug use, and, let\u2019s not forget, his racist thoughts and comments. Now, I\u2019m not a teetotaller and believe all drugs should be legalized, but that\u2019s not what you want from a CEO, especially one that\u2019s prone to lash out. \u201cIn January it was reported that Musk is an occasional user of cocaine, ecstasy, LSD, and mushrooms, in addition to medical and recreational use of ketamine, and we\u2019ve all seen him smoke weed. All of these drugs, bar the ket for which Musk has a prescription, are federally illegal, and could jeopardize his companies,\u201d Quartz\u2019s Feb. 5 article on his alleged drug use stated. It goes on to say that it could be especially problematic for SpaceX, which survives off federal government contracts and looks unfavorably on drug use, etc. On Feb. 5, Daiwa analyst Jairam Nathan downgraded Tesla stock to Hold from Buy. He lowered its target price by $50 to $195, about $5 higher than its current share price. \u201cWe see corporate governance concerns aggravating already tough financial conditions in 2024,\u201d Barron\u2019s reported Nathan\u2019s comments in his report to clients. Analysts are generally bullish until they\u2019re not. You can see they\u2019re losing patience. If more of those sitting on the fence with a Hold rating move to a Sell, Tesla stock could see double digits, a level it hasn\u2019t seen since July 2020.
