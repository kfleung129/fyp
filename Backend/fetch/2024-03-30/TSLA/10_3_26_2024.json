    "text": "Morgan Stanley\u00a0analyst and Tesla Inc TSLA bull\u00a0Adam Jonas believes a partnership between the U.S. EV giant and Chinese battery maker CATL could be a game-changer with the \u2018power-couple\u2019 potentially recharging the U.S. EV market. What Happened: Jonas believes that the U.S. EV market is in dire need of high-quality cheaper batteries for which it needs to rely on China despite the complicated geopolitics and security concerns. While the U.S. EV market is under-penetrated, China\u2019s is highly penetrated with an oversupply of batteries, he noted. The analyst was referring to recent reports that CATL is working with Tesla on a fast-charging battery in Nevada. Neither of the two companies have confirmed the report. However, the U.S. EV giant is looking to make a cheaper EV, expected to be priced around $25,000, and would require Chinese cooperation to enable this price point, as per Jonas. Currently, CATL cannot sell directly into the U.S. but can license their battery tech for a royalty fee. \u201cWe\u2019ve long written about the need for the US to engage with (\u2018on-ramp\u2019) Chinese EV technology to drive higher EV penetration. In our view, this will require a degree of westernization of Chinese tech to be palatable in the US given the rising protectionist sentiment (both in the US and Europe),\u201d the note read. Jonas has a price target of $320 on Tesla and an \u2018overweight\u2019 rating. Price Action: Tesla shares closed up 2.92% at $177.67 on Tuesday. The stock is down nearly 28.5% year-to-date, according to\u00a0Benzinga Pro. Check out more of Benzinga's Future Of Mobility coverage by\u00a0following this link.
