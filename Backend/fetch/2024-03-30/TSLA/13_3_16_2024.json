    "text": "CFRA Research analyst and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) bull Garrett Nelson believes that the current fall in the EV giant\u2019s stock is not surprising given shares more than doubled last year. What Happened: Despite Tesla shares falling about 34% year-to-date, the analyst is optimistic about Tesla and maintains a \u2018buy\u2019 rating on the stock. Tesla, Nelson said in an interview with Fox Business on Thursday, has a great balance sheet, is in the process of ramping up Cybertruck production, is expected to unveil their mass-market electric vehicle later this year, and has a new factory coming up in Mexico. \u201cTesla is a lot different than the company it was three or four years ago,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cThere are plenty of catalysts.\u201d While several legacy automakers are pulling back on their EV targets, smaller EV manufacturers such as Fisker are facing a lot of distress, the analyst noted. This, he added, gives Tesla the chance to really grow its market share in the coming years. \u201cWe kind of view Tesla as the best house on a bad block in the Western market, you know, looking at North America and Europe, but there is certainly a ton of competition coming from China,\u201d the analyst said.  Analyst Rating: Nelson holds a \u201cbuy\u201d rating on Tesla with a price target of $275. The analyst believes the EV giant will become the world\u2019s largest auto manufacturer by the end of this decade, surpassing Japanese automaker Toyota Motor. Price Action:\u00a0Tesla shares closed 0.66% higher on Friday at $163.57, according to\u00a0Benzinga Pro. Check out more of Benzinga's Future Of Mobility coverage by\u00a0following this link.
