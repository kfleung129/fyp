    "text": " You waited for a pullback in TSLA stock and now you got it, so quit worrying and start investing Advertisement Source: Roschetzky Photography / Shutterstock.com Electric vehicle manufacturer\u00a0Tesla\u00a0(NASDAQ:TSLA) might not stay in the prestigious \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d or \u201cMag-7\u201d club much longer. Tesla\u00a0is out of favor for the moment, and you may be tempted to get rid of your shares. Don\u2019t let temporary sentiment shifts cloud your TSLA stock outlook, though. Indeed, I\u2019d say now is the time to buy what the worry warts are selling. Sure, Tesla has its fair share of challenges. As we\u2019ll discuss in a moment, an analyst just downgraded Tesla stock. The reward-to-risk balance is favorable and volatility-tolerant investors should stay in the trade for the long haul. Because the financial press always places Tesla\u00a0under the proverbial microscope, investors can always from excuses to sell Tesla stock. For example, Tesla\u2019s fourth-quarter 2023 revenue came in at\u00a0$25.1 billion, up 3% year over year. Some stock traders might not feel that 3% revenue growth is good enough nowadays. However, I suspect investors can be too demanding nowadays, insisting on blockbuster sales growth every quarter. Another excuse to sell TSLA stock is a recent Bloomberg report that hints at potentially imminent Tesla layoffs. More precisely, the report stated that Tesla \u201cmanagers were asked to affirm whether each of their employees\u2019 positions is critical.\u201d What some people will surely miss is that Tesla has, according to the same Bloomberg report, \u201croughly doubled its workforce since 2020.\u201d So, even if Tesla lets some workers go, this ought to be expected after a bout of over-hiring activity. Now moving on to the good news, Tesla is restarting construction of the company\u2019s \u201cgiga-factory\u201d in Berlin, Germany. As you may recall, construction was paused because of disruptions in the Red Sea. If you want to sell your TSLA stock because of possible Tesla layoffs, consider this. If Tesla is in such terrible condition, would the company be building a gigantic EV-production factory now? Tesla\u2019s problems in China might be subsiding. I say that because Tesla\u2019s EV sales in China increased by around 8% YOY in January 2024 (according to a Barron\u2019s report). Again, some folks won\u2019t be impressed with 8% sales growth because only blockbuster sales figures are acceptable anymore. Just bear in mind, though, that Tesla must take baby steps forward in China\u2019s highly competitive EV market, which isn\u2019t always friendly to U.S.-based automakers. The Tesla\u00a0share price went down in early 2023 and the company fell out of favor for a moment. Tesla could get kicked out of the \u201cMag-7\u201d at some point this year as a result. This actually makes my TSLA stock outlook more optimistic, not less. People sometimes ask for the market to give them a share-price dip, but then they don\u2019t take advantage of the opportunity. I encourage investors to consider taking a share position in Tesla while the skeptics, as usual, look for excuses throw in the towel.
