    "text": "According to Elon Musk Tesla is really \u201can AI/robotics company\u201d. Tesla shares slipped last week after Chinese company BYD overtook it as the world\u2019s biggest-selling electric vehicle (EV) maker in the fourth quarter of 2023. BYD and other Chinese companies \u201care set to conquer the world market\u201d with low-cost EVs, said UBS, but Tesla\u2019s $760 billion market capitalisation remains almost 10 times that of BYD. Tesla has many sceptics regarding its elevated valuation, but comparisons with BYD miss the point, says Elon Musk, who tweeted that Tesla \u201cis an AI/robotics company that appears to many to be a car company\u201d. Musk had made the same point just days earlier, responding to Roth Capital\u2019s criticism that Tesla was \u201cegregiously overvalued\u201d compared to Toyota. Roth\u2019s analyst \u201chas the wrong frame of reference\u201d, said Musk, because Tesla is really \u201can AI/robotics company\u201d. Fanciful? Perhaps. After all, Tesla is invariably described in the financial media as an electric car company, not an AI/robotics company. Indeed, as American financial journalist Herb Greenberg notes in his Substack newsletter, Tesla\u2019s own financial accounts confirm some 95 per cent of its revenue comes from \u201cautomotive\u201d sources. Tesla uses the words \u201cautomotive\u201d and \u201cautomobile\u201d 138 and 49 times, respectively, in its 10-K filing, adds Greenberg \u2013 a lot more than \u201cAI\u201d (six) and \u201crobotics\u201d (three). Tesla\u2019s regulatory filings contain various warnings about the competitive and cyclical nature of the global car market, but warnings about AI or robotics are conspicuous by their absence. Tesla bulls might say such snark ignores the fact markets have never valued Tesla as a mere car maker, but as a tech stock of sorts. True \u2013 but describing it as an AI/robotics company is pushing it. \u00a9 2024 The Irish Times DAC \u00a9 2024 The Irish Times DAC "
