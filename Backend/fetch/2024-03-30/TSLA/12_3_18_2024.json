Musk recently shared an amazing video on X of a customized Cybertruck that looked like it belonged on Mars. In the video, the custom car can be seen driving through the sandy rough terrain while going at 50 mph. READ MORE! Elon Musk responds after man builds fully functional Cybertruck out of wood for $15,000 The custom car dubbed \u2018Cyberrail\u2019 was made by YouTuber, Dave Sparks. Previously, the YouTuber had added snowmobile tracks to the Cybertruck and plowed it through the snow. This time he has done something less crazy but equally amazing. The custom Cybertruck even got the attention of Tesla owner Elon Musk who retweeted the video. Sparks had planned on building a full long travel suspension for the Cybertruck, but couldn\u2019t due to lack of time. However, they did build new control arms and a custom steel frame to prevent the truck from cracking. They also installed full Raptor Fox suspension and beefier steering components to stabilize the vehicle. Since the Cybertruck is a 7500-pound chunk of stainless steel, it is not built for offroading as the truck\u2019s suspension is quite weak. Sparks had to strip the truck\u2019s suspension and then install a new one. All of this was done to protect the truck from the tremendous force when driving it on off-road trails. He had done the same thing for his last project when he installed snow track rails on the truck. Images of the custom truck were also shared by Supercar Ron on X. The truck also has a custom SpaceX decal on the back left side of the car that really makes it look like Cybertruck Mars edition. There\u2019s also the paddle tires and wide-body customization that completes the entire look. Let\u2019s just hope that this doesn\u2019t give Musk any ideas to launch the truck to Mars, just like he did with the Tesla Roadster.
