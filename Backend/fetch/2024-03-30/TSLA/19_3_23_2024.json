    "text": "The projected down trend from last year with an extreme low value of $70 along with the update indicating it was not likely to brake $210 before declining farther have been very upopular but also very accurate forcasts.\n\nCurrently Tesla is showing a very familiar and very bullish pattern that will likely lead to a significant relief rally that could certainly turn... Reasons for bullish bias:\n- Price bounced from support\n- Price-tested channel support\n- Strong bullish divergence\n\nHere are the recommended trading levels:\nEntry Level(CMP): 173.80\nStop Loss Level: 155.80\nTake Profit Level 1: 191.8\nTake Profit Level 2: 209.8\nTake Profit Level 3: Open (REPOSTED) - I made the same post on 31/07, but now it is hidden by Tradingview.\n\n ...but you wouldn't believe it. \n\nThe asset shows signs of being close to its ascent towards new price discoveries after a corrective period.\n\nObserve the consolidation patterns of waves II and IV. The first corrective period was long, so this one tends to be short.\n\nNotice how the... Please pay special attention to the very accurate trend, channel, and colored levels are very useful.\n************* red level as SL *********\nIts a very sensitive setup, please be careful.\n\nBEST,\nMT TSLA is doing same think it did last time, flush out lot of bulls.\nI think if there is any more downside it should be 145.\n\nThe volatility during the FOMC will impact tesla, but should bounce back stronger.\nDollar cost averaging is best.\n\nBuying between 145 to 170 is what I'm looking at.\n\nCheers,\nHappy investing  NASDAQ:TSLA In a strategic maneuver to bolster sales and navigate shifting market dynamics, Tesla ( NASDAQ:TSLA ) recently announced price hikes for its Model Y electric vehicles across select regions, triggering a surge in its stock price amidst a backdrop of evolving challenges and opportunities.\n\nSeizing Momentum Amidst Price Adjustments:\nTesla's decision to increase Model... It\u2019s going to take a while but when it breaks out it\u2019s going to be awesome My TSLA forecast has been one of my most accurate predictions so far, and TSLA has reached the $164.76  price target discussed in my previous updates.  NASDAQ:TSLA  initially dipped below the $164.76 support level, but had a bullish rebound at the support line. TSLA is red today, but could be forming a bullish retest of the $164.76 support line. I would keep an... yuhhhh plane booked to bora bora what is going on cuhhhh im about to take a bath im so wet TSLA has been a solid short but I have a hard time believing that this stock is down for the count. Apparently I am not the only person who is thinking this way because in spite of the downside price action, the RSI (Relative Strength Index) is indicating that sentiment is overall bullish still and price should reflect it in the short term. I don\u2019t know if I feel... Looking for a gap up into the 24h PotterBox I have outlined. If we gap up into the floor, I like TSLA long. Hello,\nThis is my trading plan for the start of next week. If this was a normal week, without much economic news, I would be much more confident about what will happen, but remember, this week is the Fed meeting and that can change a lot. On the other hand, after the close on Friday, a price hike on the Model Y in  US and EU was also announced, which I believe... Sentiment is starting to feel a lot like May 2019 all over again.\n\nLet's look at the facts in the charts:\n\n152 will be a major support level if not the most likely bottom\n\nThe RSI on our CM Ultimate indicator is at 34, a level that once we close at, tells us further downside is highly probable for about 1-4 more weeks\n\nIn my last post I indicated how in the worst... Nailed my last analysis on  NASDAQ:TSLA  hitting $170 or less and wanted to look for an entry for a CALL option to catch a dead cat bounce or better,  THE REVERSAL  back to $200. Either way, Quad-witching hour is tomorrow so we will definitely see crazy PA on everything.  VERY RISKY  play and should not put in what you cant afford to lose. TSLA weekly chart downtrend, bearish and downtrend. \nBased on price structure, TSLA forming support and resistant at every 50$ range, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300 ... \n\nMCDX Retailer still dominating the chart with 81% selling. \nFIFT still -ve indicating Bear still in control. \nAnother Slow Turtle signal triggered and is about to retest 150 support zone. \n\nPlan : \nWait... Daily is winding up to an inflection point, while the weekly is getting close as well. I'm favoring the bearish break; but there is a chance for a bullish reversal- so time will tell. What I can say is that we're approaching a conclusive point in time that will send price with signifcant momentum in either direction. When I look for an inflection point I watch for... Next major support $156 ish.  New target is $187 and we could go significantly highly on any short squeezes market melt ups or good news.  \n\nThat last break of support was annoying, a total loss for me, but thankfully I did so well on AAPL put credit spreads and calls I didn't notice the loss, it's all part of this business ladies and gents, we all make mistakes... TSLA boxes drawn. Looking for a move up into PotterBox resistance levels. Took a handfull of cxts looking for a gap up Monday morning. A bit of a risky play but, I was fairly confident in the play.
