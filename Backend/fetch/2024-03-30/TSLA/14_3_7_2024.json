    "text": "KUALA LUMPUR (March 7): Tesla Inc is no longer one of the 10 largest US companies by market capitalisation, dropping out of that elite club on Wednesday for the first time in 13 months. In a report on Wednesday, MarketWatch, which provides financial information, business news, analysis, and stock market data, said the electric vehicle company ended Wednesday\u2019s session with a US$562.24 billion (RM2.65 trillion) market cap, putting it behind Visa Inc, which finished the day at US$563.37 billion. The website said Tesla last ranked outside the top 10 on Jan 20, 2023, according to Dow Jones Market Data. It last trailed Visa a few days later, on Jan 25, 2023. MarketWatch said Tesla shares lost 2.3% in Wednesday\u2019s session, racking up their third consecutive trading day of declines. It said the stock is off 12.9% over that three-session stretch and down about 29% on a year-to-date basis. Tesla\u2019s stock selloff so far this year has erased US$228 billion from the company\u2019s market cap, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The stock has come under recent pressure as Wall Street worries about factors such as price cuts and China trends.    Copyright \u00a9 1999-2023 The Edge Communications Sdn.
