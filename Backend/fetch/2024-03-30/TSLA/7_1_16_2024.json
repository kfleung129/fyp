Invest Now Billionaire Elon Musk recently shared a video featuring Tesla's Optimus robot expertly folding a shirt. However, as the virtual dust settled on social media platforms, Musk was forced to clarify that the seemingly autonomous feat was not a current reality but a tantalizing glimpse into the future. Musk had earlier showcased the prowess of Tesla's Optimus robot in various tasks, from yoga stretches to delicate egg handling. The latest demonstration, though, sparked skepticism, with users dissecting the video on social media. \u201cOptimus folds a shirt,\u201d read the caption of Musk\u2019s video. Half hour later, he had a follow up. \"Important note: Optimus cannot yet do this autonomously, but certainly will be able to do this fully autonomously and in an arbitrary environment (won't require a fixed table with box that has only one shirt),\" the owner of X wrote.Important note: Optimus cannot yet do this autonomously, but certainly will be able to do this fully autonomously and in an arbitrary environment (won\u2019t require a fixed table with box that has only one shirt) \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 15, 2024Notable tech YouTuber Marques Brownlee queried Musk about the video's authenticity. \"This is a video, not CG?\" Brownlee asked. Musk did not respond. As discussions unfolded, users on Threads pointed out peculiarities in the footage. A slow-motion analysis suggested potential inconsistencies, as the shirt manipulated itself at times. Observant eyes also caught a glimpse of a gloved hand in the video's periphery, raising suspicions about remote operation rather than true autonomy. Many chimed in with jokes. One wrote, \"My mom would\u2019ve already taken its place and said: Too slow, I\u2019ll do it. I always have to do everything around here.\" Despite the skepticism, Musk's ardent supporters rallied on X, showering praise on the visionary entrepreneur. Lex Friedman, a podcaster known for engaging conversations with Musk, commended the effort with an enthusiastic \"Amazing work.\" While there is no timeline on when Musk\u2019s video becomes a reality, other advances in robotics and Artificial Intelligence has stumped the world with many asking to exercise caution against deepfake videos and other scams.
