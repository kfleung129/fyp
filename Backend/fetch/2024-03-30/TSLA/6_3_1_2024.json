Showcasing the ease with which Nxu\u2019s charging technology charged the Cybertruck exemplifies our commitment to improve EV technology and provide EV owners with efficient, reliable, and cutting-edge charging solutions,\u201d said Nxu CEO Mark Hanchett. Nxu shares are charging higher on heavy trading volume following the announcement.

Buying shares is typically done through a brokerage account. You can find a list of possible trading platforms here. Many will allow you to buy \u2018fractional shares,' which allows you to own portions of stock without buying an entire share. For example, some stock, like Berkshire Hathaway, or Amazon.com, can cost thousands of dollars to own just one share. However, if you only want to invest a fraction of that, brokerages will allow you to do so. In the the case of Nxu, which is trading at $1.14 as of publishing time, $100 would buy you 87.72 shares of stock. If you're looking to bet against a company, the process is more complex. You'll need access to an options trading platform, or a broker who will allow you to \u2018go short' a share of stock by lending you the shares to sell. The process of shorting a stock can be found at this resource. Otherwise, if your broker allows you to trade options, you can either buy a put option, or sell a call option at a strike price above where shares are currently trading \u2013 either way it allows you to profit off of the share price decline. NXU Price Action: According to Benzinga Pro, Nxu shares are up 35% at $1.08 at the time of publication. Image: GGBot from Pixabay \u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.
