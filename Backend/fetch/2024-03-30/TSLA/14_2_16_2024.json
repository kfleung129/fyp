New photos show the pop star in one of the new and highly-coveted Tesla Cybertrucks. Images shared on X showed Gaga leaving a Whole Foods Market with a few coffees and hopping into the passenger seat of the swanky new truck. Only the highly connected appear to have gotten first dibs on the truck, which Tesla started delivering to customers in November. One of the lucky customers was Serena Williams' husband, Reddit cofounder Alexis Ohanian. Meanwhile, stars like Spike Lee were still on the waitlist at the time, Business Insider previously reported. Related stories Gaga has been dating tech executive Michael Polansky since 2020, and the two were recently pictured at the Super Bowl looking cozy while cheering for the San Francisco 49ers. Polansky works for Sean Parker, the cofounder of Napster and former president of Facebook. Gaga and Polansky reportedly met through Parker.

A request for comment to Polansky via social media was not immediately returned on Friday. The different models of the truck range in cost from $66,990 all the way up to nearly $100,000, Business Insider previously reported.
