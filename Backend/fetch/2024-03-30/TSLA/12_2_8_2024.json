    "text": "Data released by the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA) has revealed the details of Tesla\u2019s January 2024 results. Last month, Tesla China\u2019s wholesale figures were listed at 71,447 vehicles, which included cars that were sold in the domestic market and exported abroad. Out of the 71,447 total vehicles that Tesla China sold last month, 31,556 units were exported abroad, as per recent CPCA data. This was down 19.5% from the 39,208 vehicles that were exported from Giga Shanghai in January 2023, but up 72.2% from December 2023. Tesla China sold 39,891 vehicles in the domestic Chinese market in January 2024. This is quite an interesting result, as it represents a 48.6% year-over-year improvement from the 26,843 units that were sold in the domestic Chinese market in January 2023. It also represents the best January for Tesla China\u2019s domestic sales to date. $TSLA \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\uddf3Tesla China registered 39,891 vehicles in domestic(retail) demand in January.\u2013 Export : 31,556\u2013 Model Y : 41,873 (YoY +2.4%)\u2013 Model 3 : 29,574 (YoY +17.6%) pic.twitter.com/x05WE5q8rO Tesla China\u2019s domestic sales in January 2024 are quite encouraging, especially since the electric vehicle maker tends to prioritize exports earlier in the first weeks of a quarter. The company\u2019s strong local deliveries in January suggest that the demand for the Giga Shanghai-made Model 3 sedan and Model Y crossover among local consumers is quite substantial. The CPCA also provided a breakdown of Tesla China\u2019s sales last month. From the 71,447 vehicles that were sold domestically and exported abroad, 41,873 were Model Y and 29,574 were Model 3, as per the CPCA. This suggests that until last month, sales from Giga Shanghai were still heavily skewed towards the best-selling all-electric crossover.

This means that Tesla China held a 5.97% share of the domestic NEV market in January. For comparison, Tesla China held an 8.02% share of the country\u2019s NEV market in December 2023, as noted in a\u00a0CNEV Post\u00a0report. Tesla China\u2019s share in the country\u2019s BEV segment, however, was more notable in January 2024. China saw about 376,000 sales of battery electric vehicles last month. This means that Tesla China accounted for over 10.61% of the country\u2019s overall BEV segment in January 2024. For comparison, Tesla China\u2019s share of the country\u2019s BEV market was 12.68% in December 2023. Don\u2019t hesitate to contact us with news tips.
