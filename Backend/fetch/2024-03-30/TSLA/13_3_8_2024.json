    "text": "Tesla, Inc. shares have been experiencing a downward trend recently. This is primarily due to concerns about the potential impact on first-quarter deliveries. The company faced a shutdown at the Giga Berlin factory, which resulted in a power outage. The production was halted until March 17. This shutdown is projected to result in a loss of 9,000 units in production for Tesla. Furthermore, Tesla's sales numbers in China saw a significant drop in February. This has added to the wider concerns in the electric vehicle (EV) market. These developments have led to predictions of further reductions in delivery estimates in the upcoming weeks.
