    "text": " Tesla's dominance of the EV future is coming under threat Advertisement Source: Khairil Azhar Junos/Shutterstock.com Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock remains the world\u2019s most valuable auto company and by a wide margin. With a market cap of $558 billion, it\u2019s worth $230 billion more than Toyota Motor (NYSE:TM), which is second at $329 billion. But the lead is narrowing. Toyota stock is up 75% over the last year. Tesla\u2019s is flat. No other car company is worth over $100 billion. But after years of dominating the Electric Vehicle (EV) market, with investors insisting it\u2019s more like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) than General Motors (NYSE:GM), the posse of competitors chasing Tesla may finally be closing in. Or are they? I wrote about TSLA stock a few weeks ago, when its market cap was $330 billion ahead of Toyota\u2019s. I noted Tesla\u2019s need for a product line refresh. I called CyberTruck a giant failure. That\u2019s not just because of the truck\u2019s faults. It\u2019s because its development took Tesla\u2019s attention away from continuing to scale production of lower-priced cars. That failure is illustrated by the Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) R3. It\u2019s a little smaller than the Tesla Model Y. It looks better and (most important) it will cost less. Even if the R3 never makes it into mass production, there are other challengers. BMW (OTCMKTS:BMWYY) sold 376,000 EVs last year, up 75% in a year, and its EVs are profitable. Then there\u2019s China\u2019s BYD (OTCMKTS:BYDDF), whose $15,000 Seagull is so good that American policymakers are desperately trying to delay its entry into our market. BYD insists its coming plant in Mexico isn\u2019t a bid to enter the U.S. market, that it will only be supplying Latin America. But market share is market share. Kill America\u2019s export markets, and you\u2019re killing American brands. Elon Musk still has his fans. They cheered his threats to move Tesla to Texas after Delaware rejected his latest stock grant proposal. But making yourself the face of a company has its downsides. Musk, once a hero to environmentalists, found himself slamming \u201ceco-terrorists\u201d when electricity to Tesla\u2019s German plant was sabotaged. His personal politics have made him a villain to people who should be Tesla customers. What Musk believes may not be relevant to the Tesla investment case. What is relevant is his devotion to the company. This has been continuous in good times and bad. So long as Musk\u2019s favorite charity is Musk, investors will forgive a lot. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, who has succeeded Cathie Wood as the tech industry\u2019s most prominent bull, is telling investors to stay \u201clong and strong\u201d in Tesla. Ives has been right on many things lately, especially artificial intelligence (AI). TSLA stock has its own AI, called Grok, which it intends to integrate with its cars. It\u2019s all part of Musk building an \u201cecosystem\u201d around Tesla, with charging, insurance, and service all part of the package. He\u2019s clearly winning on charging. Tesla still dominates the EV market. It\u2019s good to be the King. But any crown hangs heavy on its wearer. Every success brings rising expectations. Apple is up 13% in the last year, but that\u2019s half the gain of the S&P average. There are signs that the stock market is broadening and that 2024\u2019s big gains won\u2019t be in the \u201cMagnificent Seven.\u201d This includes the Cloud Czars, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Tesla. Tesla faces many challenges. Will its cars really drive themselves, and what will it cost Tesla if they can\u2019t? Can it maintain its lead in batteries alongside partner Panasonic (OTCMKTS:PCRFY)? Might CATL, which also supplies Tesla, gain control? I don\u2019t know. I do know there are enough questions here to give me pause. The posse is coming for Tesla, and they\u2019re hot on its trail.
