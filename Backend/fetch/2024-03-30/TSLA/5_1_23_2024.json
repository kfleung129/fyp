    "text": "Anski Electric vehicle maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) will report Q4 earnings on January 24. The Austin-based company is expected to report revenue of $25.8B and EPS of $0.74. The recent price cuts on some Tesla models in key regions have the gross margin line being closely watched. Tesla is forecast to report a gross margin rate of 18.1% vs. 17.9% in Q3 and 16.0% a year ago. Free cash flow is anticipated to come in at $1.45B for the quarter. Key topics will include the production guidance for 2024, trajectory of margins, and tech updates on AI/FSD/robotics. Wildcards in the mix include potential news of a new model introduction or a Gigafactory unveiling. There could also be some awkwardness if CEO Elon Musk is asked to clarify his recent threat to take AI initiatives outside of Tesla (TSLA) if he is not given more voting control. Looking ahead, Barclays thinks the most central theme for Tesla (TSLA) in 2024 is that it faces volume pressure in a demand-constrained environment. The reality is that 2024 could be the first time that Tesla's production volume will likely be more a function of demand than of reaching full production capacity. The firm expects Tesla to deliver 1.97M units in 2024, which is below the current consensus estimate of 2.1M units and far off from the 50% CAGR target laid out by Tesla several years ago. Morgan Stanley cut its price target to Tesla (TSLA) to $345 from $380 ahead of the report. The firm warned that there is continually growing evidence that the global EV market is in an unfavorable balance of growing supply vs. slowing demand based on the recent price cuts, expiration of EV incentives, excess capacity in China, EV fleet pullbacks, and political risk in an election year. Analyst Adam Jonas said the market may be approaching maximum market negativity on EVs, but believes the trough may happen towards the latter part of 2024 with EU Parliamentary and U.S. Presidential elections part of the equation. Options trading implies a swing in share price of 7% after the Tesla (TSLA) earnings report is released. Notably, Tesla fell 9% after its last earnings report. The stocks that have correlated the closest to Tesla on earnings day over the last year are Rivian Automotive (RIVN) and Polestar Automotive (PSNY). Meanwhile, high levels of short interest in the EV sector on Fisker (FSR), Lucid Group (LCID), VinFast Auto (VFS), Workhorse Group (WKHS), Canoo (GOEV), and NIO (NIO) mean those stocks could also be active after Tesla's earnings update and conference call at 5:30 p.m. Read the latest breakdowns on Tesla from Seeking Alpha analysts.
