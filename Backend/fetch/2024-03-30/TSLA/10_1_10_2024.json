    "text": "Legendary investor Warren Buffett holds Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk in high regard. He called him \u201ca brilliant, brilliant guy\u201d at his company Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s (BRK.B) annual shareholders meeting in 2023. \u201cHe dreams about things, and his dreams have got a foundation.\u201d He also noted, \u201cWe don't want to compete with Elon in a lot of things.\u201d Commercial real estate has outperformed the S&P 500 over 25 years. Here's how to diversify your portfolio without the headache of being a landlord Take control of your finances in 2024: 5 money moves to start the new year off strong The US dollar has lost 87% of its purchasing power since 1971 \u2014 invest in this stable asset before you lose your retirement fund Buffett\u2019s right-hand man, the late Charlie Munger, concurred. \u201cWe don\u2019t want that much failure,\u201d he said. Musk\u2019s accomplishments, often overshadowed by his controversial statements and actions, are indeed remarkable. As an electric vehicle (EV) pioneer, Tesla has transformed the automotive industry and provided enormous returns to investors, with shares soaring over 900% in the past five years. Today, the company boasts a market cap of about $764 billion, which is several times bigger than Ford and General Motors combined. Yet, Buffett hasn't entirely sidestepped the EV race. Enter BYD, a Chinese EV manufacturer that has been a part of Buffett's closely-watched portfolio for more than a decade. BYD stands for Build Your Dreams. In 2008, Berkshire Hathaway acquired 225 million shares of BYD for $232 million. The investment proved highly lucrative. By the end of 2020, as stated in Berkshire\u2019s shareholder letter, their stake was valued at approximately $5.9 billion. However, despite Buffett\u2019s preference for long-term investments \u2014 he famously said that his favorite holding period is \u201cforever\u201d \u2014 he's not opposed to trimming positions. Since late 2022, the Oracle of Omaha has been reducing his stake in BYD. An October 2023 stock exchange filing reported on by Reuters revealed Berkshire sold another 820,500 Hong Kong-listed shares of BYD, though it still retained a sizable 7.98% stake. And while BYD might not be well-known to North American investors, it certainly warrants attention, having recently surpassed Tesla in a key metric.

BYD sold 526,409 EVs in Q4 of 2023, surging past its American rival for the first time. The Chinese company's success has been attributed to various factors, including its broad lineup with inexpensive models, price cuts, its battery-manufacturing capability, and the Chinese government's support of the country's EV sector. BYD's shares are not listed in the U.S., but they are traded over-the-counter here, so American investors who want to buy the stock would need to choose a broker that supports trading them. And while BYD has surpassed Tesla in sales in the most recent quarter, its passenger EVs are not yet available in the U.S., where Tesla continues to dominate. \u201cIn the U.S., Tesla is still the dominant EV name,\u201d Barclays analyst Dan Levy said in a recent Bloomberg interview. Musk is also confident about the company\u2019s growth prospects. During Tesla\u2019s earnings conference call in October, an analyst asked about 2024 projections, citing Wall Street\u2019s forecast of Tesla delivering 2.3 million vehicles, and inquired about the timeline for the company's return to its long-term compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 50%. \u201cAt the risk of stating the obvious, it is not possible to have a compound growth rate of 50% forever, or you will exceed the mass of the known universe,\u201d Musk replied. \u201cI think we will grow very rapidly, much faster than any other car company on earth by far.\u201d The market\u2019s optimism for Tesla is also evident, as shares surged 101% in 2023. Wall Street sees further upside ahead. For instance, Morgan Stanley has an \u201coverweight\u201d rating on Tesla and a price target of $380 \u2014 roughly 60% above where the stock sits today.
