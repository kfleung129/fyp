    "text": "Tesla. Still the most actively traded stock most days, Tesla\nTSLA\n is no longer among those favorites of the Nasdaq 100 that the algorithms and humans just keep taking higher. It hasn\u2019t been officially kicked out of the \u201cMagnificent 7,\u201d but no one paying attention puts it on the same list as NVIDIA\nNVDA\n\nDIA\n and Microsoft\nMSFT\n anymore. Analysts could come up with differing views on the financial reasons for the months-long decline in value, but it\u2019s likely that investors have re-considered how they feel about Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk. His mind seems to be elsewhere a lot these days and that distracted quality has been noticed by recent Tesla shareholders. Hourly. Tesla hourly price chart, 3 25 24. From $205 in late February 2024 to the current $160 by mid-March, 2024, for a 22% loss from the high to the low on this chart. That took less than a month. It\u2019s rallied from the low back up to $172 which puts it just above the 50-hour moving average. The 200-hour moving average continues downward. Daily. Tesla daily price chart, 3 25 24. It looks like the late July 2023 high is up above $285 and it\u2019s never made it back to the level since then. It\u2019s a classic \u201clower highs and lower lows\u201d chart, signifying the presence of a downtrend. Every time it\u2019s gone up, sellers have entered. Note that the 50-day moving average crossed below the 200-day moving average at the end of January 2024. Weekly. Tesla weekly price chart, 3 25 24. The red-dotted line indicates the extent and duration of the downward trend from October 2021 to the present. The price has kept underneath the line from then until now. Long-term investors hoping that it would eventually surpass that $400 level have to be wondering whether that will ever take place. Monthly. Tesla monthly price chart, 3 25 24. It\u2019s a delightful \u201cto-the-moon\u201d look from early 2020 to the late 2021 peak. The price has been back down to earth since then, with an occasional rally to make it interesting. The January 2023 low of $100 looks as if that\u2019s the next significant support level. Point-and-figure chart. Tesla point-and-figure price chart, 3 25 24. Just to provide a different kind of perspective, this point and figure look shows the decline from the beginning of January 2024 to the present. The price has been below the red line the whole time. Will the low of $162 hold again?  "
