Unlike every other vehicle with an internal chassis that is constructed from steel and aluminum, the Cybertruck features an exoskeleton. The Cybertruck\u2019s exoskeleton is made out of 30X cold-rolled, thick, and ultra-strong stainless steel. This means the Cybertruck\u2019s body panels are not just there for cover but also as part of the truck's chassis.

The Cybertruck\u2019s chassis is so rigid that rather than to truck\u2019s, it\u2019s more appropriate to compare it to sports cars.

That\u2019s at least until over the weekend when Tesla officially released the Cybertruck Service manual; Owner\u2019s manual; and Collision Repair Producers manual on the company\u2019s free service portal. The full document is hundreds of pages long and contains every procedure necessary to repair or replace every part of the Cybertruck. \u201cCyberTRON\u201d \u2013 The Tesla Cybertruck\u2019s Even More Futuristic Cousin With $30,000 in Aftermarket Upgrades \u2013 Glow in the Dark Electrified Wrap, Purple Under-Glow Lights, 24-inch Cyberhex Wheels, Lowering Kit & More @Tesla @elonmusk #Tesla https://t.co/CF57RwMSx9\n\u2014 Torque News (@torquenewsauto) March 2, 2024 If you are a repair shop planning to work on Teslas, this is an incredible treasure trove worth diving into. Every part of the Cybertruck collision repair manual is interesting; however, some of the tidbits in the document are hard to believe positively. As I have mentioned, one of the biggest concerns regarding the Cybertruck was the repairability of the truck\u2019s exoskeleton in the event of an accident. However, we now know that although incredibly rigid, Tesla has assembled the Cybertruck\u2019s exoskeleton modularly, making it a breeze to repair and replace. For your reading pleasure, the following Cybertruck documents are now available on Tesla\u2019s website: Service Manual\nOwner\u2019s Manual\nCollision Repair Procedureshttps://t.co/YFgHFSQyb9 https://t.co/hsUBh9dIQJ pic.twitter.com/kuwyo0oaa8\n\u2014 Drive Tesla \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\udde6 (@DriveTeslaca) March 2, 2024 For example, the Cybertruck\u2019s rear quarter panel affectionately referred to as \u201cthe sail,\u201d is a good example. This enormous body panel, responsible for 30% of the truck\u2019s stiffness, bolts onto the rear casting with a few bolts. An X user, Nic Cruz Patane, has compared what it would take to do similar repair on a Ford F-150 truck. Nic writes on X, \u201cTraditionally, you would need to cut, rivet, weld, seal, primer, sand, then paint in any legacy style truck. This process normally takes 3-5 days to complete, but with Cybertruck, the process is MUCH simpler and cost-effective since less labor and materials are required to complete the repair. This is a GAME CHANGER.\u201d Cybertruck\u2019s rear quarter panel AKA the \u201cSail\u201d just simply bolts up to Cybertruck\u2019s rear casting.

Currently, this is all the information we have regarding Cybertruck\u2019s repairability; however, we\u2019ll be sure to keep you up-to-date as Tesla shares more Cybertruck information.
