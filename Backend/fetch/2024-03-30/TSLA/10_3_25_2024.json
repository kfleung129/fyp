    "text": "The Boring Company\u2019s (TBC) Prufrock 3 is in position to start digging at Tesla Giga Texas. The tunnel boring machine (TBM) has been at Tesla\u2019s Giga Texas site for quite some time now, and many are eager to see it start digging. \u201cThe [Boring Company] crews continue what appears to be final prep to start the Giga Texas tunnel, [and] I got video of crews entering in to the front of the drill head. Unsure what the delay is to begin tunneling, but indications seem to point to this happening soon,\u201d noted drone operator Joe Tegtmeyer on X.

He was among the first to spot Prufrock 3 parts at Tesla\u2019s Texas gigafactory. TBC started shipping and\u00a0assembling Prufrock 3 parts at Giga Texas\u00a0in January. Tegtmeyer and a few others closely following the project estimate that The Boring Company\u2019s TBM will dig 14 meters (55 feet) below the highway surface. It will dig a tunnel about 300 meters long that leads to Giga Texas. Earlier this month, a photo of Prufrock 3 showed that the\u00a0TBM looked lined up to launch. Recent images show that Prufrock 3 is angled to porpoise or launch directly from the surface and break into the ground. The tunnel boring machine will break the ground and resurface at the other end of the tunnel. If you have any tips, contact me at maria@teslarati.com or via X @Writer_01001101.
