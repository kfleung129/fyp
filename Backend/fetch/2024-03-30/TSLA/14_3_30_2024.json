    "text": "Tesla Inc, the electric vehicle giant, is anticipated to announce its first-quarter production and delivery figures next week. The company is navigating a challenging first quarter, with potential year-over-year declines in sales, especially in the U.S. and China. This could lead to a sequential decline from the fourth quarter. Analysts have been revising their estimates for Tesla due to concerns such as electric vehicle demand and macroeconomic issues. Consequently, there have been several reductions in delivery estimates for the company. Based on the first quarter results, it is probable that more estimate reductions will be made for the full year. So far in 2024, Tesla's shares have seen a year-to-date decline of 29%. A weak delivery figure from the company next week could potentially impact the share price further. Traders and investors use our platform.
