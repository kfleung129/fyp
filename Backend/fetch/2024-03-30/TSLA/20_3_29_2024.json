    "text": "Tesla has announced that it produced its 6 millionth electric vehicle \u2013 a big milestone amid a major slow down in its growth rate. While BYD has recently surpassed Tesla in terms of new BEV production capacity, Tesla is still the kind in terms of overall BEV deployment. Today, the automaker announced that it produced its 6 millionth electric car: Produced our 6 millionth car! Thank you to our owners & teams around the world for your support & hard work\u2014it truly matters. \ud83c\udf0e\ud83c\udf0d\ud83c\udf0f\u2764\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/F4IeQtK0PS It comes just over 6 months after the company announced its 5 millionth vehicle produced in September 2023. Before that, Tesla announced its 4 millionth vehicle produced in early March 2023. It means that Tesla hasn\u2019t really accelerated its production rate over the last year. That\u2019s despite Tesla claiming that its installed production capacity has greatly increased over the last year: But the installed production capacity is not always fully utilized on top of Tesla having some demand issues now. We all like to make fun of Elon these days. But good for Tesla, this is a big deal. I\u2019m glad they have been leaders in clean energy and I hope they continue to make electric products for a long time. Congrats. That\u2019s quite an accomplishment. However, it does show that Tesla\u2019s production rate haven\u2019t changed much in the last year despite the automaker increasing the capacity at Gigafactory Shanghai, Gigafactory Berlin, and adding Cybertruck production at Gigafactory Texas. At this point, it\u2019s clear that Tesla is not just adjusting prices to match demand, but it is also throtling production capacity. As we preivously reported, it is expected that Tesla could see its growth completely wiped out in Q1 2024. FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links. More.
