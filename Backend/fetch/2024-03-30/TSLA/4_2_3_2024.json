What Happened:  Lars Lengacker, an associate quality engineer at Tesla Germany, earlier this week posted a video on LinkedIn of a silver Model Y with several t-shirts on it. The t-shirts pose graphics reading \u201c1k,\u201d \u201c2k\u201d, \u201c3k\u201d and so on, hinting at the weekly production milestones achieved at the Giga Berlin factory. One of the t-shirts has \u201c6k\u201d printed on it, hinting that the company has achieved that milestone as well. Director of Quality Bob Foulkes also took to LinkedIn to acknowledge the engineer\u2019s post and wrote, \u201cYour post is something that we all feel at Giga, something that pulses through us, a pride in what we've achieved.\u00a0The hood of your new beautiful Quicksilver Model Y scattered with trophies of our achievements \u2013 1K all the way to 6K and beyond.\u201d Foulkes also posted a picture of the workers at the factory donning the 6K t-shirt, hinting that the company has indeed achieved the target. However, Tesla is yet to officially confirm this landmark achievement. Why It Matters: Giga Berlin\u00a0achieved a weekly production capacity of 5,000 vehicles\u00a0in March. The factory currently has an annual capacity to produce 375,000 Model Ys. Last month, Tesla reduced the prices of the\u00a0Model Y\u00a0in Germany by 1,900 euros ($2,065.6) on the base version and a more substantial 5,000 euros on Long Range and Performance versions. The rear-wheel-drive variant of the SUV is now listed at 42,990 euros on the company's Europe website, while the Long Range version is priced at 49,990 euros, and the Performance version at 55,990 euros.
