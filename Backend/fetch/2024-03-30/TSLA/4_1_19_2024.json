    "text": "Electric carmaker Tesla Motors TSLA is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2023 results on Jan 24 after market close.Tesla has been struggling since the start of 2024 on price cuts of its electric vehicles in China and Europe as well as supply chain delays due to a crisis in the Red Sea. The stock has plunged about 12% in the initial weeks of 2024, erasing $91 billion in market capitalization, according to data from Refinitiv.With this slide, Tesla is just up 1.5% in the past three months. However, Tesla has the potential to stage a comeback if it beats estimates in the to-be-reported quarter (see: all the Alternative Energy ETFs here).ETFs having a substantial allocation to this luxury carmaker like Direxion Daily TSLA Bull 1.5X Shares TSLL, MeetKevin Pricing Power ETF PP, Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund XLY, Simplify Volt Robocar Disruption and Tech ETF VCAR and Fidelity MSCI Consumer Discretionary Index ETF FDIS are in focus ahead of its fourth-quarter earnings. Tesla has an Earnings ESP of -1.04% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). According to our methodology, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 increases the chances of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they\u2019re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.The electric carmaker saw positive earnings estimate revision of a penny over the past 30 days for the to-be-reported quarter. Analysts increasing estimates right before earnings \u2014 with the most up-to-date information possible \u2014 is a good indicator for the stock. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter indicates a substantial year-over-year earnings decline of 37.8% and revenue growth of 6.9%. The earnings track record of the company is robust. It delivered a four-quarter average earnings surprise of 3.22%.Tesla has a solid Growth Score of B but falls under a bottom-ranked Zacks industry (bottom 31%).Tesla currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 2.63 on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell etc.) made by 28 brokerage firms. The current ABR compares to an ABR of 2.61 a month ago based on 27 recommendations.Of the 28 recommendations deriving the current ABR, eight are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 28.57% and 7.14% of all recommendations. A month ago, Strong Buy made up 29.63%, while Buy represented 7.41%.Based on short-term price targets offered by 24 analysts, the average price target for Tesla comes to $242.38. The forecasts range from a low of $85.00 to a high of $380.00. Earlier this month, Tesla reported record deliveries for the fourth quarter and exceeded analysts\u2019 estimates. The electric carmaker also met its full-year delivery target. This reflects a continuation of Tesla's strong growth trajectory in the electric vehicle market.The leading electric carmaker delivered a record 484,507 (461,538 Model 3 and Y and 22,969 Model S and X) cars worldwide in the fourth quarter, beating Street estimates of 483,173.
