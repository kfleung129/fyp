Dell posted a picture of him standing with Musk on X (formerly Twitter), with the newly-launched Cybertruck in the background. \u201cThanks Elon Musk for the most impressive and inspiring tour of Tesla Giga Texas,\u201d Dell wrote. Musk replied: \u201cGood to see you\u201d. A follower commented: \u201cSo, when are you getting a Cybertruck? Just imagine it driving in Austin with a Dell logo on the side.\u201d \u201cNow you just need to make a Cybertruck-inspired Alienware computer,\u201d another X user wrote. Tesla reported $7.9 billion in net income and $25.2 billion in revenue during the fourth quarter of 2023, a 3 per cent growth from the same quarter last year. The electric car company registered a record delivery of 1.8 million EVs in 2023. Tesla, however, cautioned that the growth of its vehicle sales \u201cmay be notably lower\u201d in 2024 as it prepares to launch a new vehicle platform for cheaper EVs. The company is now focused on bringing the next generation platform to market as quickly as it can, with the plan to start production at Gigafactory Texas. \u201cThis platform will revolutionise how vehicles are manufactured,\u201d said Tesla. At Gigafactory Texas, it began production of the Cybertruck and delivered the first units to customers recently. (Agency) "
