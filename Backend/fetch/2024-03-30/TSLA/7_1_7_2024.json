    "text": "Elon Musk\u2019s lawyers have vehemently denied allegations of illegal drug use amid reports that Tesla and SpaceX executives are increasingly alarmed about his erratic behaviour. Alex Spiro, Mr Musk\u2019s lawyer, pushed back against claims made in The Wall Street Journal as he said the entrepreneur is \u201cregularly and randomly drug tested at SpaceX and has never failed a test\u201d. It came in response to reported accusations that Mr Musk\u2019s alleged drug use was causing alarm among executives, who feared it could cause harm to his businesses. Mr Musk\u2019s unpredictable behaviour prompted former Tesla director Linda Johnson Rice to avoid seeking re-election to the board in 2019, the newspaper claimed. The tech tycoon had sparked controversy when he smoked marijuana on Joe Rogan\u2019s podcast in 2018. He also revealed in August that he had a prescription to use ketamine as an antidepressant, while he has previously said he suffers from undiagnosed bipolar disorder and Asperger\u2019s syndrome. In response to the latest accusations regarding illegal drug use, Mr Musk said on social media: \u201cAfter that one puff with Rogan, I agreed, at Nasa\u2019s request, to do three years of random drug testing. Not even trace quantities were found of any drugs or alcohol.\u201d Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.
