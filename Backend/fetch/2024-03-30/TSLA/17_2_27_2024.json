Voahangy Rasetarinera, the owner of Giving Pies, posted her experience working with Tesla on an Instagram post titled, \u201cHow Tesla\u2019s Actions Hurt My Small Black Women-Owned Business.\u201d In the post, Rasetarinera said she received an inquiry on Feb. 14 from a Tesla employee named Laura for an order of 2,000 mini pies, but \u201ccomplications arose when the payment process was redirected.\u201d \u201cDespite this hurdle, I remained optimistic as I awaited payment,\u201d she said, but she \u201cgrew concerned\u201d when she didn\u2019t receive the payment. Rasetarinera said she heard back from Laura who apologized for not paying on time, and who requested to double the order to 4,000 pies. However, after preparing the extra order, Rasetarinera said she had still not received payment, and could not contact the Tesla employee. \u201c[M]y hopes were shattered when I received a text from Laura, CASUALLY informing me that the plan had changed and Tesla would no longer require the order,\u201d Rasetarinera wrote. \u201cThis abrupt reversal left me reeling, realizing the extent of the impact on my small business. I had invested time, resources, and effort based on assurances from Tesla, only to be left high and dry.\u201d After her story gained media attention, Tesla CEO Elon Musk responded on X, saying, he would \u201cmake things good with the bakery.\u201d \u201cPeople should always be able to count on Tesla trying its best,\u201d Musk wrote. Rasetarinera confirmed with The Guardian Monday that,\u201cTesla just paid the $2k that I was out of\u201d for the cost of ingredients for the order. She did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Quartz. Despite the fiasco with Tesla, Rasetarinera told ABC 7 sales at her small bakery were up after the story went viral, and she had to close the shop to catch up on orders. She also told the news outlet she would be open to working with Tesla again. \u201cI think that we\u2019re all humans, we all make mistakes, and they\u2019re trying to do good on their mistakes,\u201d Rasetarinera said, \u201cSo if they want to work with me, and they\u2019re not bitter about the whole experience - then yes, I would love to.\u201d Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.
