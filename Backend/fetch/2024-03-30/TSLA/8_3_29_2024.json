What Happened: Neoen will be responsible for handling the grid's system integrity, the\u00a0Financial Times\u00a0reports. Whereas, Tesla will supply its megapack technology.\u00a0The battery plant could be operational sometime towards the end of 2021. The 300-megawatt Victorian Big Battery plant will be located in Geelong city in Australia\u2019s second-most populous state \u2014\u00a0Victoria. The move is in sync with Australia\u2019s renewable energy targets. Presently, the Australian government is aiming for 50% power generation from renewable sources by 2030. Why Does It Matter: Energy Minister for the Victorian State, Lily D\u2019Ambrosio, told Bloomberg\u00a0that the project would not only support the economy with reduced energy prices and increased jobs but also support the network grids during Australia\u2019s extreme summers. The state\u2019s energy grid is powered by coal-reliant energy plants, which failed in recent summers leading to power outages. Before the Victorian project, the\u00a0Elon Musk-led\u00a0electric vehicle maker\u00a0partnered with the French company for the Hornsdale wind farm project, which was the largest facility supporting essential grid services when it began operations in 2017. It was dethroned from the top spot in August, with the opening of the 230-megawatt project in San Diego, California, Bloomberg reported\u00a0separately. Price Action:\u00a0Tesla shares traded 2.86% higher at $433 in the pre-market session on Thursday.
