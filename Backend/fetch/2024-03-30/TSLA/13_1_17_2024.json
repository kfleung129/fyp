    "text": "Tesla Inc. is about to offer investors some hints of what\u2019s to come, and one analyst thinks Wall Street should brace for \u201cgrowing pains.\u201d Wells Fargo analyst Colin Langan expects about 13% growth in Tesla \n        TSLA,\n        -2.25%\n       deliveries next year, below the company\u2019s 50% long-term target. The year already hasn\u2019t gotten off to a great start for the electric-vehicle company, which has cut prices in China and paused production in Germany. \u201cThere are also macroeconomic headwinds around elevated interest rates& flattening EV adoption,\u201d Langan wrote in a Tuesday note to clients. \u201cAdditionally, there are signs of moderating growth in all three key regions.\u201d Tesla is expected to share more about the landscape, and its outlook for the year, when it reports earnings next Wednesday afternoon. While Langan expressed caution about automotive earnings in general for the latest quarter, Tesla \u201cscreens the most at risk,\u201d in his view. Read: Nio\u2019s stock tanks toward a record-tying loss streak as Tesla price cuts weigh Wall Street will be focused on Tesla\u2019s profit picture as well, and Langan predicts that the effect of price cuts outweighed the impact of higher volumes in that latest quarter. He models a 15.4% gross margin for the period, which he said is below the 17% consensus view on VisibleAlpha. FactSet lists a 16.7% consensus estimate. Langan is interested to see how higher leasing rates in the U.S. will affect profits, \u201cas leases would qualify for IRA 45W credits,\u201d or those related to the Inflation Reduction Act. \u201cProfits on leased vehicles are realized over the lease life, rather than up front like a normal sale,\u201d he added. Don\u2019t miss: Fisker loses its biggest bull as EV maker\u2019s stock breaks the buck Langan cut his price target on Tesla\u2019s stock to $223 from $250, with the new target reflecting his expectations for lower long-term growth. Tesla shares are off 2.5% in afternoon trading Wednesday.  Warren Buffett now owns about 30% of Liberty SiriusXM\u2019s outstanding shares. Emily Bary is a MarketWatch news editor based in New York.
