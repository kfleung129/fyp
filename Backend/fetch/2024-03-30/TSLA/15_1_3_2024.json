One of the hot companies investors want to know more about, as a potential or continued investment, is Tesla, which did quite well in 2023, seeing gains of 112% overall.

Let\u2019s find out why \u2014 and who Tesla stock may be best suited for. Sponsored: Get Paid To Scroll. Start Now Before we get into what will or won\u2019t happen to Tesla stock in 2024, we must address a major problem with Tesla as a stock in general: it\u2019s not really clear how investors should categorize it. \u201cThe great debate among investors and analysts is: \u2018Should Tesla be valued as an automobile company or a tech company?'\u201d said Robert R. Johnson, PhD, CFA, CAIA, professor of finance, Heider College of Business, Creighton University, who added that the answer falls somewhere in between \u2014 that\u2019s something of a red flag in itself for prospective and present investors who need clear categories when designing their portfolios. Johnson is of the opinion that fundamentally, Tesla is an automobile manufacturer \u2014 and one that is \u201cwildly overvalued\u201d at that.\u00a0As of December 2023, Tesla was valued at $813.86 billion. \u201cThere are an awful lot of red flags, starting with the still-atmospheric valuation of the company,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThe bull case for Tesla is predicated on a narrative of Elon Musk being a genius and electric vehicles being the future of transportation. The bottom line is that many investors are swayed by stories and ignore fundamentals.\u201d Johnson points to Nobel Prize laureate Robert Shiller \u2014 specifically his book \u201cNarrative Economics: How Stories Go Viral and Drive Major Economic Events\u201d \u2014 as a good explainer on how and why companies like Tesla may get overvalued. \u201cShiller shows how popular stories \u2014 narratives \u2014 can drive the decisions of individuals and create market inefficiencies,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cInvestors would be wise to take Shiller\u2019s advice and consider the narrative. This is how investors become speculators and how speculation is akin to gambling.\u201d Take a Look: 11 Uncommon Investments That Can Actually Make You a Lot of Money As it stands, we can\u2019t make any definite determinations of how Tesla stock will fare in the coming months; but we can look at the performance of electric cars as a possible indicator. \u201cThe future of electric cars is the biggest issue going forward with auto stocks,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cWhile electric cars and driverless vehicles appear to be the future of the automobile industry, renowned baseball philosopher Yogi Berra once said, \u2018It\u2019s tough to make predictions, especially about the future.'\u201d The Tesla Cybertruck is expected to deliver big in 2024, and that could boost the profitability and market share of Tesla, as Kevin Luthringshausen, lead market analyst at The Tradier Hub, noted. But even this success isn\u2019t a sure thing, because there will be more EV competition happening in the new year. \u201cTesla will see increased competition and new EV startups which could erode market share and pressure margins,\u201d Luthringshausen said. \u201cAs always, any sort of challenges around production and supply chain could impact valuations. Tesla accounts for approximately 50% of the EV market in the U.S. and nearly 20% of global shipments. Tesla has cut its vehicle prices recently, which could weigh on share valuation. Analysts are mixed on share valuation for 2024 with most seeing not much movement in TSLA shares from current levels.\u201d Since it\u2019s not entirely possible to know how EVs in general (let alone Tesla) will perform in 2024, making predictions about that is a murky business. And history shows that the automobile industry at large is prone to major ups and downs. Especially downs. \u201cSpeaking before a gathering of business titans at Sun Valley in 1999, Warren Buffett described the experience of the auto industry in the early part of the last century as follows: \u2018There were 2,000 auto companies\u2026but of the 2,000 companies, as of a few years ago, only three car companies survived,'\u201d Johnson said. Johnson said that Buffett went on to say that at one time or another, \u201c\u2018all three were selling for less than book value, which is the amount of money that had been put into the companies and left there. So autos had an enormous impact on America, but in the opposite direction of investors.'\u201d The bigger question about how Tesla will perform in 2024 is: How will the auto industry as a whole perform in 2024, and, additionally, what role will technology play in its performance? \u201cOne not only has to identify the technology that is going to prove to be enduring, but one also has to identify the firms that will be the ultimate winners and losers,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThe second half of that equation has proven to be particularly illusive.\u201d Despite the inability to accurately predict Tesla\u2019s performance in 2024, Johnson finds that many investors are betting on Tesla as the big winner in the electric car space. \u201cIn fact, Tesla is really sucking all of the air out of the automobile industry from an investor\u2019s standpoint,\u201d Johnson said. This may not be the smartest approach, as other auto companies could be a better bet. \u201cGiven all of the attendant problems with Tesla management, its huge debt load and atmospheric valuation, I believe that a much more prudent investment is GM or Ford at PEs of 4.3 and 5.5 times, respectively, rather than Tesla at a PE of 70.6 times,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cTo buttress that point, GM and F sell at price to sales ratios of 0.29 and 0.29, respectively. Tesla sells at a P/S ratio of 9.2. And, the cash flow metrics also favor GM and F, as they sell at a price to cash flow ratio of 2.2 and 3.6, respectively, while Tesla sells at a P/CF ratio of 26.5. Investors committing funds to Ford and GM have a much higher margin of safety than those in Tesla.\u201d Bear in mind that though Tesla is hugely speculative, that doesn\u2019t mean that you can\u2019t make money off of Tesla stocks. \u201cWhile I wouldn\u2019t bet on Tesla at these valuation levels, I wouldn\u2019t bet against the firm either,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cBut, the biggest risk is that Tesla isn\u2019t the big winner in the electric vehicle sweepstakes.\u201d Since we don\u2019t really know what will happen to Tesla stock in 2024, you may be best suited to pursue it if you think it will be a huge and successful disruptor in the EV space, and, if you are passionate about Elon Musk and his approach to business. \u201cTesla seems best suited for risk-taking investors who buy into the narrative that Elon Musk is much smarter than all of the other automobile executives and that Tesla will capture a huge share of the electric vehicle market in the long term,\u201d said Johnson. \u201cThese investors also must believe that Musk\u2019s attention won\u2019t be diverted to Twitter or any of his other business ventures. That, in my opinion, is wishful thinking.\u201d More From GOBankingRates 7 Ways Fraudsters Are Trying to Scam People in 2024 5 Ways to Earn at Least 5% APY on Your Money (Without Using the Stock Market) 3 Ways to Recession Proof Your Retirement 7 Money Secrets All Wealthy People Know -- And How You Can Use Them, Too This article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: I\u2019m an Investment Expert: 9 Things To Consider Before Investing In Tesla Stock in 2024 "
