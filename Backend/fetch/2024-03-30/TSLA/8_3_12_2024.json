With the chipmaking star up 5%, and other\u00a0megacaps like Microsoft, Amazon and Meta Platforms up over 2%, the Nasdaq has reversed earlier losses and is up 1.1% now at over 16,195. A big riser among smaller names is Rumble Inc\u00a0has offered to buy\u00a0TikTok, with a letter from CEO Chris Pavloski to ByteDance CEO Shou Zi Chew declaring the online video platform is ready to \"acquire and operate TikTok in the US\".

Specifically, we are ready to serve as a cloud technology partner.\" Wall Street stocks opened higher but then quickly slid in the red.

On the Dow, fallers are led by Boeing, down 2.9% with others including Chevron, Intel and Nike. US stocks are heading for a mixed start after\u00a0inflation data came in hotter than expected, which sent Wall Street stock futures into a tizzy.

All the tech megcaps - Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla etc - are heading higher in pre-market trading. The US consumer price index (CPI) for February printed at 315.57, 3.2% higher than a year ago, up from 3.1% and higher than the 3.1% consensus forecast.
