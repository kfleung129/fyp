    "text": "Mercedes-Benz overtakes Tesla to regain its position as the world\u2019s most valuable Automobiles brand, according to a new report from Brand Finance, the world\u2019s leading brand valuation consultancy. Tesla\u2019s drop to second position comes in the context of controversies surrounding Elon Musk which have affected the electric car maker\u2019s reputation, impacting its brand value (down 12% to USD58.3 billion). Meanwhile, Mercedes-Benz\u2019 brand value grew 1% to USD59.4 billion. Luxury sports car manufacturer, Ferrari, maintains a high brand strength with a score of 90.0/100, earning a AAA+ rating and solidifying its status as the world\u2019s strongest automotive brand. Research conducted by Brand Finance underscores the brand\u2019s robust familiarity, recommendation, and reputation metrics, while optimistic forecasts have further contributed to its increased brand value (up 43% to USD10.6 billion). Alex Haigh, Managing Director, Brand Finance, Asia Pacific said, \u201cThe decline in Tesla\u2019s brand value is made all the more compelling against the backdrop of an automotive industry increasingly focused on electric vehicles, however, Tesla\u2019s brand strength persists, a sign that the company\u2019s core identity is resilient. \u201cAs other EV manufacturers, such as BYD and New Flyer, see considerable growth, Tesla\u2019s enduring high levels of consumer familiarity and recommendation are likely to be pivotal for the company to stay competitive.\u201d The Chinese auto sector continues to grow, fuelled by strong global EV interest which is driving investments and exports. BYD is China\u2019s most valuable auto brand, with its brand value increasing by 20% to USD12.1 billion. While Chinese auto brands experienced fluctuations in brand value, brand strength is rising \u2013 Brand Finance research reveals that 19 out of the 22 Chinese brands featured in the 2024 Brand Finance Automobiles ranking improved in brand strength. New Flyer\u2019s brand value has increased by three-and-a-half times its previous value (up 250%) to reach USD646 million. This follows burgeoning demand for electric vehicles in the public transport sector, New Flyer\u2019s distinctive position in the EV bus market, and the steadfast support from the British and Canadian Governments in funding public transport initiatives involving EVs. Bosch\u2019s is the most valuable and strongest Auto Components brand, with a valuation of USD14.6 billion. Brand Finance research shows it is excelling in metrics like \u2018Brand I Admire\u2019 and \u2018Positive Contribution\u2019, indicating growing respect for its brand and contributions. Updates in Familiarity and Consideration evaluations reinforce this recognition.
