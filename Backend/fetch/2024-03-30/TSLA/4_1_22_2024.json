View more search results US earnings will accelerate from tomorrow with Netflix, J&J, General Electric and Verizon reporting financial results. On Wednesday, it will then be the turn of IBM, Tesla and AT&T; followed by Intel, Visa and American Airlines on Thursday. American Express quarterly earnings will then conclude this busy week, as IGTV\u2019s Angela Barnes explaines. (AI Video Summary)  Next week, we can expect to see a bunch of big companies reporting their financial results in the US. Some of these companies include Netflix, Johnson & Johnson, General Electric, Procter & Gamble, and Verizon. Let's break it down: First up, let's talk about Netflix. In the third quarter of 2023, Netflix did really well. They had an 8% increase in revenue and gained 8.76 million new paid members. In the fourth quarter, they expect to keep up their strong performance with an 11% increase in revenue and 8 to 9 million new subscribers. Basically, things are looking good for Netflix. Their stock has even gone up by 73% since the beginning of the year. Now, let's move on to Tesla, the electric vehicle company. Tesla will also announce its fourth-quarter report. Experts predict that they will earn around $0.72 per share and bring in revenue of $25.52 billion. People are especially interested in Tesla's margins, which is basically how much money they're making from sales. Tesla's focus has been on sales rather than margins, which has caused a decline in automated growth margins from 30% to 16.3%. But don't worry, Tesla's stock has still gone up by a crazy 120% since January 2023. Lastly, we have American Airlines. They will be releasing their quarterly report too. It's estimated that they will earn $0.11 per share and have revenue slightly over $13 billion. People will be closely watching something called the total value per available seat mile. Basically, they want to see if it has gone down between 5.5% and 7.5% compared to last year's fourth quarter. Right now, American Airlines' stock has dropped by 1%. Overall, these earnings reports are really important because they will have a big impact on these companies' stock prices. Investors will be closely examining their financial performance, how much money they're making, and what they predict for the future. So keep an eye out for these reports, because they could have a huge effect on the market. This information has been prepared by IG, a trading name of IG Markets Limited.
