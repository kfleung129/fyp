    "text": "Electric vehicle adoption has slowed,\u00a0impacting the top lines of companies. On Saturday,\u00a0Tesla, Inc. TSLA bull\u00a0Gary Black\u00a0shared insights on the strategy to tackle this challenge. What Happened:\u00a0Black emphasized the responsibility of EV industry leaders like Tesla to spearhead efforts as the industry transitions from early adopters to rational pragmatists. \u201cWe've moved from Stage 1, where early adopters buy EVs, to Stage 2, where rational pragmatists need convincing through facts, figures, and analysis,\u201d he said. Black\u2019s remarks were prompted by a Globe and Mail opinion piece discussing the fading \u201cEV hype.\u201d The Future Fund, managed by Black, holds Tesla as its fourth-largest position with a 5.07% weighting in its actively managed\u00a0Future Funds Active ETF\u00a0FFND. Contrary to popular belief, Black suggested that it\u2019s not the high monthly interest payments dampening demand. Despite the Federal funds rate standing at a 22-year high of 5.25%-5.50%, EV manufacturers\u2019 management, including Tesla\u2019s Elon Musk, have cited higher interest rates as detrimental to demand. Black disagreed, emphasizing the necessity for \u201cmore effective communication.\u201d \u201cThink about how $AAPL convinced users of\u00a0Blackberry, Motorola\u00a0and\u00a0Nokia\u00a0dumb phones to switch to smart iPhones,\u201d he said. EV industry leaders like $TSLA need to drive this narrative. We've gone from Stage 1 early adopters buying EVs to Stage 2 rational pragmatists who need to be convinced through facts, figures, and analysis why they should go EV. It's not about high monthly interest payments.... https://t.co/3luvbcgkzV See Also:\u00a0Everything You Need To Know About Tesla Stock Apple\u2019s introduction of the iPhone in 2007 revolutionized the mobile industry, driving competitors out of business through \u201ccreative destruction.\u201d By positioning the iPhone as a three-in-one product and emphasizing design appeal, software, and touchscreen technology, Apple enticed customers away from competitors resistant to innovation. Why It\u2019s Important:\u00a0Tesla fell short of both top and bottom-line expectations for the last two straight quarters. The company is expected to report lackluster first-quarter deliveries next month, driven by weakness across geographies. Tesla\u2019s price-cutting strategy failed to yield significant results, impacting margins and profits. Musk previously hinted at selling Tesla EVs at zero profits, offsetting losses with high-margin full-self-driving (FSD) software. Despite skepticism about FSD\u2019s safety, many view it as a long-term opportunity. Black advocates for advertising to enhance Tesla\u2019s prospects, criticizing price cuts\u00a0as a short-term solution. He believes Tesla should lead in advertising the benefits of EV ownership and address customer concerns like range anxiety. Price Action: Tesla ended Friday\u2019s session up 0.38% at $202.64, according to Benzinga Pro data. Check out more of Benzinga\u2019s Future Of Mobility coverage by\u00a0following this link.
