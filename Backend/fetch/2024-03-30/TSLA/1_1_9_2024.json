Login New York | Elon Musk\u2019s reported drug use has Tesla board members, including James Murdoch, facing a familiar quandary: having to decide what, if anything, to do about the chief executive subjecting directors and shareholders alike to great financial and legal risk. The Wall Street Journal\u2019s article describing Mr Musk\u2019s history of recreational drug use and ongoing consumption of ketamine is the latest in a long line of tests for a board packed with the CEO\u2019s acolytes \u2013 several of whom agreed less than six months ago to return $US735 million ($1.1 billion) to settle a lawsuit alleging they had excessively compensated themselves. Musk\u2019s personal life intrudes anew.\u00a0AP Shareholders voiced dissatisfaction with the board last year over Tesla\u2019s succession planning, and accused Mr Musk of being distracted by his commitments to other companies. His chaotic 2022 takeover of Twitter, the social media company he\u2019s renamed X Corp, contributed to Tesla losing $US672 billion in market capitalisation that year. Before that, directors rode out litigation related to Mr Musk\u2019s doomed effort to take Tesla private in 2018, and his calling a cave explorer involved in the rescue of a youth soccer team in Thailand that year a paedophile. They also testified in proceedings related to the $US55 billion compensation package they arranged for Mr Musk in 2018, and in a trial challenging Tesla\u2019s $US2.6 billion acquisition of SolarCity, the struggling power provider run by Mr Musk\u2019s cousins. The report by the Journal, which said Mr Musk has used LSD, cocaine, ecstasy and psychedelic mushrooms, often at private parties, is not even the Tesla board\u2019s first brush with drug-related issues. Weeks after The New York Times reported in August 2018 that directors had expressed concern about Mr Musk\u2019s use of Ambien, he puffed a blunt containing marijuana on comedian Joe Rogan\u2019s podcast. Tesla\u2019s board took minimal action after those episodes. It replaced Mr Musk as chairman and named two new independent directors as required by the settlement of fraud charges brought by the US Securities and Exchange Commission. It could face more litigation over its handling of Mr Musk\u2019s drug use, said Stephen Diamond, who teaches courses on corporate governance at Santa Clara University\u2019s School of Law. \u201cThis will give ammunition to class-action lawyers on behalf of disgruntled shareholders at Tesla, if they can tie evidence of drug use to his actual role as an executive,\u201d Mr Diamond said. \u201cThe Tesla board has an obligation to discern what\u2019s going on here.\u201d While Mr Musk\u2019s drug use has the potential to harm his other enterprises \u2013 particularly Space Exploration Technologies, a US government contractor \u2013 he derives more of his fortune from Tesla than any other company. His shares and exercisable stock options are worth $US97.6 billion, or about 44 per cent of his $US219.4 billion net worth, data shows. \u201cWhatever I\u2019m doing, I should obviously keep doing it!\u201d Mr Musk posted on X, citing Tesla and SpaceX being the world\u2019s most valuable car and space companies. \u201cIf drugs actually helped improve my net productivity over time, I would definitely take them!\u201d Tesla\u2019s longest-serving directors are Mr Musk, 52, and his younger brother, Kimbal \u2013 both have been on the board since 2004. Kimbal\u2019s reelection to the board has gotten pushback in recent years from an investor critical of his lack of relevant industry experience and a proxy adviser concerned about objectivity. Proxy advisers also opposed the 2022 reelection of Ira Ehrenpreis, a venture capitalist who has been on the board since 2007. They cited concern about the amount of borrowing against Tesla stock by Mr Musk and other directors, and a half measure the board took in response a shareholder proposal for annual director elections that got majority support in 2021. The only other relatively long-tenured director on the board is Robyn Denholm, who joined in 2014 and became chair in 2018. Months after her elevation to the position, which was linked to the SEC suing Mr Musk and Tesla over his take-private tweeting, she praised Mr Musk\u2019s use of the social media platform. \u201cTwitter is part of everyday business for many executives today,\u201d Ms Denholm said in a March 2019 interview. \u201cFrom my perspective, he uses it wisely.\u201d Tesla\u2019s four other directors are Mr Murdoch, the former 21st Century Fox CEO appointed in 2017; Kathleen Wilson-Thompson, the former human-resources chief of Walgreens Boots Alliance who joined in 2018; and Joe Gebbia and JB Straubel, who were elected to the board last year. Mr Gebbia co-founded Airbnb, and Mr Straubel is a co-founder of Tesla. Mr Musk has close relationships with Mr Murdoch, Mr Gebbia and Mr Straubel. During testimony in Delaware Chancery Court over his Tesla compensation package in 2022, the CEO fielded questions from a plaintiff\u2019s lawyer about vacationing with Murdoch on several occasions. After Mr Musk tweeted about trying to take Tesla private, Mr Gebbia texted his praise, calling it a \u201cballer move\u201d. Mr Musk\u2019s and Mr Straubel\u2019s ties date back to Tesla\u2019s founding in 2003. While Tesla\u2019s directors have been well-compensated, being a board member has at times been risky. In April 2020, the company disclosed that it had decided not to renew its directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability policy, because of high premiums quoted by insurers. Mr Musk agreed to personally provide coverage, which the board determined wouldn\u2019t impair directors\u2019 independent judgment. After catching flak for the arrangement, which initially was planned to last a year, Tesla disclosed in October 2020 that it had lined up a customary insurance policy for its directors and officers. It paid Mr Musk $US3 million for 90 days\u2019 worth of interim coverage that he provided. Mr Musk\u2019s reported drug use may temporarily hit Tesla\u2019s shares, said Gene Munster, a managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management. But those who\u2019ve held on through the CEO\u2019s antics have been rewarded \u2013 the stock has soared 1168 per cent since Mr Musk\u2019s marijuana toke in September 2018. \u201cA small percentage of investors will sell their stock over the next week and put some pressure on shares,\u201d Mr Munster said on Sunday. \u201cMost investors won\u2019t care because it falls into the category that if you want to profit from Elon, you have to put up with his controversies.\u201d Bloomberg Copy link Copied Copy link Copied Subscribe to gift this article Gift 5 articles to anyone you choose each month when you subscribe.
