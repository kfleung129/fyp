    "text": "Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Production at Tesla\u2019s factory near Berlin is gradually resuming after the plant was reconnected to the power grid late on Monday following a week-long closure caused by an arson attack. \u201cThe lights are back on,\u201d German energy network E.DIS told CNN late on Monday. \u201cAt 8:45 p.m. (local) the E.DIS grid control center was able to make the decisive switch\u2026 Since then, the power supply has been restored.\u201d A group of far-left activists, calling themselves the \u201cVolcano Group,\u201d claimed it was behind the arson attack on an electricity pylon, which cut off the power supply to the Tesla (TSLA) plant early last Tuesday. Now production at the factory should be gradually ramped up, CNN affiliate RTL has reported. It is not yet possible to say when it will resume fully, RTL cited a Tesla spokesperson as saying Tuesday. Tesla had originally expected the shutdown to last until the end of this week, the German media outlet added. Still, the outage could be costly for Elon Musk\u2019s company. The huge plant \u2014 located about 30 kilometers (18 miles) southeast of the German capital \u2014 is its only one in Europe and is currently capable of producing\u00a0375,000 electric vehicles a year. Prices in Germany for Model Y vehicles, the only cars manufactured at the factory, start at \u20ac44,990 ($49,196). That means a week of output is worth about \u20ac324 million ($354 million) in sales for Tesla. Analysts had warned of a potential hit to first-quarter earnings from a shutdown lasting about 10 days or more. But tepid demand for EVs in Europe and the possibility that Tesla will make up lost production in the coming weeks should soften the blow, they said. Tesla has not responded to a CNN request for comment. The carmaker\u2019s stock dropped 1% in morning trade in New York Tuesday. The share price has fallen 6.5% since last Monday\u2019s close, the day before the arson attack. In a letter published on the alternative German media website Kontrapolis, the Volcano Group wrote that it had \u201csabotaged\u201d Tesla because its plant \u201cconsumes Earth, resources, people, labor and spits out 6,000 SUVs, killer cars and monster trucks per week.\u201d Musk retorted by saying on X: \u201cThese are either the dumbest eco-terrorists on Earth or they\u2019re puppets of those who don\u2019t have good environmental goals. \u201cStopping production of electric vehicles, rather than fossil fuel vehicles, ist extrem dumm.\u201d Last year, the company\u00a0lodged an application\u00a0to increase the factory\u2019s production capacity to 1 million electric vehicles a year, which would make it Europe\u2019s biggest car plant. But in February, local residents voted against a motion to clear enough forest for Tesla\u00a0to expand the site, leaving it to local authorities to decide how to proceed, according to Reuters. In another setback earlier this year, the carmaker said it would\u00a0pause\u00a0most production at the Berlin plant for two weeks because attacks on container ships in the Red Sea had delayed the delivery of components.
