    "text": "  You are reading your free article for this month.\nMembers-only This week, the tech industry turned its focus to Elon Musk and OpenAI. Following the lawsuit Musk filed against the company, OpenAI has fired back with its own allegations of the entrepreneur angling to merge OpenAI with Tesla. Elsewhere in AI, Anthropic launched its Claude 3 model family, a trio of advanced chatbots. And on the Apple side, the company rolled out MacBook Air models updated with M3 chips, as well as its iOS 17.4 update for iPhones. Below, Hypebeast has rounded up the top tech stories of the week so you can stay up to date on trends in the industry.\nOpenAI Revealed Elon Musk Left the Company After It Declined To Merge With Tesla\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaja Hitij/Getty Images\n\n\n\n\nOpenAI publicly responded to Elon Musk \u2018s lawsuit against them with a blog post \u2013 and email receipts \u2013 detailing the dissolution of his relationship with the company. While Musk was a co-founder and early backer of OpenAI, the founders had mutually decided to launch a for-profit entity within the company.\nMusk, however, wanted that effort to take the form of a merger with Tesla, a move founders Sam Altman and Greg Brockman refused to agree to. \u201cIn late 2017, we and Elon decided the next step for the mission was to create a for-profit entity,\u201d the post reads. \u201cElon wanted majority equity, initial board control, and to be CEO. In the middle of these discussions, he withheld funding.\u201d The argument is a compelling case for OpenAI in what looks like it will be a lengthy legal battle with Musk.\nApple Released the iOS 17.4 Update for iPhone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJaap Arriens/Nurphoto/Getty Images\n\n\n\n\nApple has unveiled 118 new emojis as part of iOS 17.4. Available for iPhone Xs and later models, the new emoji lineup includes a mushroom, phoenix, lime and broken chain, as well as a shaking head.\nElsewhere in the update is the ability to peel and stick emojis onto chats in Messages and the introduction of transcripts for Apple Podcasts, available in English, French, Spanish and German.\nAnthropic Launched Claude 3, Its New Flagship AI Chatbot Family\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOmar Marques/Sopa Images/Lightrocket/Getty Images\n\n\n\n\nAnthropic has continued to evolve its AI with the rollout of Claude 3. The company\u2019s third-gen model family is described as setting \u201cnew industry benchmarks across a wide range of cognitive tasks\u201d and in fact, is composed of three bots, each geared towards a different use.\nClaude Haiku is the cheapest model, as well as the fastest for reading data and research papers, while Claude Sonnet is built for run-of-the-mill knowledge retrieval and automating sales.
