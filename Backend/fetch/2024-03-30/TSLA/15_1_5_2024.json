    "text": "Tesla has cut back claims about how far its electric cars can travel as it faces scrutiny from the US government. Elon Musk\u2019s company has reduced the estimated range of several cars on its US website by as much as 37 miles. Tesla, which was this week overtaken by China\u2019s BYD as the world\u2019s best-selling electric car manufacturer, did not give a reason for the adjustment. However, the US Department of Justice has been investigating Tesla\u2019s range claims amid concerns they may be exaggerated. Tesla updated its website to say that its Model Y Performance vehicle has a range of 285 miles, down from its previous 303-mile claim. Meanwhile, the Long Range model has been cut from 330 miles to 310. One version of its luxury Model S car has seen its estimated range reduced from 396 miles to 359 miles. In October, Tesla said it had received legal requests from the Department of Justice over issues including vehicle range. Tesla did not publicly say why it had changed the range estimates. According to internal company documents reviewed by the Drive Tesla website, the changes are in response to new testing conditions from US regulators, and \u201ccomfort and functionality improvements\u201d that require more energy from the battery. Tesla has faced questions over its cars\u2019 ranges, a key selling point for electric vehicles as their manufacturers seek to avoid the \u201crange anxiety\u201d that deters many drivers. An investigation by the Reuters news agency last year claimed that Tesla often exaggerated ranges to attract drivers, while the US organisation Consumer Reports found that Tesla cars were among those whose ranges fell short of what was claimed. Tesla owners have sued the company in the US over false advertising related to the range claims. The company has responded to the lawsuits, calling the Reuters investigation \u201cerror-ridden\u201d and the lawsuits \u201clegally untenable\u201d. Tesla has not reduced its range claims in other countries, such as the UK, which uses a different testing regime. Separately, Tesla was forced to issue a recall to 1.6m cars in China to fix its Autopilot system, which steers and accelerates automatically. A regulator in China said Tesla would make the changes through a software update issued to the vehicles. It covers almost every Tesla vehicle sold in China since 2014. It comes the month after Tesla was forced to update its Autopilot system to more than 2m cars in the US. The company has not been required to make any changes in the UK. Regulators have launched investigations into Autopilot after dozens of crashes, some of them fatal, in which the technology was activated. The system warns drivers that they should have their hands on the wheel and pay attention to the road when it is activated, but Mr Musk has been criticised for over-stating the cars\u2019 ability to drive themselves. This week, China\u2019s BYD surpassed Tesla as the world\u2019s best-selling electric car maker, after selling 526,409 cars in the fourth quarter of 2023 against Tesla\u2019s 484,507.
