    "text": "Tesla rival Rivian faced a make-or-break moment this week as it unveiled its latest model, the R2 SUV. Judging by its soaring shares, things went well. Since the Thursday event, the market value of the Amazon-backed electric-vehicle maker has jumped by more than $1.7 billion. Whether it sinks again as investors reconsider remains to seen, but the initial reaction has meant a much-needed boost for the beleaguered EV maker. Last month, Rivian announced a disappointing quarter and outlook and said it would cut its salaried workforce by roughly 10%. Its market cap has plunged from a peak of $153 billion in 2021 to $12.5 billion today. Gene Munster, managing partner of Deepwater Asset Management, recently mulled the possibility of Apple buying Rivian, noting the low valuation and the tech giant needing to do \u201csomething big\u201d after killing its own EV project. Tesla CEO Elon Musk said last month that Rivian\u2019s product design was \u201cnot bad,\u201d but added, \u201cthe actual hard part of making a car company work is achieving volume production with positive cash flow.\u201d He suggested his rival would go bankrupt in six quarters without a drastic change, saying it needed to \u201ccut costs massively.\u201d On Thursday, Rivian demonstrated that it\u2019s willing to do just that, announcing to the surprise of many that it\u2019s delaying plans to build a $5 billion factory in Georgia. Instead, it will manufacture its new models at its existing plant in Illinois, allowing it to save more than $2.25 billion in capital expenditures. Deutsche Bank analyst Emmanuel Rosner told Reuters he sees the move \u201crelieving considerable pressure to raise capital in the near term,\u201d as it appears Rivian will have enough cash on hand to carry it through production of the R2. Rivian surprised investors with other news, as well, unexpectedly unveiling another model\u2014the smaller, cheaper R3 compact SUV\u2014to be produced after the R2. It also showed off a beefier, more rugged R3X. \u201cYou didn\u2019t expect that \u2018one more thing\u2019 here,\u201d joked CEO Robert \u201cRJ\u201d Scaringe, referencing the tendency of the late Apple cofounder Steve Jobs to make last-minute product announcements after his keynotes. In an X post on Friday, Scaringe wrote that in less than 24 hours the company had taken more than 68,000 reservations for the R2, which will start at $45,000. He added that the company was \u201coverwhelmed\u201d by the response to the new vehicles. But the fact remains that Rivian has never made a profit, it\u2019s still losing money on each vehicle it makes, and EV sales in general are growing at a slower pace than the industry expected. After a long stretch of difficult months, Rivian had a good Thursday and Friday. Whether that proves to be a blip or a turning point remains to be seen. \u00a9 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.
