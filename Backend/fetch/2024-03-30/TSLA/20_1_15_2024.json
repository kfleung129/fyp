    "text": "Stock Analysis When close to half the companies in the United States have price-to-earnings ratios (or \"P/E's\") below 16x, you may consider Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) as a stock to avoid entirely with its 64.5x P/E ratio.  Although, it's not wise to just take the P/E at face value as there may be an explanation why it's so lofty. While the market has experienced earnings growth lately, Tesla's earnings have gone into reverse gear, which is not great.   One possibility is that the P/E is high because investors think this poor earnings performance will turn the corner.  You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason. Check out our latest analysis for Tesla Tesla's P/E ratio would be typical for a company that's expected to deliver very strong growth, and importantly, perform much better than the market. If we review the last year of earnings, dishearteningly the company's profits fell to the tune of 5.6%.   Still, the latest three year period has seen an excellent 1,686% overall rise in EPS, in spite of its unsatisfying short-term performance.  So we can start by confirming that the company has generally done a very good job of growing earnings over that time, even though it had some hiccups along the way. Turning to the outlook, the next three years should generate growth of 18%  per annum as estimated by the analysts watching the company.  Meanwhile, the rest of the market is forecast to only expand by 13% per annum, which is noticeably less attractive. With this information, we can see why Tesla is trading at such a high P/E compared to the market.  It seems most investors are expecting this strong future growth and are willing to pay more for the stock. Typically, we'd caution against reading too much into price-to-earnings ratios when settling on investment decisions, though it can reveal plenty about what other market participants think about the company. We've established that Tesla maintains its high P/E on the strength of its forecast growth being higher than the wider market, as expected.  Right now shareholders are comfortable with the P/E as they are quite confident future earnings aren't under threat.  It's hard to see the share price falling strongly in the near future under these circumstances. And what about other risks? Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for Tesla   you should know about.
