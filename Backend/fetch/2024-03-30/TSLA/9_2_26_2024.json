The Giving Pies owner, Voahangy Rasetarinera, said that the world\u2019s most valuable automaker \u201churt my small Black women-owned business,\u201d because of the last-minute cancellation, according to Business Insider. She said on February 14 a Tesla representative called her and asked for 2,000 mini pies to be delivered the following week, and she started getting nervous when the payment for her invoice didn\u2019t come through by the next day. Rasetarinera told ABC7 Bay Area that she wasn\u2019t going to worry too much, since she knew Tesla is \u201ca big company.\u201d That evening, the same Tesla rep called her back and actually doubled the order \u2013 meaning The Giving Pies had to rush to make sure it could meet the demand. All in all, the order was worth $16,000. Here\u2019s more information on how this whole ordeal went down, from Business Insider: \u201cTo fulfill the order, I had turned down other Black History Month catering inquiries, purchased supplies, and prepared for a demanding production schedule,\u201d she wrote in her post. After chasing the representative on Friday, she said, she got a text message \u201cCASUALLY informing me\u201d that Tesla had changed its mind. \u201dThis abrupt reversal left me reeling, realizing the extent of the impact on my small business,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI had invested time, resources, and effort based on assurances from Tesla, only to be left high and dry.\u201d [...] The change of course cost The Giving Pies $2,000, ABC7 reported. Although the bakery has a cancellation policy, it could not recoup its costs because Tesla had not paid the invoice, NBC Bay Area reported. Following Rasetarinera\u2019s interview with ABC, she said another Tesla employee reached out to her to say there had been a miscommunication, and that the original representative wasn\u2019t authorized to promise any payment, according to BI. She said she \u201cexpressed her disappointment\u201d at the situation directly with Tesla. \u201cAs I reflect on this ordeal, I am reminded of the resilience and determination that have propelled me forward as a Black woman entrepreneur,\u201d she said, according to BI.
