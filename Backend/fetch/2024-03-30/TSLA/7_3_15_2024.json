    "text": " India, in a strategic move to boost electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing within its borders, announced on Friday a reduction in import taxes for EVs. This policy adjustment is contingent on automakers committing to an investment of at least $500 million and starting local production within three years. The move significantly benefits Tesla, aligning with the company\u2019s long-sought objectives in the Indian market, reports Reuters. Tesla and CEO Elon Musk have been eyeing the Indian market for years. The company\u2019s entry was contingent upon New Delhi\u2019s requirement for a commitment to local manufacturing. This policy change follows Musk\u2019s engagement with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and multiple visits by Tesla officials to India. In July, sources revealed Tesla\u2019s proposal to build a $24,000 car in a new Indian factory, contingent on reduced import taxes. India\u2019s new policy, effective immediately, permits qualifying companies to import up to 8,000 EVs annually, priced at $35,000 or above, at a reduced tax rate of 15%. The current tax rate stands at 70% or 100%, based on the vehicle\u2019s value. India\u2019s Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal, addressing the press, invited global companies to India, expressing confidence in India becoming a global hub for EV manufacturing. This move is expected to create jobs and boost trade. The Indian EV market, though currently small, is rapidly growing, with domestic player Tata Motors leading sales. EVs accounted for about 2% of total car sales in 2023, with a government target of 30% by 2030. The lowered tax rate will be available for a maximum of five years, with the duty foregone capped at the company\u2019s investment or around $800 million, whichever is lower. India is the world\u2019s third-largest auto market and offers a huge opportunity for EV carmakers. Tesla\u2019s upcoming next-gen $25,000 EV could play a huge role in sales in India. The introduction of this policy has been a contentious issue, facing opposition from domestic manufacturers like Tata Motors and Mahindra & Mahindra. Following the announcement, the Nifty Auto index saw a decline, with Mahindra and Tata Motors experiencing notable stock drops. "
