    "text": "A recent decision by Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick of the Delaware Court of Chancery following a five-day trial ordered the rescission of the largest executive compensation package in U.S. history. The decision in Tornetta v. Musk would be newsworthy just for that reason. But the opinion also has important ramifications for companies and their boards when handling transactions with dominant stockholders and when making executive compensation decisions. The Chancellor notably found Tesla CEO Elon Musk to be a controlling stockholder, despite owning only 21.9% of Tesla. This finding caused the court to conclude that the option grants were a conflicted-controller transaction requiring application of the \u201centire fairness\u201d standard of review, Delaware\u2019s most stringent form of judicial review. The Chancellor held that the defendants failed to meet their burden to prove that the process employed by the Board in approving the compensation arrangements, as well as the compensatory options, were entirely fair. In particular, the Chancellor was troubled by what she perceived to be the pliancy of the compensation committee, which she found to be comprised of directors with deep financial and personal relationships with Musk, acting \u201calmost as an advisory body\u201d to Musk rather than as an independent negotiator. She twice quotes the Compensation Committee Chair\u2019s testimony that \u201cWe were not on different sides of things. We were trying to make sure if we were going to go through this exercise that he was on board.\u201d The Chancellor faulted the Compensation Committee and the board for not considering alternatives, failing to conduct a customary benchmarking analysis, and not assessing whether the grant was necessary to meet the company\u2019s purposes. She also found that the burden of proving entire fairness remained with the defendants despite a vote of the stockholders approving the grant, because the relevant proxy statement was deficient for failing to disclose, among other things, the relationships of a majority of the board with Musk that called into question their independence and projections showing that the company expected to meet the milestones for Musk\u2019s compensation. Without such information she found the stockholder vote was not fully informed. Each of these elements of the Tornetta decision bears consideration and analysis beyond the scope of this client alert. Indeed, there may be an inclination to view the opinion as only applying to an entire fairness reviews of conflicted-controller executive compensation transactions. While in a strict sense that may be the case, Tornetta is an important decision on Delaware executive compensation and provides some generally applicable guidance for boards and compensation committees considering executive compensation awards.
