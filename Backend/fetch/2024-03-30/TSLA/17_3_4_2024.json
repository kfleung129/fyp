This has caught the attention of investors and analysts, including CNBC\u2019s Jim Cramer, who sees a potential investment opportunity in the automaker\u2019s stock. What Happened: On Monday, Tesla Inc rival Ford announced a remarkable 31.5% year-over-year surge in hybrid vehicle sales, further validating the success of its strategic shift. This news has driven Ford\u2019s stock prices up by as much as 4%, reported CNBC. Despite a challenging year for EVs, Ford\u2019s EV sales also saw an 80% increase. This growth is particularly significant given the previous year\u2019s production inconsistencies. Traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle sales also rose by 7.5%, contributing to an overall 10.5% increase in Ford\u2019s vehicle sales for the month.

New Q4 Data, Leasing Growth For EVs Say Yes Jim Cramer, a prominent figure in the financial world, believes that the surge in hybrid sales could be a turning point for Ford. He predicts further sales growth in March and April, urging investors to consider buying the stock. \"I'm urging people to get long this thing ahead of a move to $15,\" Jim said. Ford CEO Jim Farley has previously stated that he expects the hybrid segment to grow by 40% in 2024. This forecast aligns with Ford\u2019s plans to double the production of its F-150 hybrid pickup, a move intended to offset losses in its Model e EV business. Why It Matters: Ford\u2019s impressive sales figures come at a time when the company is making significant strategic moves. In February, Ford granted its EV customers access to Tesla\u2019s Supercharger network, a move that significantly expanded its charging infrastructure. This decision was seen as a bold step in the EV market. However, Ford\u2019s success in the hybrid market also comes amid a backdrop of intense competition from Chinese EV manufacturers, who are rapidly outpacing their western counterparts in innovation and production speed. This competition could pose a threat to Ford\u2019s future growth in the EV market.
