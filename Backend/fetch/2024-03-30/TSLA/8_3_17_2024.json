    "text": "Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) has been the subject of several bearish narratives this week in analyst notes. However, Adam Jonas of Morgan Stanley countered those notes with a new communication to investors late this week that looks at the big picture. Of the three analyst notes we\u2019ve covered this week, two have described lackluster outlooks for Tesla\u2019s future. As demand begins to slightly reduce in speed and Tesla gears up for a \u201cnotably lower\u201d growth phase due to its focus on the next-generation platform, which will be released next year, analysts are concerned about the stock\u2019s future. However, not every analyst looks at Tesla\u2019s story negatively. Wedbush\u2019s Dan Ives said in a note to investors this week that the negative sentiments are \u201coverdone\u201d in their opinion. Adam Jonas believes that Tesla\u2019s long-term picture is much bigger than just the automotive side of things, which is true. Many forget that Tesla is more than just a car company, offering energy storage, AI, and robotics projects. However, Jonas\u2019s newest note does not take into account the robotics portion of Tesla\u2019s story, at least from a price target perspective. With that being said, Morgan Stanley does believe it is part of the bigger picture for the company. \u201cOur message to investors: Prepare for the theme of humanoid robotics to potentially accelerate in the months and years ahead for a number of factors,\u201d Jonas writes. \u201cWE recently discussed our thoughts in a December note where we discussed \u2018mobile AI\u2019 as akin to Cambrian Explosion that may profoundly impact our way of life.\u201d It\u2019s no secret that Tesla is pushing more time into robotics and AI, and Jonas believes that \u201cTesla CEO Elon Musk is spending increasing amounts of time\u201d on developing the Optimus project, its humanoid robot. Tesla shares more footage of Optimus walking improvements  Jonas and Morgan Stanley said their $320 price target is comprised of automotive hardware, software, and energy-related businesses, leaving out the potential impact robotics could have. \u201cWhile Tesla\u2019s competencies in computer vision, machine learning, AI, and robotics may have a multitude of adjacent commercial applications, we have not included such revenue streams (including Optimus) in our model or valuation at this time.\u201d Disclosure: Joey Klender owns Tesla stock.
