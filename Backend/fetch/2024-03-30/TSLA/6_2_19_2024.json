    "text": "The issue of rusting in Tesla's $100,000 Cybertrucks has recently been a topic of concern. The rust is superficial, attributed to the free iron on the stainless steel used in the Cybertruck. Tesla's Cybertruck lead engineer has clarified this issue. The rust can be removed by cleaning the vehicle with specific products to loosen the deposit and wipe it off. However, this cleaning process is not mandatory, and customers can choose to ignore it if it doesn't bother them. Tesla maintains that the Cybertruck's stainless steel exoskeleton provides enhanced durability, minimizing dents and damages. In other news, Tesla's stock performance has seen a decline.
