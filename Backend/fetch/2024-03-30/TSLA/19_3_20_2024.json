    "text": "Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos, the CEOs of Tesla and Amazon, are the two richest individuals on the planet, behind only the family of Bernard Arnault. With respective net worths of $188.5 and $192.8 billion, they\u2019ve clearly benefited from the stratospheric rises in their companies\u2019 stock prices. But as you\u2019ll hear constantly repeated on Wall Street, past performance is not a guarantee of future results. So the question remains, which stock \u2014 Tesla or Amazon \u2014 is the better buy going forward? Here\u2019s a look at where the stocks have been, the pros and cons that currently affect them and what analysts think can happen from here.

Take advantage of the timeless appeal of gold in a Gold IRA recommended by Sean Hannity. Here are the performance stats for Tesla and Amazon over the past one-, three-, five-, 10- and 15-year periods. One-year return: -9.35% Three-year average annual return: -11.50% Five-year average annual return: 54.87% 10-year average annual return: 26.66% 15-year average annual return: N/A One-year return: 81.31% Three-year average annual return: 4.22% Five-year average annual return: 15.29% 10-year average annual return: 25.03% 15-year average annual return: 29.94% Despite the extreme variability in the performance of these two stocks, their 10-year average annual return is quite close.

This makes Tesla the worst-performing stock in the entire S&P 500 on a year-to-date basis. Amazon, on the other hand, has had a banner year in 2024, up 14.8% YTD as of March 15. This more than doubles the S&P 500\u2019s YTD return of 7.17%. Currently, 32 Wall Street analysts follow Tesla stock, and they have a consensus \u201cbuy\u201d rating on the company. Their average 12-month price target is $207.30, marking a potential gain one year out of about 27%. Amazon is covered by 47 analysts who have a consensus \u201cstrong buy\u201d on the stock. The average 12-month price target is $208.48, nearly identical to the forecast for Tesla. But in the case of Amazon\u2019s stock, that projection only amounts to a potential gain of just under 20%. In spite of its recent runup, Amazon still has a lot going for it. In addition to being the absolute go-to for online shopping of all types, Amazon actually generates a lot of its income from its cloud services division, Amazon Web Services. AWS already controls roughly one-third of the entire world\u2019s cloud computing service revenue, and that looks likely to expand. The company is also expanding into digital advertising, which could prove to be another generous revenue stream. Amazon recently joined the venerable Dow Jones Industrial Average, solidifying its position as one of the market\u2019s 30 leading stocks. For some investors, however, Amazon becoming a member of the Dow suggests that its growth years are behind it, and that it is transforming into \u2014 or has already become \u2014 a slow-growing blue-chip stock. With a price-earnings ratio north of 60x and future growth not as stellar as in its infancy, there could be some valuation risk in the stock, especially after an 80% gain over the past year. Tesla\u2019s transformation of the EV industry has been nothing short of miraculous, but now the company has to deal with something new \u2014 competition. A victim of its own success, nearly every car maker in the world is now jumping into the field, giving consumers more choice. In the meantime, EV sales themselves have been slowing, and Tesla\u2019s own price cuts are trimming the company\u2019s margins. According to analysts, the news is almost entirely bad around Tesla, from decelerating sales to a potential Q1 delivery miss, slashed earnings estimates and deteriorating margins. On the plus side, many legendary investors believe that the best time to buy a stock is when people are abandoning it. Warren Buffett himself is famous for his quote that you should be \u201cgreedy when others are fearful.\u201d While Buffett hasn\u2019t issued an opinion on Tesla\u2019s stock, the philosophy could be sound. In 2025, for example, Tesla intends to release a $25,000, next-generation electric vehicle, and if it\u2019s a hit, all could be well with Tesla once again. If that all pans out, investors may lament not picking up shares at current prices. Based on all of the above, it seems as if Amazon has the edge going forward. The company has posted more reliable results and it has its finger in a number of different growing industries. Tesla, on the other hand, remains something of a wild card. While currently the undisputed leader in electric vehicles, it\u2019s encountering headwinds it has never faced before. A bet on Tesla stock from here is a wager that Musk can navigate the next phase in EV development and reassert the company\u2019s dominance in the industry. That makes Tesla a much higher risk/reward play \u2014 but that is exactly what certain types of investors prefer.
