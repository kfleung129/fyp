    "text": "American EV giant\u00a0Tesla Inc.\u00a0TSLA\u00a0saw new vehicle registrations in the European Union surge by nearly 67% year-on-year in January. However, its growth was outpaced\u00a0by a surprising contender: Chinese state-owned automaker\u00a0SAIC Motors. What Happened:\u00a0Data from the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA) reveals Tesla registered 14,466 new vehicles in January, representing a 66.9% increase year-on-year. Meanwhile, SAIC reported a year-on-year jump of 69.5% with 9,746 new registrations. Headquartered in Shanghai, SAIC features on the Fortune Global 500 list and sold over 5 million vehicles in 2023, including 1.1 million New Energy Vehicles (NEVs). In China, NEV refers to vehicles primarily powered by electricity, encompassing battery-electric vehicles (BEVs) and hybrid electric vehicles, among others. Notably, Tesla only manufactures BEVs and reported 1.81 million vehicle deliveries for 2023. See Also:\u00a0Best Electric Vehicle Stocks Why It Matters:\u00a0Tesla ceded the title of\u00a0the world\u2019s top-selling BEV maker\u00a0to\u00a0BYD Co Ltd\u00a0BYDDY BYDDF last year. The Chinese player sold 526,000 BEVs, surpassing Tesla\u2019s 485,000, consolidating its position as a major global competitor. In December, BYD said it would build a\u00a0new factory in Hungary. The company currently has over 230 retail stores across countries and multiple models in the European region. However, SAIC Motors demonstrates that BYD is not the only Chinese company challenging Tesla\u2019s dominance. China\u2019s impressive exporting power is another factor to consider. The country\u00a0exported 5.2 million vehicles\u00a0last year, potentially overtaking Japan as the world\u2019s largest auto exporter. During Tesla\u2019s fourth-quarter earnings call, CEO\u00a0Elon Musk\u00a0even acknowledged that \u201cwithout trade barriers, Chinese EV makers will\u00a0pretty much demolish\u00a0most other car companies in the world.\u201d Check out more of Benzinga's Future Of Mobility coverage by\u00a0following this link.
