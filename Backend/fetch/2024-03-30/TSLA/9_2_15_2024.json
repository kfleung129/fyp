    "text": "Decision to move rocket company comes after Musk said he would hold shareholder vote to move Tesla to Texas as well Rocket company SpaceX has moved its state of incorporation to Texas from Delaware, CEO Elon Musk has announced. \u201cSpaceX has moved its state of incorporation from Delaware to Texas! If your company is still incorporated in Delaware, I recommend moving to another state as soon as possible,\u201d Musk said on the platform. The move comes after a Delaware judge ruled last month in favor of Tesla investors who had launched a lawsuit to challenge Musk\u2019s $56bn pay package as excessive. Musk, who is also CEO of Tesla said, earlier this month that he would hold a shareholder vote to move Tesla\u2019s state of incorporation to Texas as well. \u201cThe public vote is unequivocally in favor of Texas! Tesla will move immediately to hold a shareholder vote to transfer state of incorporation to Texas,\u201d Musk said on X earlier this month after holding a poll where 87% of respondents voted \u201cyes\u201d for Tesla\u2019s change of incorporation. In January, the Delaware judge found that Musk\u2019s compensation was inappropriately set by the electric-vehicle maker\u2019s board and struck down the package. The decision followed a lawsuit launched by Tesla shareholder Richard Tornetta five years ago, which accused Musk of improperly dictating negotiations around the compensation package, and claimed that the board had acted without independence. Tesla\u2019s agreement with Musk is by far the largest compensation deal ever for an executive and it contributes a significant part of his fortune, which is one of the world\u2019s largest. Musk testified during the compensation trial in November 2022 that the money would be used to finance interplanetary travel. Musk\u2019s brain-chip implant company, Neuralink, also changed its location of incorporation from Delaware to Nevada last week. Reuters contributed to this report "
