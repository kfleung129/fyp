But three weeks later, Tesla appears no closer to leaving Delaware \u2014 and with good reason. The central argument of the shareholder lawsuit filed against Tesla in Delaware\u2019s Court of Chancery was that the electric vehicle maker\u2019s board of directors is too close to Musk. Judge Kathaleen McCormick, who presided over the case, voided his performance-based compensation plan because of a lack of transparency from the company\u2019s board. \u201cMusk operates as if free of board oversight,\u201d the judge said in her ruling. That decision, legally speaking, leaves Tesla\u2019s board in a sticky situation,  Case Western Reserve University School of Law professor Anat Alon-Beck told Yahoo Finance. Without new independent directors, a shareholder vote on Tesla\u2019s reincorporation could be nixed over the same type of claims that invalidated Musk\u2019s compensation deal, she said. \u201cThe first thing is they need to appoint new directors,\u201d Alon-Beck said. \u201cYou need new blood.\u201d The board\u2019s chair, Robyn Denholm, has faced growing scrutiny since McCormick\u2019s decision. The judge described Denholm\u2019s approach to her oversight obligations as \u201clackadaisical.\u201d Adding to Tesla\u2019s worries are reports showing Musk\u2019s sway over the board, including pushing members to consume drugs with him. The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this year that Musk \u2014 who has been locked in a close race with Jeff Bezos and Bernard Arnault for the title of richest person in the world \u2014 is an occasional user of cocaine, ecstasy, LSD, and mushrooms, among other drugs. Musk has denied that. \u201cThey really need to get rid of three or four board members and replace them with truly independent board members that have no financial ties to Elon,\u201d Tesla shareholder Ross Gerber told CNBC earlier this month. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be very hard for the company to move forward with the current board.\u201d Despite Tesla\u2019s lack of public movement toward reincorporating in Texas, another of Musk\u2019s companies has already done so. Musk announced last week that SpaceX, his aerospace company, had officially moved to Texas. \u201cSpaceX has moved its state of incorporation from Delaware to Texas!,\u201d Musk wrote in a post on X, the social media platform he owns. \u201cIf your company is still incorporated in Delaware, I recommend moving to another state as soon as possible.\u201d Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.
