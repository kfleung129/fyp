    "text": "Elon Musk has lost bragging rights as the world\u2019s wealthiest tycoon to Bernard Arnault, the French patriarch behind luxury goods giant LVMH, following a disastrous January during which Tesla shed a staggering $200 billion in market value. The drop reflects a litany of setbacks the EV maker suffered in a month that saw a 26% plunge in Tesla\u2019s stock price. As a result, Musk\u2019s personal net worth is now currently\u00a0estimated\u00a0by\u00a0Forbes\u00a0at $205 billion, down from a peak of $320 billlion in November 2021. First Tesla\u00a0surrendered the crown\u00a0as the leading EV manufacturer to China\u2019s BYD in the fourth quarter. Official data later suggested Tesla had\u00a0deep-rooted problems\u00a0in Europe\u2019s largest car market, while frigid temperatures in the U.S. prompted a wave of fear regarding the general\u00a0reliability of EVs\u00a0outside of the warm climes found in California. Allegations also surfaced in the\u00a0Wall Street Journal\u00a0that Tesla\u2019s board knew Elon Musk was\u00a0abusing a wide range of narcotics. The Tesla CEO then compounded the company\u2019s problems after\u00a0leaning on his fellow directors\u00a0for a pay package that could double his stake to 25%\u2014lest he develop his AI and robotics plans elsewhere. Finally, the company\u2019s Q4 earnings last week turned into a stock price fiasco after Tesla refused to provide guidance beyond a vague warning that vehicle sales would grow at a \u201cnotably lower\u201d pace than in 2023, when it cut prices and sacrificed profits in a bid to prop up demand. Even as revenue rose by a fifth to a record $97 billion in 2023, earnings and free cash flow declined across the board. Investors are now looking to parse through the annual 10-K filing\u00a0published on Monday\u00a0for any further red flags, beyond the windfall\u00a0$5.9 billion accounting gain\u00a0booked in the fourth quarter. Tesla\u2019s only saving grace came in the form of Musk suggesting a\u00a0low-cost $25,000 entry-level model\u00a0would arrive in the\u00a0second half of next year, even though investors have yet to see so much as an official design rendering. Musk\u2019s personal fortune now rests heavily on one question: whether Tesla should be valued as an AI company, as the CEO insists it is\u2014in which case 2024\u2019s low growth is little more than an anomaly\u2014or whether it is closer to a cyclical goods manufacturer that deserves much lower multiples. By comparison, French luxury goods giant LVMH is\u00a0riding high\u00a0after Q4 sales that bucked a trend for the broader sector. Chief executive Bernard Arnault is now worth $208 billion, according to\u00a0Forbes, after\u00a0Friday\u2019s 12% share price gain. Musk is still easily within striking distance of Arnault. But if investors decide Tesla is not a tech stock after all\u2014and is in essence just a carmaker that for a time enjoyed a first mover advantage\u2014his wealth could tumble much further. BYD, at the\u00a0vanguard\u00a0of a\u00a0Chinese EV industry, offers a cautionary tale in that regard.\u00a0While Musk predicts the automaker could\u00a0demolish the global competition, it is worth just $70 billion. That\u2019s significantly less than the 13% stake in Tesla that Musk owns, so there is potentially a lot of downside still to go should his carmaker be re-rated. \u00a9 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.
