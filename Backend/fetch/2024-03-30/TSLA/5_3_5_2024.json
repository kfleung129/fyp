    "text": "Tesla\u2019s Stock Plummets as Elon Musk\u2019s Unfinished Projects Take a Toll, Investor Claims Elon Musk, the enigmatic CEO of Tesla, is once again in the spotlight as investor Ross Gerber claims that the company\u2019s stock is plummeting due to Musk\u2019s numerous unfinished projects. Gerber, a longtime Tesla bull, argues that these unfinished projects are causing investors to view Tesla primarily as a car company, which has led to a decrease in the company\u2019s valuation. According to Gerber, Tesla has been facing several headwinds over the past year, including rising competition from companies like BYD in China. In an effort to maintain its market position, Tesla had to issue significant price cuts on some of its models. However, despite these efforts, Tesla\u2019s sales in China hit a low point last month, raising concerns about the company\u2019s ability to compete globally. Gerber believes that the increasing competition has diverted Tesla\u2019s attention away from its other projects, such as developing its full self-driving technology. This technology is seen as crucial for adding value to the company, but its completion remains uncertain. Additionally, Musk\u2019s threats to move AI projects away from Tesla unless he gains 25% ownership of the company have been criticized by Gerber as \u201cdelusional.\u201d The combination of Musk\u2019s erratic behavior and the lack of progress on these projects has led to a reevaluation of Tesla\u2019s valuation. Gerber argues that investors are now valuing Tesla more as a hardware company rather than a software company. This shift in perception has caused Tesla\u2019s stock to decline significantly, with shares down 24% since the beginning of the year. Gerber is not the only one concerned about the risks associated with Musk\u2019s leadership. In 2023, a group of 17 shareholders wrote a letter to Tesla\u2019s board expressing their concerns and calling for Musk to be reined in amid his chaotic takeover of Twitter. As Tesla\u2019s stock continues to drop, some investors are questioning whether the company can still be considered part of the group of mega-cap tech stocks that have powered the stock market in recent years. Tesla\u2019s stock dropped almost 3% on Tuesday, trading at around $183.15 per share. Despite these concerns, Tesla has yet to comment on the situation. As the company faces increasing competition and criticism of its CEO\u2019s leadership style, it remains to be seen how Tesla will navigate these challenges and regain investor confidence. In conclusion, Tesla\u2019s stock is currently experiencing a significant decline due to Elon Musk\u2019s unfinished projects, according to investor Ross Gerber. The completion of projects such as full self-driving technology and Musk\u2019s demands for greater ownership have left investors concerned about Tesla\u2019s future. As a result, the company is now being valued primarily as a car company, with a decrease in its overall valuation. With increasing competition and criticism of Musk\u2019s leadership, Tesla faces an uphill battle to regain investor confidence and reestablish itself as a major player in the market. \u00a9 2023 | Email: contact@globalvillagespace.com "
