    "text": "Join us... The Cybertruck is designed to not resemble any vehicle out on the road. Not only is the Cybertruck the only mass-market vehicle that does not have paint, but the all-electric truck is also the only vehicle to be built out of stainless steel exoskeleton. If all this wasn\u2019t enough to make the Cybertruck stand out, the truck is also devoid of almost any curves. As Elon Musk put it, the pickup truck has a triangular silhouette, giving the Cybertruck a look that resembles \u201can armored personnel carrier from the future.\u201d Independent Recreation of Tesla\u2019s Infamous Cybertruck vs Porsche 911 Drag Race Reveals Interesting Results @Tesla @elonmusk #Tesla https://t.co/eTTFIAGrlC\n\u2014 Torque News (@torquenewsauto) February 15, 2024 A lot has been said about the Cybertruck\u2019s design. Some love it, others hate it, but one undeniable fact is that the Cybertruck catches people\u2019s attention.

The ultra-strong stainless steel exterior makes the vehicle extra durable; however, the thick stainless steel plates also mean that the panels can\u2019t be stamped into complex curves, giving the truck a brutalist exterior. The triangular silhouette also means that the Cybertruck is stiff and sturdy in a rollover; however, this same design decision has meant many people find the truck aesthetically unappealing. We can delve into many more pros and cons regarding the Cybertruck; however, a new Cybertruck picture in the snow might have shed light on an unexpected advantage to the truck\u2019s design. \u2018Inverse Cramer\u2019 Appears To No Longer Predict Tesla Stock Pirce \u2013 TSLA Down 25% Since CNBC Host Suggested \u201c2024 Will be Awful For Tesla\u201d @Tesla @elonmusk #Tesla https://t.co/ZOjJR8dAla\n\u2014 Torque News (@torquenewsauto) February 13, 2024 As I have already mentioned, the Cybertruck has a triangular silhouette that extends uninterrupted from the front of the truck to the tailgate. For aerodynamic purposes, not only is the Cybertruck triangular, but Tesla has ensured all the surfaces are continuous without any nooks and crannies, allowing air to flow rather smoothly over the surface. This decision was intended to increase the truck\u2019s range and efficiency; however, as I have mentioned above, one unintended benefit is how easy it is to remove snow off the Cybertruck\u2019s surface. Given the Cybertruck\u2019s smooth, uninterrupted surface, the ice quickly falls to the ground when you push off the snow from any part of the vehicle. The owner of the Cybertruck in question, Aaron Lieber, which was covered in over a foot of snow, confirmed on X that removing snow from the truck was relatively simple.
