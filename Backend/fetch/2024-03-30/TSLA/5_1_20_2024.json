    "text": "How do the two major residential solar installers stack up on equipment, warranties and more? Here's what you need to know. Solar panels are installed by dozens of different companies. It's worth including national solar companies in your search for a solar installer, since they might be able to offer lower prices or long term stability in what's currently a tumultuous time for the industry. Tesla, one of the industry's largest installers, and SunPower, one of the longest established, might both be worth a second look. Tesla -- better known for its electric vehicles -- has spent a few different stints near the top of the solar installation leader board, likely thanks to its promise to beat or match competitor's prices. Its\u00a0Powerwall\u00a0also set the standard for solar batteries, though options are proliferating these days. SunPower has been around since the 1980s and, as the exclusive residential installer (through March 2024) for Maxeon solar panels, installs some of the highest performing solar panels available to homeowners. Can solar panels save you money? Interested in understanding the impact solar can have on your home? Enter some basic information below, and we\u2019ll instantly provide a free estimate of your energy savings. Your search for a solar installer shouldn't end with one or even two companies. Make sure you get multiple quotes before choosing one to move forward with. If you're looking to squeeze the maximum amount of energy out of your solar panels, SunPower is one of, if not the best option on the market at the moment. This is due in large part to the industry-leading efficiency of the company's solar modules from sister brand Maxeon that achieve 22.8% conversion rates. It's hard to do better in the residential market. Maxeon also goes a step farther with its warranties that guarantee those panels will continue to produce at least 92% of that original efficiency for 25 years. That's also an industry-leading promise -- most other installers promise around 85% of original production for the same period. A SunPower installation. SunPower operates nationwide and has also begun offering a wider selection of modules made in the USA by Qcells. The company relies on its in-house branded SunVault line for batteries and Enphase inverters. The company's track record isn't perfect, but it's hard to find an unblemished solar company in this crowded and competitive market. SunPower's reputation and rankings are nearer to the top among national solar companies than the bottom. Tesla's name recognition makes it a popular choice for solar nationwide, and it also offers some of the best value, with relatively low prices and a price match guarantee. However, paying less for panels could come at the expense of customer service, where the company has a less-than-stellar reputation. To be fair, individual experiences vary widely and online reviews aren't the best source of information. There are plenty of satisfied Tesla customers out there as well. Tesla also offers some unique products, like its Powerwall storage system and a solar roof made up of proprietary solar tiles. By most accounts, Tesla offers quality equipment for the best prices around, with warranties that are in line with industry standards. A Tesla solar installation. If anything goes wrong though, you might be in for more of a headache than with other companies. Tesla's lack of a broad selection of equipment might also be considered a knock on the company for the more discerning energy aficionado. At a glance, SunPower offers top-of-the-line equipment and warranties, but Tesla's offerings certainly aren't that far behind, and plenty of consumers will place a premium on the popular company's price match policy. If you're the type of person looking to get the most out of your solar system for as long as possible, and you're willing to pay a little extra for that privilege, SunPower makes a strong case for itself with its efficient modules and strong warranties. But if you're looking for value backed by a company that is a force in multiple industries, not to mention pop culture, Tesla is worth a close look. The average consumer isn't likely to notice a huge difference in performance between systems, and Tesla's panels and Powerwalls arguably look a little cooler, if that matters to you. We've outlined our concerns about customer service with Tesla, but the evidence for this is largely anecdotal. Be sure to do your own research and due diligence and ask around about both companies. Always get multiple quotes from local installers before signing any contracts. CNET does not directly review any of the equipment mentioned here, nor do we go through the ordering or installation process with either of the companies. The reality is that homeowners' situations are so unique, even if we did have panels installed, it would only capture a tiny fraction of the many variations of experiences with the solar industry. Instead we rely on our knowledge of the industry, in-depth conversations with company representatives and our own research to evaluate companies. (Tesla doesn't operate a press office, so our review of it is based on information available on its website.) We do so with a particular emphasis on three categories: equipment, warranties and service. Here's a more detailed look into our process. Each company has its own strengths. Tesla has a strong national brand and price match guarantee on its equipment that's generally considered high quality. SunPower offers efficient panels and warranties that are among the best in the industry. SunPower may be more expensive, but Tesla's value may come at the expense of customer service. At the moment we're unaware of SunPower offering any Tesla equipment. Each consumer has their own needs that may be ideally filled by different companies. That said, we've reviewed and scored numerous solar companies here. SunPower offers some of the most efficient solar panels available in the residential market, which can be married with its SunVault line of batteries. Both are well regarded in general.
