Yesterday Bitcoin (BTC-USD) reached $64.32 a share. Currently, it is at $63. Year-to-date, the cryptocurrency is up 81.48%. On the other hand, Tesla (TSLA) reached its all-time high on Nov. 4, 2021, reaching $409.97. The stock is currently at $178.19 a share, down 28.29% year-to-date. Since 2000, Bitcoin (BTC-USD) and Tesla (TSLA) exhibited a correlation typically under 0.5, but since September, the correlation has been -0.59, Analyst Adam Jonas wrote. \u201cWe believe the correlation began to break-down around the time of disappointing third quarter 2023 results, impacted further by the disappointing fiscal year 2024 outlook for \u2018notably lower\u2019 sales growth,\u201d the report said. Negative sentiment around electric vehicles fundamentals and positioning have affected the Tesla stock (TSLA) since late last year. \u201cTesla\u2019s decelerating EV business and lower margin trajectory has coincided with the AI theme achieving even greater \u2018escape velocity\u2019 in the market,\u201d Jonas said. \u201cPortfolios have had to make room for the continued surge in other terra-cap AI names, which may have served to marginalize Tesla shares at the moment.\u201d  "
