    "text": "(Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc.\u2019s slide to the lowest level since May attracted a wave of bullish option buying not in the stock itself, but with an exchange traded fund that offers more leverage.

According to Chris Murphy, co-head of derivative strategy at Susquehanna International Group, the trader may have targeted the ETF \u2014 as opposed to options tied to Tesla shares \u2014 in order to take advantage of the fund\u2019s added leverage. Tesla shares slumped as much as 6.9% Monday to the lowest level since May after Handelsblatt reported the German IT giant SAP is removing the electric-vehicle maker from the list of its car suppliers. The EV maker has slipped more than 4% over the past year, trailing other megacap companies. By comparison, Meta Platforms is up 147% over the same period. The option \u2014 a Jan. 17 $12.73 call \u2014 traded in small blocks throughout the morning, with the ETF trading around $8.50. By 1:12 p.m. in New York, the contract had changed hands 63,000 times \u2014 pushing the total call volume to nearly eight times greater than the average over the past month. The 6.3 million shares that represents would be more than one-third of the fund\u2019s 15-day average volume.
