The historical average of roughly 15 shows a poor value for TSLA stock as investors are paying higher share prices relative to the company's earnings. TSLA's high trailing PE ratio shows that the firm has been trading above its fair market value recently. Its trailing 12-month earnings per share (EPS) of 4.30 does not justify the stock's current price. However, trailing PE ratios do not factor in the company's projected growth rate, resulting in many newer firms having high PE ratios due to high growth potential enticing investors despite inadequate earnings.\n\n\n\n\nTSLA's 12-month-forward PE to Growth  (PEG) ratio of 3.36 is considered a poor value as the market is overvaluing TSLA in relation to the company's projected earnings growth due. TSLA's PEG comes from its forward price to earnings ratio being divided by its growth rate. A PEG ratio of 1 represents a perfect correlation between earnings growth and share price. Due to their incorporation of more fundamentals of a company's overall health and focusing on the future rather than the past, PEG ratios are one of the most used valuation metrics by analysts today.\n\nSummary\n\nAll together these valuation metrics paint a pretty poor picture for TSLA at its current price due to a overvalued PEG ratio despite strong growth. The PE and PEG for TSLA are worse than the average of the market resulting in a valuation score of 22.\n\n Click Here to get the full Report on Tesla Inc (TSLA) stock.
