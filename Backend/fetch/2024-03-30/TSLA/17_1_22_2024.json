    "text": " One auto CEO believes Musk has made a mistake Advertisement Source: ssi77 / Shutterstock.com CEO Elon Musk turned plenty of heads in 2023 when he opted to slash prices on multiple Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) models. A clear attempt to compete with the growing number of electric vehicle (EV) makers undercutting Tesla\u2019s high prices, Musk\u2019s decision didn\u2019t really help TSLA stock or the broader EV market. Now, though, the company is moving into a new year with no plans to stop lowering its prices. As Investor\u2019s Business Daily reports, this trend is sparking concern among Wall Street analysts. Some business leaders are opting against following Musk\u2019s example, however. In fact, one rival CEO recently stated that, if price cuts continue without leading to profits, the industry could experience a \u201cbloodbath.\u201d If that happens, it could significantly hinder the entire EV market\u2019s progress as well as EV stocks. News of ongoing Tesla price cuts hasn\u2019t been well received by Wall Street. Multiple analysts have lowered their price targets on TSLA stock recently and things only seem to be getting worse. Today, Tesla shares closed down by 1.6%. Shares have also fallen more than 15% since the year began and investors have cause for concern. Stellantis (NYSE:STLA) CEO Carlos Tavares\u00a0shares in this concern, as he recently made clear. What\u2019s more, while TSLA stock has mostly trended downward over the past six months, STLA stock has managed to remain in the green by over 15%. So, why is Tavares worried? Specifically, the CEO is taking a stand against Elon Musk\u2019s chosen method of trying to spur growth. While he didn\u2019t name Tesla directly, the Stellantis CEO did state, \u201cI know a company that has brutally cut pricing, and their profitability has brutally collapsed.\u201d Tavares seems to have no intention of letting Stellantis sell discounted EVs at a loss, noting that his company is already making money from EV sales and that he expects this growth trend to continue. \u201cThere is no such thing as slowing down for the EV road map for Stellantis\u201d he added. This full-steam ahead approach comes at a time when rivals Ford (NYSE:F) and General Motors (NYSE:GM) are cutting back on EV production due to demand concerns. But international auto giants like Hyundai (OTCMKTS:HYMTF) and Volvo (OTCMKTS:VLVLY) have actually reported impressive growth \u2014 and seem to have the same mindset as Tavares. Even Musk has admitted that cutting prices hasn\u2019t quite helped Tesla, which he attributes to high interest rates. But no matter what this year brings from the Federal Reserve, it\u2019s clear that Tesla\u2019s price cuts haven\u2019t led to enough sales. The fact that the EV market is growing all the time and competition is fierce is also too important to disregard. As InvestorPlace contributor Chris MacDonald reports: \u201cTesla, with fewer vehicle sales but higher margins, faced pressure as it reduced model prices. Although subscriptions could enhance profits, challenges, including the loss of EV tax credits, may require further price cuts. Slowing growth suggests a potentially challenging year for the stock, particularly with other higher-growth options available to investors in this sector right now.\u201d If Stellantis reports high sales growth this year and Tesla reports low numbers, it will demonstrate that Tavares\u2019 thesis on price cuts is likely correct. And if it is, TSLA stock and the larger EV market may have a difficult time righting the ship.
