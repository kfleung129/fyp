Considered to be Ghana\u2019s \u201ccrown jewels,\u201d the treasures were looted by the British army during the Anglo-Asante Wars in the 1800s. Several British laws prevent the museums from returning the artifacts to Ghana outright, so they\u2019ll only be in west Africa on a three-year loan. The British Museum and other collections in Europe and North America have faced recent criticism for not returning artifacts to their countries of origin\u2014U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak canceled a meeting with his Greek counterpart over an ongoing dispute as recently as November. Serbia's Novak Djokovic acknowleges applauds by the supporters as he walks off the court after losing against Italy's Jannik Sinner during their men's singles semi-final match on day 13 of the Australian Open tennis tournament in Melbourne on January 26, 2024. Italian tennis player Jannik Sinner defeated defending champion and top seed Novak Djokovic at the Australian Open semifinal in Melbourne on Friday, handing the world\u2019s top-ranked male player his first defeat at the tournament since 2018. Djokovic holds a record 24 Grand Slam men\u2019s singles titles, including 10 Australian Open titles, and the 36-year-old ranked first in Forbes\u2019 list of the World\u2019s Highest-Paid Tennis Players for 2023. U.S. economic output, or real GDP, expanded by 2.5% in 2023\u2014a somewhat surprising feat considering the economy\u2019s downtrodden state heading into the year, when the Federal Reserve had projected 0.5% output growth. It signals the strength of the American consumer in the face of higher interest rates, though growth does appear to be slowing. Tesla stock slid about 12% Thursday after the company reported missed estimates in its fourth quarter earnings, as Elon Musk\u2019s electric vehicle goliath grapples with shrinking profit margins as it expands output. Perhaps most worrisome was Tesla\u2019s vague warning of \u201cnotably lower\u201d output in 2024, as analysts slammed Musk and company\u2019s lack of clear guidance. MORE: Musk\u2019s net worth fell by more than $18 billion alongside Tesla\u2019s stock decline, though he remains the richest person in the world. The centibillionaire is worth an estimated $204.2 billion. Mark Suzman, CEO of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation With extreme poverty rates on the rise, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation CEO Mark Suzman said his organization\u2019s budget for 2024 will rise to $8.6 billion, up $300 million from last year, and he\u2019s encouraging the ultra-wealthy around the globe to give more as well. By Suzman\u2019s calculations, if each billionaire were to give away 0.5% of their net worth, that would unlock $61 billion in giving\u2014about seven times this year\u2019s budget for the Gates Foundation. The FTC voted unanimously to open an investigation into the billion-dollar deals forged by tech giants and swiftly growing generative AI companies, including Microsoft, OpenAI, Amazon, Alphabet and Anthropic PBC. The investigation will look into whether the tech giants are \u201cdistorting innovation and undermining fair competition\u201d in the generative AI market. Months after Microsoft finalized its acquisition of Activision Blizzard, the company announced layoffs affecting 1,900 employees across its video game divisions, around 8% of its total gaming workforce. The cuts follow a string of other reductions in the gaming and tech industries this year so far, such as Riot Games and Unity Software, as well as Wayfair, Google, Amazon, Twitch and Discord. More than 40% of state lawmakers say they\u2019ve experienced threats in the past three years, while nearly 20% of other local officeholders reported experiencing threats in the past year-and-a-half, with many expressing reluctance to legislate on contentious issues, according to a new report. Women and people of color were more likely to report receiving targeted abuse mentioning their gender or race. Former President Donald Trump took the stand briefly in his own defense at the defamation trial brought by writer E. Jean Carroll, telling the court he \u201cwanted to defend myself, my family and frankly the presidency.\u201d Trump\u2019s entire testimony, described as fiery, lasted only about three minutes, reporters in the courtroom said.

More than 8 million copies of Palworld have sold in less than a week\u2014already making it one of the fastest selling video games of all time. We\u2019re deep into the pickleball craze, with participation numbers and demands for courts rising nationwide. At the same time, we\u2019re seeing savvy businesses take over abandoned shopping malls and move into spaces once occupied by big-box stores. One of the biggest names in the market is Major League Pickleball founder Steve Kuhn. Here\u2019s a take on the other players in the indoor pickleball market. Aileen Lee, managing partner and cofounder of Cowboy Ventures TOPLINE Back in 2013, when venture capitalist Aileen Lee first coined the term \u201cunicorn,\u201d just 39 companies qualified for the moniker. That club has now grown to 532, according to Lee\u2019s latest research for her firm Cowboy Ventures, a 14X growth rate. And when it comes to today\u2019s broader ecosystem of unicorns, startups whose valuations reached $1 billion or more over 10 years, in some ways it\u2019s more diverse than ever\u2014in sector focus, founder background and headquarter location. \u201cEnterprising people came up with all these new ways to use technology to help nurses and hospitals, or accountants, or farmers,\u201d Lee says, noting that the list of 532 unicorns includes 19 sectors that Cowboy Ventures wasn\u2019t even tracking 10 years ago, including generative AI and enterprise marketplaces. But in gender diversity, progress has been slow. Among the unicorns of 2013, there were no female CEOs and only 5% had a female founder or cofounder. Today, 14% of unicorns have a female cofounder and 5% have a founding CEO who identifies as female. The numbers have edged up, but there are still more founders named Michael, David or Andrew among the present-day unicorn ecosystem than there are female CEOs, and Cowboy Ventures\u2019 analysis estimates that it will take until 2063 to reach fully equal gender representation. WHY IT MATTERS There is ample evidence that shows investments made in female-founded companies are often a more lucrative financial move than investing in male-founded companies. \u201cEspecially in downturns, women and minorities have been kind of forced to be scrappier and to do more with less. So I think they will continue\u201d to do so and also grow their ranks among the unicorn club\u2019s founders, she said.
