    "text": "Elon Musk\u2019s reported drug use has Tesla Inc. board members facing a familiar quandary: having to decide what, if anything, to do about the chief executive subjecting directors and shareholders alike to great financial and legal risk. The Wall Street Journal\u2019s\u00a0article\u00a0describing Musk\u2019s history of recreational drug use and ongoing consumption of ketamine is the latest in a long line of tests for a board packed with the CEO\u2019s acolytes \u2014 several of whom\u00a0agreed\u00a0less than six months ago to return $735 million to settle a lawsuit alleging they had excessively compensated themselves. Shareholders voiced dissatisfaction with the board last year over Tesla\u2019s\u00a0succession planning, and accused Musk of being\u00a0distracted\u00a0by his commitments to other companies. His chaotic 2022 takeover of Twitter Inc., the social media company he\u2019s renamed X Corp., contributed to Tesla losing $672 billion in market capitalization that year.

They also testified in proceedings related to the\u00a0$55 billion\u00a0compensation package they arranged for Musk, and in a trial challenging Tesla\u2019s $2.6 billion acquisition of\u00a0SolarCity, the struggling power provider run by Musk\u2019s cousins. The report by the Journal \u2014 which said Musk has used LSD, cocaine, ecstasy and psychedelic mushrooms, often at private parties \u2014 isn\u2019t even the Tesla board\u2019s first brush with drug-related issues. Weeks after the New York Times\u00a0reported\u00a0in August 2018 that directors had expressed concern about Musk\u2019s use of Ambien, he\u00a0puffed a blunt\u00a0containing marijuana on comedian Joe Rogan\u2019s podcast. Tesla\u2019s board took minimal action in the wake of those episodes. It replaced Musk as chairman and named two new independent directors as required by the settlement of fraud charges brought by the US Securities and Exchange Commission. It could face more litigation over its handling of Musk\u2019s drug use, said Stephen Diamond, who teaches courses on corporate governance at Santa Clara University\u2019s School of Law. \u201cThis will give ammunition to class-action lawyers on behalf of disgruntled shareholders at Tesla, if they can tie evidence of drug use to his actual role as an executive,\u201d Diamond said. \u201cThe Tesla board has an obligation to discern what\u2019s going on here.\u201d While Musk\u2019s drug use has the potential to harm his other enterprises \u2014 particularly Space Exploration Technologies Corp., a US government contractor \u2014 he derives more of his fortune from Tesla than any other company. His shares and exercisable stock options are worth $97.6 billion, or about 44% of his $219.4 billion net worth, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. \u201cWhatever I\u2019m doing, I should obviously\u00a0keep doing it!\u201d Musk posted on X, citing Tesla and SpaceX being the world\u2019s most valuable car and space companies. \u201cIf drugs actually helped improve my net productivity over time,\u00a0I would definitely take them!\u201d Tesla\u2019s longest-serving directors are Musk, 52, and his younger brother, Kimbal \u2014 both have been on the board since 2004. Kimbal\u2019s reelection to the board has gotten pushback in recent years from an investor critical of his\u00a0lack of relevant industry experience\u00a0and a proxy adviser concerned about\u00a0objectivity. Proxy advisers also\u00a0opposed\u00a0the 2022 reelection of Ira Ehrenpreis, a venture capitalist who has been on the board since 2007. They cited concern about the amount of borrowing against Tesla stock by Musk and other directors, and a half measure the board took in response to a shareholder proposal for annual director elections that got majority support in 2021. The only other relatively long-tenured director on the board is Robyn Denholm, who joined in 2014 and became chair in 2018. Months after her elevation to the position, which was linked to the SEC suing Musk and Tesla over his take-private tweeting, she praised Musk\u2019s use of the social media platform. \u201cTwitter is part of everyday business for many executives today,\u201d Denholm said in a\u00a0March 2019 interview. \u201cFrom my perspective, he uses it wisely.\u201d Tesla\u2019s four other directors are James Murdoch, the former 21st Century Fox CEO appointed in 2017; Kathleen Wilson-Thompson, the former human-resources chief of Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. who joined in 2018; and Joe Gebbia and JB Straubel, who were elected to the board last year. Gebbia co-founded Airbnb Inc., and Straubel is a co-founder of Tesla. Musk has close relationships with Murdoch, Gebbia and Straubel. During testimony in Delaware Chancery Court over his Tesla compensation package in 2022, the CEO fielded questions from a plaintiff\u2019s lawyer about\u00a0vacationing\u00a0with Murdoch on several occasions. After Musk tweeted about trying to take Tesla private, Gebbia texted his praise, calling it a \u201cballer move.\u201d Musk and Straubel\u2019s ties date back to Tesla\u2019s founding\u00a0in 2003. While Tesla\u2019s directors have been\u00a0well-compensated, being a board member has at times been risky. In April 2020, the company\u00a0disclosed\u00a0that it had decided not to renew its directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability policy, due to high premiums quoted by insurers. Musk agreed to personally provide coverage, which the board determined wouldn\u2019t impair directors\u2019 independent judgment. After\u00a0catching flak\u00a0for the arrangement, which initially was planned to last a year, Tesla\u00a0disclosed\u00a0in October 2020 that it had lined up a customary insurance policy for its directors and officers. It paid Musk $3 million for 90 days\u2019 worth of interim coverage that he provided. Musk\u2019s reported drug use may temporarily hit Tesla\u2019s shares, said Gene Munster, a managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management. But those who have held on through the CEO\u2019s antics have been rewarded \u2014 the stock has soared 1,168% since Musk\u2019s marijuana toke in September 2018. \u201cA small percentage of investors will sell their stock over the next week and put some pressure on shares,\u201d Munster said Sunday. \u201cMost investors won\u2019t care, because it falls into the category that if you want to profit from Elon, you have to put up with his controversies.\u201d \u00a9 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.
