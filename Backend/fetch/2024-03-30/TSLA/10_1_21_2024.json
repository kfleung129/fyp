One of them is Tesla (TSLA), which reports on Wednesday and has seen its share price decline about 15% so far this year after cutting prices on some models in Europe and China. Investors will be looking to see if the escalating price wars impact the electric vehicle (EV) maker\u2019s bottom line after it reported weaker-than-expected revenue and profit last quarter. On Tuesday, earnings from Netflix (NFLX) could show if its ad-supported subscription tier helped boost growth after subscriptions rose last quarter. When Intel (INTC) reports on Thursday, investors will be looking for an update on the chipmaker\u2019s progress capitalizing on surging interest in artificial intelligence (AI), as well as its foundry business and demand for PCs.

December\u2019s jobs report showed employers added more positions than expected as wages rose, while retail sales continued to increase at a robust pace, adding to some worries that rate hikes by the Fed may not have curbed inflation enough for the Fed to start cutting rates soon. The most recent measurement of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) showed inflation ticked higher in December after easing over the past several months. Friday\u2019s PCE release comes after the Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred measure of inflation fell to an annual rate of 2.6% in November, its lowest since early 2021.
