What Happened:\u00a0According to a\u00a0report\u00a0from the German newspaper Handelsblatt on Monday, SAP, a large fleet operator with approximately 29,000 vehicles in its fleet, will no longer procure Tesla cars, aligning with Germany-headquartered\u00a0car rental company\u00a0Sixt SE. The report indicated that SAP\u2019s fleet manager,\u00a0Steffen Krautwasser, highlighted the frequent price fluctuations of Tesla vehicles compared to those of other automakers, posing challenges in company planning. Additionally, Tesla vehicles are often delivered earlier than agreed upon, leading to operational disruptions. Why It Matters: Despite notable players like Sixt, SAP, and U.S. car rental firm Hertz announcing intentions to discontinue Tesla EV acquisitions, other entities are actively considering incorporating Tesla vehicles into their fleets. For instance, Dartmouth College\u2019s Department of Safety and Security aims to transition over half of its current fleet to Tesla Model Y vehicles, as\u00a0reported\u00a0by the college\u2019s student newspaper. However, with only seven vehicles currently in their fleet, the department plans to introduce four Tesla Model Y SUVs while retaining three Ford vehicles. The report further suggested that the department may eventually explore transitioning to a fully electric fleet. Check out more of Benzinga's Future Of Mobility coverage by\u00a0following this link.
