    "text": "Another tough day for Wall Street is in the making after China growth numbers disappointed, hitting oil and a bunch of U.S.-listed Chinese stocks. \u2018I can\u2019t afford to keep paying for two households\u2019: My adult sons live rent-free in my house, while I pay for 50% of utilities in my second husband\u2019s condo \u2018She\u2019s obsessed\u2019: My mom moved into my house and refuses to move out. She has paid for repairs and appliances. What should I do? Apple\u2019s stock could soar nearly 25%, BofA says, going against tide of skepticism Social Security\u2019s cost-of-living adjustment for 2025 could be the lowest in five years \u2018You are not paid for the risk you take.\u2019 Why this money manager is betting bonds over stocks this year. That brings us to our call of the day  , where market observers say China-related trouble continues to build for Tesla TSLA and Apple AAPL and their investors. In a note to clients, Mike O\u2019Rourke, chief technical strategist at JonesTrading, observes how Magnificent Seven stocks have been under pressure to shore up the S&P 500 SPX in a bumpy 2024. \u201cKey leaders Apple and Tesla continue to be bombarded by daily negative headlines regarding their fundamental businesses. While it barely draws much attention, it does not help that they are also the two most China exposed companies,\u201d says the strategist. Apple and Tesla have lost 4% and 11% respectively this year, the worst performers of the seven. So is China a common denominator for the pair\u2019s woes? Apple recently cut handset prices  in the China where it battles competitors like Huawei. Tesla also reduced EV prices in the country where Berkshire Hathaway-owned BYD CN:002594 rules. Wednesday brought news of Tesla price cuts in Germany , where it faces production disruptions due to Red Sea ship attacks. China represented a 19% chunk of Apple\u2019s revenue in 2023 , and roughly 22% for Tesla in the first nine months of last year . Jenny Hardy, portfolio manager on the\u00a0 GP Bullhound Global Technology Fund , tells MarketWatch that for Apple and Tesla, \u201cit\u2019s much more about the competitive environment that could hurt them rather than their underlying markets.\u201d She notes that in a gloomy China market, EVs and smartphone sales were strong into end 2023. Hardy notes a number of new launches in China have been competing with Tesla at the higher end, such as Huawei\u2019s luxury Aito M9 model, rumored to have hit weekly sales of more than 20,000. \u201cAt the very least for Tesla it means the aggressive price war it is facing in China continues,\u201d she says. And Huawai has also been taking \u201csignificant share\u201d where Apple is concerned. That company had a 16% smartphone share in China that fell to around 2% by 2022 after the U.S. blacklist, she notes. \u201cFor us in the portfolio, we continue to be exposed to China EV through the semiconductor component companies who supply into the Chinese market (Infineon XE:IFX and NXP NXPI) \u2013 who are less vulnerable to pricing pressure than the OEMs. We remain cautious around broader consumer electronics exposure, where the Chinese demand recovery remains uncertain,\u201d Hardy says. More food for thought comes from Peter Navarro, former White House trade adviser under President Donald Trump, whose recent op/ed  \u2014 \u201cThe eve of Apple and Tesla\u2019s destruction in China\u201d \u2014 has been making the rounds. Navarro, it should be noted, is due to be sentenced later this month after being found guilty of contempt of Congress for not cooperating with a probe into the U.S. Capitol attack two year ago. \u201cLike GE before it, Apple and\u00a0Tesla\u00a0now have this grim mercantilist reality. Because Mr.\u00a0Cook\u00a0and Mr.\u00a0Musk\u00a0each directed the offshoring of the vast bulk of Apple\u2019s and\u00a0Tesla\u2019s production to\u00a0China\u00a0, the companies are at the mercy of a merciless dictator in Xi Jinping,\u201d he writes. \u201cArrogance and hubris are common threads that run from Mr.\u00a0Immelt \u00a0[Jeffrey, former CEO] in the 2000s through Mr.\u00a0Cook\u00a0and Mr.\u00a0Musk\u00a0today,\u201d said Navarro, adding that the companies\u2019 products face a \u201cxenophobic ban\u201d in the country. The food-for-thought kicker from Navarro? \u201cWhether you are a big hedge-fund manager or a small retail investor, you have to wonder whether Apple or\u00a0Tesla\u00a0are still safe investments \u2014 at least on the long side, if you get my drift.\u201d Read:  Is AI hype starting to fade?
