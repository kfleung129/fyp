    "text": "Tesla (TSLA) has reportedly grown its deliveries by 25% in the US last year to now hold a 4.2% market share of the US auto market. It wasn\u2019t that long ago that many bigwigs in the auto industry didn\u2019t see Tesla ever being more than a niche automaker. But the company has made itself undeniable by holding a majority market share in the electric vehicle market in the US. And as EV volumes have been growing, Tesla is now becoming a significant player in the broader auto market in its home country. According to the latest estimates from Kelley Blue Book, the Texas-based automaker increased its deliveries in the US by 25% last year to over 650,000 vehicles. With that increase, Tesla now holds a 4.2% market share of the auto market. You can\u2019t make this upTesla ended 2023 at exactly 4.20% market share.(Source: Kelly Blue Book) pic.twitter.com/p2NuWXyr3K It might now sound like much at first, but the auto market is extremely fragmented with only a few capable of having double-digit market shares in the US. Therefore, it is enough for Tesla to now surpass large well-established brands like VW, BMW, Subaru, and Mazda. Tesla had the biggest increase in deliveries of any major automaker other than Honda, who had a massive year. We didn't buy our model 3 Tesla because we had to, we bought it because of how it performs, rides, handles and the freedom from gasoline. We also enjoy taking the car on long road trips. It's a superior ownership experience. EV's may not be for everyone at this time, they will continue to improve, along with superchargers. To each their own! That\u2019s very cool to see. I think Tesla keeps climbing those rankings. I don\u2019t know if Tesla can surpass the next automaker, Nissan, this year with over 300,000 more vehicles. The Cybertruck is probably not enough to make the difference. Tesla needs its next-gen cheaper vehicle to start reaching that next level and double-digit market shares. That\u2019s when things are going to be really interesting. I think 2025-2026 is going to be when everyone is going to accept that their next *new* vehicle is going to be all-electric.
