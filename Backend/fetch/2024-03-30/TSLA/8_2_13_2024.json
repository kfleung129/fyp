(which trades under the symbol TSLA) is a car company, but if you want to buy Tesla stock, it helps to be comfortable with roller coasters. That\u2019s because wild up-and-down share price swings are a hallmark of the stock\u2019s performance, especially given the company's mercurial CEO, Elon Musk, and his constant presence in the news, particularly since purchasing Twitter (now known as \"X\"). But maybe the opportunity to buy Tesla stock during one of its price dips is what piques your interest. You can buy Tesla stock through a brokerage account. You have to add money to the account and then purchase purchase Tesla stock shares from there. You cannot buy Tesla stock directly from Tesla the company. \u00bb Check out the best brokerage accounts for stock trading Charles Schwab Interactive Brokers IBKR Lite J.P.

Morgan Self-Directed Investing account with qualifying new money. If you don\u2019t already have an investment account, you\u2019ll need one to buy Tesla stock. In general, you\u2019ll want a brokerage account with no trading commissions, useful trading tools and no account or inactivity fees. Worth noting: If you\u2019re buying Tesla shares for retirement because you believe in the company\u2019s long-term potential, a Roth IRA could be a good parking spot. That\u2019s because qualified withdrawals from a Roth are tax-free, so you won\u2019t be responsible for paying Uncle Sam for investment gains (like with a traditional IRA), which could be substantial with a potentially fast-growing company like Tesla. If this is all new to you, here is what you\u2019ll need to know to open a brokerage account. Before you load up the trunk with Tesla shares, pop open the hood and see what you\u2019re really getting into. Remember, when you buy a stock, you\u2019re purchasing a small portion of an actual business, not just hitching a ride on a cult of personality. Tesla's balance sheet, income statement, competition and management (all explained in our guide on how to research stocks) will help you give the company a good once-over. You can access research, analyst ratings and other key information about Tesla via your brokerage account or a financial information website. If you like what you see, your next step is to consider the rest of your portfolio. One of the key tenets of investing is diversification, which means spreading your money around among many different investments \u2014 a variety of companies, industries and geographical locations, as well as investments that aren't tied to the stock market, like bonds or real estate. This is the \u201cdon\u2019t put all of your eggs in one basket\u201d rule you may have heard. If you don\u2019t have a diversified portfolio yet, one of the easiest ways to get there is by investing in mutual or index funds rather than individual stocks. Funds essentially bundle stocks together to lessen the chances that you\u2019ll lose your entire investment if a single company tanks. (Here\u2019s how to invest in index funds, many of which, conveniently enough, contain Tesla stock.) If you do already have a diversified portfolio, you'll want to consider how Tesla fits into that \u2014 ask yourself how much you're already exposed to EV stocks, or simply to stocks in general. A strong portfolio has a healthy mix of stocks and bonds, though the exact asset allocation depends on your goals, timeline and risk tolerance. This is partially dictated by how much money you have to invest. But you should also think about how much of your portfolio you want to tie to Tesla\u2019s business performance, and where you stand in your progress toward other financial goals. High on most lists should be an emergency fund. Experts suggest aiming for three-to-six months' worth of expenses, though even $500 to $1,000 is a good start. Your emergency fund should go not into an individual stock like Tesla, but into a high-yield savings account where it is safe and accessible. It's wise to also consider when you'll need the money you plan to invest in Tesla \u2014 generally speaking, stock market investments should have a time frame of five years or more, meaning you should be thinking of Tesla as a long-term investment, and only investing money you won't need in the near future. Finally, there's your budget. What if you don\u2019t have enough to buy an entire share of Tesla? You may be able to purchase a fractional share \u2014 essentially a piece of a share. Several brokers now offer fractional shares of individual stocks. When a company\u2019s share price is somewhat unpredictable, it can be hard to know when to step on the gas and go forward with purchasing shares. The good news is that you have options. They are: Buy Tesla stock right now: When you're ready to buy Tesla stock in your brokerage account, you'll be given the option to choose between a market order and a limit order. A market order places the trade right away. It will be executed at the best possible price at the time of your trade. The potential downside is that with a fast-moving stock like Tesla, by the time your order goes through, you could end up paying more (or less!) than what you were quoted. Buy Tesla stock at a specific share price: A limit order allows you to set the price you\u2019re willing to pay and only takes place if the stock reaches that price or lower. It\u2019s a good way to ensure some predictability in what you pay. A possible downside: Your order may not be fully executed, or even fulfilled at all, if Tesla\u2019s price swings so wildly that enough shares don\u2019t become available before the order expires. Buy Tesla stock systematically over time: Dollar-cost averaging takes some of the fear and guesswork out of deciding the best time to buy Tesla stock. Instead of buying all the shares you want in a single purchase, you spread out your trades and buy shares at regular intervals over time (days, months and even years). You can schedule these purchases based on price with a stop-loss or stop-limit order, as explained in more depth in our full guide to how to buy stocks. On a similar note...
