In a separate memo, CEO Sam Altman called the X owner his hero and added he misses the man who was known for competition via its better technology. Elon Musk and OpenAI are now engaged in a legal battle in which the Tesla CEO claims the company sidestepped its initial commitments concerning artificial intelligence for all. While this affair is gaining diverse reactions in the tech landscape, media reports, citing OpenAI, believe the lawsuit stems from Musk's regret that he is no longer a part of the company.  \nOpenAI claims that this suit \"may stem from Elon's regrets about not being involved with the company today\", citing Jason Kwon, Chief Strategy Officer of OpenAI in an internal memo, CNBC reported. Kwon further called the lawsuit \"disappointing\" because the X (formerly Twitter) owner started the AI company. \nAlso Read:\u00a0'Anytime': Sam Altman Revives His 2019 Bro Code With Musk Amid New Lawsuit; 'Cat Fight' Screams Internet\n\"It is deeply disappointing to see Elon take this action against a company he helped start, especially given his close collaboration with some of you who are still here working towards the mission,\" Kwon added. As per Bloomberg, the company also said it \"categorically disagrees\" with Musk's claim in a memo shared with employees.  \n\nIn a separate memo, CEO Sam Altman called the X boss his hero and added he misses the man who was known for competition via its better technology. On the other hand, Kwon stated that OpenAI is in competition with Microsoft, is independent and its mission is to ensure \"AGI benefits all humanity\".  \nFor the unversed, Musk left OpenAI's board in 2018 and is now suing the company with the claims that OpenAI abandoned its mission to develop AI via a nonprofit lab. According to the lawsuit, he invested over $44 million in OpenAI and is now suing the company for a breach of contract and fiduciary duty, unfair business practices and other grievances. \n\nAlso Read:\u00a0Elon Musk Sue OpenAI And CEO Sam Altman Over Agreement Breach Around AI\nMeanwhile, venture capitalist Vinod Khosla engaged in a spat with Musk on X amid the ongoing headlines. \"With @elonmusk, feels like a bit of sour grapes in suing @OpenAI, not getting in early enough, not staying committed and now a rival effort. Like they say if you can't innovate, litigate and that's what we have here. Elon of old would be building with us to hit the same goal,\" @vkhosla said.  \n\nSupply chain error on wording. @elonmusk got in early and bailed early when it seems the going got tough and keeping the mission required real scale money to be able to have any benefit to society. https://t.co/dhdS6KtNOP   \u2014 Vinod Khosla (@vkhosla) March 2, 2024\n\n\nTo this, Musk replied: \"Vinod doesn't know what he is talking about here.\" Later he replied: \"You jumped in early but didn't stay committed.
