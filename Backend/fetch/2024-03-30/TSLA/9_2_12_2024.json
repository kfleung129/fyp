    "text": "There\u2019s been earthshaking news in the global automotive world. Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer BYD, or Build Your Dream, overtook Tesla to be the world leader in the sale of electric cars in 2023. Back in the 1990s, BYD was just making cell phone batteries. The company created its first EVs in 2010, including buses that are now running in China, Canada and American cities. The company\u2019s cars are ubiquitous in large Chinese cities, but they aren\u2019t sold in the U.S. yet. Tu Le is an automotive consultant and managing director of Sino Auto Insights. He says BYD and other Chinese EV manufacturers are eager to compete on the international market and are watching events unfold in the US. \u201cI think most Chinese EV makers are going to wait at least through the election in November,\u201d Le says, \u201cand then assess who the administration is in 2025 and beyond, and then make a final assessment. But I do anticipate at least two or three, maybe a handful of Chinese EV players announcing they\u2019re entering the market by 2025.\u201d Le says for now, a typical BYD car design may not be exactly what American consumers are looking for. \u201cThe Western consumer might not like some of the features or some of the kitschy colors,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause in China, there\u2019s a lot of lights going on, a lot of neon, just sensory overload sometimes.\u201d But he says BYD is a quick learner, evidenced by the company dominating global all-electric car sales. \u201cIt still depends on how successful their premium brands will be,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I do see BYD taking global share on the mass market side all over the world over the next several years.\u201d  Adeline Sire produced and edited this interview for broadcast with\u00a0Todd Mundt.\u00a0Sire also\u00a0adapted it for the web.
