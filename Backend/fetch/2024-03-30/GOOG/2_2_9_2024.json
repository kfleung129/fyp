On the negative side, the social media website generated lower-than-expected Q4 revenue, while its guidance came in below analysts\u2019 average estimates. On the other hand, PINS announced that it had made a new deal with Alphabet\u2019s (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google that is supposed to meaningfully boost Pinterest\u2019s ad revenue. Pinterest generated Q4 sales of $981.3 million, below analysts\u2019 average estimate of $990.2 million. However, the firm\u2019s earnings per share, excluding certain items, came in at 53 cents, significantly higher than the mean estimate of 48 cents. Also noteworthy is that its top line increased 12% versus the same period a year earlier, while its monthly active users surged 11% year-over-year to 498 million, slightly above analysts\u2019 mean estimate. On the guidance front, the firm expects its Q1 revenue to come in at $690 million to $705 million, or $697.5 million at the midpoint of the range. The latter figure was significantly below analysts\u2019 mean outlook of $703 million. Under Pinterest\u2019s deal with Alphabet, Google\u2019s Ad Manager system will place ads on Pinterest. As a result, PINS will be able to start generating revenue from some of its overseas markets for the first time. Overseas users currently constitute 80% of its user base but just 20% of its sales. The firm reported that the deal has already had some impact on the demand for Pinterest\u2019s ads and may start meaningfully affecting its financial results during the current quarter. Heading into today, the shares had gained 10% in the last month, 31% in the previous three months, and 54% in the last 12 months.
