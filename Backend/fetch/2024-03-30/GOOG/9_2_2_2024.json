    "text": "PUNE PULSE Trusted-Connected-Targeted PUNE PULSE Google's Rs 17,500 crore expenditure on layoffs revealed in Q4 earnings In a significant revelation during its fourth-quarter earnings release, Alphabet, the parent company of Google, disclosed that the tech giant spent \u20b917,500 crore (approximately $2.1 billion) on severance and related expenses during its 2023 layoffs, impacting over 12,000 employees. The expenditure included $700 million spent this month alone on severance charges for additional layoffs affecting more than 1,000 roles. This financial move follows Alphabet\u2019s announcement in January 2023 of plans to cut 12,000 jobs, constituting 6% of its global workforce, marking the largest layoff in Google\u2019s history. Alphabet\u2019s CEO, Sundar Pichai, deemed these layoffs \u201cessential\u201d for the company. Despite the substantial layoffs, Google\u2019s parent company experienced a notable return to double-digit revenue growth in the last quarter of the previous year. This growth was driven by the success of YouTube and the cloud computing unit, marking Alphabet\u2019s third consecutive quarter of increasing revenue. While Google\u2019s ad sales exhibited growth, it lagged behind increases in other areas, such as cloud computing and YouTube subscriptions. Despite the positive results, Alphabet\u2019s shares faced a nearly 7% dip in extended trading. CEO Sundar Pichai has informed employees to anticipate further job cuts in the upcoming months, aiming to \u201csimplify execution.\u201d In a memo, Pichai clarified that the layoffs will focus on streamlining operations by \u201cremoving layers\u201d from various departments, aiming to enhance the company\u2019s efficiency. He emphasized that these role eliminations will not be at the scale of the previous year\u2019s reductions and will not affect every team.    "
