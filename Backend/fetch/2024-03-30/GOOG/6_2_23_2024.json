Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. With that in mind, the ROCE of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) looks great, so lets see what the trend can tell us. For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Alphabet, this is the formula: Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities) 0.28 = US$88b \u00f7 (US$402b - US$82b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023). Therefore, Alphabet has an ROCE of 28%. That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 8.0% earned by companies in a similar industry.
