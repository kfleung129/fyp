Prices dropped at the fastest rate in China since 2009.\u00a0Here are the details: In The Arora Report analysis, paradoxically these bad numbers are likely to instill urgency in President Xi to take measures to run up the stock market.\u00a0 We shared with you yesterday that China has a new regulator for securities. In a surprise move, China has replaced its top stock market regulator.\u00a0The new regulator is Wu Qing, a respected banker.\u00a0In The Arora Report analysis, this surprise move is an attempt by President Xi to move the Chinese stock market higher.

Based on individual risk preference, consider a protection band consisting of cash or Treasury bills or short-term tactical trades as well as short to medium term hedges and short term hedges. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time. You can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges.\u00a0The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive.\u00a0 If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges. It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash.\u00a0 When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks.\u00a0 High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market. Probability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time. Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of seven year duration or less.\u00a0 Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time.
