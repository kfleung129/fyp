    "text": "Alphabet GOOGL stands out among the mega-cap tech stocks in several ways. The company\u2019s high-margin business, and its substantial global reach, are truly remarkable. Playing a role in most individuals\u2019 every day lives, Alphabet\u2019s core search business is integral to how the western world operates. That\u2019s something that few companies can claim. In the world of AI, Alphabet may certainly seem like a laggard. This lack of perspective or perceived growth is one reason why GOOG stock currently trades at a relatively attractive forward price-earnings ratio of around 21-times. But there may be more than meets the eye to this quasi-legacy tech company. Here\u2019s what to make of Alphabet\u2019s recent announcement, and where this stock could be headed from here. AI Offers Spark Fear After pausing a controversial image generation feature, Alphabet\u2019s stock tripped and fell 4.4%, leading to a $70 billion market value drop. Melius Research hinted that AI losses could reduce public confidence in Google\u2019s skills and that competitors may gain from this. Because of the criticism thrown at its \u201cGemini\u201d AI system, Google\u2019s shares dropped below the 50-day moving average. In 2024, analysts predict that GOOGL\u2019s performance won\u2019t exceed\u00a04.4%. Other analysts have put a spotlight on Google\u2019s AI potential and many consider the sell-off to be overkill. Reitzes pointed out how rivals would raise eyebrows on Google\u2019s dependability because of AI-driven features. Demis Hassabis, at the Mobile World Congress, revealed that Google is aware of the errors in its image generation. Alphabet is working hard to fix these early issues, and bring back the feature soon. GOOG Stock is Cheap for a Reason Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, is fighting against some pretty stiff AI competition. This key factor has led Melius Research to deem GOOG stock \u201ccheap for a reason.\u201d Even with Google\u2019s search moat, analysts are looking for disruption and reasons to invest in the stock. In January, Ronald Josey of Citi pointed out how undervalued Alphabet was compared to competitors like Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta Platforms. The market price of Alphabet is below its historical norm, trading at 20.7-times forward earnings. That\u2019s cheap, no matter how you look at it. A company\u2019s price-earnings ratio can help compare a valuation relative to earnings. However, these ratios can be murky, when factoring in one-time adjustments or early-stage growth prospects. While Alphabet\u2019s AI ambitions may not justify valuation expansion to the degree its peers have seen, it\u2019s also clear that the company\u2019s valuation is pricing in less and less growth moving forward. I\u2019m of the view that while Alphabet can certainly be considered one of the \u201cold guard\u201d in the mega-cap tech sector, it\u2019s also a company that has plenty of levers to pull to generate cash flow growth. Thus, for now at least, the AI story could be on hold \u2013 maybe that\u2019s a good thing for long-term investors.
