The YouTube workers, who voted 41-to-0 last April to join the Alphabet Workers Union, are hired via the staffing agency Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. Alphabet\u2019s Google, which owns YouTube, has consistently denied being their boss, even after NLRB officials last year deemed it a \u201cjoint employer\u201d of the workers \u2013 a company with enough control over them to be liable for their treatment and obligated to negotiate with them if they unionize. A Google spokesperson said the company plans to appeal the ruling in federal court. \u201cAs we\u2019ve said before, we have no objection to these Cognizant employees electing to form a union,\u201d the spokesperson said in an emailed statement. \u201cWe simply believe it\u2019s only appropriate for Cognizant, as their employer, to engage in collective bargaining.\u201d The treatment of contract workers has been a constant point of contention for Alphabet, which relies heavily on staffing firms. Contract staff became the majority of the company\u2019s global workforce in 2018, and the Alphabet Workers Union, an affiliate of the Communications Workers of America, has been pushing to organize both those workers and Alphabet\u2019s direct employees since it launched in 2021. \u201cAny future appeals by Alphabet are just an attempt to avoid collectively bargaining with the union and pad the pockets of shareholders and executives,\u201d YouTube Music worker Katie-Marie Marschner said in an emailed statement from the union. In their ruling Wednesday, a trio of Democratic NLRB members ordered Google to \u201ccease and desist\u201d from refusing to recognize and negotiate with the union, and \u201cin any like or related manner interfering with, restraining, or coercing employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed\u201d under federal labor law. The Alphabet union filed a complaint with the NLRB early last year accusing Alphabet and Cognizant of responding to the union campaign by making threats, transferring work abroad and using new return-to-office rules to try to derail organizing. Cognizant has said the allegations have \u201cno merit.\u201d That complaint is still pending. Another group of Alphabet contract staff, who are employed via Accenture Plc to work on content for Google\u2019s support pages, voted to unionize with the Alphabet Workers Union in November; Alphabet is appealing an NLRB regional director\u2019s determination that it is a joint employer of those workers as well.
