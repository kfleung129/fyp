    "text": "Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NASDAQGS over the last few months, increasing to US$154 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$129. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Alphabet's current trading price of US$139 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let\u2019s take a look at Alphabet\u2019s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. See our latest analysis for Alphabet Good news, investors! Alphabet is still a bargain right now. According to our valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $211.45, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. However, given that Alphabet\u2019s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility. Future outlook is an important aspect when you\u2019re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it\u2019s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by 48% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Alphabet. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation. Are you a shareholder? Since GOOGL is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation. Are you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping an eye on GOOGL for a while, now might be the time to enter the stock. Its prosperous future outlook isn\u2019t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it\u2019s not too late to buy GOOGL. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the track record of its management team, in order to make a well-informed investment decision.
