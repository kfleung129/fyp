The facility will be situated on a 33-acre site in Waltham Cross, Hertfordshire, which Google acquired in October 2020. The search engine giant emphasised that the data centre will\u00a0accelerate artificial intelligence (AI) growth and ensure reliable digital services for Google Cloud customers and users in the UK. The heat generated by the centre will also be repurposed to benefit homes and local businesses. Google, already employing 7,000 individuals in the UK, anticipates the data centre to contribute to job growth, especially during the construction phase.
