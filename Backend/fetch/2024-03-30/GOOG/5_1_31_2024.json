Login When the artist formerly known as Google renamed its parent company Alphabet, the plan looked simple. Google\u2019s advertising business would generate billions in profit that would be channelled to Alphabet\u2019s \u201cmoonshot bets\u201d, such as delivering the internet via hot air balloons and generating renewable power through advanced kites. But counterintuitively, AI has not encouraged Alphabet\u2019s flights of fancy. Instead, it has forced the company back to earth, presaging how it might affect the broader economy. Alphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai is overseeing a company that is ditching its flights of fancy to focus on getting AI into its core business.\u00a0David Rowe The news: Alphabet reported its fourth quarter results on Wednesday AEDT, reporting $US86.3 billion in revenue, up 13 per cent, and $US20.6 billion in profit, up 52 per cent. That beat analysts\u2019 revenue forecasts, according to data from the London Stock Exchange Group, but Google\u2019s advertising numbers disappointed Wall Street, sending shares down about 6 per cent at 9.45am. (Microsoft, the other major technology stock to report on Wednesday with a huge bet on AI, beat analysts\u2019 earnings forecasts slightly, leaving its shares roughly flat.) Behind those headline numbers, Alphabet is retooling its business for AI. Hiring is slower, except for the engineers Google needs to improve its AI. The hot air balloon internet and power generating kites are long gone from the \u201cmoonshot bets\u201d, but Alphabet flagged it was trying to get its remaining bets to find external capital. Staff in Google\u2019s sales divisions have been reorganised, with substantial redundancies, including in Australia. The scale is huge: Alphabet plans to spend $US700 million on redundancy payments next quarter alone. But that all leaves more cash for AI long term. What\u2019s driving it: The notion that chatbots would undermine Google\u2019s search \u2013 and therefore advertising \u2013 dominance have so far proved alarmist. But that doesn\u2019t mean the risk isn\u2019t there if Google were to rest on its laurels. And so, at great cost, it is making more AI tools available in more parts of its business. More ads are auto-generated, more audiences are targeted automatically, and content displayed across Google platforms. Google is working to improve its own chatbots too. The cost? Alphabet spent $US11 billion ($16.7 billion) on capital expenses, up from $US7 billion in the same quarter last year, which overwhelmingly went to the data centres and servers it needs to run AI tools. Our take: \u201dWe\u2019re not restructuring because AI is taking away roles, that\u2019s important here,\u201d Google\u2019s chief business officer, Philipp Schindler, said on Wednesday\u2019s earnings call. That may be true in the sense that a machine is not replicating exactly what a Google ad salesperson once did. On net though, it\u2019s clear that machines are doing more work selling ads for Google and people are doing less. That\u2019s unfortunate for the salesperson, but it makes sense for Google, and the other companies that are in the similar position of leading their industries but facing AI disruption. No one wants to go the way of so many newspapers that failed to take the internet seriously 20 years ago. The Breakdown is a regular column that unpacks and explains big stories from the tech world.
