    "text": "Google\u2019s Gemini AI image generation tool previously received plenty of flak and became the subject of memes, particularly on Twitter, for \u2018historical accuracies\u2019 and misrepresenting people. It got so bad that the search engine giant was forced to snatch away the ability to produce images from the AI chatbot. This week, Google CEO Sundar Pichai addressed these missteps of the company\u2019s new AI image generator, Gemini, acknowledging the \u201cunacceptable\u201d errors and affirming Google\u2019s commitment to fixing the problems. In an internal memo published by Semafor, Pichai wrote that \u201cno AI is perfect\u201d but said the company would continue refining Gemini \u201cfor however long it takes.\u201d He remained upbeat about Gemini\u2019s future, saying the team has already seen \u201csubstantial improvement\u201d in many areas. The image generation capabilities of Gemini, formerly known as Bard, have been paused since users noticed it was churning out historically inaccurate pictures, like images of Vikings and Founding Fathers depicted as people of colour. This sparked backlash on social media, with many critics decrying the \u201cwoke\u201d programming. Google SVP Prabhakar Raghavan clarified this was not intentional wokeness on the company\u2019s part but rather a series of tuning errors. He revealed in a blog post published February 23 that, essentially, Gemini was calibrated to allow for diversity in generated images but failed to exclude inappropriate contexts for that diversity. Over time, Raghavan explained, Gemini also became more cautious, sometimes refusing reasonable prompts out of an abundance of sensitivity. This aligns with reports that Gemini declined to generate images of white people in some cases. Gemini\u2019s image generator will return after fixes, Google says, including \u201cstructural changes, updated product guidelines, improved launch processes, robust evals and red-teaming.\u201d  BSEB will declare the Bihar Board 10th exam results 2024 today at 1:30 pm.
