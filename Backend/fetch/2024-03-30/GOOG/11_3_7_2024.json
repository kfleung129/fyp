Chinese e-commerce entity, Temu, has given a substantial lift to the advertising revenues of Meta Platforms Inc META and Google parent company Alphabet Inc GOOGL GOOG through its hefty ad spending. What Happened: PDD Holdings PDD, the parent company of Temu, is said to have spent close to $2 billion on ads at Meta last year, catching the social media giant\u2019s executives by surprise. Temu also ranked among Google\u2019s top five advertisers in terms of spending, reported The Wall Street Journal citing people familiar with the business. Despite a Temu representative contesting the $2 billion figure, they refrained from disclosing the company\u2019s spending levels at Meta. The unexpected surge in advertising from Temu, which was launched in 2022, has taken executives at both tech companies by surprise. The Chinese e-commerce platform\u2019s hefty ad spending has not only escalated digital advertising prices but also aided the recovery of Meta and Google\u2019s ad businesses.

Advertising analyst Brian Wieser cautioned that if Temu decides to cut back on its advertising, it could pose a challenge for tech behemoths like Meta. However, Wieser also noted that given the extensive spending originating from China, a pullback by Temu wouldn\u2019t significantly dent Meta\u2019s overall growth. Temu has responded to Benzinga\u2019s query about the report. The company\u2019s spokesperson stated, \u201cJust like any business, Temu uses different ways to let both current and future customers know about our services and products. As our business grows and more people start using it, we\u2019re finding that recommendations from friends and others are becoming even more important.\u201d They have denied disclosing the actual advertising spend but have confirmed that the $2 billion number is incorrect. Why It Matters: Temu\u2019s aggressive ad spending strategy comes as the company is making strides in the e-commerce industry. In February, Temu made headlines with its \u2018Shop Like A Billionaire\u2019 Super Bowl commercial, which drew both positive and negative attention. Temu\u2019s rivalry with fast-fashion competitor Shein has also intensified, as it woos sellers previously affiliated with Shein. The company\u2019s strategic focus on the U.S. market has resulted in substantial growth in traffic and sales, with 172 million app users and 43 million web visitors within a year. However, potential challenges loom as U.S. lawmakers contemplate a possible import ban on Temu over alleged connections to forced labor in China\u2019s Xinjiang region. This has sparked concerns among investors and market analysts.
