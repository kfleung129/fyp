    "text": " GOOG stock investors don't need to bail after the initial Gemini fail Advertisement Source: rvlsoft / Shutterstock.com What can you do when a \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d company briefly falls out of favor? In the case of Google and YouTube parent company,\u00a0Alphabet\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), the right response may be to buy and/or hold some GOOG stock shares. After all, a misstep doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s the end of the road for Google and Alphabet. As we\u2019ll see, Google has received a lot of press coverage lately, but it\u2019s not positive. Some investors will view this as a problem, but others will see an opportunity. Currently, we\u2019re assigning a \u201cB\u201d grade to Alphabet stock, and we don\u2019t see an immediate need for investors to panic-sell their shares. Interestingly, GOOG stock ended January at almost exactly $155 before the sellers took over. Evidently, some stock traders didn\u2019t like Alphabet\u2019s financial results, though they really weren\u2019t too objectionable. Indeed, it\u2019s not such a bad result that Alphabet\u2019s diluted EPS increased 27% from 2022 to 2023. Still, Alphabet\u2019s results might not have been spectacular enough for some spoiled short-term stock traders. Also, Alphabet (or, more precisely, Google) recently got hit with some backlash over the company\u2019s Gemini artificial intelligence chatbot. To be honest, Google\u2019s Bard AI chatbot was a flop. Yet, Google didn\u2019t just give up. The company rebranded Bard as Gemini, a more powerful generative AI chatbot for 2024. However, it appears that Gemini is initially encountering issues. We won\u2019t delve into the controversial details, but let\u2019s just say that Gemini has been accused of showing bias. Google\u00a0CEO Sundar Pichai acknowledged the backlash, stating, \u201cI know that some of its responses have offended our users and shown bias \u2014 to be clear, that\u2019s completely unacceptable, and we got it wrong.\u201d So, Alphabet and Google fumbled with Gemini just as it did with Bard. Clearly, Alphabet isn\u2019t the gen-AI chatbot king right now. That\u2019s why GOOG stock, even if it\u2019s part of the \u201cMagnificent Seven,\u201d earns a \u201cB\u201d grade instead of an \u201cA.\u201d On the other hand, it\u2019s possible that the market has already priced its consternation into Alphabet\u00a0shares. Alphabet\u2019s GAAP trailing 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is 23.64x, which is pretty reasonable for a \u201cMag-7\u201d member. Just maybe, the market overreacted to Alphabet\u2019s aforementioned financial report and to the Gemini misstep. Remember, the company still has a wide moat in the search engine market. Plenty of people use Google Search regularly and don\u2019t care about the latest Gemini controversy. According to Bloomberg, Alphabet and Google control over 90% of the search engine market. That\u2019s not just a competitive moat; that\u2019s an ocean between Alphabet and its rivals. Since we\u2019re assigning GOOG stock a \u201cB\u201d grade now, we\u2019re not recommending that you overload your portfolio with Alphabet\u00a0shares. However, if you view the share-price discount as overdone, you might choose to take advantage of the buying opportunity. In time, Alphabet\u00a0and Google might finally perfect their gen-AI chatbot technology. In the meantime, Google\u2019s search engine moat remains undisputed. So, if you\u2019ve been waiting for a discount with Alphabet stock, today\u2019s a good day to consider buying a few shares.
