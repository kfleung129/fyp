    "text": "The Federal Trade Commission said Thursday it will look closely at the generative-artificial-intelligence investments and partnerships of Alphabet Inc. \n        GOOGL,\n        +0.04%\nGOOG,\n        +0.21%,\n       Amazon.com, Inc. \n        AMZN,\n        +0.31%,\n       Anthropic PBC, Microsoft Corp. \n        MSFT,\n        -0.17%\n       and OpenAI Inc. Microsoft has invested more than $10 billion in OpenAI, while Alphabet has agreed to plow up to $2 billion in Anthropic. \u201cHistory shows that new technologies can create new markets and healthy competition. As companies race to develop and monetize AI, we must guard against tactics that foreclose this opportunity,\u201d FTC Chair Lina  Khan said in a statement. \u201cOur study will shed light on whether investments and partnerships pursued by dominant companies risk distorting innovation and undermining fair competition.\u201d The agency cited section 6(b) of the FTC Act, which allows it to scrutinize corporate partnerships and investments with AI providers and their impact on the competitive landscape. The study allows the FTC to look into the AI companies separately from its law-enforcement arm and to make civil investigative demands, such as ordering companies to file specific reports and answer questions in writing about their businesses.

So why is its deal with OpenAI largely a secret to Wall Street? \u201cBig Tech companies are using their dominance to insert themselves into AI companies and take advantage of AI being the technology of the moment,\u201d Emily Peterson-Cassin of nonprofit social-welfare organization Demand Progress, said in a statement. The agency\u2019s inquiry is the latest by federal regulators into the broad reach of Big Tech and its impact on the trillion-dollar tech economy. The FTC has aggressively pursued action against Amazon and Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. \n        META,\n        -1.68%\n       while the Justice Department has sued Alphabet and is expected to announce a case against Apple Inc. \n        AAPL,\n        -1.06%\n       as early as March. At the same time, the U.S. Senate is holding forums with AI leaders on the responsible growth of the technology and its implications for jobs, hiring practices, and the overall national economy. Late Thursday, Alphabet ended contractual work with Appen, the AI data firm that helped train Google\u2019s chatbot Bard and Google Search results. \u201cUnder Lina Khan, the FTC is taking on the nuances of \u2018partnerships\u2019 vs. \u2018acquisitions,'\u201d says Thomas Smale, chief executive of FE International, tech M&A advisory firm. \u201cMicrosoft\u2019s lawyers argue their deal with OpenAI is a partnership, not an acquisition, highlighting the complexities in current antitrust law applications. \u201cThe FTC\u2019s aggressive stance raises questions: Will this deter broader tech investment in AI startups? Or is this just playing catch up? Either way, investors and deal makers have to factor this risk into their decision-making within this AI boom.\u201d The company says the leaked data set seems to be from 2019 or earlier.
