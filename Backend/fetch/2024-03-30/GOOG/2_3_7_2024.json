    "text": "Alphabet\u2019s GOOGL Waymo is leaving no stone unturned to expand its ride-hailing service \u2014 Waymo One \u2014 across the United States.This is evident from the latest move of testing its self-driving vehicles on the streets of Austin, TX, which was declared as the fourth city for Waymo One last year.Waymo\u2019s electric Jaguar I-PACE vehicles, which are equipped with advanced Waymo Driver technology, will be tested across 43 square miles in Austin, which includes the heart of downtown, Barton Hills, Riverside, East Austin and Hyde Park. The latest move bodes well for Waymo\u2019s growing efforts toward reaching out to more customers on the back of its robust driverless technology and expansion efforts.  Alphabet Inc. price-consensus-chart | Alphabet Inc. Quote Recently, the company entered a multi-year partnership with Uber Technologies UBER to offer an autonomous driving experience to the latter\u2019s customers in Phoenix, AZ. Uber, which offers a ride-sharing service, strives to infuse Waymo\u2019s autonomous driving technology into its operations on the back of this partnership.It is in sync with the company\u2019s deepening focus in Phoenix.GOOGL\u2019s expansion of the operating area of Waymo One in the city, which now includes rides to Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport, remains a plus.Waymo\u2019s effort to expand its operations to downtown Phoenix remains noteworthy. It also rolled out a rider-only service in downtown Phoenix.Apart from Phoenix, Waymo\u2019s expansion to San Francisco, CA, on the back of its Early Rider program called Trusted Tester, is a major positive. Notably, this marked its first expansion outside Phoenix.Recently, Waymo received regulatory approval to expand in the San Francisco Peninsula and Los Angeles.Waymo is also testing its self-driving vehicles on the streets of Bellevue, WA. The above-mentioned endeavors will help Alphabet further penetrate the booming autonomous driving space.Per a Precedence Research report, the global autonomous vehicle market is expected to reach $2.35 trillion by 2032, witnessing a CAGR of 35% between 2023 and 2032.We believe that Alphabet\u2019s growing prospects in this promising market will help it win investors\u2019 confidence in the days ahead.Notably, Alphabet has gained 40% in the past year.Additionally, expanding Waymo\u2019s efforts will continue to strengthen Alphabet\u2019s competitive position. Its peers like Amazon AMZN and Baidu BIDU are also making every effort to capitalize on the growth prospects in the autonomous driving space.Amazon\u2019s buyout of Zoox, a developer of autonomous ride-hailing vehicles, remains a major positive. The company\u2019s launch of its first self-driving robotaxi strengthened its position in the autonomous driving space.Zoox has been testing its autonomous vehicles in San Francisco, Las Vegas and Foster City. It intends to open an engineering office and operations facility, which will act as a base for its autonomous vehicle testing.It also plans to establish a large-scale manufacturing facility for its autonomous vehicles. The facility will be located at Hayward Exchange @ 92, 25810 Clawiter Rd. The facility is being built to expand Zoox\u2019s presence in the East Bay.Meanwhile, Baidu is gaining from the strong momentum of the Apollo Go Robotaxi service across China on the back of its increasing availability in several cities and a growing number of rides.Apollo Go is available in ten cities, namely Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Chongqing, Changsha, Cangzhou, Yangquan, Wuzhen Water Town and Wuhan.Nevertheless, Alphabet\u2019s growing autonomous driving initiatives are likely to help it stay ahead of the curve.Currently, Alphabet carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).
