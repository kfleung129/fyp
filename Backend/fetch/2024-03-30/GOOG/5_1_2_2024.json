(GOOG), which belongs to the Zacks Internet - Services industry. When looking at the last two reports, this company has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 7.99%, on average, in the last two quarters. For the last reported quarter, Alphabet Inc. Came out with earnings of $1.55 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.45 per share, representing a surprise of 6.90%.

The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier. Alphabet Inc. Has an Earnings ESP of +15.16% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. Investors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric. Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate. Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.
