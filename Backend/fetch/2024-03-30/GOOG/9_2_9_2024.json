    "text": "Unlike Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN), Pinterest Inc (NYSE: PINS) and Snap Inc (NYSE: SNAP) did not experience double digit growth of their ad business. Snap reported its fourth quarter sales grew 5% and it issued a weak guidance. On Wednesday, Snap shares tanked 35% as Meta set the bar high with its advertising revenue up 24%, more than double compared to Google and its 11% growth. Not to mention the fact that Amazon reported an impressive 27% YoY expansion of its ad business.\u00a0\u00a0Pinterest shares surged 53% last year and until Thursday\u2019s report, they rose 9.5% since the beginning of 2024. But like Snap, it got punished for the revenue miss with its stock falling about 20% after-hours before recovering. On its now long quest to monetize its platform, Pinterest enlisted the help of Google that is similar to its existing Amazon partnership in an effort to make that business equation finally happen. After announcing the integration with Google, shares rebounded to a decline of about 10%. Although revenue rose 12% to\u00a0$981 million, it\u00a0came below LSEG\u2019s estimate of\u00a0$991 million.\u00a0Net income rose from last year\u2019s comparable quarter when it was $17.49 million, or 3 cents a share\u00a0to $201 million, or 29 cents a share. Unlike revenue, adjusted earnings of 53 cents per share topped LSEG\u2019s consensus estimate of 51 cents. Although the Google integration went live a couple of weeks ago, it was not a significant contributor in the reported quarter, but it is expected to bring improvement in the current quarter and beyond, as it already helped lift third party ad demand. Pinterest reported its costs decreased about 10% YoY to\u00a0$785 million, but this is mainly the result of lowered sales and marketing expenses. Also, Pinterest trimmed its workforce by 5% last year as layoffs plagued the entire industry. Although its monthly active users rose 11% to 498 million and topped analyst estimates of 487 million, global average revenue per user of $2\u00a0came below analyst estimates of $2.05. One cannot but not notice that ad recovery is selective, with Big Tech reaping the rewards of the rebound and leaving scraps for others. Fortunately, the world\u2019s multiyear slump is expected to soon become history.\u00a0Pinterest guided for\u00a0first-quarter revenue in the range between $690 million and $705 million, which equates to YoY growth of 15% to 17%, while the average analyst estimate is at the higher end that range, at about $703 million. At the end of the day, Pinterest needs to lift its revenue and get its users to buy goods they see on its platform. Its Amazon partnership looked promising and the Google integration is another step in the right direction. But, by no means will Pinterest have it easy with intense, not to say scary, competition for ad dollars. DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.
