    "text": "Justin Sullivan  Justin Sullivan Google (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) announced Q4 2023 earnings last week, with investors keen to observe how the generative AI revolution is impacting various parts of the business. Advertising remains the biggest source of revenue and profits for the tech giant, and hence a key focus for investors. While ad revenue growth came in-line with market expectations, investors were underwhelmed by the growth rates, especially considering Meta\u2019s relatively stronger quarter. The stock dived lower after the earnings release, as Google has yet to prove that it can successfully pivot its flagship search ad business and remain highly profitable in the era of generative AI. Although amid all the focus on Google\u2019s advertising business, the market seemed to overlook the very encouraging performance of Google Cloud, where savvy strategies to boost profitability are paying off. We maintain a \u2018buy\u2019 rating on Google stock. In a previous article, we discussed how Google Cloud\u2019s profitability is only getting started, as the use of its own chips allowed for deep integration between its customized TPUs and cloud services, yielding cost benefits that strengthen profitability. The operating margin for Google Cloud jumped from 3.16% in Q3 to 9.40% in Q4 2023, marking a whopping 6-point expansion. Data from company filings, Nexus Data from company filings, Nexus During Google\u2019s Q4 2023 earnings call, the executives repeatedly mentioned that they continue to durably reengineer their cost base to drive long-term cost efficiencies. While they mentioned some top-level initiatives they are taking across the organization to optimize efficiencies, no specific insights into Google Cloud were shared. Although on Google\u2019s website in 2023, the tech giant did reveal details regarding how one of its most recent LLM models, PaLM 2, was built using a new technique called \u201ccompute-optimal scaling\u201d, outlining: \u201cThe basic idea of compute-optimal scaling is to scale the model size and the training dataset size in proportion to each other. This new technique makes PaLM 2 smaller than PaLM, but more efficient with overall better performance, including faster inference, fewer parameters to serve, and a lower serving cost.\u201d Now all these technical terms may be overwhelming, so let\u2019s simplify it with some context to better understand the long-term advantages of Google\u2019s AI innovation approach. To do so, we must first understand what parameters are. AI models learn from data, but they need some guidance. Parameters are like little dials inside the model that the AI adjusts during training. The model learns which parts of the data are important and how to use them to make predictions and serve users\u2019 queries when it is provided with new data, while adjusting the parameters according to what it has learnt. For instance, one example of a parameter used in training LLMs is \"contextual relationship\". The extensive dataset used to train PaLM includes wide-ranging scenarios exhibiting how words are used in different contexts. The computer then tries to find patterns in the data to understand and respond to nuances in language depending on the situation, by using these \"contextual relationship\" parameters to create rules for distinguishing between different contexts. During the training phase, the computer fine-tunes its internal workings by analyzing its errors. It continuously refines its outputs by adjusting crucial parameters, ultimately leading to improved accuracy over time. It is commonly perceived that a larger number of parameters can make models more versatile, and this is true, up to a certain extent. Google\u2019s original PaLM model included 540 billion parameters. PaLM (Google) PaLM (Google) One of the advantages of having more parameters is that it enhances modeling capacity. Adding more parameters in generative AI models allows them to capture and reproduce more complex patterns and structures in the data, allowing for more intricate and realistic outputs. The whole point of generative AI is to create new forms of content/ output. So the more parameters a model has, the more varied types of outputs it will be able to create, extending the applicability of the generative AI model to many more use cases. However, more parameters also comes at the cost of more computing power requirements and longer training times. This means greater operating expenses which undermine profitability for shareholders. Furthermore, an increased number of model parameters can exacerbate the risk of overfitting, particularly in scenarios with constrained training data. Overfitting happens when a model learns the specific details of the training data too well, while performing poorly on new, unseen data. Now Google is of course not constrained by limited data, as it has unmatched access to large sets of training data through the top two search engines in the world (Google and YouTube), as well as various other digital services, therefore reducing the likelihood of overfitting. Nonetheless, it is key to note that focusing solely on model size can be misleading when evaluating performance. Now going back to Google\u2019s approach to building PaLM 2, when they outlined that \u201cthe basic idea of compute-optimal scaling is to scale the model size and the training dataset size in proportion to each other\u201d, it essentially hinders issues like \u2018overfitting\u2019. The number of parameters and the amount of training data available being proportionally balanced allows for improved performance and faster inferencing, enhancing its competitiveness against LLMs from other organizations. From a shareholders\u2019 perspective, the goal is to encourage more and more cloud customers to use its own AI models like PaLM 2 as their foundation model for building their own AI services. This is done through Google Cloud\u2019s Vertex AI platform, where it offers access to both its own models as well as open source models from third-parties. While the company has not disclosed how many cloud customers have chosen to use Google\u2019s models, CEO Sundar Pichai did reveal on the Q4 2023 Google earnings call that: \u201cVertex AI has seen strong adoption with the API request increasing nearly 6x from H1 to H2 last year.\u201d Now another key advantage of \u201ccompute-optimal scaling\u201d that Google highlighted was \u201cfewer parameters to serve, and a lower serving cost\u201d. Indeed, PaLM 2 has been built using fewer parameters than the original PaLM model, although Google has not specified how many parameters exactly. This lowers the amount of computational power required to train the model, and shortens training time. More importantly on a forward-looking basis, it lowers the cost incurred for serving these models to cloud customers. And Google could leverage this cost advantage in two ways. Either it could pass them onto businesses to be more price competitive and attract more customers, or it could absorb the cost savings themselves to expand profit margins for shareholders. Now while Google has not explicitly revealed that its latest Gemini model was also built using the \u201ccompute-optimal scaling\u201d technique, it would be prudent to assume that the company used at least similar strategies to optimize cost efficiency in the interest of long-term profitability. The overarching point is, Google\u2019s AI innovation endeavors inherently incurs cost-efficient approaches that allow for sustainable profit margin expansion. And it is these strategies like \u201ccompute-optimal scaling\u201d that enable Google Cloud to deliver operating margin expansion towards 9.40%. While Google Cloud has been delivering operating profit margin expansion, the company-wide operating margin has not improved over the past few years. Data from company filings, Nexus Data from company filings, Nexus Relative to its two main cloud rivals, Microsoft Azure and Amazon\u2019s AWS, Google Cloud remains the least profitable. In addition, its core business of Search advertising is perceived to be most at risk of disruption from the generative AI revolution, compared to Amazon\u2019s e-commerce business and Microsoft \u2018Productivity and Business Processes\u2019 segment, which includes sales of its Microsoft 365 suite of productivity apps like Word and Excel. In fact, Microsoft\u2019s \u2018Productivity and Business Processes\u2019 unit is already highly profitable with a 53.43% operating margin in Q4 2023, and this even before we see the full impact from the rollout of its AI assistant \u2018Copilot\u2019. On the basis of Levered Free Cash Flow Margin, which measures how much cash a company has left over (after paying all its financial obligations) relative to total sales revenue, Microsoft boasts a 25.78% margin, while Google\u2019s margin stands at 19.08%. This signifies a competitive risk as Microsoft is in a financially stronger position to continue investing heavily in AI infrastructure to support Azure growth. Google has yet to prove to the street that its digital advertising segment can remain a highly profitable business in the era of generative AI. For years, the advertising unit has been an incredible source of profits and cash flow, which Google was able to invest into its cloud unit. The Google Services segment, which mainly encompasses digital advertising revenue, remains comfortably profitable with an operating margin of 35.03% in Q4 2023. Although the top-line growth rate was underwhelming last quarter at 12.49% year-over-year, as the street wanted to see faster revenue growth relative to expense growth to see margins expand in its flagship business unit. Meanwhile, rival Meta Platform\u2019s \u2018Family of Apps\u2019 segment, majority of which derives its revenue from digital advertising, grew at a much faster rate of 24.18% in Q4 2023 year-over-year. It has also been delivering better profit margin expansion for shareholders over the past year, making it more profitable than Alphabet\u2019s \u2018Google Services\u2019 segment. Data from company filings, Nexus Data from company filings, Nexus The market is also perceiving Meta as being able to roll out generative AI-powered features faster and more aggressively than Google. Alphabet has been cautious with its rollout of new services, such as by keeping Search Generative Experience in test-mode, as it wants to avoid cannibalizing its current lucrative Search ads business. There is indeed the risk that new rising competitors may introduce new forms of search experiences at a more rapid pace to try and eat into Google\u2019s dominant market share in Search and other digital services, forcing Google to transform its platform with generative AI capabilities more swiftly, without being ready to monetize it at the level at which it is currently monetizing the traditional Search engine. Though as we covered in a previous article, Google is showing promising signs of being able to monetize conversational-based search in this new era. Additionally, we discussed the advantages of Google\u2019s \u201ccompute-optimal scaling\u201d technique for the cloud segment in particular. Although benefits like greater cost efficiencies also enable Google to offer its own generative AI-powered Search services more cost effectively to widen profit margins over the long-term. In fact, the faster inferencing associated with smaller models (with fewer parameters) also enables the tech giant to innovate and adapt its services with more agility to stay competitive as new consumer trends continue to rise and evolve. On the other hand, rival Meta Platforms had released a blog post back in June 2023 suggesting that: \u201cIn order to deeply understand and model people\u2019s preferences, our recommendation models can have tens of trillions of parameters \u2014 orders of magnitude larger than even the biggest language models used today.\u201d As we discussed earlier, larger models with more parameters does not necessarily translate to more superior performance, and the cost of training such models with trillions of parameters would indeed be enormous. Comparatively, Google is wisely designing its AI solutions for long-term cost efficiencies. Hence, Google\u2019s ability to sustain or even grow profit margins over the long-term should not be underestimated given the company\u2019s pragmatic approach to AI innovation. Now let\u2019s consider Google stock\u2019s valuation. GOOG currently trades at a forward PE (non-GAAP) of 21.77x, which is well below the forward PE ratios of MSFT and AMZN, which trade at 35.42x and 41.37x, respectively. Although we prefer the forward PEG (Price-Earnings-Growth rate) ratio to better assess the valuation of a stock, as it takes into account the expected future growth rate of a company\u2019s earnings over a certain period. It is calculated by dividing the forward PE ratio by the projected EPS growth rate, and a ratio of 1 would imply a fairly valued stock. Although it is worth noting that highly sought-after stocks rarely tend to trade at a PEG of 1. Google currently carries a forward PEG of 1.33, which is lower than Amazon stock\u2019s 1.70, and considerably below Microsoft stock\u2019s 2.41 level. Although as discussed earlier, Microsoft seems to be in a financially stronger position than Google to invest heavily in cloud computing infrastructure to capitalize on the AI opportunity, not just because Azure is more profitable than Google Cloud, but also because its flagship \u2018Productivity and Business Processes\u2019 segment is also highly profitable relative to Google\u2019s advertising business. Therefore, while Google may seem significantly cheaper than Microsoft stock at first glance, there are good reasons behind why the market is assigning a higher valuation multiple to MSFT relative to GOOG. Nevertheless, Google\u2019s own savvy strategies like using the \u201ccompute-optimal scaling\u201d approach for AI model building certainly enhances the company\u2019s long-term financial strength and profitability prospects. At a forward PEG of 1.33, it is well below its 5-year average of 1.50 that investors have been willing to pay for the stock historically. And the stock trades closest to its estimated fair value relative to the other major cloud providers. Therefore, Google stock remains attractively valued, and we maintain a \u2018buy\u2019 rating on the stock.
