The feature tracks your browsing history when you click on links in the Facebook app and is enabled by default. What Happened: The Facebook app's \u2018Link History' feature records the websites a user visits from the app within 30 days. It\u2019s available on Android and iOS devices and is turned on by default, but users can disable it. While this could spark privacy concerns, Facebook has clarified that the link history does not capture sites visited during Messenger chats. According to Facebook\u2019s support page, turning off the link history feature will erase the user\u2019s link history. However, it may take up to 90 days for the complete deletion from Facebook's servers.
