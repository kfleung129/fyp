    "text": "Google\u2019s Gemini scandal has been linked to rushed product shipping and internal misalignment, days after co-founder Sergey Brin and CEO Sundar Pichai admitted the company made a mistake. What Happened: Insiders at Alphabet Inc.'s GOOG GOOGL Google have confessed that the Gemini responses, which were problematic, managed to bypass testing due to a hurried shipping process, reported The Verge. Interestingly, the Gemini app\u2019s photo generation feature isn\u2019t powered by the Gemini model but by an older text-to-photo model. This was a quick fix to speed up the feature\u2019s launch.

While the former is in charge of building the underlying models, the latter is responsible for integrating them into user-facing products. Pichai has hinted at \u201cstructural changes\u201d in a recent employee memo, which could potentially address this issue. Why It Matters: The Gemini scandal is not the first time Google\u2019s hasty approach to product launch has been scrutinized. Google co-founder Brin publicly admitted to rushing the Gemini image generator without proper testing. This followed an admission by Pichai that the Gemini AI errors were \u201ccompletely unacceptable.\u201d The Gemini AI had been generating historically inaccurate images, leading to widespread criticism. This included misrepresentations of Google's own co-founders, among others. Internal discord and lack of alignment within Google\u2019s teams have been a concern for quite some time now, with former employees criticizing Pichai\u2019s leadership and claiming low employee morale.
