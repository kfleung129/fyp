    "text": "Howard Marks put it nicely when he said that, rather than worrying about share price volatility, 'The possibility of permanent loss is the risk I worry about... and every practical investor I know worries about.' It's only natural to consider a company's balance sheet when you examine how risky it is, since debt is often involved when a business collapses. As with many other companies Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) makes use of debt. But the more important question is: how much risk is that debt creating? Generally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. If things get really bad, the lenders can take control of the business. While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together. Check out our latest analysis for Alphabet The chart below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that Alphabet had US$12.9b in debt in December 2023; about the same as the year before. However, its balance sheet shows it holds US$110.9b in cash, so it actually has US$98.0b net cash. According to the last reported balance sheet, Alphabet had liabilities of US$81.8b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$37.2b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting this, it had US$110.9b in cash and US$48.0b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So it actually has US$39.9b more liquid assets than total liabilities. This surplus suggests that Alphabet has a conservative balance sheet, and could probably eliminate its debt without much difficulty. Succinctly put, Alphabet boasts net cash, so it's fair to say it does not have a heavy debt load! Also good is that Alphabet grew its EBIT at 18% over the last year, further increasing its ability to manage debt. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Alphabet's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting. Finally, while the tax-man may adore accounting profits, lenders only accept cold hard cash. While Alphabet has net cash on its balance sheet, it's still worth taking a look at its ability to convert earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, to help us understand how quickly it is building (or eroding) that cash balance. During the last three years, Alphabet generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 81% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect. That puts it in a very strong position to pay down debt. While we empathize with investors who find debt concerning, you should keep in mind that Alphabet has net cash of US$98.0b, as well as more liquid assets than liabilities. And it impressed us with free cash flow of US$69b, being 81% of its EBIT. So we don't think Alphabet's use of debt is risky.
