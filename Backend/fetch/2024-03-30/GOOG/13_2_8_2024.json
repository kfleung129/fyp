    "text": " Shares bounced back quickly after a post-earnings slide Advertisement Source: rvlsoft / Shutterstock.com Shares in Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG,GOOGL) may have tumbled after last month\u2019s quarterly earnings release, but so far this month, shares in this \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d component have been rapidly bouncing back. Clearly, the market is catching onto the fact that the GOOG stock forecast is anything but dire. Instead, prospects still shine bright for Google. Alphabet has both AI and non-AI catalysts on tap. When these potential catalysts become realized, they positively impact fiscal performance. GOOG\u2019s upside potential may be substantial. Even as the bounce back has already begun, fear not! For those bullish on GOOG, current prices are a worthwhile entry point. Here\u2019s why. As I also discussed in my prior write-up on Alphabet, the market bailed on shares post-earnings for a fairly arbitrary reason. Investors \u201csold on the news\u201d with GOOG, not because the company missed on revenue or earnings, or because of weak guidance. Rather, the sell-off was caused by the market overreacting to Alphabet\u2019s quarterly advertising revenue ($65.5 billion) coming in slightly below expectations ($65.8 billion). Although falling short on ad revenue is hardly cause for celebration, it\u2019s petty to make a fuss about it, when things are by-and-large firing on all cylinders at the company. For instance, Alphabet\u2019s YouTube and Google Cloud units both reported solid levels of top-line growth during the quarter (15.5% and 25.7%, respectively). Google Cloud\u2019s operating income came in at $864 million, a significant swing from the $186 million loss reported in the prior year\u2019s quarters.. While not certain, it\u2019s possible that the market has realized its mistake, and has become appreciative of these positive aspects of the release. It\u2019s also possible that investors are taking to heart CEO Sundar Pichai\u2019s statement regarding what the launch of Alphabet\u2019s Gemini AI model means for the company: \u201cthe best is yet to come.\u201d With the bounce back, the market has become more bullish about the GOOG stock forecast. However, it\u2019s not as if shares have made a full recovery. Trading for around $146.50 per share as of this writing, Alphabet remains slightly below its all-time high ($155.20 per share). GOOG hit this new high right before the aforementioned earnings release. If the latest wave of broad market bullishness carries on, it may not be long before GOOG re-hits its high-water mark. Still, that doesn\u2019t mean shares have limited upside, or that once the stock gets back to prior price levels, it\u2019s all middling returns from here. Again, thanks to the company\u2019s AI and non-AI catalysts. While non-AI catalysts such as continued cost efficiency moves and a scaling back of its \u201cOther Bets,\u201d can provide a further boost to the bottom line, developments more directly related to the generative AI growth trend could boost both profits and GOOG\u2019s valuation. At present, Alphabet is integrating its latest AI technology across all of its business segments, including YouTube. This could help both enhance monetization of its various platforms/services, as well as help to keep the competition at bay. Alphabet shares currently trade for just 21.7 times forward earnings. Compare that to the valuation of \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d stocks receiving a greater level of appreciation for their AI-related growth catalysts. Such names trade at higher valuation. In some cases, considerably higher valuations. Although relative value is more an art than a science, and hardly a foolproof strategy for investing success, relative value isn\u2019t the sole reason GOOG is a buying opportunity. The opportunity is because the above factors could both lead to stronger-than-expected results in the coming quarters, and finally put to rest the notion that Alphabet\u2019s AI strategy is \u201ctoo little, too late.\u201d As noted last time, that\u2019s why the GOOG stock forecasts call for shares possibly hitting $200 per share before year\u2019s end. Hence, if you\u2019ve considered entering a position, it\u2019s not too late. GOOG stock earns a B rating in Portfolio Grader.
