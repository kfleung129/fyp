    "text": " Google's layoffs don't have to be a deal-breaker for GOOG stock investors Advertisement Source: achinthamb / Shutterstock.com If you\u2019re going to invest in a particular market sector, it\u2019s not a bad idea to focus on the leaders and ignore the laggards. Alphabet\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) doesn\u2019t have to have the number-one position in every tech field to be a winner. GOOG stock is still a \u201cmonopoly stock\u201d and deserves a \u201cB\u201d grade because it holds a dominant position among U.S. search-engine providers. This isn\u2019t to suggest that Alphabet and Google are problem-free. As we\u2019ll see in a moment, Google isn\u2019t immune to challenges and the company\u2019s layoffs might worry some investors. There are reasons to consider owning at least a few shares of Alphabet stock this year. One area of concern is that Google plans to implement layoffs in 2024. Don\u2019t be too alarmed, however, as Google expects that the layoffs this year will be on a smaller scale than the company\u2019s workforce reductions from 2023. Besides, Google\u2019s job cuts aren\u2019t just being done randomly. There\u2019s a plan in place here, as CEO Sundar Pichai assured that Google is cutting costs to invest in \u201cour big priorities this year,\u201d such as artificial intelligence (AI). Another concern is that Alphabet\u00a0isn\u2019t the top contender in the AI arms race. This is a primary reason why we\u2019re not assigning Alphabet stock a full \u201cA\u201d grade right now. By investing early and aggressively in ChatGPT developer OpenAI, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) took an early lead over Alphabet in the generative AI field. To quote Argus analyst Joseph Bonner, \u201cAlphabet remains at minimum competitive if not a leader in the development of generative AI.\u201d That\u2019s a fair assessment, so stay tuned for further developments as Alphabet\u00a0attempts to play catch-up in the gen-AI field. So, if Alphabet\u00a0isn\u2019t number-one in gen-AI, can we still call GOOG stock a \u201cmonopoly stock\u201d? The answer is yes, as Alphabet doesn\u2019t have to lead every technology niche market. Alphabet\u2019s Google is still, by a wide margin, the top U.S. search-engine provider. Microsoft\u2019s Bing is a very distant runner-up. In fact, Bloomberg recently reported that Google \u201chas more than 90% of the [search engine] market.\u201d Not only that, but Bing \u201cended 2023 with just 3.4% of the global search market.\u201d Enhancing Bing with ChatGPT gen-AI functionalities didn\u2019t seem to move the needle very far. There hasn\u2019t been an \u201ciPhone moment\u201d for Microsoft in the search-engine category. Therefore, until there\u2019s data to prove otherwise, it looks like Google\u2019s monopoly position is quite secure. Even in 2024, Alphabet\u00a0is still licking its wounds from the company\u2019s\u00a0notoriously bad rollout\u00a0of its Bard gen-AI chatbot. Going forward, it remains to be seen whether Alphabet can gain traction against Microsoft in developing gen-AI technology. Still, Google remains the undisputed heavyweight champion among U.S. search-engine providers. Furthermore, Alphabet\u2019s layoffs are notable but shouldn\u2019t be a deal-breaker for investors. Consequently, GOOG stock earns a \u201cB\u201d grade and should be appropriate for a moderately sized position in a broad variety of portfolios.
