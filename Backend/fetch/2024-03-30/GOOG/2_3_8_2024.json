Jennings Follow DataDrivenInvestor -- Share Alphabet (GOOG), the company popularly known as Google, is one of the Magnificent Seven stocks. The Magnificent Seven is a new group of super stocks that has replaced the old FANG (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and Google) index. The Magnificent Seven are Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), NIVIDA (NVDA), Tesla Motors (TESLA), and Meta Platforms (META). Essentially, the Magnificent Seven are the six largest publicly traded US companies by market capitalization and Tesla. Microsoft had the largest US market cap ($3.018 trillion on 8 March 2024). Apple was second with $2.636 trillion, NVIDIA was third with $2.188 trillion, Amazon was fourth with $1.821 trillion, Alphabet was fifth with $1.688 trillion, and Meta Platforms (Facebook) was sixth with $1.289 trillion. However, Tesla had the 11th largest US market cap with $558.42 billion on 8 March 2024. I guess, they put Tesla on the list to get Elon Musk\u2019s star power. Hence, I calculate the Magnificent Seven had a combined market cap of $11.94 trillion on 8 March 2024. I think the Magnificent Seven should comprise Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, NVIDIA, Meta, and Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B). -- -- DataDrivenInvestor Daniel G.
