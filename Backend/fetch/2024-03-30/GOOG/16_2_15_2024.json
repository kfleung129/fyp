NVIDIA is on fire! No, not literally. But it\u2019s definitely turning up the heat in stock markets. After surpassing Amazon\u2019s value recently, now the world\u2019s biggest AI chip maker has overtaken Google\u2019s parent company Alphabet. It\u2019s become the third most valuable company in the United States and the fourth most valuable in the world. NVIDIA\u2019s shares went up 2.5% on Wednesday, making the company worth about $1.83 trillion, more than Alphabet\u2019s $1.82 trillion, reported Bloomberg. Microsoft, Apple, and Saudi Aramco are ahead in the first, second, and third positions, respectively. Alphabet has assumed fifth place after NVIDIA\u2019s surge. Microsoft has a valuation of $3 trillion, followed by Apple at $2.8 trillion, and then Saudi Aramco at $2 trillion. NVIDIA\u2019s rise has been unstoppable this year, with their stock climbing about 49%, adding a whopping $602 billion in value, with a commanding grip on approximately 80% of the high-end AI chip market. This surge is mainly because everyone wants their AI chips, which power data centers for complicated tasks needed in AI applications. Compared to NVIDIA\u2019s skyrocketing success, other big tech companies seem slow. NVIDIA is set to report its earnings on February 21, and analysts are expecting another strong performance. Wall Street sees continued high demand for NVIDIA\u2019s H100 accelerators, especially from big customers like Microsoft and Meta Platforms. Based in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA has become a beacon of innovation and progress, riding the wave in pursuit of integrating AI into diverse products and services. The ascendancy of NVIDIA is not an isolated incident but rather a culmination of its role in meeting the demand for AI-centric solutions. However, Nvidia\u2019s remarkable trajectory is not without its challenges. The surging demand for its top-of-the-line chips has led to shortages, exacerbating the need for customers and AI developers. The Biden administration, in the country\u2019s AI arms war with China, has introduced strict sanctions on the US chipmakers from exporting them to the Dragon nation. In August 2022, China\u2019s AI startups faced a setback when NVIDIA\u2019s chip exports were banned. Nvidia later introduced chips with reduced performance to bypass the restrictions, offering a brief reprieve. However, this relief was short-lived. The Biden administration last year announced new measures to limit Beijing\u2019s military ambitions, including further restrictions on NVIDIA\u2019s AI chip shipments to China. The new rules will affect Nvidia\u2019s A800 and H800 chips, specifically designed for shipment to China. While the chip bans were aimed at China\u2019s military usage, the impact is felt strongly by the country\u2019s startups relying on advancements in AI technology. Many rushed to stockpile NVIDIA\u2019s A100 and H100 chips before the bans took effect, spending millions of dollars due to inflated costs. The optimism surrounding AI extends beyond NVIDIA and spreads through the entire technology sector. Companies like Microsoft and Meta Platforms have also witnessed remarkable rallies, scaling unprecedented heights riding on the promise of AI-driven innovations, reported Reuters. Jake Dollarhide, the Chief Executive Officer of Longbow Asset Management, cautions against the repercussions of failing to meet the lofty expectations set by the market around NVIDIA, which will be unveiled on Wednesday, reported Reuters. The stakes are undeniably high, with the prospect of a single quarterly report dictating the trajectory of NVIDIA\u2019s fortunes in the near term. "
