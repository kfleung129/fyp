    "text": "Michael M. Santiago Michael M. Santiago The following segment was excerpted from this fund letter. Shares in Alphabet returned 58% last year, essentially double the return of the Index. Business performance was solid. Google Search and YouTube advertising continued to grow last year, with YouTube subscriptions growing nicely and enjoying a bump last fall as the NFL made the platform the exclusive home of NFL Sunday Ticket in the US in a deal signed through 2030. In the first quarter of 2023, Google Cloud achieved profitability for the first time. It stayed in the black over the balance of the year, as revenues grew to an annualized run-rate of over $33 billion. In Other Bets, Waymo's driverless fleet surpassed seven million fully autonomous miles driven while safety issues forced a key competitor out of the market. We expect Alphabet's revenues and earnings per share to be up high-single digits in 2023. Since our initial investment over twelve years ago, Alphabet has only become more of an internet powerhouse. From its origins in Search, the company has expanded into a vast ecosystem of complementary products across YouTube, Gmail, Workspace, Android, Cloud and more. These are preeminent assets that boast some of the largest user-bases globally. Investors have been pondering the potential impact of Large Language Models (\u00e0 la ChatGPT) on Google Search. The direst fears-that Microsoft's Bing, augmented by OpenAI's chatbot, would quickly turn the tables on Google-have already proven dramatically overblown. Search market share has not changed to any significant degree. Google Search remains a trusted source of information and links to source material, while the world has learned to regard the answers of AI chatbots with skepticism. That said, LLMs and other forms of Generative AI have grown in popularity and usage over the course of 2023 because they are already useful for some tasks and becoming useful for more tasks with each passing day. We can see how they could evolve to become a very significant way for people to interact with their personal devices and with the internet. This presents both risk and opportunity for Alphabet. If the company does not evolve to incorporate the latest AI in Search, YouTube, Cloud, Assistant, and their other assets, then they could lose share to rivals that fully embrace this new paradigm. On the other hand, Alphabet has an opportunity to use the latest AI technology to unify and significantly enhance the usefulness of their entire suite of products. Alphabet is not starting from zero here-in fact, far from it. The company has been building world-class capabilities in artificial intelligence for over a decade. It built two of the leading AI research organizations in the world, Google Brain and DeepMind, and in April of 2023 merged them in order to accelerate the development of a new state-of-the- art model. This model, Gemini, saw a limited release at the end of 2023 and should see full availability in 2024. It is too early to say where exactly Gemini will land vis-a-vis ChatGPT, but we laud the company for understanding the importance of the opportunity and marshaling its forces quickly. We consider Alphabet very well-positioned to deliver large incremental value by bringing world-class AI to a world-class set of products. Even as Alphabet makes significant investments in AI, we appreciate that management has committed to growing profits in line with or faster than revenue. Historically profligate, Alphabet has ample headroom to both grow revenue and find efficiencies in its core businesses, and we find the stock's valuation quite reasonable relative to its financial prospects.
