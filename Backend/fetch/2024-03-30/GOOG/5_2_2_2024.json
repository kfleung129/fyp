With retail sales a bright spot, the company\u2019s fourth-quarter ad revenue rose to $65.5 billion from $59.0 billion a year prior. That was short of analysts\u2019 average expectation for $66.02 billion according to LSEG data.\n\u201cAlphabet\u2019s disappointing ad revenue numbers suggest that corporations worldwide are still uncertain about the pace of interest rate cuts from global central banks,\u201d said Thomas Monteiro, an analyst at Investing.com. \nGoogle, inventor of foundational technology for today\u2019s AI boom, is also locked in battle with two industry players that have captured the business world\u2019s attention, ChatGPT\u2019s creator OpenAI and its backer Microsoft.\nWhile Google Cloud\u2019s revenue topped Wall Street targets and growth rebounded with a boost from AI, Microsoft\u2019s Azure grew faster in the same period.\nPowering such AI requires heavy investment in servers, data centers and research. Alphabet\u2019s capital expenditure shot up 45% to $11 billion, the highest in years, and Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat told analysts on a conference call that capital expenditures would be notably larger this year than in 2023.\nTo restrain costs, technology giants have been winding down non-priority projects and cutting jobs. Alphabet expects $700 million in severance-related expenses in the first quarter, Porat said.\nGoogle is bringing a powerful suite of models called Gemini to its ChatGPT rival Bard. It also struck a deal to invest up to $2 billion in high-profile AI startup Anthropic as it courts customers from larger cloud rivals Microsoft and Amazon.
