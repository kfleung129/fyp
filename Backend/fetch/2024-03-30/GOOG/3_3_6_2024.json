Get features like Google co-founder Sergey Brin, in a rare public appearance, said that the company \u201cmessed up on the image generation\u201d feature of Gemini which was pulled after users discovered historical inaccuracies and questionable responses stirring a major controversy for the tech giant. Addressing a group of artificial intelligence enthusiasts in California, Sergey Brin said that he came out of retirement \u201cbecause the trajectory of AI is so exciting.\u201d Reflecting on AI\u2019s impact on search and Google's position, he said on Gemini gaffes, \u201cI think it was mostly due to just not thorough testing. It definitely, for good reasons, upset a lot of people.\u201d Google said last week that it plans to relaunch the image generation feature soon as Sergey Brin asserted that some Chatbot replies were \u201cpersonal\u201d answers and did not represent the company. \u201cSeeing what these models can do year after year is astonishing,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cWe haven\u2019t fully understood why it leans left in many cases\u201d but \u201cthat\u2019s not our intention.\" The company has recently made accuracy improvements by as much as 80% on certain internal tests, he added, marking the first time a a company executive has spoken on the Gemini matter in a live setting. Earlier, Prabhakar Raghavan, said in a blog post, \u201cSo what went wrong? In short, two things. First, our tuning to ensure that Gemini showed a range of people failed to account for cases that should clearly not show a range. And second, over time, the model became way more cautious than we intended and refused to answer certain prompts entirely \u2014 wrongly interpreting some very anodyne prompts as sensitive. These two things led the model to overcompensate in some cases, and be over-conservative in others, leading to images that were embarrassing and wrong.\u201d Sergey Brin also said that Google is far from alone in its struggles to produce accurate results with AI. Citing OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT and Elon Musk\u2019s Grok services as AI tools he said that \u201csay some pretty weird things that are out there that definitely feel far left, for example.\u201d \u201cWe have made them hallucinate less and less over time, but I\u2019d definitely be excited to see a breakthrough that\u2019s near-zero,\u201d he said, continuing, \u201cBut you can\u2019t just like \u2014 count on breakthroughs so I think we\u2019re just going to keep doing the incremental things we do to bring it down, down, down over time.\u201d Follow the latest breaking news and developments from India and around the world with Hindustan Times' newsdesk.
