    "text": "You might be tired of seeing so much coverage of the group of tech stocks known as the Magnificent Seven, but their valuations and expected growth rates highlight Alphabet \u2014 Google\u2019s holding company \u2014 as a compelling play at its current price. It even appears to be a bargain when compared with the entire S&P 500. Tesla\u2019s stock chart sends warning to bears that momentum may have bottomed IBM begins layoffs amid push toward AI No more free lunches: How laid-off tech workers are surviving a tight job market I inherited $70,000 in savings bonds from my late mother. How do I avoid tax problems when cashing them in? Nvidia\u2019s stock could hit $1,200, this bull says. Here\u2019s the key to that rally. Sorted by market capitalization, the Magnificent Seven include Microsoft Corp. MSFT, Apple Inc. AAPL, Nvidia Corp. NVDA, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, Alphabet Inc. GOOGL GOOG, Meta Platforms Inc. META and Tesla Inc. TSLA. Combined, these seven companies (eight stocks with Alphabet\u2019s Class A and Class C shares) make up 28.7% of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY, the largest exchange-traded fund tracking the S&P 500 SPX. The most commonly cited stock valuation is the forward price-to-earnings ratio. This is the current price of a stock divided by the average earnings estimate for the next 12 months among analysts who work for brokerage firms. FactSet tracks forward P/E ratios historically, based on rolling consensus estimates among analysts polled by the data provider. With the Magnificent Seven sorted by market capitalization, here are current forward P/E ratios along with historical averages, with weighted ratios for the S&P 500 at the bottom: Company Ticker Market cap ($bil) Forward P/E 3-year average forward P/E 5-year average forward P/E 10-year average forward P/E Microsoft Corp.

Class A META 121% 111% 91% Tesla Inc. TSLA 73% 57% 43% S&P 500 SPX 107% 106% 114% Source: FactSet Microsoft, Apple and the S&P 500 trade well above their average 10-year forward P/E valuations. Alphabet is among five companies trading below their 10-year averages. But only Alphabet trades below all the averages while having a current forward P/E below that of the index. Now let\u2019s take a look at expected compound annual growth rates for sales and earnings per share through 2025. The estimates driving the expected growth rates are based on calendar years, because Nvidia, Microsoft and Apple have fiscal years that don\u2019t match the calendar. Company Ticker Expected 2-year sales CAGR through 2025 2-year estimated EPS CAGR through 2025 Microsoft Corp. MSFT 14.8% 14.8% Apple Inc. AAPL 4.1% 6.6% Nvidia Corp. NVDA 52.3% 66.8% Amazon.com Inc. AMZN 11.7% 36.3% Alphabet Inc. Class A GOOGL 11.2% 16.3% Meta Platforms Inc. Class A META 14.6% 24.9% Tesla Inc. TSLA 17.6% -1.4% S&P 500 SPX 5.3% 12.3% Source: FactSet Some notes about this data: Investors shouldn\u2019t be overly fixated on a low P/E, of course. The point with Alphabet is that it is expected to grow sales and earnings at considerably higher paces than the S&P 500, while its shares trade at a lower valuation than that of the index as a whole. Nvidia has a relatively high P/E of 34.1, but that valuation has come down considerably over the past year. Nvidia tops this list of 25 of the best-performing stocks in the S&P 500 whose EPS estimates have risen more quickly than the share prices. Related: Nvidia\u2019s stock could hit $1,200, this bull says. Here\u2019s the key to that rally. Getting back to Alphabet, the stock is down 5% from where it was at the end of 2021. It is useful to look at performance from that date, because the S&P 500 fell 18.2% in 2022, only to rise 26.3% in 2023. (All returns in this article include reinvested dividends.) So the S&P 500 is up only 3.4% since the end of 2021, while Alphabet is down 5% and Nividia\u2019s stock has tripled in price. On Monday, Michael Nathanson, a senior research analyst at MoffettNathanson, wrote in a note to clients that Alphabet\u2019s stock had been \u201dde-rated\u201d relative to the S&P 500, reflecting investors\u2019 concern over artificial intelligence and its possible effect on Google\u2019s search business. He also pointed to a recent misstep, when Google botched the rollout of its Gemini AI tool for generating images. \u201cIronically, Alphabet\u2019s long-term reluctance to ship AI products that were not yet safe, reliable, and responsible did not compute with what just happened here,\u201d Nathanson wrote. The analyst also cited a ceding of advertising market share to Meta and Amazon \u201cfor much of the past decade.\u201d But then he pointed to Meta, another company that had disappointed investors: CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s initial vision of the metaverse didn\u2019t work out very well, and it was followed by a \u201cyear of efficiency\u201d for the company in 2023, which helped reverse its share-price slide. Nathanson rates Alphabet\u2019s Class A shares a buy, with a $175 price target, which is 29% higher than the stock\u2019s closing price of $135.41 on Friday. Summing up, the analyst wrote that \u201cthe basic question is about Alphabet\u2019s ability to harness their deep pool of world-class engineers and their long-term embrace [of] machine learning to build products thatconsumers want to use.\u201d He concluded: \u201cJudging by past accomplishments, despite current headlines, that seems like a bet that investors should be willing to make akin to buying Meta in the 4th quarter of 2022.\u201d Here\u2019s a summary of ratings and price targets for the Magnificent Seven among analysts polled by FactSet: Company Ticker Share buy ratings Share neutral ratings Share sell ratings March 8 price Consensus price target Implied 12-month upside potential Microsoft Corp.
