    "text": "Nvidia\u2019s market value surpassed those of fellow technology titans Amazon and Alphabet on Monday, an almost unbelievable feat accomplished as Nvidia\u2019s stock more than quadrupled over the last 15 months as investors bought into Nvidia\u2019s market-leading position in artificial intelligence. Nvidia stock's 17,000% runup over the last 10 years is far and away the best of any S&P 500 ... [+] constituent. Shares of Nvidia rose nearly 3% to an record high of over $740, bringing its market capitalization to $1.83 trillion, narrowly surpassing Alphabet\u2019s $1.82 trillion and Amazon\u2019s $1.8 trillion. The symbolic passing of the torch caps Nvidia\u2019s remarkable journey as Wall Street flooded into the stock amid the AI boom. Nvidia\u2019s market cap sat below $300 billion as recently as October 2022, just before the AI wave began to crest, lagging far behind Amazon and Alphabet\u2019s above $1 trillion valuations at the time. Nvidia is now the fourth most-valuable public company in the world, trailing only Microsoft ($3.1 trillion), Apple ($2.9 trillion) and Saudi Aramco ($2 trillion). Nvidia is by far the most prominent producer of the semiconductor chip technology powering generative AI. Investors have been impressed not just by the potential for Nvidia to capitalize on the growing interest and corporate spending in AI, but also by its already exploding results. Nvidia\u2019s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) expanded by more than 500% last quarter on a year-over-year basis thanks to runaway growth in its AI unit, far stronger than Amazon and Alphabet\u2019s robust 20% or more earnings growth during the comparable period. Nvidia\u2019s gross revenue and profits are less eye-popping than its trillion-dollar company peers \u2013 its $9.2 billion profit last quarter was far smaller than Apple\u2019s and Microsoft\u2019s over $22 billion profits during the comparable stretch \u2013 but analysts expect Nvidia\u2019s financials to soon close the gap. Nvidia remains among the most popular stocks on Wall Street even after its more than 50% run-up this year, and is a top pick for analysts at both Goldman Sachs and Bank of America, each of which has an $800 price target for Nvidia, implying 8% further upside for the stock. Nvidia stock\u2019s 17,000% gain over the last decade is by far the best return of any stock on the S&P 500, nearly tripling the return of silver medalist and fellow chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices. A $1,000 investment in Nvidia a decade ago would now be worth about $175,000. Nvidia will report earnings next Wednesday for its fiscal quarter ending last month. Analysts project the company to report its third consecutive quarter of record sales and profits.   "
