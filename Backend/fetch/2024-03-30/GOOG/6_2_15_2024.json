    "text": "Anadolu/Anadolu via Getty Images Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) shares slipped 1.5% in premarket trading on Thursday as OpenAI is reportedly working on a web search product that could place it further in competition with the Sundar Pichai-led tech giant. The search service may be partly powered by Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Bing, The Information reported, citing a person with knowledge of OpenAI's plans. Microsoft invested multiple billions of dollars into the Sam Altman-led company last year and has been integrating its technology into a number of its products and services, including its Bing search engine. Microsoft, OpenAI and Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Seeking Alpha. At this point, it is not clear if the search product would be separate from OpenAI's ChatGPT, which took the world by storm in late 2022 and helped usher in the current generative artificial intelligence craze in the tech industry. Google generated roughly $150B in revenue from search ads and has maintained a roughly 90% share of the search market, though ChatGPT has started to eat into some of that, according to a November analysis by Bank of America. Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said last year that every percentage point of share Bing won was worth roughly $2B in advertising revenue. "
