    "text": "Earlier this week, Sundar Pichai said that Google has \u201cambitious goals and will be investing in [its] big priorities\u201d in 2024. This includes AI and spans Google\u2019s consumer to enterprise platforms. In that company-wide memo (via The Verge), the CEO laid out seven goals for Google in 2024: Artificial intelligence is unsurprisingly at the top of this list. Gemini Ultra should be nearing launch, while work on future versions of Gemini was something the company already teased as being underway when launching 1.0 in December.\u00a0Particularly important this year is adding generative AI features that people actually want. For example, Duet AI \u2013 to me \u2013 is a more straightforward application than SGE. On the consumer side, there\u2019s building the \u201cmost helpful personal computing platforms and devices.\u201d That\u2019s undoubtedly a reference to Android and Chrome, while devices being mentioned in the same breath feels noteworthy, especially when coupled with the hardware reorg. Meanwhile, Google should be introducing a new platform with Android XR this year. Building products and platforms that are \u201ctrusted\u201d can be evaluated from a number of criteria, including the perennial \u201cwill this product be killed.\u201d Google Cloud is the only brand name to get an explicit mention as the company continues to compete with Amazon and Microsoft in enterprise.\u00a0Speaking of Duet AI in Google Workspace, it will be interesting to see whether consumers will want to pay for it in Drive, Docs, Sheets, etc. as a standalone subscription. The more internal-facing goals are about making the company more efficient, but it remains to be seen how effective the stated goals \u2013 \u201csimplify execution and drive velocity in some areas\u201d \u2013 of the layoffs will end up being. A leaner Google with less cruft and bureaucracy that can ship products/features faster would be the best possible outcome. FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links. More.
