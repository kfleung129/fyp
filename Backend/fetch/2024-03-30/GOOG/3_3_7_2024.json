One of the cheapest stocks in our\u00a0Stock Screeners\u00a0is: Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Alphabet is a holding company. Internet media giant Google is a wholly owned subsidiary. Google generates 99% of Alphabet revenue, of which more than 85% is from online ads. Google\u2019s other revenue is from sales of apps and content on Google Play and YouTube, as well as cloud service fees and other licensing revenue. Sales of hardware such as Chromebooks, the Pixel smartphone, and smart home products, which include Nest and Google Home, also contribute to other revenue. Alphabet\u2019s moonshot investments are in its other bets segment, where it bets on technology to enhance health (Verily), provide faster internet access (Google Fiber), enable self-driving cars (Waymo), and more. A quick look at the share price history (below) over the past twelve months shows that the price is up 51.75%. Here\u2019s why the company is undervalued.
