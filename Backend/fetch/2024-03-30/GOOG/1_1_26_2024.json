Microsoft stole the show when it released results on Tuesday, leaving Alphabet lurking in the wings. What does this mean? Investors had already pulled Microsoft\u2019s stock up by 10% this year before the world\u2019s biggest firm announced its results, so they would\u2019ve been hoping for evidence that their faith was well-placed. Well, they got it: Microsoft\u2019s cloud business, Azure, made 30% more revenue last quarter than the same time last year, a little better than the 28% that markets expected. That overshadowed Alphabet: Google\u2019s parent company saw its cloud business pick up by 26%, an improvement from the last quarter\u2019s 22% but more than a whisper shy of Microsoft\u2019s division. Why should I care? For markets: Dread in the clouds. Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon have all shared one gripe \u2013\u00a0and it\u2019s not the world\u2019s mounting skepticism about a future run by machines and screens. The cloud divisions in all three companies had been slowing down, with revenue at Microsoft\u2019s branch increasing by half as much a couple of quarters ago compared to the last quarter of 2021. But these latest results will reassure investors about Microsoft\u2019s prospects, at least, and Amazon\u2019s upcoming announcement will paint a picture for the sector as a whole. For you personally: Tick tock, tech. The Magnificent Seven took over stock markets together last year, but that tight bond seems to be fraying a little. Tesla\u2019s results were the financial equivalent of a failed parallel park, and while Microsoft\u2019s stats look decent, investors seem to have an issue with Alphabet\u2019s slower-than-expected cloud growth. Apple, Meta, and Amazon will chime in on Thursday, but Nvidia \u2013\u00a0last year\u2019s stock market success story \u2013 is a master of suspense: the most important chipmaker in the world won\u2019t clue investors in until later in February. alphabet amazon earnings information technology microsoft tech stocks us ai amazon exxon geopolitics Disclaimer: These articles are provided for information purposes only.
