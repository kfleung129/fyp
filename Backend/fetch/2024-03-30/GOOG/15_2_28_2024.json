Data by YCharts Despite strong financial growth and expectations, the company trades just 25.05 times earnings, which is lowest as compared to its peers, as shown in the chart below. Amazon (AMZN), Meta Platforms (META), Microsoft (MSFT) and NVIDIA (NVDA) have P/E ratios of 60.34, 32.49, 37.10 and 66.07. Some of these companies are growing faster than Alphabet, but the reasonable valuation of Alphabet positions it for strong growth potential. Data by YCharts The yearly chart for Alphabet also shows strong growth potential in terms of technical trends. It is observed that the stock price is consistently trading higher without having strong corrections. The only correction in Alphabet was observed in 2022 which was started after reaching a record high of $152.10. The primary reason for this correction was the strong price surge in 2021 which was initiated due to the significant growth in advertising revenue. This growth was driven by the recovery of the global economy after Covid-19 pandemic and higher consumer activity. Moreover, Google Cloud also showed strong performance with the advancements in AI innovations which fuelled the growth of Alphabet. Google Yearly Chart (stockcharts.com) Google Yearly Chart (stockcharts.com) This price correction was supported at $85.57 and recovered 100% to break the record high levels in 2024. The strong candle for 2021 followed by the red candle in 2022 and then the strong recovery in 2023 highlights the strong price volatility between $85 and $152. However, the long-term trend remains positive and price is looking for higher levels in 2024. The red candle for year 2022 appears to stabilize the strong growth of 2021, which is a positive sign and indicates that any break above $152 could initiate a strong price move to much higher levels. To further understand the price correction of 2022 and strong recovery of 2023, the quarterly chart below shows the important historical levels which are important for investors. The price peak was observed in Q1 2022 at the price level of $152.10 and the correction was quick with the same acceleration as the 2021 move. The consecutive negative quarterly candles for 2022 marked a bottom at $83.45 in Q4 2022 followed by strong recovery in Q1 2023. The price bottom of Q4 2022 was held at the 50% Fibonacci retracement, which is stretched from the 2015 low of $24.31 to the record high of $152.10. After confirming this bottom, the stock price continuously rallied in the subsequent quarters of 2023. This strong recovery indicates that the price action for Alphabet is strong, as the price was unable to break 61.8% Fibonacci retracement and instead came back to the same level seen in 2021 highs. It is interesting to observe that the stock price attempted to breach the record highs of 2021 at $152.10 in Q1 2024 after having consistently positive quarterly candles. However, the stock price has not yet closed the quarter above this level, which indicates that the breakout has not yet been confirmed. This level has become the key level for the next strong market surge. A quarterly close above this key level will initiate the next move to higher levels, and the breakout is highly likely due to the emergence of bullish price action. Google Quarterly Chart (stockcharts.com) Google Quarterly Chart (stockcharts.com) This key level was identified as the target of falling wedge as discussed in the previous article. The achievement of price target may initiate a slight correction, but due to the parabolic move, which was discussed previously, the continuation of upward momentum is likely. Therefore, investors can consider buying the stock even if the price is currently expensive. Based on the financial growth and technical price action, the stock price is likely to grow significantly from these levels, ignoring the major corrections. Alphabet depends on Google services for revenue generation, which highlights potential vulnerabilities to the technological advancements. Since a big portion of revenue for Google is generated from advertising sector, this exposes the company to sector-specific risks such as changes in advertising spending, regulatory changes and strong competition from technology companies. Moreover, strategic workforce reduction can incur short term financial burdens and also introduce risks to sustain the growth momentum. The rapid advancements in AI innovation also introduce risks tied to rapid pace of technological change. Due to rapid technological change, there is need to continuously invest in new technologies to remain competitive in the market, which may divert focus from the core areas. On the other hand, the expansion of supply chain in India also introduces geopolitical tension, which may impact operational efficiency. The controversy surrounding Gemini highlights the challenging situation for the brand. This situation may have a negative impact on Google as the reputable source of information. However, the company\u2019s financial standing and growth potential indicate long-term growth. Any short-term drop in the stock price may be a strong buy for the long term. From a technical perspective, the stock price has not broken the key level of $152.10 which indicates the possibility of correction. Since the period from 2021 to 2023 shows strong volatility, the correction may be deeper than expected. A break below $103.34 will negate the bullish outlook and initiate further decline. In conclusion, Alphabet has shown strong financial and operational performance in Q4 and full year of 2023 which is evidenced by the strong performance in its key segments. The company\u2019s strategic expansion in India, workforce optimization and significant development in AI lay the foundation for further growth in the competitive market. On the other hand, technical analysis further shows long-term growth in yearly and quarterly charts. The strong fluctuations between $85 and $152 observed during 2021 and 2023 in the yearly charts highlight the strong volatility. However, the stock price is expected to break this fluctuation in Q1 2024 at the key level of $152. This breakout may further open the investment opportunities for investors to benefit from the long-term growth. On the other hand, the consecutive strong quarterly candle in the quarterly chart highlights the probability of this breakout. Therefore, investors can consider accumulating long positions at the current levels to benefit from the upcoming swing in the market.
