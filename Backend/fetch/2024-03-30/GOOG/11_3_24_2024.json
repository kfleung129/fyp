    "text": " The \u2018Magnificent Seven\u2019 stocks have dominated headlines lately, as this exclusive group of mega-cap companies is in a league of its own and has had especially strong performances lately. While Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has certainly been the most exciting Magnificent Seven stock we\u2019ve seen so far in 2024, and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) And Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) While I\u2019m in a two-way race for the title of largest market cap in the US stock market, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to be the top performer in the Magnificent Seven over the next five to ten years Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) Table of Contents Alphabet is best known for its Google subsidiary, and for good reason.  In addition to its Google Search business, which is dominant in its industry, Google also has Gmail, Maps, Chrome, YouTube and the Android mobile operating system, to name a few.  These are collectively known as the Google Services business.  I used four different Google products while writing this article.  This is a huge company that\u2026 tons of reliable revenues with high margins. The other main part of the company is Google Cloud, a cloud infrastructure provider it competes with Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) Web services and Microsoft\u2019s Azure.  It currently has the third market share but is growing rapidly. Alphabet makes most of its money from ad sales, especially on the Google Services side of the business, and there could be more growth potential here than it seems.  Thanks to evolving AI technology, Alphabet is getting better at targeting ads more effectively, making them inherently more valuable.  And while there\u2019s certainly limited growth potential in the search business, that\u2019s not the case for some of Alphabet\u2019s other ad-driven platforms, like YouTube. Google Cloud is definitely the more interesting part of the business from a growth perspective.  It makes up less than 11% of the company\u2019s total revenue today, but is also Alphabet\u2019s fastest growing part, with revenue growth of 26% year-on-year by 2023. In fact, in 2018, Google Cloud was just over 4% of the total turnover of the company. The story continues This could just be the starting point.  The cloud computing market is currently estimated at $676 billion, but is expected to grow to around that size quadruple to $2.3 trillion by 2032. If Google Cloud can simply maintain its market share, this could be a major growth driver, but recent data indicates that Google Cloud is gaining on the market leaders. It\u2019s also worth noting that Alphabet has approximately $111 billion in cash and short-term investments on its balance sheet, which, combined with the more than $80 billion in annualized net revenues it generated in the most recent quarter, it gives enormous financial flexibility to take advantage of new opportunities.  they arise. With a valuation of approximately 22 times future earnings, I wouldn\u2019t exactly call Alphabet a \u2018top performer\u2019 cheap stock, although it is easily the cheapest of the Magnificent Seven by this measure.  However, it seems attractively valued for a market-leading and highly profitable company growing its revenue at double-digit rates.  Alphabet is a rare combination of a dominant core business and a fast-growing secondary business with enormous long-term growth potential.  And while it\u2019s not the largest stock in the Magnificent Seven today, I wouldn\u2019t be at all shocked if that changed in the coming years. Should you invest \u20ac1,000 in Alphabet now?
