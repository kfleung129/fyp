FAQ - New Privacy Policy Piper Sandler managing director and SR economist Jake Oubina sits down with 'Mornings with Maria' to discuss the shift from focusing on inflation to unemployment and the risk of recession on the horizon. Google parent Alphabet Inc. is reportedly slashing jobs within its innovation lab called X as it adopts a new structure. In recent months, X \u2013 described as a diverse group of inventors and entrepreneurs that develops technologies to solve the world's hardest problems \u2013 has increased talks regarding funding with venture capitalists and other investors, so they can launch projects even faster, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg. X was established in 2010 by Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin with the goal of working on \"far-out, sci-fi sounding technologies that could one day make the world a radically better place.\" Since then, the division has \"incubated hundreds of different moonshot projects,\" with many going on to become independent businesses.
