    "text": "  Written by Rebecca Uffindell Wed 24 Jan 2024 CEO of Google and Alphabet, Sundar Pichai, has warned staff more job cuts will come in addition to recent layoffs. In a staff memo, Pichai stated certain roles may be affected as company divisions undergo ongoing changes. \u201cWe have ambitious goals and will be investing in our big priorities \u2026 The reality is that to create the capacity for this investment, we have to make tough choices,\u201d said Pichai in a memo seen by The Verge. Pichai added these role eliminations are not at the scale of last year\u2019s reductions and will not touch every team. As of September 30 last year, the company had a workforce of 182,000, as reported in its latest quarterly results. Pichai said the layoffs were about \u2018removing layers to simplify execution and drive velocity in some areas\u2019. \u201cMany of these changes are already announced, though to be upfront, some teams will continue to make specific resource allocation decisions throughout the year where needed, and some roles may be impacted,\u201d added Pichai. Earlier this month, Google cut 1,000 jobs across its hardware, voice-assistance, and engineering teams to invest in the company\u2019s biggest priorities and future opportunities. On 12 January, the Alphabet Workers Union labelled the Google layoffs as both \u2018unnecessary\u2019 and \u2018counterproductive\u2019. The Alphabet Workers Union said they will not stop fighting until their jobs are safe. Last year, Google said it would lay off 12,000 employees, around 6% of its workforce. Google attributed the layoffs to overexpansion as tech companies experienced heightened levels of demand during the COVID-19 pandemic. Pichai said Google \u2018hired for a different economic reality\u2019 than the one experienced by the company. Several major technology companies are also facing layoffs. Earlier this month, Amazon said it will lay off hundreds of its employees from its Prime Video and studio units with plans to cut 500 employees from its live-streaming platform, Twitch. This move followed Amazon\u2019s earlier rounds of layoffs. In March, the company announced 9,000 job cuts on top of the 18,000 employees laid off in January 2023. In March, Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, cut more than 20,000 jobs. In 2022, Twitter employees prepared themselves for substantial layoffs. Around 2,000 staff, or 25% of the workforce, were expected to be dismissed as part of an extensive overhaul. Sign up for your weekly tech briefings!
