    "text": "(Bloomberg) -- Alphabet Inc. reported fourth-quarter revenue from its core search advertising business that fell short of analysts\u2019 estimates, overshadowing an otherwise strong end to the year.

That was better than the $71 billion analysts had projected, and the best quarter for revenue growth in seven. Net income was $1.64 per share, compared with Wall Street\u2019s estimate of $1.59 per share. But revenue in Alphabet\u2019s core search business was $48 billion, narrowly missing analysts\u2019 projections for $48.15 billion. The shares fell 6.5% in extended trading. The disappointing results come at a time of broader uncertainty for Google\u2019s search engine, which has dominated the global internet for years and is the subject of a major antitrust case. Its leading position is threatened by new competition as the rise of generative AI has enabled companies like Microsoft Corp. and OpenAI to deliver programs that answer users\u2019 questions in a more conversational fashion, like the wildly popular chatbot ChatGPT. \u201cGoogle advertising does make up the vast majority of its revenue and as it prepares to really go full throttle on all of its carefully laid plans in AI, having that cash cow experience volatility doesn\u2019t bode well,\u201d said Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf, an analyst at Insider Intelligence. Wall Street had high expectations for Alphabet\u2019s efforts in AI, pushing the stock up almost 60% over the past 12 months, valuing the company at nearly $2 trillion. But now investors are looking for a sense of when the technology will actually start moving the needle for earnings and revenue. \u201cGoogle has kind of reached a new phase in its maturity where really strong explosive growth every quarter is just not feasible any more,\u201d Mitchell-Wolf said. \u201cThe stock market just hasn\u2019t quite caught up to that reality yet.\u201d Google has raced to weave the new AI technology into its own products, and last month released its most powerful large language model, called Gemini. But Alphabet has been dogged by concerns that it\u2019s been too slow to capitalize on the shift in the market and has been playing catch up to Microsoft in the AI race. As Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai plows resources into AI and other big priorities, executives have scrutinized operations to identify places where they can make cuts. Earlier this year, the company eliminated hundreds of employees in areas including hardware, engineering, and the moonshot technology lab X. More rounds of layoffs may follow this year, Pichai has said. Google had 182,502 employees as of Dec. 31, a 4% decline from a year earlier. President and Chief Investment Officer Ruth Porat said Google is continuing to invest in \u201ctop engineering and technical talent,\u201d and \u201cwhere possible, in support of our growth opportunities we are reallocating talent across Alphabet.\u201d In the last three months of the year, Google\u2019s closely watched cloud unit brought in an operating profit of $864 million, more than double analysts\u2019 estimates for $427 million. Google still trails Microsoft and Amazon.com Inc. in the market for cloud computing, but this quarter\u2019s results mark Google Cloud\u2019s first full year of profitability, pointing to a relatively healthy business unit. \u201cWe are really pleased with the cloud growth,\u201d Porat said on a call with reporters. \u201cWith respect to profitability, cloud has been focused on efficiency for quite some time and you\u2019re seeing the benefit in the fourth quarter.\u201d Google\u2019s push into AI hasn\u2019t come cheap. Capital expenditures increased by $2.96 billion from the previous quarter, a bump Porat attributed directly to its investment in AI. Cash on hand also dropped by about $9 billion from the previous quarter as the company seeks to allocate resources properly. Porat said capital spending this year will be \u201cnoticeably larger\u201d than in 2023. The company has been vying for years to diversify beyond the product that made it a household name. YouTube, one of its prized businesses, reported $9.2 billion in revenue, compared with analysts\u2019 average estimate of $9.16 billion. The unit has been the most susceptible to marketers\u2019 pullback in spending as the digital ad market floundered in the past year. Alphabet\u2019s Other Bets \u2014 the company\u2019s moonshot unit that includes the self-driving car effort Waymo and the life sciences unit Verily \u2014 brought in $657 million in revenue while losing $863 million in operating income. That was still less than analysts\u2019 projection for a loss of $1.3 billion. \u201cWe are investing with other bets where we see opportunities for high impact returns,\u201d Porat said. The Google Network business, in which the company serves up ads on other parts of the internet, saw its revenue decline by 2% to $8.3 billion. That business, which has been an ongoing weak spot in Alphabet\u2019s results, will be at the center of an antitrust trial later this year. --With assistance from Ed Ludlow.
