    "text": "  Google employees are criticizing the company for its most recent round of layoffs, and are taking to social media to express their frustration, claiming that the \u201cboring management\u201d lacks \u201ca visionary leader.\u201d In a LinkedIn post, software engineer Diane Hirsh Theriault post a lengthy tirade on LinkedIn, blasting the company\u2019s leadership. \u201cFrom the C-suite to the SVPs to the VPs, they are all profoundly boring and glassy-eyed,\u201d she wrote, reacting to news that the company was laying off several hundred people from its ad sales team. Last week, CEO Sundar Pichai told staffers to expect more layoffs this year, though it would not be at the same scale as last year\u2019s. He has confirmed layoffs in its core engineering team and a hardware division \u201cto remove layers to simplify execution and drive velocity in some areas.\u201d the New York Post reported. In a memo shared with its employees on Jan. 18, which was reported by The Verge,\u00a0 \u201cthe company referenced its belt-tightening plans\u201d for this year. Among the company\u2019s goals for this year are \u201cimprove company velocity, efficiency, and productivity, deliver durable cost savings, and deliver the world\u2019s most advanced, safe, and responsible AI.\u201d\u00a0 The memo also mentioned boosting innovation through Google Cloud services and building \u201cthe most helpful personal computing platforms and devices,\u201d The Verge said. As Business Insider noted, employees are also lamenting the lack of a \u201cfamily\u201d environment.\u00a0 Last January, the tech giant said it was to lay off about 12,000 employees \u2014 the equivalent of 6% of its workforce \u2014 in a bid to cut costs and focus on high-priority areas such as artificial intelligence. Many foreigners of Indian origin have had the honor of being CEOs of the world's largest multinational companies. While Indian origin Sundar Pichai has got the honor of heading a giant company like Google, it is not without interest that he is being called the worst CEO in the\u2026 Meanwhile, on Jan. 18, the Alphabet Workers Union planned protests at five Google campuses across the country \u201cpush back against the bogus talking points that Google employs to rationalize decision-making,\u201d Business Insider reported, citing a press release from the union. \u201cThe truth is that these layoffs cause chaos in our workplace, leaving us with increased workloads and widespread anxiety over which team will be the next to disappear overnight\u201d added the statement. Last November, former Google employee Ian \u201cHixie\u201d Hickinson criticized Pichai for displaying a lack of \u201cvisionary leadership\u201d and disinterest in maintaining the ethos of Google that made it a successful company. He also stated that the employee morale at Google is at an all-time low and that therapists in the Bay Area would say that all Googlers are \u201cunhappy\u201d with the company.
