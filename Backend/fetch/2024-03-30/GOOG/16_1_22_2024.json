    "text": "Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future. Shares of this company have returned +3.7% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.6% change. The Zacks Internet - Services industry, to which Alphabet Inc. belongs, has gained 6.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term? Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision. Revisions to Earnings Estimates Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings. Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements. Alphabet Inc. is expected to post earnings of $1.60 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +52.4%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.5%. The consensus earnings estimate of $5.77 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +26.5%. This estimate has changed +0.3% over the last 30 days. For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.66 indicates a change of +15.5% from what Alphabet Inc. is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged. With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Alphabet Inc. The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate: 12 Month EPS Projected Revenue Growth Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial. In the case of Alphabet Inc. the consensus sales estimate of $70.71 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +12%. The $254.87 billion and $284.4 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +9% and +11.6%, respectively. Last Reported Results and Surprise History Alphabet Inc. reported revenues of $64.05 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +11.9%. EPS of $1.55 for the same period compares with $1.06 a year ago. Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $63.13 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.45%. The EPS surprise was +6.9%. Over the last four quarters, Alphabet Inc. surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period. Valuation Without considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects. While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price. As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued. Alphabet Inc. is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.
