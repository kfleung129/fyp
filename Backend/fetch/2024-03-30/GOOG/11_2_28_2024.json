Pichai called the issues \u201cproblematic\u201d and said they \u201chave offended our users and shown bias,\u201d according to the memo viewed by CNBC. The news was first reported by Semafor. Google introduced the image generator earlier this month through Gemini, the company\u2019s main group of AI models. The tool allows users to enter prompts to create an image. Over the past week, users discovered historical inaccuracies that went viral online, and the company pulled the feature last week, saying it would relaunch it in the coming weeks. \u201cI know that some of its responses have offended our users and shown bias \u2014 to be clear, that\u2019s completely unacceptable and we got it wrong,\u201d Pichai said. \u201cNo AI is perfect, especially at this emerging stage of the industry\u2019s development, but we know the bar is high for us.\u201d The news follows Google changing the name of its chatbot from Bard to Gemini earlier this month. Pichai\u2019s memo said the teams have been working around the clock to address the issues and that the company will instate a clear set of actions and structural changes, as well as \u201cimproved launch processes.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve always sought to give users helpful, accurate, and unbiased information in our products,\u201d Pichai wrote in the memo. \u201cThat\u2019s why people trust them. This has to be our approach for all our products, including our emerging AI products.\u201d Read the full text of the memo here: I want to address the recent issues with problematic text and image responses in the Gemini app (formerly Bard). I know that some of its responses have offended our users and shown bias \u2013 to be clear, that's completely unacceptable and we got it wrong. Our teams have been working around the clock to address these issues. We're already seeing a substantial improvement on a wide range of prompts. No AI is perfect, especially at this emerging stage of the industry's development, but we know the bar is high for us and we will keep at it for however long it takes. And we'll review what happened and make sure we fix it at scale. Our mission to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful is sacrosanct. We've always sought to give users helpful, accurate, and unbiased information in our products. That's why people trust them. This has to be our approach for all our products, including our emerging AI products. We'll be driving a clear set of actions, including structural changes, updated product guidelines, improved launch processes, robust evals and red-teaming, and technical recommendations. We are looking across all of this and will make the necessary changes. Even as we learn from what went wrong here, we should also build on the product and technical announcements we've made in AI over the last several weeks. That includes some foundational advances in our underlying models e.g. our 1 million long-context window breakthrough and our open models, both of which have been well received. We know what it takes to create great products that are used and beloved by billions of people and businesses, and with our infrastructure and research expertise we have an incredible springboard for the AI wave. Let's focus on what matters most: building helpful products that are deserving of our users' trust. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.
