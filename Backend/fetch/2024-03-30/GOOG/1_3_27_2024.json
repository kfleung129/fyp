    "text": "Get All the Market Moving News, Squawk, and Mentorship NOW Get All the Market Moving News, Squawk, and Mentorship NOW China has been identified as the leading nation in\u00a0government-backed exploitation of zero-day vulnerabilities, according to a report released by Alphabet Inc.\u2019s GOOG GOOGL Google. What Happened: The Google report, published on Wednesday, revealed that China\u2019s cyber espionage groups\u00a0exploited 12 zero-day vulnerabilities in\u00a02023, a notable increase from the seven in 2022. This trend is indicative of a broader global surge in zero-day exploits. In 2023, 97 vulnerabilities were exploited, a 50% increase from the previous year but still below the record set in 2021. \u201cThe People's Republic of China (PRC) continues to lead the way for government-backed exploitation.\u00a0PRC cyber espionage groups exploited 12 zero-day vulnerabilities in 2023, up from seven in 2022, more than we were able to attribute to any other state and continuing a trend we've observed for multiple years,\u201d the report stated. See Also:\u00a0Mark Zuckerberg Reportedly Woos AI Talent From Google\u2019s DeepMind With Personal Emails: Meta CEO Offers No Interviews, Higher Salaries James Sadowski, principal analyst at Mandiant Intelligence, noted that attackers have shifted their\u00a0focus to third-party components and\u00a0libraries, as exploiting these vulnerabilities can have a widespread impact. The report also highlighted a 64% increase in the\u00a0exploitation of enterprise-specific technologies in\u00a02023, with a general rise in the number of targeted enterprise vendors since 2019. Despite the overall increase in zero-day exploits, the proportion of financially motivated actors decreased in 2023.\u00a0\u201cFinancially motivated actors accounted for\u00a010 zero-day vulnerabilities exploited in\u00a02023, a lower proportion of\u00a0the total than what we\u00a0observed in 2022,\u201d the report stated.

However, the report highlighted threat group FIN11, saying it \u201cexploited three zero-day vulnerabilities,\u201d while at least four ransomware groups separately milked another four vulnerabilities. Why It Matters: The report\u2019s findings align with the recent global concerns over China\u2019s cyber activities. Last month,\u00a0Federal Bureau of Investigation or FBI director Christopher Wray warned\u00a0that China\u2019s covert placement of offensive malware in U.S. critical infrastructure networks posed a significant national security threat. This was followed by a crackdown on a widespread Chinese cyber espionage effort, known as\u00a0Volt Typhoon, by the U.S. in January. Earlier this week,\u00a0Australia and New Zealand\u00a0united to accuse China of orchestrating cyberattacks on democratic institutions. On Tuesday, New Zealand\u2019s foreign minister, Winston Peters, denounced the \u201cmalicious cyber activity\u201d directed at the country\u2019s parliament in 2021, linking these attacks to entities allegedly supported by the Chinese government. Australia has also denounced China\u2019s purported cyber assaults aimed at U.K. democratic entities and lawmakers. The nation\u2019s foreign affairs minister voiced apprehension regarding the ongoing targeting of democratic institutions and procedures.
