Google stock is down 3% over the past five trading days, and down 2% YTD after a +52% past year.

His price target is $165 a share. Anmuth suggests \u201cGoogle is down, but not out.\u201d The Google Thesis: Google stock\u2019s recent underperformance, amplified by investor frustration surrounding Gemini issues, is seen by Anmuth as a manifestation of uncertainties in a Gen AI world. Challenges include: Anmuth acknowledges the scrutiny over Google\u2019s leadership and culture, but remains optimistic about Google\u2019s ability to navigate these challenges. He believes that Google will not only recover Gemini, but also close the Gen AI gap with competitors such as Microsoft Inc MSFT and OpenAI. The recent hiccups in Gemini, specifically in text and image responses, have put the spotlight on Google\u2019s execution, leadership, and culture. Despite this, Pichai assures major improvements in Gemini, with necessary changes in product guidelines, launch processes, testing, and technology. Also Read: Perplexity AI Vs. ChatGPT Vs.

Revenue-wise, Google Search has shown consistent acceleration, with concerns arising about Google\u2019s share of search and total advertising dollars. Meta and Amazon.com Inc AMZN advertising growth outpacing Google suggests a potential shift in the online ad market dynamics. Google\u2019s ongoing re-engineering of the cost structure enters its second year, focusing on further margin expansion without anticipating a significant headcount reduction. The company aims to grow revenue faster than expenses, emphasizing rationalization and reprioritization rather than large-scale layoffs. Looking ahead, JPMorgan anticipates Google\u2019s commitment to capital returns. There are expectations of a share buyback announcement, following a decade of substantial stock repurchases. Notably, Anmuth suggests that Google could initiate a dividend. This would align with recent moves by Meta Platforms, Booking Holdings Inc BKNG, and others. While the prospect of a dividend is viewed as a potential catalyst to attract a broader investor base, Anmuth underscores that its impact would be more significant if accompanied by overall improvements in Google\u2019s business performance. As the industry waits for Google Cloud Next on April 9-11, the focus is on how Google will address these challenges and showcase its resilience in the evolving tech landscape.
