The cuts come as Google looks towards \u201cresponsibly investing in our company\u2019s biggest priorities and the significant opportunities ahead\u201d, the company said in a statement. \u201cSome teams are continuing to make these kinds of organizational changes, which include some role eliminations globally,\u201d it said. Google at first said said it was eliminating a few hundred roles across engineering, hardware and the Assistant teams, though most of the impact hit the company\u2019s augmented reality hardware division. The next day, the Alphabet Workers Union pegged the figure at 1,000 workers. The layoffs follow pledges by executives of Google and its parent company, Alphabet, to reduce costs. A year ago, Google said it would lay off 12,000 employees, about 6% of its workforce. The same day news of the cuts broke, Google announced that it would deprecate 17 \u201cunderutilized\u201d features of Google Assistant, including playing audiobooks, sending an email or starting a meditation session with Calm by using a voice command. In a post on X \u2013 previously known as Twitter \u2013 the Alphabet Workers Union described the job cuts as \u201canother round of needless layoffs\u201d. \u201cOur members and teammates work hard every day to build great products for our users, and the company cannot continue to fire our coworkers while making billions every quarter,\u201d the union wrote. \u201cWe won\u2019t stop fighting until our jobs are safe!\u201d Google experienced record growth in the early days of the coronavirus pandemic but has needed to adjust predictions for its business as that expansion has slowed over the past year. It is not the only technology company in that boat. Meta \u2013 the parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp \u2013 has slashed more than 20,000 jobs. Spotify said in December that it was axing 17% of its global workforce, the music streaming service\u2019s third round of layoffs in 2023 as it moved to slash costs and improve its profitability.
