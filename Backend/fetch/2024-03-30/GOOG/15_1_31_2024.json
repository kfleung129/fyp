    "text": "Shares in Alphabet (GOOG:NASDAQ) fell over 5% to $153 in a bout of profit-taking after the US tech giant\u2019s fourth quarter results disappointed the market. The fall is a drop in the ocean\u00a0compared with the 53% gains delivered over the last year. Although the company reported 13% year-on-year growth in consolidated revenues to $86 billion, some of the company\u2019s revenue in other divisions fell short. Google Cloud\u00a0saw revenue increasing to $9.12 billion for the fourth quarter ending 31 December compared to $7.31 billion in the same year ago period. Analysts were expecting fourth-quarter revenue of $8.94 billion for Google Cloud. In relation to YouTube ads, Alphabet reported revenue of $9.2 billion in line with Wall Street estimates. Which \u2018Magnificent Seven\u2019 stock has the most 2024 upside according to analysts? Russ\u00a0Mould, investment director at AJ Bell said: \u2018Last time it was the cloud computing arm causing a downpour on Alphabet\u2019s results, now it is the advertising segment which has made investors switch off. Analysts were optimistic for Alphabet-owned Google and YouTube to scoop up bucket loads of cash from advertising, but the group has fallen short of what was expected. \u2018The backdrop for advertising has been challenging. An uncertain economic backdrop makes corporations\u00a0nervous about spending big on advertising and many companies are taking a more cautious approach. Those that are spending want more information to show they are getting the best bang for their buck. That means better audience profiling and measurement tools. \u2018Alphabet is pinning its hopes on artificial intelligence to help enhance its advertising offering. Naturally, that comes at a cost, and it is spending big on infrastructure underpinning AI.\u2019 CAN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI) SAVE ALPHABET? Alphabet also announced continued investment in AI, but analysts have questioned whether this will pay off. Ben Barringer, technology analyst at Quilter Cheviot said:\u00a0\u2018Interesting the business has seen an acceleration in its cloud computing unit too as business look to adopt artificial intelligence capabilities and go through less cost-cutting now the economic picture is beginning to improve. This has pushed Alphabet to reallocate resources and spend more on the cloud. Despite the buoyant advertising market, Alphabet is behind other competitors when it comes to cloud computing and AI. As such, it must spend to keep up. \u2018That said, Alphabet remains an AI winner, but there are big risks around its search function and the disruption it is likely to see from those who can better implement AI tools.\u2019 DISCLAIMER: Financial services company AJ Bell referenced in this article owns Shares magazine.
