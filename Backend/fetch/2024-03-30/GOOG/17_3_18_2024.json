View more search results Alphabet, all-sessions, rise on a Bloomberg report that Apple is in talks to build Google\u2019s Gemini AI engine into the iPhone. IGTV's Angeline Ong explains why Microsoft, all-sessions, is also moving higher ahead of the cash open. (AI Video Summary) Shares of Alphabet, the parent company of Google, saw a rise in value after news broke that Apple is considering using Google's Gemini AI engine in their iPhones. According to a report by Bloomberg News, this potential collaboration had a clear impact on Alphabet's stock prices. While the daily chart might not easily show this reaction, a closer look at the minute chart gives a clearer understanding of the market's response. Interestingly, Microsoft's shares also experienced a reaction on the minute chart, possibly due to the same Bloomberg report. The report mentioned that Apple is in talks with OpenAI, a company supported by Microsoft, and is exploring the possibility of incorporating its technology. This news led to fluctuations in Microsoft's stock prices on the IG platform, particularly around 4 a.m. London time. It's important to note that there have been no official statements from Apple, Microsoft, or Alphabet about these potential collaborations. However, it is expected that any announcements about new agreements will be made during Apple's Global Developers Conference, which is taking place in the summer.
