Alphabet CEO, Sundar Pichai, said the business was \u201cpleased with the ongoing strength in Search and the growing contribution from YouTube and Cloud. Each of these is already benefiting from our AI investments and innovation. As we enter the Gemini era, the best is yet to come\u201d. Ruth Porat, president and chief investment officer, added: \u201cWe ended 2023 with very strong fourth quarter\nfinancial results, with Q4 consolidated revenues of $86 billion, up 13% year over year. We remain committed to our work to durably re-engineer our cost base as we invest to support our growth opportunities.\u201d In APAC, Q4 saw a reported increase in revenue of 17% YoY to A$21.47 billion (US$13.97 billion). Overall, 2023 was reported at a 10% increase YoY making for a regional revenue of A$79.14 billion (US$51.51 billion).
