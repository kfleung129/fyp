    "text": "By Jill Goldsmith Co-Business Editor Google parent Alphabet on Tuesday reported decent numbers for the fourth quarter of 2023, including a 15.5% hike in YouTube advertising to $9.2 billion (from $7.8 billion), solid but disappointing the market a bit with shares down 4%. Most numbers met but didn\u2019t exceed forecasts at a time of very high expectations for tech stocks. Google Search & other advertising saw revenue of $48 billion, from $42.6 billion. Google Network saw ad revenue of $8.3 billion versus $8.5 billion. So total Google advertising including YouTube of $65.5 billion was up from $59 billion. Google services sales rose to $76 billion from $68 billion. Cloud Services was strong, with revenue of $9.2 billion, up from $7.3 billion. Alphabet consolidated revenue was up 18% at $86 billion. EPS of $1.64 was up from $1.05.
