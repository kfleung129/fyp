But when it comes to\u00a0Alphabet\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), today\u2019s bet on a more resilient \u201cLucky 7\u201d looks like a winning investment strategy off and on the price chart for GOOGL stock investors. Let me explain. Wall Street wisdom says that one day doesn\u2019t make a trend. The thoughtful words are intended to keep investors from hastily jumping on board a seductive-looking move, which ultimately favors turning into the equivalent of a one-hit wonder on the music charts \u2026 never to be heard from again. And on the heels of Friday\u2019s price action, the warning might seem more than a bit appropriate. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips For its part, the S&P 500 was up 3.35%. Microsoft (NYSE:MSFT), the world\u2019s largest publicly traded company tacked on 4.65%. And GOOGL stock rallied an even stronger 5.13%. The determined-looking wagers occurred within a market correction, which recently turned into a full-fledged, confirmed bear market. Prompting the bid, a favorable trifecta of hopeful U.S.-China trade war negotiations, dovish Fed talk and better-than-expected jobs report found investors quickly and aggressively placing bets on green. 10 Oversold Stocks Due for a Bounce So have investors forgotten about the recently confirmed bear market, those pearls of wisdom from Wall Street and opted to throw caution to the wind? This strategist doesn\u2019t see it that way. Well, at least in Alphabet shares. My view is the price action now looks like an opportune time to bet on a more secure and less-chancy, Lucky 7 situation on the GOOGL stock chart. Back in October and early into Alphabet\u2019s correction, I was cautious and even bearish on shares. A forecast calling for a challenge of $973 \u2013 $1000 in the company\u2019s Class C GOOG stock proved prescient with this month\u2019s low of $970.11 slightly piercing the support zone. I also guardedly warned of an even steeper correction. Multiple tests of this technical area suggested another challenge could prove to be the straw that would break the proverbial camel\u2019s back. But that hasn\u2019t proved the case for GOOG or GOOGL stock. And in fact, I\u2019m bullish after last week\u2019s promising price action. As Alphabet\u2019s weekly view shows, GOOGL\u2019s 24% correction has established a bullishly supportive stochastics set-up as shares made a seventh test of lateral price support and the 38% retracement level. Now and following Friday\u2019s close, confirmation of a two-week candlestick reversal pattern has turned Alphabet\u2019s technical challenge into a bullish-looking \u2018Lucky 7\u2019 proposition, rather than resembling a losing game of craps. For investors agreeable with what\u2019s been presented, GOOGL stock is currently in position to be purchased. Shares of Alphabet are only 1.3% above an idealized entry price of $1064.23 and the prior week\u2019s candlestick high. 7 Best Fidelity Funds for 2019 My recommendation is this type of entry in GOOGL should be accompanied by an initial stop-loss just below the pattern low. That amounts to exposure of less than 10% in Alphabet stock. This keeps potential losses contained and manageable just in case an odds-on favorite Lucky 7 wager takes an unexpected turn into a game of craps \u2026 that\u2019s not worth playing.
