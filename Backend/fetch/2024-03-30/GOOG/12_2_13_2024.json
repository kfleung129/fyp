This is done to buy them back later at a lower price. The difference between the selling price and the eventual buying price represents the profit for the investor.\nTraditional short selling\nIn traditional shorting, an investor borrows shares of a stock from their broker and sells them on the open market. If the price of the stock declines as anticipated, the investor can buy back the shares at the lower price and return them to the broker, pocketing the difference as profit.\nWhat are financial derivates?\nOn the flip side, investors can use derivatives such as options, swap contracts, or futures contracts to short a stock. These financial instruments allow investors to profit from the decline in a stock\u2019s price without actually owning the underlying shares.\nHow to short Alphabet stock: Step-by-step\nTo start shorting stocks like Alphabet, you can follow our step-by-step guide in the following segment.\nStep 1: Choose the right broker\nTo short Alphabet stock, you\u2019ll first need to register an account with a brokerage platform that offers short-selling services.
