    "text": "InvestorsObserver gives Alphabet Inc Class C (GOOG) a strong  valuation score of 80 from its analysis. The proprietary scoring system considers the underlying health of a company by analyzing its stock price, earnings, and growth rate. GOOG currently holds a better value than 80% of stocks based on these metrics. Long term investors focused on buying-and-holding should find the valuation ranking system most relevant when making investment decisions.\n\n\n\n\n\n GOOG gets a 80 Valuation Rank today.  Find out what this means to you and get the rest of the rankings on GOOG!\nSee Full GOOG Report\n\n\nMetrics Analysis\n\nGOOG has a trailing twelve month Price to Earnings  (PE) ratio of 23.72 which places it above the histroical average of roughly 15. GOOG is currently trading at a poor value due to investors paying more than what the stock is worth in relation to its earnings. GOOG's trailing-12-month earnings per share (EPS) of 5.81 does not justify its share price in the market. Trailing PE ratios do not factor in the company's projected growth rate, thus, some firms will have high PE ratios caused by high growth recruiting more investors even if the underlying company has produced low earnings so far.\n\n\n\n\nGOOG's 12-month-forward PE to Growth  (PEG) ratio of 1.29 is considered a poor value as the market is overvaluing GOOG in relation to the company's projected earnings growth due. GOOG's PEG comes from its forward price to earnings ratio being divided by its growth rate. A PEG ratio of 1 represents a perfect correlation between earnings growth and share price. Due to their incorporation of more fundamentals of a company's overall health and focusing on the future rather than the past, PEG ratios are one of the most used valuation metrics by analysts today.\n\nSummary\n\nGOOG's valuation metrics are weak at its current price due to a overvalued PEG ratio despite strong growth. GOOG's PE and PEG are worse than the market average resulting in a below average valuation score.\n\n Click Here to get the full Report on Alphabet Inc Class C (GOOG) stock.
