Table of Contents Born on June 10, 1972, in Madurai, Tamil Nadu, India, Pichai\u2019s academic journey took him from the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur to Stanford University and the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. Beginning his career as a materials engineer, he transitioned to Google in 2004, playing a pivotal role in the development of groundbreaking software products.  Assuming the role of Google\u2019s CEO in August 2015, Pichai later ascended to the helm of Alphabet Inc. in December 2019. This strategic transition was part of a broader restructuring initiative that positioned Alphabet as Google\u2019s parent company. It allowed co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin to step back from day-to-day operations amidst mounting antitrust investigations. Over the period from 2015 to 2023, Sundar Pichai garnered a substantial $1.3 billion in total compensation and potential earnings before taxes.

Notably, he secured an additional grant of $240 million in stock options over three years in December 2019, aligning with a base salary increase to $2 million.
