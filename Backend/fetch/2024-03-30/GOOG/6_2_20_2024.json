    "text": "Vithun Khamsong/Moment via Getty Images Search engine volume will drop 25% by 2026, with search marketing losing market share to AI chatbots and other virtual agents, according to Gartner. Chatbots like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) backed OpenAI's ChatGPT are changing the way users access information on the internet. Observers fear GenAI solutions could render traditional search engines obsolete. ChatGPT has started to eat into some of Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), if ever so slightly, according to a November analysis by Bank of America. OpenAI is also reportedly working on a web search product that could place it further in competition with the Sundar Pichai-led tech giant. This could spell trouble for Alphabet's (GOOG) (GOOG) Google Search, which still accounts for over 55% of the company's total revenue. \"Generative AI (GenAI) solutions are becoming substitute answer engines, replacing user queries that previously may have been executed in traditional search engines,\" said Alan Antin, Vice President Analyst at Gartner. However, Alphabet (GOOG) (GOOGL) continues to be dominant, with Google holding a 91.5% market share as of January 2024, followed by the GPT-powered Microsoft (MSFT) Bing with a 3.4% market share, according to data by Statcounter. Google recently unveiled Gemini 1.5, its next-generation AI model with \"dramatically\" enhanced performance, a longer context window, and better understanding, among other things. "
