Alphabet Inc.'s GOOG GOOGL Google reportedly pays publishers five-figure sums to test an unreleased artificial intelligence platform. What Happened: Google has reportedly initiated a private program for a select group of independent publishers, offering them beta access to an unreleased generative artificial intelligence platform, reported Adweek. In exchange, these news organizations are expected to provide analytics and feedback. As part of the agreement, publishers are required to use AI tools to produce a certain amount of content for a year. In return, they receive a monthly stipend that amounts to a five-figure sum annually and the means to produce content relevant to their readership at no cost.

The program is part of the Google News Initiative, launched in 2018 to provide publishers with technology and training. The year-long program began in February, with participating publishers required to produce and publish three articles per day, one weekly newsletter, and one monthly marketing campaign. Update: A Google spokesperson has issued the following statement to Benzinga. \u201cThe experimental tool is being responsibly designed to help small, local publishers produce high quality journalism using factual content from public data sources \u2013 like a local government's public information office or health authority. Publishers remain in full editorial control of what is ultimately published on their site. These tools are not intended to, and cannot, replace the essential role journalists have in reporting, creating, and fact-checking their articles.\" Why It Matters: Google\u2019s latest move comes in the wake of the company\u2019s ongoing efforts to enhance its AI capabilities. In October, Google announced \u201cAssistant with Bard,\u201d a generative AI-powered personal assistant for Android and iOS devices. However, Google\u2019s AI initiatives have not been without controversy. The company faced criticism over its Gemini AI chatbot, which generated historically inaccurate images and text. Google CEO Sundar Pichai acknowledged these errors as \"completely unacceptable.\" Despite these challenges, Google\u2019s investment in AI technology and its commitment to improving its capabilities underscore the company\u2019s belief in the potential of AI to revolutionize content creation and dissemination.
