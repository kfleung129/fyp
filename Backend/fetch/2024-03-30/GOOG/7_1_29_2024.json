Premium advertising opportunities for brands Team access to our exclusive tech news Journalists who break and shape the news, in your inbox Catch up on conversations with global leaders in tech, media and finance Explore our recent partner collaborations Alphabet, the parent company of Google, is cutting back its commitment to ambitious moonshot projects. Company executives have told staffers at the X unit, which converts promising investment projects into full-fledged subsidiaries, known as Other Bets, that no such conversions will happen this year, said a person familiar with the situation. At the same time, executives have told staffers that projects within X that might have turned into full subsidiaries should seek outside capital and depart from the Alphabet corporate umbrella, the person said. The most advanced projects at X include Chorus, which is developing new sensor technology to solve supply chain issues, and Tapestry, which uses computational tools to predict electric grid usage. "
