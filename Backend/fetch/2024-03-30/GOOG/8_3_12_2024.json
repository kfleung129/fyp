    "text": "MDoculus Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google will restrict queries on election from its AI chatbot Gemini, TechCrunch reported. If anyone would want to ask the AI chatbot a question about an upcoming election, they would have to do it from a country where no elections are occurring, the report added. The company has started rolling out the restrictions on Gemini to limit providing answers about election-related queries worldwide. The update is already live in the U.S. and the company has started rolling it out in India and all major countries where elections are going to occur in the coming months, the report noted. The move shows the role generative AI could play in the election process, and Google's concern that how the service may impact the process and potentially produce inaccurate or misleading responses. Queries regarding political parties, candidates, politicians now provide a fixed message, which reads, \"I'm still learning how to answer this question. In the meantime, try Google Search.\" Google said in a blog post related to the move in India, \"out of an abundance of caution on such an important topic, we have begun to roll out restrictions on the types of election-related queries for which Gemini will return responses.\" Last month, Google paused image generation of people from Gemini, following criticism about how it was handling race. Even Google's Co-Founder Sergey Brin said the company \"definitely messed up\" on Gemini image generation due to a lack of thorough testing. "
