It resolved a patent lawsuit on Wednesday involving AI technology, with the claim amounting to an extraordinary $1.67 billion. Singular Computing, established by Massachusetts computer scientist Joseph Bates, initiated the lawsuit. The company accused Google of misusing its\u00a0computer-processing solutions. Google has also partnered with Hugging Face, a startup\u00a0specializing in AI software, to host its platform on Google\u2019s cloud computing network. This collaboration will allow\u00a0Hugging Face\u00a0to offer its platform through Google Cloud, significantly expanding developers\u2019 access to the startup\u2019s AI tools. The Hugging Face partnership will likely accelerate innovation by enabling more developers to create AI applications using Hugging Face\u2019s resources and Google Cloud\u2019s computing capabilities and specialized hardware, Bloomberg\u00a0reports. This agreement bolsters Google\u2019s relationship with the open-source AI community, a sector increasingly competitive with significant tech companies in developing cost-effective AI models.
