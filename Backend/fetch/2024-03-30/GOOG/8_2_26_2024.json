    "text": "Google parent Alphabet lost some $90 billion in market value Monday as controversy over the Silicon Valley giant\u2019s generative artificial intelligence product made its way to Wall Street. Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai has grappled with significant headaches from his company's generative AI ... [+] chatbot. Shares of Alphabet fell 4.5% to $138.75 Monday, closing at its lowest price since Jan. 5 and registering its second-steepest daily loss of the last year. The selloff followed a spate of controversy surrounding Google\u2019s Gemini AI service, with issues including Gemini\u2019s image-generating service producing racially inaccurate depictions of historical figures and its chatbot refusing to determine the more negatively impactful historical figure between Adolf Hitler and Elon Musk, culminating in the company\u2019s admission it \u201cmissed the mark\u201d with Gemini\u2019s early rollout and taking its AI image service offline for the next few weeks. \u201cThis is a meaningful blunder in the PR battle surrounding [generative AI] and further suggests that Google is trailing and mis-executing in a fast-moving and high-stakes space,\u201d Loop Capital analyst Rob Sanderson wrote in a note to clients Sunday. Alphabet\u2019s losses came as major stock indexes were flat in a rather uneventful day of trading, and Alphabet was the biggest percentage faller among S&P 500 constituents with a market capitalization over $50 billion. \u201cThe issue for the stock is not the debate [over Gemini] itself, it is the perception of truth behind the brand,\u201d Melius Research analysts Ben Reitzes and Nick Monroe wrote in a Monday note to clients. \u201cRegardless of your view, if Google is seen as an unreliable source for AI to a portion of the population, that isn\u2019t good for business,\u201d the analysts continued. Alphabet propulsion into the \u201ccrosshairs\u201d of the culture war debate could challenge its stranglehold in the online search market, the Melius group hypothesized, considering AI\u2019s burgeoning role in online search and the possibility of \u201ca meaningful portion of users grow[ing] concerned about Google\u2019s hallucinations and bias.\u201d Gemini\u2019s apparent bias is the latest flub by Alphabet during the AI arms race, in which rival Microsoft appears to be in pole position. Alphabet famously lost more than $100 billion in market capitalization on the day of the announcement of its AI chatbot service last February after the press release included factual errors made by the service. Alphabet stock is down 1% year-to-date, trailing the S&P\u2019s 7% gain and tech-heavy Nasdaq\u2019s 8% rally, as well as the double-digit gains of rivals like Microsoft and Meta.   "
