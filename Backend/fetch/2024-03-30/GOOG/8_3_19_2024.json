    "text": "Many investors aspire to build a 7-figure portfolio. Reaching this milestone offers significant financial protection. A $1 million portfolio that yields 4% provides $40,000 in cash flow each year. Growth stocks are the way. You don\u2019t have to invest in dividend stocks to reach a 7-figure portfolio. In fact, many growth stocks offer more potential and can offer dividends in the future. Investors can benefit from prioritizing stocks with strong financial growth, compelling runways, and reasonable valuations. These are some of the stocks that can take you from six figures to seven figures.

The corporation has a resilient advertising business that has successfully rebounded after a sluggish 2022. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips The tech giant\u2019s ad revenue led the company to 13% year-over-year revenue growth in\u00a0Q4 2023. Alphabet has been profitable for a while, but the firm expanded its net profit margins significantly thanks to cost-cutting measures. Net income increased by 52% year-over-year. Advertising isn\u2019t the only growth driver. The Google Cloud platform is growing at a faster rate and has become quite profitable. Alphabet has the capital and resources to capitalize on new business opportunities as they arrive. The company\u2019s controversies with Gemini will fade out of the news cycle. When that happens, more investors will recognize Alphabet stock\u2019s long-term potential. Shares are up by 41% over the past year and have gained 136% over the past five years. It\u2019s one of those growth stocks to consider. Source: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com Amazon\u00a0(NASDAQ:AMZN) is another stock that has served long-term investors well. Shares are up by 74% over the past year and have gained 16% year-to-date. The tech conglomerate has expanded its profit margins and now has a\u00a042-forward P/E ratio. The firm knows how to create its own services and make acquisitions to fill in gaps. Amazon acquired Whole Foods to jumpstart its entry into the grocery store business and created Amazon Web Services to get a head start on cloud computing. The latter has been a major growth engine that has powered the stock\u2019s gains over the past decade. There\u2019s a reason why it\u2019s one of those growth stocks to consider. As companies grow, it becomes more difficult for them to gain market share and reward investors. Amazon defied this trend with a strong showing in the\u00a0fourth quarter of 2023. Net sales increased by 14% year-over-year to reach $170.0 billion. Amazon Web Services revenue increased by 13% year-over-year. Domestic and international sales both grew, with international sales growing at a higher rate. Source: shutterstock.com/Lemonsoup14 Celsius Holdings\u2019 (NASDAQ:CELH) historical performance is enough to draw attention. Shares are up by 227% over the past year and have gained almost 6,000% over the past five years. The stock has already turned 6-figure portfolios into 7-figure portfolios. Some investors will be quick to point out that past results do not guarantee future success. Every few years, there is a stock that rises substantially only to collapse within a few years. Celsius Holdings has financial growth and captivating growth opportunities that suggest the stock\u2019s success will continue. The sports beverage company reported 95% year-over-year revenue growth in the\u00a0fourth quarter of 2023, indicating drinks are still flying off the shelves. That growth rate was close to the full-year 102% year-over-year growth rate. Celsius Holdings produces healthier drinks than most of the competition. This distinction has helped the company become a big hit with Gen Z. Domestic growth remains strong, and the company has a small international presence. It\u2019s penetrating in markets outside of North America which presents a long-term buying opportunity, and is one of those growth stocks to buy.

The corporation currently has a $568 billion market cap and plenty of enthusiasm from analysts. The\u00a0average price target\u00a0suggests Visa shares can gain an additional 8.6% from current levels. The highest price target of $326 implies an additional 15.2% gain. High-profit margins that regularly exceed 50%, a 0.73% dividend yield with an excellent annualized growth rate, and robust financial growth have fueled the stock up by 855 over the past five years. Visa will continue to grow thanks to people regularly using credit and debit cards for their purchases. Rewards programs and the opportunity to build credit with on-time payments incentivize consumers to use their cards instead of cash. These catalysts helped the corporation report a 9% year-over-year improvement in net sales in the\u00a0first quarter of fiscal 2024. GAAP net income increased by 17% year-over-year.

The company reported 33% year-over-year revenue growth in its\u00a0latest quarter\u00a0when many cybersecurity firms lowered their guidance and saw their demand slow down. While Crowdstrike\u2019s revenue growth was already impressive, the context of headwinds throughout the industry makes recent growth even better. Most of Crowdstrike\u2019s revenue is recurring which offers a solid foundation. The firm closed out fiscal 2024 with $3.44 billion in annual recurring revenue. That\u2019s a 34% year-over-year increase. Cybersecurity is a necessity for many businesses. This technology keeps hackers away from sensitive information. While hackers sometimes infiltrate databases that use cybersecurity solutions, they significantly reduce the amount of damage that takes place.\u00a0 This makes it one of those growth stocks to buy. Crowdstrike and other firms can pinpoint threats long before they become serious and save companies a lot of money. Avoiding cyber attacks can also preserve a corporation\u2019s reputation among its customers. The Falcon platform can save businesses a lot of money in the long run and offer a considerable amount of digital protection. Source: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com People use social media to stay on top of the news, connect with friends, grow their businesses, and meet new people. These platforms have connected more parts of the world. While it\u2019s possible to choose from many social media companies,\u00a0Meta Platforms\u00a0(NASDAQ:META) is the best choice in the stock market. Meta Platforms is the most recognizable social media firm thanks to Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. The stock is up by 1365 over the past year thanks to a strong rebound in advertising revenue and meaningful profit margin improvements. Net income more than tripled year-over-year in the\u00a0fourth quarter of 2023. Revenue grew by 25% year-over-year which is an acceleration from the firm\u2019s full-year revenue growth of 16% year-over-year. Active users are growing across the corporation\u2019s social networks. Advertisers are back after slowing down their spending in 2022, and the market should heat up thanks to the 2024 Election and the Olympic Games. Meta Platforms has the makings of a long-term winner. Source: C H A L N / Shutterstock.com Synopsys\u00a0(NASDAQ:SNPS) is a semiconductor giant that has been in business for over 35 years. The company\u2019s high-performance silicon chips are in innovative technology like self-driving cars, machine learning devices, and various devices. Semiconductor stocks have been logging big gains thanks to the artificial intelligence boom. It feels like Synopsys has somewhat missed out since it is \u2018only\u2019 up by 47% over the past year. That return is still beating the market, but there are other semiconductor stocks that have doubled over that same stretch. Synopsys has a much better 400% gain over the past five years. Financials came in good in the\u00a0first quarter of fiscal 2024. Revenue was up by 21% year-over-year while GAAP EPS exceeded the high end of guidance. Net income increased by 65% year-over-year. Synopsys is also working on its\u00a0$35 billion acquisition\u00a0of\u00a0Ansys\u00a0(NASDAQ:ANSS) which will help the corporation expand its market share. Ansys reported 16% year-over-year revenue growth and 6.5% year-over-year net income growth in the\u00a0fourth quarter of 2023. That firm is still growing, and it will become a big piece that aids Synopsys\u2019 long-term objectives. On this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in GOOG, CELH, and SNPS.
