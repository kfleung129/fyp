    "text": "AS the era of low interest rates came to a halt over the past two years, hundreds of tech companies slashed jobs. Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, cut 12,000 jobs, or about 6 per cent of its global workforce, at the start of 2023. Meta laid off more than 10,000 employees, or roughly 13 per cent of its staff. So did other household names, including Microsoft, Amazon and Disney. More than 260,000 tech employees were laid off in 2023, according to Layoffs.fyi, a site that tracks job cuts across the tech industry. Google just announced more cuts this month. Some executives were squeamish about using the term \u201claid off,\u201d so many cloaked such discussions in opaque language. \u201cThe term \u2018rightsizing\u2019 sounds more neutral,\u201d said Roger Lee, creator of Layoffs.fyi, adding that the phrase is also used \u201cto convey the fact that these companies did a lot of hiring the past couple years, and now realize, given the current economic reality, it makes sense for the business to go back to a smaller size.\u201d Start and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox. Some layoffs were announced in the strange, isolating environment of remote work settings \u2013 with workers shutting down their laptops, in their living rooms, knowing they might never speak to their teammates again. When Wayfair, the furniture retailer, announced last January that it was laying off 1,750 employees, or 10 per cent of its workforce, the company said it was part of a \u201crightsizing\u201d plan. That same month, when PayPal eliminated 2,000 full-time roles, or 7 per cent of its overall staff, the company also discussed \u201crightsizing our cost structure.\u201d But experts caution that avoiding the phrase \u201cjob cuts\u201d doesn\u2019t soften the blow for employees. \u201cThis language can dehumanize the process,\u201d Lee said, \u201cand perhaps have the unintended effect of making the employee feel that the company doesn\u2019t fully realize the real impact the decision has.\u201d Sandra Sucher, a Harvard University professor of management who has studied layoffs, said using euphemisms during a layoff process could reflect the psychological phenomenon of \u201cmoral disengagement,\u201d in which business leaders rely on squishy language to distance themselves from the ethics of their decisions. But for workers, the term \u201crightsizing\u201d means one thing: They\u2019ve been laid off. NYT BT is now on Telegram! For daily updates on weekdays and specially selected content for the weekend.
