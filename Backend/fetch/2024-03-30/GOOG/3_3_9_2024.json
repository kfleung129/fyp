The disruption happened at New York City's \"Mind the Tech\" conference on Monday. Google Israel managing director Barak Regev was giving a lecture at the time. The employee, whose name was not released by Google, abruptly interrupted Regev's speech to reference the war between Hamas and Israel. The conflict began on Oct. 7, after Hamas terrorists massacred Israeli civilians on the Jewish holiday of Simchat Torah.
