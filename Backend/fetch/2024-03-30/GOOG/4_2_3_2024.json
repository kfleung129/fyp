    "text": "Google parent company Alphabet this week reported a $1.2 billion charge in the fourth quarter to exit office space, a notable cost that largely flew under under the radar in a hectic week, according to a Barclays researcher. I inherited $246,000 from my mother and used $142,000 to pay off our mortgage. If we divorce, can I get it back? When mortgage rates will cross the \u2018key threshold\u2019 that unfreezes the housing market, according to five economists Nvidia\u2019s stock could ride to $800, says Goldman Sachs. Here\u2019s its path. Super Micro board member buys over $1 million in stock after 600% yearly surge Palantir\u2019s stock surges nearly 20% as company rides AI wave to upbeat earnings, outlook The search-engine giant GOOG GOOGL on Tuesday said the new charge stems from an effort to optimize its office space globally, which in 2023 resulted in a total of $1.8 billion in related costs as the company worked through announced staff cuts. While many corporations have been downsizing their office footprints in the wake of the pandemic, big reductions in space from major technology companies can have an outsize impact. Momentum by companies to bring more staff back to their offices has been building. Still, Jones Lang LaSalle Inc. JLL said in a fourth-quarter U.S. office outlook that office-space demand was still roughly 30% below pre-pandemic levels last quarter, due in part to a \u201clargely absent\u201d pipeline of technology and co-working expansions. Leasing volume by technology companies was still less than 50% of 2019 levels, JLL noted. \u201cTo keep it short, a lot happened this week,\u201d said Lea Overby, a Barclays researcher focused on securitized credit, in a Friday client note \u2014 citing a barrage of corporate earnings, the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest-rate decision and New York Community Bank\u2019s NYCB charge-offs relating to two commercial-real-estate loans as among the week\u2019s action. \u201cAnd to put all this in perspective, Alphabet noted in its earnings that it took a $1.2 [billion] charge to exit office space in Q4, more than twice the\u00a0charge it took Q1, and this has not even made the news,\u201d Overby said. While at least one real-estate business publication highlighted the charge , much of the broader coverage of Alphabet\u2019s fourth-quarter earnings results this week focused on the company\u2019s digital-advertising business.

U.S. stocks also rallied Friday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA hitting its ninth record close of 2024, the S&P 500 index SPX up 1.1% and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP 1.7% higher, according to FactSet. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield BX:TMUBMUSD10Y was up 17 basis points to 4.03%. Alphabet did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
