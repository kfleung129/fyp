FAQ - New Privacy Policy Substack columnist Michael Shellenberger discusses the woke rhetoric from Google\u2019s AI platform on \u2018The Bottom line.\u2019 Google is facing heavy backlash over accusations that the company is \"woke\" following the revelation that its new artificial intelligence tool, Gemini, was developed with a bias against White people. The Alphabet-owned tech giant is scrambling to right ship after pulling the plug on Gemini's image generation features last week, with CEO Sundar Pichai telling employees on Tuesday the company is working \"around the clock\" to fix the tool's bias, calling the images generated by the model \"completely unacceptable.\" Google CEO Sundar Pichai (REUTERS/Brandon Wade / Reuters Photos) Alphabet, Inc. However, \"Public\" founder Michael Shellenberger says the fallout over Gemini is Google's \"Bud Light moment,\" likening the situation to what Anheuser-Busch InBev faced after its Bud Light brand was boycotted following a partnership with controversial transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney. Anheuser-Busch InBev \"The problem for Google, as with Bud Light before it, is that its CEO and other senior executives are still in denial about the problem,\" Shellenberger told FOX Business in an emailed statement. \"They think the problem is just a few tweaks to the AI or the algorithms.\" BUD LIGHT REMAINS DRAG ON PARENT COMPANY AS DYLAN MULVANEY HIT LINGERS The journalist and author argues it will take more than fixing Gemini for Google to regain the public's trust. Gemini's senior director of product management at Google has issued an apology after the AI refused to provide images of White people.

GOOGLE CEO'S 2016 PLEDGE TO COMBAT MISINFORMATION WITH AI UNDER SCRUTINY FOLLOWING GEMINI CONTROVERSY Jessica Melugin, director of the Competitive Enterprise Institute\u2019s Center for Technology and Innovation, says she does not believe Google's troubles rise to the same level as Bud Light's. Jessica Melugin, Competitive Enterprise Institute Director of Center for Technology and Innovation, reacts to Google\u2019s \u2018woke\u2019 artificial intelligence tool on \u2018The Big Money Show.\u2019 \"I think they\u2019re different in that Bud Light was a marketing mistake, while Gemini was a product mistake,\" Melugin told FOX Business. \"I think the parallel would be skunked beer.\" Melugin said she can see how some might see a common thread in terms of political slant, but noted that generative AI competitors have produced bad results in the other direction too, so she thinks Gemini's woes could be attributed to a quality-control issue.
