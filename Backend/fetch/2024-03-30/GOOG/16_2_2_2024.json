And really I think the story here is understanding how big this is going to be for the overall market.\" GM (00:00:14) General Motors (GM) reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter results. General Motors CFO Paul Jacobson discussed the results, EV adoption, and the company's growth plans. Jacobson said, \"It was another year of overcoming a lot of challenges.

Baird Technology Desk Sector Strategist Ted Mortonson provided insight into the results and the impacts of AI on Google and other tech companies. Mortonson said, \"People are really focused on this move to generative AI and that seems to be a very big focus longer term for The Street, where Google has had basically a monopoly on search. With generative AI, you've got different players at least trying to dethrone them in some way.\" Microsoft (00:00:52) Microsoft's fiscal second-quarter earnings beat estimates, but Wall Street supposedly expected more from AI-driven revenue streams. Brent Bracelin, Piper Sandler Equity Research Analyst on Cloud, discussed the results and outlook for future revenues as generative AI turns roughly one-year-old in its adoption by tech giants. Bracelin said, \"Generative AI is one-year-old. We're one year into this new AI cycle of Microsoft. They disclosed their AI business actually doubled sequentially. It's now a $4.4 billion run rate business in year one.\" Starbucks (00:01:10) Starbucks (SBUX) released its latest quarterly earnings with results missing revenue expectations despite growing over 8% year-over-year.

Ruggeri said, \"We had a strong quarter in Q1, and it was really driven by our most loyal customers remaining engaged across the globe. And so as we think about going forward ... what we're really focused on is continuing to drive customers into our rewards program.\" Boeing (00:01:29) Boeing (BA) narrowed its fourth-quarter losses as outlined in its latest earnings results, but is withholding 2024 guidance amid questions surrounding the manufacturing of its 737 Max 9 jet series. Melius Research Managing Director of Aerospace, Defense & Space Robert Spingarn broke down the implications for Boeing. Spingarn said, \"The fact that there's no guide here isn't really a suspension so far as I can tell ... The FAA has asked for a freeze on the 737, arguably the most important product they do. And I think they're just being smart and not trying to get ahead of the regulator.\" Novo Nordisk (00:01:47) Novo Nordisk (NVO) reported a 36% surge in sales thanks to high demand for weight loss drugs Wegovy and Ozempic. Novo Nordisk CFO Karsten Munk Knudsen discussed the company\u2019s results and what it has in store in the coming months.

And so I think investors are really more focused on the guidance and the dividend for Meta.\" Amazon (00:02:36) Amazon reported its fourth-quarter earnings, beating Wall Street estimates with $170 billion in revenue versus an expected $166.2 billion. Wedbush Securities Managing Director Scott Devitt broke down the results and the performance of the online retailer's various segments and business properties. Devitt said, \"At $13.2 billion, which is what they did in the quarter, you have a trajectory that's leading the company towards kind of a 10% bogey in 2025 now, which is not something that investors were expecting.\" Apple (00:02:50) Apple's first-quarter earnings results blew past Wall Street estimates, posting over $119.5 billion in revenue and adjusted earnings per share of $2.18. However, net sales across Apple's categories and devices fell below expectations, particularly in its services and performance in China. Manhattan Venture Partners Head of Research Santosh Rao discussed Apple's sales miss and how Apple will proceed in generative AI investments. Rao said, \"The number is a miss overall, but I think it's not a major disaster because it's all about the future here going forward, how they get the generative AI into their whole mix and all that. So there are a lot of other levers that they can pull, but at this point it is definitely a disappointment that two areas that we were concerned about did disappoint.\" Related Quotes "
