Indian startups have been at odds with Google for months over the fee it charges for in-app payments.\\  The dispute escalated earlier this month after Google removed more than 100 Indian apps from its app store for violations related to billing, though it restored them after the Indian government intervened. The startups had asked the Competition Commission of India (CCI) to look into the matter and the watchdog on Friday ordered an investigation, saying: \u201cGoogle is implementing its policies in a discriminatory manner\u201d.\n\n The CCI also directed its investigation unit to complete the probe within 60 days.\u201d We are examining CCI\u2019s order initiating the investigation,\u201d a Google spokesperson said in an emailed response to Reuters, adding that the company will cooperate with the process \u201cin every way\u201d. \n\nThe dispute centres on efforts by some Indian startups to stop Google from imposing a fee of 11% to 26% on in-app payments, after the country\u2019s antitrust authorities ordered it to dismantle a system of charging 15% to 30% in 2022. Google denies wrongdoing and says it charges the fee for supporting investments in Google Play app store and the Android mobile operating system, ensuring it distributes it for free. The CCI has already spent months looking into startups\u2019 complaint that Google is not following the earlier antitrust directive that prevents it from taking adverse measures against companies which use alternate billing systems.\nAlso Read:  \n\n\n  \n\n\nCCI Orders Probe Into Google Play Store, Details Here\n\n\n \n \n\n\n  \n\n\nGovt Has Assured Us Support On Google's New Play Store Policies: Startup Founders\n\n\n \n \n\n\n  \n\n\nGoogle Play Store: Majority Of Apps Yet To Be Relisted Says Internet And Mobile Association of India\n\n\n \n  \nFor breaking news and live news updates, like us on Facebook or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.
