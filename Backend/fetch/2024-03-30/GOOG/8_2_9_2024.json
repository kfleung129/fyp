    "text": "The first workers to suffer from the rollout of artificial intelligence (AI) are those at the world's top tech companies. Meta (US:META), Alphabet (US:GOOG) and others are\u00a0cutting staff to invest more in their AI computing infrastructure as they also look to boost profitability. Last week, the fruits of these cuts were announced, for Meta at least, as it beat analyst earnings expectations. This drove share prices even higher, adding to the AI-focused bull run. In the three months to December, its earnings per share were up 203 per cent year on year to $5.33, 11 per cent ahead of the FactSet consensus expectation of $4.82. The company also announced its first ever dividend. The Facebook owner cut 22 per cent of jobs, or 19,182 roles, in 2023. "
