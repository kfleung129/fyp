A poll earlier this month on the jobs site Blind asked users to click yes or no in response to the following statement: \u201cSundar Pichai is Google\u2019s Steve Ballmer.\u201d As of this writing, 76% of the poll\u2019s respondents have agreed with the statement \u2014 that is, with the idea that Pichai is comparable to the former Microsoft CEO who led the company during a period of decline, when it missed out on ascendent technologies and lost its market dominance. In other words, the exact opposite of the kind of CEO Google needs at this very moment \u2014 with ominous legal challenges continuing to multiply, many of the search giant\u2019s core products now showing their age, employees being laid off in seemingly arbitrary droves, and Google\u2019s head start in AI having been eroded by the lightning pace of progress at Sam Altman\u2019s OpenAI. The more you think about it, it\u2019s not hard at all to see why the respondents to that poll feel like Pichai is this generation\u2019s Ballmer. Both men, for example, were business managers who took over from revolutionary founders. Both Pichai and Ballmer became known for maximizing sales, and keeping investors happy, while likewise getting caught flat-footed by major technology shifts. Windows, of course, was too slow to recognize the shift to mobile, while Google has similarly found itself leap-frogged by OpenAI. \u201cAs a xoogler with a decent chunk of $GOOG,\u201d reads a comment from the user who posted that Blind poll, \u201cI\u2019m hoping (Pichai) doesn\u2019t last as long as Ballmer did.\u201d Sign up for the most interesting tech & entertainment news out there.

It\u2019s not just OpenAI, by the way, that brings this realization about Google\u2019s uninspiring leadership into stark relief. And you don\u2019t even have to look all that hard to see the signs. Arguments wrapped in November, for example, in the search monopoly case against Google (which still has an 83% market share as of January). At the same time, Google Search is an increasingly garbage-filled hellscape of everything from Reddit, Quora, and Forbes posts \u2014 as well as People Also Ask questions and other automated nonsense \u2014 that make it harder than ever to find the damn thing you searched for in the first place. Along those lines, you can find dozens of Reddit threads over the past several months with some permutation of \u201cGoogle sucks\u201d in the title: Google search sucks now. F*** Google. Absolutely done with Google Search. What the hell happened to Google? \u201cMy hot take,\u201d begins a LinkedIn post from a Googler that went viral in January. \u201cGoogle does not have one single visionary leader. Not a one. From the C-suite to the SVPs to the VPs, they are all profoundly boring and glassy-eyed.\u201d If you read or listen to interviews with Pichai \u2014 who made a base salary of $2 million last year, or more than $166,000 per month \u2014 you\u2019d think his company is still the same technotopia it was as recently as the 2010s, when free on-campus massages were given out like candy and armies of people with six-figure salaries spent big chunks of their time on wacky, pie-in-the-sky projects (like ending death). The fact of the matter, though, is that this is a company whose CEO correctly predicted back in 2017 that we would \u201cmove from mobile first to an AI first world\u201d and then proceeded to blow its head start in AI. Now, not only is OpenAI approaching a valuation of $100 billion and big enough to present a real, credible challenge to Google. Its AI capabilities are also advanced enough that the company is reportedly developing a search product that would take direct aim at Google Search. In a recent interview with Wired timed to Google\u2019s 25th anniversary, Steven Levy asked Pichai whether Microsoft\u2019s current CEO, Satya Nadella, was right when Nadella said his company \u201cmade Google dance\u201d after Google rush-released its own AI search chat product following Microsoft\u2019s move to plug OpenAI\u2019s chatbot ChatGPT into Bing. Responded Pichai: \u201cIn cricket, there\u2019s a saying that you let the bat do the talking. We have been innovating on AI, and also applying AI to search, every year. There\u2019s always been competition. We\u2019ve seen Alexa launch and Siri launch \u2014 this is not new. Around the end of last year, my thoughts were, how can we bring generative AI to search in a way that makes sense for our users?\u201d Hi Sharks,I am seeking to destroy $1 trillion of shareholder value. pic.twitter.com/94gMmSqds1 I, however, remain skeptical that Pichai\u2019s Google can successfully navigate that transition to \u201cAI-first,\u201d partly because it seems to me the company is increasingly slipping on the little things. Scoff at this if you want, but I have to check my Gmail spam folder every day now, lest I miss an important communication that Google has just started randomly routing to spam instead of my inbox. Search, Google\u2019s mainstay, is also a hopeless mess now. Spam and AI-produced junk are everywhere. \u201cIt\u2019s the worst quality results on Google I\u2019ve seen in my 14-year career,\u201d Lily Ray, senior director of search engine optimization at digital marketing agency Amsive Digital, told Fortune. \u201cRight now, it feels like the scammers are winning.\u201d There\u2019s a great story from the early days of Google, as recounted in Ken Auletta\u2019s 2009 book Googled, when founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin were showing Viacom executive Mel Karmazin how Google Search\u2019s ad business works. They showed him how their new ad system makes everything trackable and measurable now. Isn\u2019t it great? Gone would be the days of admen wooing buyers and having them pay partly for a brand\u2019s aura. Back then, you knew a TV spot or a Super Bowl commercial worked \u2014 you just didn\u2019t know to what extent it worked or who was buying your product as a result. Google Search ads promised to change all that. Karmazin, though, recoiled at the presentation; it\u2019s terrible, he decided. He reasoned that you could keep squeezing more ad dollars out of buyers if they didn\u2019t know what worked and why. Karmazin wanted buyers to keep paying for a little mystery. And then he declared to Page and Brin: \u201cYou guys are f*****g with the magic.\u201d Pichai\u2019s Google is still doing the same thing today, but in an altogether different way than Karmazin meant it back then.
