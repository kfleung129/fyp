    "text": "Shares of Google parent Alphabet Inc. closed at an all-time high on Thursday, days before the company is expected to announce strong quarterly results. The stock, which finished the regular-trading session at $151.87 (Class A) \n        GOOGL,\n        +0.04%\n       and $153.64 (Class C) \n        GOOG,\n        +0.21%,\n       has been on a tear to start 2024 as it rides the broader tech rally. The company is currently trading at a market cap of $1.911 trillion, which is its first close above the $1.9 trillion mark. Also see: Microsoft closes above $3 trillion market value for the first time Alphabet\u2019s rousing rally comes amid severe belt tightening: Google has shed more than 1,000 people in recent weeks while company Chief Executive Sundar Pichai circulated a memo warning of more layoffs to come. Alphabet\u2019s stock is up 56% over the past 12 months, while the broader S&P 500 index \n        SPX\n       has jumped 20.5% over the past year. The stock looks like a bet on Trump himself more than a company with significant revenue and profits.
