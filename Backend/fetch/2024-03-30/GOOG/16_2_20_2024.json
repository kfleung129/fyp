    "text": "The stock market is seeing red across the board on Tuesday, the first day of trading this week. Why are stocks down today? Well, investors appear to be showing a bit of anxiety ahead of Nvidia\u2019s NVDA fourth-quarter earnings report due Wednesday. Indeed, the chipmaker is down more than 4% today despite relatively optimistic expectations for the tech giant. Nvidia has proven to be one of the biggest market movers this year. One of the loftiest beneficiaries of the ongoing artificial intelligence (AI) craze, NVDA stock is up 44% so far this year. Recently, Nvidia even overtook the likes of Amazon AMZN and Alphabet GOOG in terms of market capitalization, albeit briefly. Nvidia\u2019s surge in valuation has drawn comparisons to meme stocks and cryptocurrencies. \u201cWith technology now trading at close to 30x forward estimates, that seems to be a ceiling for the tech sector. Makes it pretty hard for additional PE multiple expansion,\u201d said CFRA Research Chief Investment Strategist Sam Stovall. \u201cWhat investors have to wait on is for earnings to come in better-than-anticipated so that the 2024 and 2025 estimates end up being improved.\u201d Why Are Stocks Down Today? The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite are both in the red today, down 0.6% and 0.9%, respectively. Meanwhile, the Russell 2000 \u2014 which tracks small-cap stocks \u2014 is down 1.4% as of this writing. Today\u2019s dip serves as something of a follow-up to last week\u2019s losses, spurred by concerning economic data. Indeed, last week\u2019s January Consumer Price Index (CPI) report showed that inflation was proving more stubborn than investors had hoped, igniting fears that the Federal Reserve may hold off cutting rates until the second half of the year. Predictably, investors responded to the economic data bearishly, with the S&P losing about 0.3% on the week and the Nasdaq shedding around 1%. This may be fueling today\u2019s selloff, following Monday\u2019s President\u2019s Day holiday and stock market closure. That said, indices are still enjoying a fairly strong year almost two months in. The S&P is up almost 5% year-to-date (YTD) while the Nasdaq is up almost 6%.
