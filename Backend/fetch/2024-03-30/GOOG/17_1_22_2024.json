As a component of this restructuring initiative, X is laying off numerous employees, with a primary focus on those in support roles. Alphabet has not officially commented on the layoffs. Editorji News Desk Alphabet Inc.'s Moonshot X Lab, renowned for its innovative projects, is undergoing a significant transformation that includes layoffs as it turns to external investors for financial support. The division, known as X, has been engaging in discussions with venture capitalists and other investors to secure funding for its ventures. This shift is part of a broader restructuring plan aimed at enabling X's projects to emerge as independent startups with support from Alphabet and external backers. Astro Teller, the leader of the lab, shared details of the changes with staff in an email, stating, \"We're expanding our approach to focus on spinning out more projects as independent companies funded through market-based capital.\" Teller emphasized collaboration with a broader base of industry and financial partners, underscoring the need for lean teams and capital efficiency. As part of this restructuring, X is letting go of dozens of employees, primarily those in support roles. The layoffs have not been officially addressed by Alphabet. X, spearheaded by Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, has been recognized for its ambitious projects, ranging from self-driving cars to high-altitude balloons providing internet connectivity to remote areas. However, the lab has faced challenges in translating these speculative ventures into profitable businesses, leading to the necessity for a strategic shift. Alphabet's CFO, Ruth Porat, who is taking on the role of president and chief investment officer, will now oversee divisions that include X, aiming to instill greater financial discipline. The move to seek external funding and the subsequent layoffs reflect a dynamic shift in X's strategy to navigate industry-wide challenges, particularly in the realm of innovation. In addition to exploring venture capital, X has sought funding from family offices, sovereign wealth funds, private equity firms, and strategic investors aligned with the industries targeted by its moonshot projects. Amid layoffs and budget cuts in Silicon Valley's innovation labs, X's restructuring underscores a proactive approach to address the evolving landscape. \"This approach will give us more opportunity to focus on what Xers do best: inventing breakthrough technologies to help solve some of the world's most pressing challenges,\" noted Teller in the staff communication. \"Because the world needs moonshots more now than ever.\"Also Watch: Google layoffs: Unhappy over mass layoffs, Google employees plan protests ADVERTISEMENT Alphabet's Moonshot X Lab initiates layoffs, shifts to external investors for funding Kotak AMC's Nilesh Shah speaks out against repetitive KYC demands Home loan from HDFC Bank gets costlier after gradual increase in repo-rate linked interest rate Cocoa prices soar nearly 140%, crosses $10,000 per metric ton Mumbai's Bandra-Worli Sea Link toll rates to increase by 18% from April 1 India registers record 1.68 lakh new companies in FY24 ADVERTISEMENT Byju's shareholders raise no objection to board's resolution, miffed investors skip meeting: Sources RBI suspends Rs 2,000 note exchange/deposit facility on April 1 General Electric set to layoff 1,000 LM Wind Power employees Domestic airline Akasa Air begins international operations Banks, Insurance firms to remain open on Mar 30, 31.
