Keith McCullough\u00a0discussed key takeaways on Alphabet\u2019s latest earnings report after the company reported ad revenue that missed analysts\u2019 estimates. \u201cThe expectation for Google was that they\u2019d show an acceleration\u2014and they didn\u2019t,\u201d explains Hedgeye\u2019s CEO in this clip from\u00a0The Macro Show. \u201cThis company sells advertising. As you\u2019re entering a recession, I would just plainly expect advertising revenue demand to slow. And it did.\u201d \u201cNow, you can replace that with whatever some bozo wants to tell you about their AI initiatives and believe that. At the top of the risk range, I don\u2019t believe anything, and that\u2019s where it\u2019s coming from.\u201d \u201cThis is a really interesting setup. Trend for Google is 143. The risk range is 139 to 153. So, there\u2019s a rising probability that Google is going to break trend. That\u2019s a meaningful callout. What would be the catalyst for it not to break trend?
