This week we thought we\u2019d take a look at one of the stocks that is not currently in our screens, Alphabet Inc (GOOG). Profile Alphabet is a holding company. Internet media giant Google is a wholly owned subsidiary. Google services account for nearly 90% of Alphabet\u2019s revenue, of which more than 85% is from online ads. Other Google services revenue is from sales of apps and content on Google Play and YouTube, as well as sales of hardware such as Chromebooks, the Pixel smartphone, and smart home products, which include Nest and Google Home. Goolgle\u2019s cloud computing offerings account for a bit more than 10% of total Alphabet revenue. Alphabet\u2019s moonshot investments are in its other bets segment, where it bets on technology to enhance health (Verily), provide faster internet access (Google Fiber), enable self-driving cars (Waymo), and more. Recent Performance Over the past twelve months the share price is up 57.48%.
