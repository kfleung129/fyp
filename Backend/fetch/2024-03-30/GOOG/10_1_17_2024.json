    "text": "Following Google's recent rounds of layoffs affecting over a thousand jobs, CEO Sundar Pichai has reportedly told remaining employees to expect further downsizing later this year. According to The Verge, Pichai sent out an internal memo on Wednesday, in which he stated that \"to be upfront, some teams will continue to make specific resource allocation decisions throughout the year where needed, and some roles may be impacted.\" Google confirmed to Engadget that this email was sent out. The exec explained that the latest \"role eliminations\" are about \"removing layers to simplify execution and drive velocity in some areas.\" which is just another way of packaging the situation. What's a little more reassuring, perhaps, is Pichai saying that these won't match the scale of some 12,000 job cuts around this time last year, and that not every team will be affected. But numbers are all relative, of course. Google isn't the only notable tech company that has already made redundancies at the beginning of 2024. Earlier this month, the industry also saw Discord, Meta, Amazon, Twitch, Humane AI, Unity and Duolingo making similar moves at various scales. Here's hoping that LinkedIn's timely launch of its AI-powered \"Job Collections\" feature will help those impacted quickly land a new post.
