    "text": " The AI chatbot wars are heating up and GOOG stock will keep benefitting Advertisement Source: rvlsoft / Shutterstock.com There\u2019s no denying it. Google and YouTube parent company Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) didn\u2019t have a blockbuster success with the company\u2019s artificial intelligence chatbot, Bard. However,\u00a0that\u2019s ancient history now, and it doesn\u2019t affect our GOOG stock\u00a0analysis in 2024. Alphabet has a new generative AI chatbot in the works, and it\u2019s generating a whole lot of buzz. Sure, there\u2019s also buzz circulating about a rival AI company\u2019s search engine, which could threaten Alphabet\u2019s Google. Yet, that\u2019s not a sufficient reason to panic-sell Alphabet stock and we\u2019re still assigning it a confident \u201cA\u201d grade today. According to a Bloomberg report, Alphabet stock fell \u201cas much as 3.8%\u201d in a single day on the news that ChatGPT developer OpenAI is creating a search engine to compete directly with Google. So, does this mean that Alphabet\u00a0is about to lose its crown as the search-engine king? Baird analyst Colin Sebastian doesn\u2019t seem to think so. In his estimation, OpenAI\u2019s risk to Google in the search-engine arena is \u201cmodest\u201d: \u201cSearch is extremely challenging to get right \u2014 and Google has fended off many competitors over the years with the quality of search results\u2026 Alternative search engines probably need to be better than Google to really shift user behavior, which could be a challenge even for OpenAI.\u201d There have been other U.S. search-engine rivals over the years, but Google has easily fended them off. In January of this year, In January, Google\u00a0controlled a whopping 91.46%\u00a0of the search-engine market. Thus, for the time being, it\u2019s safe to conclude that Alphabet\u2019s status as a search-engine dominator is secure despite OpenAI\u2019s potential threat. As we mentioned earlier, Alphabet\u2019s Bard chatbot wasn\u2019t a huge success. Yet, that was just the first chapter of a much longer story. Alphabet\u2019s gen-AI chatbot is now rebranded as Gemini, and it\u2019s already available on Android and iPhone devices. We\u2019re already catching wind of the growing buzz surrounding the Gemini rollout. This could prove to be a significant revenue generator for Alphabet. According to Reuters, \u201cU.S. customers can subscribe for $19.99 a month to access Gemini Advanced, which includes a more powerful Ultra 1.0 AI model.\u201d TechCrunch, in influential technology-field publication, recently published an in-depth piece about Gemini. Apparently, the \u201cGemini models are multimodal,\u201d meaning that they can, in theory, perform a range of tasks \u201cfrom transcribing speech to captioning images and videos to generating artwork.\u201d It remains to be seen whether Gemini Advanced will be a popular subscription-based product for Alphabet. At the very least, Gemini is already capturing the attention of the media, including TechCrunch as well as Fortune. Alphabet stock wobbled because some traders were worried about ChatGPT\u2019s threat to Google. Yet, it\u2019s safe to say that Google remains the undefeated heavyweight champion of the U.S. search-engine market. Meanwhile, Gemini could prove to be a major force in the gen-AI field. What can investors expect, then? All things considered, it shouldn\u2019t be surprising if Alphabet\u2019s market capitalization breaks above $2 trillion in the coming quarters. It might even happen in the next few weeks. So, our GOOG stock analysis is firmly bullish and we\u2019re assigning the stock an \u201cA\u201d grade today.
