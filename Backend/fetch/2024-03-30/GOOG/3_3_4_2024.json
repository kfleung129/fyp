    "text": "The CEO of Google and Alphabet, Sundar Pichai, is under increasing pressure to go amid a string of embarrassing gaffes and escalating rivalry in the artificial intelligence area. Google\u2019s stock fell sharply when the Gemini image generator was recently suspended for producing historically incorrect photos. Pichai addressed the matter, calling it \u201ccompletely unacceptable.\u201dIndustry insiders and analysts are debating whether Pichai is the best person to lead Google through this difficult time. Renowned analyst and writer Ben Thompson proposed that there might need to be a change at the top that would involve removing Pichai. Bernstein analyst Mark Shmulik expressed doubts about Google\u2019s management team\u2019s capacity to guide the business into the future.   Some staff members and industry observers feel that Pichai\u2019s leadership has stagnated Google\u2019s innovation, despite his proven track record of achievement, which includes a notable rise in the company\u2019s market valuation during his time in office. Former Google intern Aravind Srinivas, who founded Perplexity, recommended that Pichai think about selecting a new CEO for Google in order to refocus the organization\u2019s attention on innovation.Former Google executive Marissa Mayer also chimed in on the discussion, stating that while she wanted to see Google flourish, a more imaginative approach was necessary. Google is conscious of the difficulties it faces, especially with regard to AI substitutes for conventional search. Although the corporation is gradually creating a new AI-powered search, analysts are apprehensive about its long-term future.It\u2019s still unclear who could take Pichai\u2019s post. The future of Google and its leadership is in jeopardy as the pressure grows. Your email address will not be published.
