He had shared his interview experience during a fireside chat at his alma mater the Indian Institute of Technology-Kharagpur. \"I hadn\u2019t had a chance to use it (access to Gmail was invite-only at the time), I thought it was an April Fools' joke.\"\u00a0\u00a0He had discarded Gmail as a spoof effort from Google for sometime, only to realize after watching grimy faces from interviewers that he may have been wrong. google sundar pichai interview/shutterstock \"In the fourth interview, when somebody asked me, 'have you seen Gmail?'
