    "text": "BREAKING: Futures Loom After 'Good' Inflation Data     Magnificent Seven stocks Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Meta Platforms (META) continue to show strength as 2024 gets underway. Showing a New Year's resolution of strength and resilience, Google stock\u00a0has soared back to the top of its buy range as parent Alphabet (GOOGL) unveils the biggest upgrade yet to its artificial intelligence assistant. Known as Gemini Ultra, the upgrade ushers in the next stage in the battle of AI-driven chatbots between Google Bard and Microsoft Copilot, which combines the power of Bing search with ChatGPT. Google Bard currently uses the midlevel Google Gemini Pro. Last month, Google announced that Gemini Ultra has begun to roll out in two stages. As Google's most sophisticated model, Gemini incorporates multimodal reasoning capabilities. It can run on everything from data centers to mobile devices. Starting in December, Bard has begun using a specifically tuned version of Gemini Pro in English for more advanced reasoning, planning, understanding and more. Early this year, Google plans to introduce Bard Advanced. This will give users access to Google's most advanced AI models and capabilities \u2014 starting with Gemini Ultra. How To Invest In Magnificent Seven Stocks Like Nvidia In 2024 Three Magnificent Seven members \u2014 Nvidia, Meta and Tesla (TSLA) \u2014 made the list of the best stocks of 2023. But while META and NVDA stock continue to hit record highs, Tesla stock has skidded below its 50-day and 200-day moving averages. Meanwhile, Google stock remains in buy range, alongside Microsoft. Amazon has now climbed just beyond its buy zone. Alphabet cleared a 139.42 buy point in a cup with handle on Dec. 20. Several days of heavy volume on the road to that breakout showed institutional demand. A 1.3 up/down volume ratio points to demand for Google stock. On Friday, Alphabet jumped nearly 2% to close right around the very top of its buy zone, which extends to 146.40. Volume rose as its relative strength line also perked up. With a swarm of earnings also on tap soon from Amazon, Meta and Apple (AAPL), Alphabet is scheduled to report its fourth-quarter and 2023 full-year performance on Jan. 30. Analysts forecast earnings growth of $5.75 per share, a 23% gain over the prior year. Microsoft also reports on Jan. 30. The Google Bard AI chatbot rival led this month's list of new buys by the best mutual funds. Top investors scooped up roughly $17.4 billion worth of Microsoft stock. The Q4 earnings season looms large for Alphabet, as well as fellow Magnificent Seven stocks Meta, Amazon, Apple and Microsoft. Investors may be tempted to ask Bard if Google stock is a buy with earnings due. But know that it's risky to buy any stock just before it reports. Before establising any new postions, investors can reduce risk by waiting to see how Alphabet reports and how Wall Street reacts. Follow Matthew Galgani on X (formerly Twitter) at @IBD_MGalgani.
