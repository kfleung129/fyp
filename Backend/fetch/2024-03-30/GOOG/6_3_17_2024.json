(NASDAQ:GOOGL) by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward. We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Alphabet We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years. A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value: 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$78.7b US$90.1b US$105.1b US$122.9b US$134.5b US$143.1b US$150.6b US$157.1b US$162.9b US$168.3b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x20 Analyst x20 Analyst x11 Analyst x4 Analyst x3 Est @ 6.45% Est @ 5.20% Est @ 4.33% Est @ 3.72% Est @ 3.29% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.2% US$73.5k US$78.4k US$85.4k US$93.1k US$95.0k US$94.4k US$92.6k US$90.2k US$87.3k US$84.1k (\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$874b We now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.3%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.2%. Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$168b\u00d7 (1 + 2.3%) \u00f7 (7.2%\u2013 2.3%) = US$3.5t Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$3.5t\u00f7 ( 1 + 7.2%)10= US$1.8t The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$2.6t. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$141, the company appears quite undervalued at a 33% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent. We would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Alphabet as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.064. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business. Strength Earnings growth over the past year exceeded its 5-year average. Debt is not viewed as a risk. Weakness Earnings growth over the past year underperformed the Interactive Media and Services industry. Opportunity Annual revenue is forecast to grow faster than the American market. Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value. Threat Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market. Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?
