    "text": "Stock Analysis Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NASDAQGS, rising to highs of US$154 and falling to the lows of US$129. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Alphabet's current trading price of US$136 reflective of the actual value of the  large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let\u2019s take a look at Alphabet\u2019s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. See our latest analysis for Alphabet Good news, investors! Alphabet is still a bargain right now.  According to our valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $213.34, but it is currently trading at US$136 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now.   What\u2019s more interesting is that, Alphabet\u2019s share price is quite volatile, which gives us more chances to buy since the share price could sink lower (or rise higher) in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market. Future outlook is an important aspect when you\u2019re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio.   Although value investors would argue that it\u2019s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price.    With profit expected to grow by 48% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Alphabet. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation. Are you a shareholder? Since GOOGL is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to  accumulate more of your holdings  in the stock. With  an optimistic  outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as  financial health  to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation. Are you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping an eye on GOOGL for a while, now might be the time  to make a leap.  Its  prosperous  future outlook isn\u2019t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it\u2019s not too late to buy GOOGL. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as  the track record of its management team,  in order to make a well-informed  investment decision.
