    "text": "franckreporter Piper Sandler provided its thoughts on the Magnificent 7 in a recent macro research report, arguing that Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) rank as highly attractive while shares of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) are the least favorite among the group. In constructing the analysis on Alphabet (GOOG) (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) Meta Platforms (META), Nvidia (NVDA), and Tesla (TSLA) Piper Sandler used its Macro Select Model and its Sell Model. Regarding the Macro Select Model, the firm stated: \u201cThe Macro Select model is our dynamic long model. The model screens for stocks with the factor traits we believe are most important for the prevailing backdrop: FCF Yield, EPS Growth, EPS Revisions, CF ROE.\u201d On the other side of the spectrum, when speaking of the Sell Model, Piper Sandler noted: \u201cThe Sell Model identifies stocks at risk of underperforming. The model looks for stocks that have many red flags vs sector peers.\" Moreover, shares of Apple were not ranked as high as Alphabet and Meta Platforms but they were not far off while Nvidia has conflicting grades with a strong macro select rank but also a strong sell model rank. \u201cThis means the stocks has factor traits we like but it is at risk of underperforming as it has several concerning red flags,\u201d Piper Sandler stated.
