    "text": "Wing, the drone-powered delivery company operated by Alphabet, intends to introduce a larger craft capable of towing heavier packages to customers. The news comes on the heels of Walmart\u2019s decision to expand its drone deliveries in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, so it\u2019s no wonder Wing is working to upgrade its stock; the outfit is one of the two firms\u00a0facilitating Walmart\u2019s drone delivery effort, alongside Zipline. Walmart said last week that a quarter of the items in its larger Supercenter stores don\u2019t meet the current size and weight requirements for delivery by drone. That\u2019s not all that surprising \u2014 Wing\u2019s current drones can only handle packages weighing up to a modest 2.5 pounds. Wing\u2019s larger drones, however, will handle \u201cup to 5 pounds in a standard cardboard box,\u201d the company told TechCrunch. They await approval from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration.

The online shopping giant aims to expand its drone-delivery effort into the U.K. and Italy in 2024. Meanwhile, Wing said it aims to bring its own supersized craft to market within the next year. \u201cIt\u2019s always been our vision to implement a multi-modal drone delivery model,\u201d Wing CEO Adam Woodworth said in a statement. \u201cWe are currently focused on launching the new plane and our Aircraft Library design philosophy enables us to test and build new drones based on customer and partner need,\u201d Woodworth added. To the CEO\u2019s point, he\u2019s talked about expanding Wing\u2019s fleet before. When Wing drones arrive at their destination, they don\u2019t land; instead, they lower solitary packages down on a wire before setting them onto the ground. So far, Wing claims it has completed 350,000 deliveries in three continents. In the U.S., the company says it has more than 1,000 crafts registered. "
