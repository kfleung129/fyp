    "text": " Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, and\u00a0GOOGL) is a holding company and parent of Google. The company provides software and Internet-related services including web browsing and search, cloud computing, streaming entertainment, and mobile operating systems, among others. The parent also is involved on a broad array of businesses, including cloud computing, software and hardware, advertising services, and mobile and desktop applications. The company, originally called Google, was founded by Larry Page and Sergey Brin in 1998. Now, more than two decades later, it has grown into one of the most-visited websites globally. This growth has transformed Alphabet into one of the largest companies in the world, with a market capitalization of nearly $1.75 trillion. The company has trailing 12 month (TTM) net income of $59.97 billion and TTM revenue of $280.88 billion. All of these figures are as of Jan. 9, 2024. Alphabet has three classes of shares. The ticker GOOGL represents the company's class A shares and are traded as common stock, with a one-share-one-vote structure. GOOG represents Alphabet's class C shares, which have no voting rights. The company also has class B shares, which are held by the founders and other insiders and which have 10 votes per share. Alphabet's class B shares are not publicly traded. The top individual insider shareholders of Google are Larry Page, Sergey Brin, and Sundar Pichai, and the top institutional shareholders are Vanguard Group Inc. and BlackRock Inc. (BLK). \"Insider\" refers to people in senior management positions and members of the board of directors, as well as people or entities that own more than 10% of the company's stock. In this context, it has nothing to do with insider trading. The shares owned by individual insider shareholders are those that are held through direct ownership. Shares mentioned in this section do not include shares held indirectly nor shares accessible through stock options. Company insiders must file an\u00a0SEC Form 4\u00a0every time they buy or sell an amount of the company's stock that is deemed to be material. For Larry Page and Sergey Brin below, the share numbers listed are actually class B shares, which are counted and valued based on if they were converted to class C shares. Because class B shares don't trade, they have no \"market value.\" Larry Page owns a total of 389.05 million Alphabet Class B shares, representing about 44% of the\u00a0shares outstanding. Page is the co-founder of Google and a board member of Alphabet. He was Google's CEO from the company's founding until 2001 and again from 2011-2015.
