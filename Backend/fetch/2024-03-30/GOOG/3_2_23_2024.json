Google started offering image generation through its Gemini AI models earlier this month, but over the past few days some users on social media had flagged that the model returns historical images which are sometimes inaccurate. \u201cWe\u2019re aware that Gemini is offering inaccuracies in some historical image generation depictions,\u201d Google had said on Wednesday. Since the launch of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT in November 2022, Google has been racing to produce AI software rivaling what the Microsoft-backed company had introduced. When Google released its generative AI chatbot Bard a year ago, the company had shared inaccurate information about pictures of a planet outside the Earth\u2019s solar system in a promotional video, causing shares to slide as much as 9 per cent. Bard was rechristened as Gemini earlier this month and Google rolled out paid subscription plans, which users could choose for better reasoning capabilities from the AI model. \u201cHistorical contexts have more nuance to them and we will further tune to accommodate that,\u201d said Jack Krawczyk, senior director of Product for Gemini at Google, on Wednesday.
