    "text": "Alphabet Inc.'s GOOG GOOGL Google CEO Sundar Pichai addressed the recent uproar over the company\u2019s Gemini AI chatbot, which has faced criticism for generating historically inaccurate images and text. What Happened: Acknowledging the issue for the first time since the Gemini controversy broke out last week, Pichai said that it is \"completely inacceptable\" in an internal memo reported by Semafor. Gemini AI had been generating racially diverse images of Nazi-era German soldiers, and US Founding Fathers even misrepresented Google\u2019s own co-founders. This led to Google temporarily disabling the AI\u2019s ability to generate images. In the memo, Pichai stated that the company has been \u201cworking around the clock\u201d to address the problematic responses in Gemini. However, he did not confirm that the problem had been completely resolved.

Why It Matters: The controversy began when Gemini AI was found to be generating irrelevant or inaccurate images, including those of Google\u2019s co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin. Following this, Google halted Gemini AI\u2019s image generation feature after it inaccurately represented historical figures. The issue drew criticism from tech billionaires like Elon Musk, who revealed that Google was taking immediate action to address the concerns of racial and gender bias in Gemini AI. The controversy has raised questions about the responsible use of AI, with former Reddit CEO Yishan Wong suggesting that the issue is bigger than just being \"woke.\" Check out more of Benzinga's Consumer Tech coverage by\u00a0following this link.
