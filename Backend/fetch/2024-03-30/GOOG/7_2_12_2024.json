    "text": " Will Alphabet be the best-performing Magnificent 7 stock in 2024? Advertisement Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) got off from its slump last year despite facing post-earnings challenges. Q4\u00a0 ad sales rose to $65.5 billion, with overall revenue coming in at $86.3 billion. Despite lower-than-expected ad revenues, Alphabet\u2019s perception as an AI stock remains. Thus, it\u2019s no surprise to see many investors and GOOG stock fans predict the stock to surpass $300 in five years, offering substantial potential returns over the medium term. Let\u2019s dive into Alphabet\u2019s recent earnings report, and what we can glean about whether this is a top \u2018Magnificent 7\u2019 stock to buy right now. After reporting its Q4 results, GOOG stock dipped slightly. The company did emphasize its generative AI capabilities, subscriptions growth, and cloud services as key focal areas. Additionally, advertising revenue increased by 11%, but missed estimates. Thus, many were left wondering if this stock\u2019s valuation may be too hefty for its current growth outlook. That said, CEO Sundar Pichai highlighted the company\u2019s new AI model, Gemini, which has the potential to enhance its core product portfolio and increase its profits. But despite Alphabet\u2019s AI focus, advertising remains its core. This segment saw Q4 revenue of $66B, with ads accounting for 76% of total revenue. Google Search and YouTube TV contributed significantly to the company\u2019s overall quarterly results. Apart from advertising, Google Cloud stood out, with Q4 revenue hitting $9.2B, a 26% year-over-year surge. CEO Sundar Pichai highlighted the company\u2019s AI advancements, countering concerns over competition from Microsoft-backed ChatGPT. If Alphabet can properly integrate AI into its core business segments, all bets are off in terms of how high the company\u2019s growth rate could potentially go from here. The company generated nearly $8 billion in free cash flow this past quarter, partly affected by increased income tax expenses. This company\u2019s robust balance sheet empowers Alphabet to pursue strategic investments and allows this stock to remain one of the top Mag 7 picks for long-term investors. James Cordwell, a Redburn Atlantic analyst, raised Alphabet\u2019s price target to $165 from $150, maintaining a buy rating. Despite robust results, he noted Search growth met expectations, easing his concerns. Additionally, Jefferies increased Alphabet\u2019s price target to $175 from $170, maintaining a buy rating. This firm noted robust ad demand fueling Search and YouTube growth, despite revenue falling slightly short of investor expectations. Cloud growth improved but lags behind Microsoft\u2019s Azure. Jefferies anticipates a positive 2024 driven by a robust ad market, AI-boosting Cloud, and YouTube. BMO Capital\u2019s Brian Pitz increased Alphabet\u2019s price target to $178 from $170, maintaining an outperform rating. He highlighted potential growth in GenAl from infrastructure, foundational models, and apps. BMO raised its 2024 earnings forecast to $6.62 per share and its 2025 target to $8.06 per share. Wells Fargo adjusted Alphabet\u2019s price target to $141 from $148, maintaining an equal weight rating. Analysts attributed tepid fourth-quarter search growth to Alphabet-specific factors, offsetting a favorable cost outlook. The company revised operating loss and free cash flow estimates downward, foreseeing challenges with decelerating search growth and increased capital expenditure. Alphabet\u2019s Q4 results underscore the importance of focusing on its long-term trajectory. While facing heightened AI competition and some financial declines, its robust ad business and cloud growth signal resilience.\u00a0 With the launch of Gemini, a powerful AI tool, Google Cloud has a promising revenue stream. This is the key driver I think investors will remain focused on, at least for the remainder of 2024. Additionally, due to ample resources, Alphabet can sustain and enhance its competitive edge, promising long-term shareholder value. Despite recent fluctuations, investors should consider buying the stock.
