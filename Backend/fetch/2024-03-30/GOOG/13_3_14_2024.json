    "text": " GOOG stock offers portfolio participation in the intriguing robotaxi market Advertisement Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com Google and YouTube parent company\u00a0Alphabet\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is a Magnificent Seven or \u201cMag-7\u2033 member, but GOOG stock\u00a0hasn\u2019t been the most magnificent performer lately. We\u2019re still assigning the stock a \u201cB\u201d grade, however, as Alphabet can still offer good value to its shareholders. Alphabet\u2019s Google is, of course, a dominator in the U.S. search-engine market. Plus, the company earns robust revenue from Google Cloud. Granted, Google stumbled recently in its rollout of a new generative artificial intelligence chatbot. Alphabet is making headway in a niche automotive market with growth potential. Investors constantly say that they\u2019ll buy a stock on the dip. However, when they finally get a nice dip, they\u2019re afraid to make a move. They see that a company is having problems, but you\u2019ll rarely see a share-price dip without some sort of problem happening. To a certain extent, the recent dip in Alphabet stock from $155 to $136 can be attributed to Alphabet\u2019s less-than-stellar rollout of the Gemini gen-AI chatbot. Apparently, Gemini has been accused of providing biased responses to some queries. If you\u2019re going to invest in GOOG stock, you\u2019ll need to be patient with Alphabet. Google CEO Sundar Pichai reportedly assured that the company is working \u201caround the clock\u201d to fix Gemini\u2019s bias. Alphabet will not dominate the gen-AI wars next week or next month. Meanwhile, as these issues rattle some investors, Alphabet stock is trading at a more favorable price point. As Boston Partners fund manager David Cohen put it, Alphabet shares trade at a \u201clow multiple for an extraordinary business.\u201d In case you\u2019re wondering what that \u201clow multiple\u201d is, Alphabet\u2019s generally accepted accounting principles trailing 12-month price-to-earnings ratio is 23.34x. That\u2019s not outlandishly high, especially for a Mag-7 company. As some investors fret about Gemini, they\u2019re probably overlooking the value that Waymo brings to Alphabet. Waymo is the Alphabet-owned manufacturer of self-driving taxis, also known as robotaxis. Pardon the pun, but Waymo is making \u201cway mo\u2019\u201d progress than you might expect. In fact, Waymo\u2019s driverless taxis are now allowed to operate in Los Angeles and in Santa Monica, Beverly Hills and some other cities in California. In addition, Waymo\u2019s robotaxis can operate in Austin, Texas and in Phoenix, Arizona. Perhaps, the public is warming up to the idea of driverless-taxi service. A recent report from The Los Angeles Times seemed to convey a generally positive tone about Waymo. In time, Waymo could prove to be a significant revenue generator for Alphabet. If Alphabet stock dips, what\u2019s your response? Will you focus on the problems with Gemini? Or, will you calmly weigh the risks and potential rewards of holding a share stake in Alphabet? Overall, GOOG stock earns a \u201cB\u201d grade and you\u2019re certainly not required to own it. However, at the very least, consider whether Alphabet can recover from its initial missteps with Gemini. Probably, Alphabet will recover and Gemini will improve. Alphabet will continue to generate revenue from Google Search and Google Cloud. On top of that, Waymo could provide substantial value to Alphabet in the long run. Hence, we encourage you to conduct your due diligence and decide whether Alphabet stock is appropriate for your portfolio.
