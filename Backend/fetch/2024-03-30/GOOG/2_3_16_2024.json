    "text": "Company executives in the fourth quarter produced the second-highest amount of talk about artificial intelligence for any quarter in at least a decade, according to a tally from FactSet. But while talk can be cheap, the tech executives mentioning AI the most also have been showing their shareholders the money over the past 12 months. There were 179 mentions by S&P 500 companies of the term \u201cAI\u201d during fourth-quarter earnings conference calls \u2014 second only to 181 instances in the second quarter of 2023 when looking back to earnings from at least 2014, according to FactSet\u2019s document-search tool. While shares of AI goliath Nvidia Corp. \n        NVDA,\n        +0.12%\n       were 0.1% lower on Friday \u2014 adding to a recent pullback among shares of megacap technology companies \u2014 Nvidia, the top talker about AI in the fourth quarter, has seen its stock climb 262.5% in the past 12 months, according to FactSet. Smaller yet still major advances were also made over the past year by shares of Salesforce Inc. \n        CRM,\n        -0.07%,\n       Cadence Design Systems Inc. \n        CDNS,\n        -0.02%,\n       Alphabet Inc. \n        GOOGL,\n        +0.04%\nGOOG,\n        +0.21%,\n       Microsoft Corp. \n        MSFT,\n        -0.17%,\n       Meta Platforms Inc. \n        META,\n        -1.68%,\n       Hewitt Packard Enterprise Co. \n        HPE,\n        +0.34%,\n       Broadcom Inc. \n        AVGO,\n        +0.51%\n       and Arista Network Inc. \n        ANET,\n        +0.54%\n       \u2014 all of which mentioned AI at least 50 times during their fourth-quarter calls, according to FactSet. The release of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT in November 2022 has been widely viewed as a turning point for artificial-intelligence applications, galvanizing millions of individuals to sign up for the platform and also sparking a craze in AI-related stocks on Wall Street. \u201cFor S&P 500 companies that cited \u2018AI\u2019 on Q4 earnings calls, the average change in price since March 15 (2023) is 28.6%,\u201d wrote John Butters, senior earnings analyst at FactSet. Butters noted that the average gain for companies in the index that didn\u2019t mention AI on their fourth-quarter calls was 16.8%. Stocks closed lower Friday as the tech sector retreated. For the week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average \n        DJIA\n       ended slightly down, while the S&P 500 \n        SPX\n       slipped 0.1% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite \n        COMP\n       shed 0.7%, according to FactSet. Something unusual happened in the stock market this quarter: Both the S&P 500 and Cboe Volatility Index, better known as the Vix, rose.
