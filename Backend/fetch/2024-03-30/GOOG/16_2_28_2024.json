    "text": "JHVEPhoto/iStock Editorial via Getty Images Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is facing down a \u20ac2.1B lawsuit -- about $2.3B -- filed by European media groups saying they've endured losses due to Google's digital-ad approach. The plaintiffs include Die Welt and Bild publisher Axel Springer and Norway-based Schibsted (OTCPK:SBSNY), among others in Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Hungary, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain and Sweden. The case was filed Wednesday in Amsterdam. \"Google\u2019s conduct was found to be an abuse of dominance by the French competition authority in June 2021,\" plaintiffs' representatives Geradin Partners and Stek said. \"Following this, the European Commission opened proceedings against Google and issued a statement of objections in June 2023. Now, more than 30 large and medium-sized European news media companies are suing Google for damages suffered as a result of Google\u2019s abuses.\" Google has disagreed with the European Union's antitrust charges over ad technology.
