    "text": "Alphabet Inc.'s GOOG GOOGL Google on Wednesday settled a patent lawsuit concerning AI technology, which demanded a staggering $1.67 billion. What Happened: The lawsuit was filed by Singular Computing, a company founded by Massachusetts-based computer scientist Joseph Bates, alleging that Google misappropriated its computer-processing solutions, reported Reuters. The case was due to start closing arguments on the day of the settlement. Singular Computing argued that Google had incorporated Bates\u2019 technology into processing units that enable AI capabilities in various Google services.

Singular maintained that versions 2 and 3 of the units, launched in 2017 and 2018 respectively, infringed on its patent rights. Google disputed these allegations, asserting that its technology is \u201cfundamentally different than what is described in Singular\u2019s patents.\u201d The terms of the settlement remain undisclosed. Both Google and Singular acknowledged the settlement but withheld further details, the report noted. Why It Matters: This settlement comes amidst a period of significant changes in Google\u2019s AI division. Just days before the lawsuit settlement, Google\u2019s parent company Alphabet announced its split from its Australian AI training partner, Appen. Appen was a significant revenue source for Alphabet, making up around one-third of Appen\u2019s total earnings. The separation decision was made following a strategic review process led by Google CEO Sundar Pichai, impacting at least two thousand subcontracted Alphabet workers.
