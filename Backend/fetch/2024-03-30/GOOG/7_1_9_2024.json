    "text": "Sign In Register A spinoff of Alphabet (Nasdaq:Goog) \u2013 SandboxAQ\u00a0\u2013 today announced it has acquired Good Chemistry -- a\u00a0spinoff of Vancouver\u2019s 1Qbit -- that specializes in using computational chemistry to accelerate drug discovery and materials design. SandboxAQ's acquisition of Good Chemistry\u00a0is being described as a talent acquisition. \u201cAcquiring Good Chemistry adds 25 computational and quantum chemists, AI and software engineers, and quantum computing scientists to SandboxAQ - along with significant domain expertise from working with Dow Chemical and other,\u201d SandboxAQ notes in a press release. The financial terms of the deal were\u00a0not disclosed, although the Wall Street Journal said \"sources with knowledge of the acquisition\" put the value of the deal at US$75 million. Good Chemistry founder and CEO Arman Zaribafiyan will become SandboxAQ\u2019s head of product for AI simulation platforms. \u201cThe company\u2019s computational and quantum chemists, AI software developers, machine-learning engineers, and quantum computing scientists will join the existing SandboxAQ simulation teams,\u201d the press release stated. Zaribafiyan and his team of 25 scientists will remain in Vancouver. Far from seeing the sale of yet another Canadian startup to an American company as a loss for Canada,\u00a0it should be seen as a gain,\u00a0Zaribafiyan said. \u201cI don\u2019t see this as a loss for Canada,\u201d Zaribafiyan told BIV News. \u201cI see this as a gain, as -- through this joining of forces --\u00a0we are actually taking a Canadian company and Canadian talent and opening it up to a global scale and a global reach.\u201d \u201cWe actually think there\u2019s a benefit for us to do more in Canada, because of this acquisition,\" added\u00a0Nadia Carlsten, vice president of product at SandboxAQ. \"So it\u2019s very much Sandbox now being more involved in Canada, as opposed to Good Chemistry being less involved in Canada. The company\u2019s not moving, the people are not moving, but what we can expect is more investment into the Canadian eco-system from Sandbox.\u201d SandboxAQ is a spinout of Alphabet (Google).\u00a0It is a software as a service (SaaS) company in the AI and quantum technology space. Good Chemistry was a spinout of another Vancouver company, 1Qbit, which specializes in AI for quantum computing. Good Chemistry specializes in quantum chemistry simulation for designing materials and drugs. Its\u00a0QEMIST Cloud platform uses machine learning, quantum computing and \u201cemerging algorithms in quantum chemistry.\u201d One of its \u201cengineering firsts\u201d that caught SandboxAQ's attention was its\u00a0simulation of per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS) \u2013 also known as \u201cforever molecules\u201d \u2013 compounds that are very useful to modern society but which pose environmental concerns because of their persistence in the environment. Simulating these molecules may be an important first step in understanding how to deal with them. \u201cThe fact that they were able to do that (simulation), and have many engineering firsts in the cloud, definitely caught my attention as it being a very mature and solid product,\u201d\u00a0Carlsten said. \u201cWe\u2019re already working with a lot of companies and organizations in the bio-pharma space\u2026and having this talent is just going to be able to accelerate that.\" [email\u00a0protected] twitter.com/nbennett_biv \u00a9 2024 Business in Vancouver "
