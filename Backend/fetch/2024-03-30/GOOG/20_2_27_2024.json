    "text": "Only about 20% of Wall Street analysts who cover Alphabet Inc. carry anything but a bullish stance on it. That\u2019s why Bernstein analyst Mark Shmulik says his market-perform rating on the stock makes him uniquely qualified to defend the Google parent company in the wake of its latest artificial-intelligence blunder. Google came under fire last week after it released an image-generation tool that created some racially insensitive images. On Friday the company paused the tool, which it had added to its Gemini chatbot, and Wall Street spent Monday fretting about what the debacle meant for Google\u2019s AI positioning, brand reputation and future in the world of search. Alphabet\u2019s stock \n        GOOG,\n        +0.21%\nGOOGL,\n        +0.04%\n       dropped more than 4% in the session. See also: Alphabet\u2019s stock has weathered past AI missteps. Is latest blunder different? Shmulik said that while Google was once the \u201cHermit Kingdom,\u201d shipping products slowly and deliberately, AI peer pressure seemingly has forced the company to change its ways, leading to \u201ca string of embarrassing misfires\u201d over the past year or so that came after the company showed off some functions before they were ready. One concern is that high-profile AI flubs could affect the trust people place in Google\u2019s brand, particularly as AI becomes a bigger part of the search landscape. Google overwhelmingly dominates the search market, but some users could turn elsewhere for generative-AI-driven search queries if they feel Google\u2019s offerings aren\u2019t up to par. \u201cSo is this the end of an era?\u201d Shmulik asked, adding: \u201cNot so fast.\u201d He notes that Microsoft Corp.\u2019s Bing has been shedding revenue share of the search market since Microsoft \n        MSFT,\n        -0.17%\n       began getting more aggressive in the field with its AI tie-ins. \u201cPerhaps an unintended benefit of the human bias we\u2019ve seen in Gemini raises AI trust questions more broadly, and pushes out consumer adoption of Gen AI search,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBy then, Google should have fixed the bugs and be ready for prime time \u2026 we think.\u201d The stock looks like a bet on Trump himself more than a company with significant revenue and profits.
