    "text": "Alphabet Inc Class C (GOOG) receives a strong  valuation score of 79 from InvestorsObserver analysis. Our proprietary scoring system considers the overall health of the company by looking at the stock's price, earnings, and growth rate to determine if it represents a good value. GOOG holds a better value than 79% of stocks at its current price.

Find out what this means to you and get the rest of the rankings on GOOG!\nSee Full GOOG Report\n\n\nMetrics Analysis\n\nGOOG has a trailing twelve month Price to Earnings  (PE) ratio of 28.48. The historical average of roughly 15 shows a poor value for GOOG stock as investors are paying higher share prices relative to the company's earnings. GOOG's high trailing PE ratio shows that the firm has been trading above its fair market value recently. Its trailing 12-month earnings per share (EPS) of 5.22 does not justify the stock's current price. However, trailing PE ratios do not factor in the company's projected growth rate, resulting in many newer firms having high PE ratios due to high growth potential enticing investors despite inadequate earnings.\n\n\n\n\nGOOG's 12-month-forward PE to Growth  (PEG) ratio of 1.33 is considered a poor value as the market is overvaluing GOOG in relation to the company's projected earnings growth due. GOOG's PEG comes from its forward price to earnings ratio being divided by its growth rate. A PEG ratio of 1 represents a perfect correlation between earnings growth and share price. Due to their incorporation of more fundamentals of a company's overall health and focusing on the future rather than the past, PEG ratios are one of the most used valuation metrics by analysts today.\n\nSummary\n\nGOOG's valuation metrics are weak at its current price due to a overvalued PEG ratio despite strong growth. GOOG's PE and PEG are worse than the market average resulting in a below average valuation score.\n\n Click Here to get the full Report on Alphabet Inc Class C (GOOG) stock.
