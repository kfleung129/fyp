With Super Tuesday Ahead Teams are now working around the clock to rectify the issues, Pichai wrote in his note, reviewed by Bloomberg News. Stressing the need for the company to deliver unbiased and accurate information, the chief executive officer of both Alphabet and Google said structural changes will be made to prevent similar incidents. Gemini, formerly Bard, is Google\u2019s flagship artificial intelligence product, but the company was criticized for its image generation that depicted historically inaccurate scenes when prompted to create images of people. The Mountain View, California-based company stopped accepting prompts for people in its image generator while it worked to address the concerns raised. \u201cWe\u2019ll be driving a clear set of actions, including structural changes, updated product guidelines, improved launch processes, robust evals and red-teaming, and technical recommendations,\u201d Pichai wrote, urging a focus on \u201chelpful products that are deserving of our users\u2019 trust.\u201d The boom in AI interest and use has brought with it a wave of closer scrutiny, with many critics pointing to the potential for AI-created content to mislead, either deliberately or accidentally. The full note from Pichai to Google employees, first reported by Semafor, is below. I want to address the recent issues with problematic text and image responses in the Gemini app (formerly Bard). I know that some of its responses have offended our users and shown bias \u2013 to be clear, that\u2019s completely unacceptable and we got it wrong. Our teams have been working around the clock to address these issues. We\u2019re already seeing a substantial improvement on a wide range of prompts. No AI is perfect, especially at this emerging stage of the industry\u2019s development, but we know the bar is high for us and we will keep at it for however long it takes. And we\u2019ll review what happened and make sure we fix it at scale. Our mission to organize the world\u2019s information and make it universally accessible and useful is sacrosanct. We\u2019ve always sought to give users helpful, accurate, and unbiased information in our products. That\u2019s why people trust them. This has to be our approach for all our products, including our emerging AI products. We\u2019ll be driving a clear set of actions, including structural changes, updated product guidelines, improved launch processes, robust evals and red-teaming, and technical recommendations. We are looking across all of this and will make the necessary changes. Even as we learn from what went wrong here, we should also build on the product and technical announcements we\u2019ve made in AI over the last several weeks. That includes some foundational advances in our underlying models e.g. our 1 million long-context window breakthrough and our open models, both of which have been well received. We know what it takes to create great products that are used and beloved by billions of people and businesses, and with our infrastructure and research expertise we have an incredible springboard for the AI wave. Let\u2019s focus on what matters most: building helpful products that are deserving of our users\u2019 trust.
