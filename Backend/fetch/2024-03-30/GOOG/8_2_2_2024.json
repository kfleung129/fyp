    "text": "Hi there, it\u2019s tech reporting fellow Rachyl Jones. The busiest week for tech CEOs in recent memory comes to a close today\u2014following a spree of earnings announcements from Meta, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet. And when taking the whole week into account, there\u2019s a few things investors and consumers can glean about the future of the world\u2019s top companies. First, the massive layoffs that have plagued the tech industry over the past year are doing wonders for the companies\u2019 bottom lines, and executives appear keen on continuing to operate in a lean fashion. Meta\u2019s headcount is down 22% from the same time last year, representing the elimination of 67,000 jobs, which CEO Mark Zuckerberg said \u201cis helping us execute better and faster,\u201d adding that \u201cwe will continue to carry these values forward as a permanent part of how we operate.\u201d For Amazon, which is down 27,000 employees in two years, further job cuts are on the table, CFO Brian Olsavsky said on Thursday. And as Big Tech continues to integrate artificial intelligence technologies into corporate workflows, layoffs will remain a subject to watch. Speaking of AI, executives had a lot to say about their respective investments in the technologies\u2014except for Apple, which has largely kept mum about its plans but teased a generative AI announcement coming later this year (see news blurb below). For the rest of the pack, though, the term \u201cAI\u201d sounded 200 times across the four earnings calls. Amazon expects its generative AI services to produce tens of billions of dollars in revenue over the coming years. Microsoft and Alphabet are already feeling the benefits of AI on their businesses (though specific financial details from the companies are woefully scant). Perhaps the company with the biggest talk was Meta, which is planning a massive infrastructure investment (to the tune of at least $30 billion to $37 billion this year) to win the AI race, and with CEO Mark Zuckerberg touting the company\u2019s vast trove of user data as its secret weapon. Of course, the AI arms race is taking place amid growing concerns over safety and privacy, and mounting regulatory pressure. In fact, the threat of Big Tech regulation marked another common thread throughout the week, offering a striking contrast as CEOs took their lumps from regulators one day and celebrated record results and stock gains the next. For Zuckerberg, that took the form of a four-hour grilling by the Senate Judiciary Committee on how Facebook and Instagram risk the safety and well-being of children. Support for reining in social media companies is a rare point of bipartisanship in Congress, with a series of legislative measures on the table. Amazon abandoned its $1.4 billion acquisition of iRobot on Monday, citing \u201cundue and disproportionate regulatory hurdles.\u201d And Apple is preparing for major changes to its App Store in the EU in March, to comply with Europe\u2019s competition law. The company will allow iPhone users to download apps from non-Apple app stores, and it will lower the fees it charges developers. The EU market represents 7% of global App Store sales, but how the regulation will impact revenue\u2014well, CEO Tim Cook gave an answer to the effect of \u201cWe\u2019ll have to wait and see.\u201d With that, here\u2019s today\u2019s biggest news in tech.

Meta\u2019s share price surged by more than 20% after it delivered a spectacular \u201cbeat and raise\u201d earnings report and announced its first-ever cash dividend. The company said it will pay a quarterly dividend (of 50 cents per share) starting next month to all shareholders of record as of Feb. 22. One of those shareholders is Zuckerberg himself, who will receive $700 million per year thanks to his 350 million shares, according to Bloomberg. Apple talks AI. Apple CEO Tim Cook has finally said his company has some generative AI news coming up. \u201cIn terms of generative AI \u2026 we have a lot of work going on internally, as I\u2019ve alluded to before,\u201d Cook said on yesterday\u2019s earnings call, as reported by TechCrunch. \u201cOur MO, if you will, has always been to do work and then talk about work and not to get out in front of ourselves. And so we\u2019re going to hold that to this as well. But we\u2019ve got some things that we\u2019re incredibly excited about, that we\u2019ll be talking about later this year.\u201d That probably means at WWDC in June, where reports already suggest an AI-powered Siri will be revealed. Meanwhile, EU countries today agreed on what will probably be the final text of the bloc\u2019s incoming AI Act, Politico reports. Tesla settles waste suit. Two days after 25 California counties sued it over the mishandling of hazardous waste, Tesla has settled. CNBC reports it will pay $1.3 million in civil penalties and $200,000 in costs. Elon Musk\u2019s car firm will also have to train its employees and pay for third-party trash-container audits for the next five years. Meanwhile, U.S. transport authorities have forced Tesla to increase the font size in its vehicles\u2019 warning lights. \u2014The amount of revenue Apple\u2019s App Store gets from the EU market, as disclosed by CFO Luca Maestri yesterday. This gives an idea of the stakes as Apple rolls out highly controversial changes in the region, most important by allowing third-party app stores on iOS, in response to a new antitrust law. Meta yesterday became the latest company to criticize the way Apple wants to implement the changes.
