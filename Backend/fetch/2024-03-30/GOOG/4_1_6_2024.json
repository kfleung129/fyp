    "text": "Most readers would already know that Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stock increased by 4.4% over the past month. Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Alphabet's  ROE today. ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. Check out our latest analysis for Alphabet Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula: Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Alphabet is: 24% = US$67b \u00f7 US$273b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023). The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.24 in profit. So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or \"retain\", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features. To begin with, Alphabet has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 11% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. As a result, Alphabet's exceptional 20% net income growth seen over the past five years, doesn't come as a surprise. We then compared Alphabet's net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 6.2% in the same 5-year period. Earnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It\u2019s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Has the market priced in the future outlook for GOOGL?
