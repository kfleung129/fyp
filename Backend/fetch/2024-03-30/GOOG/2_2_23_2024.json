    "text": "The Nasdaq 100 closed higher by around 3% on Thursday. Investors, meanwhile, focused on some notable insider trades. When insiders sell shares, it could be a preplanned sale, or could indicate their concern in the company\u2019s prospects or that they view the stock as being overpriced.
