Trailing PE ratios do not factor in the company's projected growth rate, thus, some firms will have high PE ratios caused by high growth recruiting more investors even if the underlying company has produced low earnings so far.\n\n\n\n\nGOOGL currently has a 12-month-forward-PE-to-Growth  (PEG) ratio of 1.27. The market is currently overvaluing GOOGL in relation to its projected growth due to the PEG ratio being above the fair market value of 1. GOOGL's PEG comes from its forward price to earnings ratio being divided by its growth rate. Because PEG ratios include more fundamentals of a company's overall health with additional focus on the future, they are one of the most used valuation metrics by analysts.\n\nSummary\n\nGOOGL' has a weak valuation at its current share price on account of a overvalued PEG ratio despite strong growth.
