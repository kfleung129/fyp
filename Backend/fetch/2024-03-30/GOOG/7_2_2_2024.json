    "text": "Get All the Market Moving News, Squawk, and Mentorship NOW Get All the Market Moving News, Squawk, and Mentorship NOW Meta Platforms, Inc.\u00a0META announced on Thursday its\u00a0initiation of a quarterly cash dividend, with a maiden dividend of 50 cents per share scheduled to be paid on March 26 to Class A and Class B shareholders of record as of Feb. 22. This declaration contributed to a 15% surge in Meta shares during after-hours trading. What\u2019s\u00a0Behind The Dividend?\u00a0The decision to offer a dividend comes nearly 12 years after Meta, previously known as\u00a0Facebook, conducted its initial public offering on May 18, 2012, at a price of $18 per share. A dividend, being an optional shareholder return, is at the discretion of the company\u2019s board. It represents a fixed payment distributed to shareholders in proportion to their shareholdings, excluding loss-making companies. Typically, companies pay dividends to attract income-oriented investors seeking a stable income stream to navigate stock market uncertainties. However, growth-focused investors often favor companies that reinvest profits into promising projects for better long-term growth. Tech companies, particularly those in high-growth sectors, often refrain from paying dividends based on this rationale. Analyzing the reasons behind Meta\u2019s dividend decision,\u00a0Future Fund\u2018s\u00a0Gary Black\u00a0noted that the company closed the quarter with $64.5 billion in cash and generated $43 billion in free cash flow in 2023. He estimated that a $2 per share dividend would consume approximately $5 billion annually from its cash reserves. Black compared Meta\u2019s revenue growth to Tesla, Inc. TSLA, pointing out that Meta\u2019s 2024 guidance of 25%-34% growth exceeded the consensus estimate of 18%-20%, while Tesla was forecasted for over 16% growth. Black stated, \u201cMETA's $43B in FY'23 FCF and $65B cash position convinced the $META Board to initiate a $2/share dividend and add $50B to the buyback.\u201d In addition to the dividend announcement, Meta revealed a new repurchase authorization of $50 billion in shares, supplementing the $30.93 billion pending from a prior authorization.

Apple\u00a0declared a cash dividend\u00a0of 24 cents per share on Thursday. Microsoft has been a consistent dividend payer, distributing both quarterly and annual dividends, along with occasional special dividends. Source: Microsoft Nvidia paid a quarterly cash dividend of 4 cents per share in late December. The dividend yields for Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia stand at 0.15%, 0.74%, and 0.025%, respectively. Assuming Meta maintains a 50-cent dividend for all four quarters, its dividend yield would be 0.51%. However, Tesla,\u00a0Amazon, Inc.\u00a0AMZN, and\u00a0Alphabet, Inc.\u00a0GOOG GOOGL have yet to establish a dividend policy. How Likely The Hold-Outs Join The Party:\u00a0According to Black\u2019s analysis, all three companies are financially sound, with substantial cash reserves and healthy free cash flows in 2023: Despite their financial strength, Tesla, Amazon, and Alphabet may opt for reinvesting profits over dividend payments due to their respective business models and capital-intensive nature. For example, Tesla, operating in a capital-intensive industry, has faced pressure to preserve cash for operational needs. When the company\u2019s stock came under pressure in 2022 amid CEO\u00a0Elon Musk\u2018s Twitter buy and stock sales to fund the acquisition, shareholders, including Black,\u00a0clamored for the company to initiate a buyback. Historically, Apple initiated dividend payments only after\u00a0Steve Jobs\u2018 departure, indicating a potential shift in priorities under new leadership. The iPhone maker, interestingly, is\u00a0a major contributor to\u00a0Berkshire Hathway\u00a0CEO\u00a0Warren Buffett's dividend income. With its consistent dividend payouts and aggressive stock buyback program, Apple is expected to add approximately $878.9 million to Berkshire\u2019s dividend coffers this year. With Musk\u00a0currently entangled in a legal battle\u00a0over his compensation package, he may lean towards convincing investors of the potential for stock price appreciation rather than prioritizing dividend payouts, given the current market challenges. Alphabet emphasized in its recent 10-K filing that \u201cthe primary use of its capital remains long-term business growth investment,\u201d signaling a commitment to reinvestment for future expansion.
