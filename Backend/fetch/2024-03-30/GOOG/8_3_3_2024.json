    "text": "Feedback After worrying results from Gemini, there are growing calls for Sundar Pichai to step down as the search giant\u2019s CEO. Gemini\u2019s AI image generation tool was received very poorly, forcing the firm to pull the feature from the chatbot. Things got so bad that Pichai addressed the issues in a statement to employees, calling it \u201ccompletely unacceptable.\u201d The melee also saw Google-parent Alphabet\u2019s stock plummetting. As per a Business Insider report, calls demanding Pichai's resignation are increasing and many are arguing that the CEO must step down. The report quotes analysts Ben Thompson and Mark Shmulik who said that things at Google needed to change, including possibly replacing CEO Sundar Pichai. While Thompson emphasised the need to address past issues, Shmulik questioned if the current leadership is suitable for guiding Google in the future. Thompson, in his newsletter, wrote that Google needed a \"transformation\" that would \"mean removing those who let the former run amok, up to and including CEO Sundar Pichai.\" The analyst's newsletters are read across the Silicon Valley and by several other Googlers. Bernstein internet analyst Mark Shmulik also talked about how things at Google needed to change in a research note. His note read, \"The most recent saga only further raises increasingly louder questions around whether this is the right management team to guide Google into this next era.\" To recall what happened with Google's Gemini, as mentioned already, it was called out by several users across the internet for generating historically inaccurate and biased images. The AI tool was accused of being \"too woke\", \"racist\" and getting details about \"white people\" wrong. Google CEO Sundar Pichai, acknowledging the problem, said that the company \u201cgot it wrong\u201d. Copyright\u00a92024 Living Media India Limited.
