    "text": "Today we're going to take a look at the well-established Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL). The company's stock saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the NASDAQGS. The recent jump in the share price has meant that the company is trading around its 52-week high. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company\u2019s outlook is already priced into the stock. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let\u2019s examine Alphabet\u2019s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there\u2019s still a bargain opportunity. View our latest analysis for Alphabet Good news, investors! Alphabet is still a bargain right now. Our valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $213.56, but it is currently trading at US$149 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. Although, there may be another chance to buy again in the future. This is because Alphabet\u2019s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company's shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity. Future outlook is an important aspect when you\u2019re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let\u2019s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by 48% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Alphabet. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation. Are you a shareholder? Since GOOGL is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. With a positive outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation. Are you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping an eye on GOOGL for a while, now might be the time to enter the stock. Its prosperous future outlook isn\u2019t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it\u2019s not too late to buy GOOGL. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to make a well-informed investment decision.
