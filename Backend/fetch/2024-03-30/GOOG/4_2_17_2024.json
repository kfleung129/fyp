    "text": "Listen to this article: (Reuters) \u2013 Reading \u201cWar and Peace,\u201d Leo Tolstoy\u2019s monumental novel that runs half a million words long and often over 1,000 pages, might be a minute-long affair for a new artificial intelligence model from Google. The Alphabet-owned company on Thursday showcased Gemini 1.5, an upgrade to its suite of AI models it announced two months ago. In a single prompt, a user can ask Google\u2019s AI to analyze vastly more content than before \u2014 30,000 lines of code, 11 hours of audio, a whole hour of video, Google said. That\u2019s for Pro, the family\u2019s mid-sized model. In concrete terms, Pro can process 1 million pieces of data known as tokens \u2014 five times the amount that Anthropic, perhaps the closet competitor in this regard, handles in a query of its Claude 2.1 technology. Reuters was unable to independently test the claims. Google\u2019s increasingly voracious AI, on the heels of releases by ChatGPT\u2019s creator OpenAI and others, reflects the rapid arms race underway in Silicon Valley to build the most capable \u2013 and marketable \u2013 technology yet. In an interview with Reuters, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai heralded the advance as one of multiple \u201cbreakthroughs\u201d that would fuel his company\u2019s myriad businesses. At root, he said, the search-industry mainstay was making a new manner of inquiry possible. \u201cYou\u2019re dramatically giving a wider view for people to ask questions about the world.\u201d One example that Google discussed internally is how a movie maker could ask the AI to judge a rough-cut film like a critic would, Pichai said. \u201cThis is just one use case we were talking about as a team, but the sky\u2019s the limit here,\u201d he said. Another: querying several companies\u2019 financial reports in one go, said Pichai. Press demos showed how the AI could extract information from a 44-minute video in about 59 seconds, as well as multimodal prompts, in which a user asked the AI to respond to a combination of text and imagery. Beyond imparting updated technology to Google Search and YouTube, Alphabet is looking to Gemini 1.5 to draw customers to its cloud unit. Locked in competition with bigger rival and OpenAI\u2019s backer Microsoft, Alphabet recently saw a rebound in sales growth for the division. Beginning Thursday, Google said it would open its million-token AI to a limited number of business customers, while any developer could build with version 1.0 and swap in the latest generation once available. Asked when such powerful AI models, typically cost-intensive, would be profitable for Alphabet, Pichai said: \u201cThese are profitable things for us to do. Also, over time, we will be very, very efficient at running these models.\u201d Efficiency was another improvement Google highlighted for Gemini 1.5. Google said it implemented a less onerous way for the AI to gather information known as a \u201cmixture of experts,\u201d in line with its prior research and a competitor\u2019s recent announcement. One company official likened the approach to calling a savant to answer a question, rather than dialing every person one knows. \u00a9 2024 FijiTimes. All rights reserved. Powered by PageSuite "
