View more search results Traders pause for breath after a strong rally, ahead of inflation data and bank earnings later this week. US investigators probe whether the Boeing 737 MAX panel was properly bolted. Megacap stocks including Apple and Amazon.com, all-sessions, look set to give back some gains after the 2% surge on the NASDAQ in the previous session. (AI Video Summary) In today's \"Beat the street\" feature, host Angeline Ong talks about the latest news and information before the stock market opens on Wall Street. It seems like the US stocks might start off a bit lower today because investors are waiting for the Trade Price Index (TPI) to be released and they are also considering the possibility of the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates. There is also some news about an investigation into whether the Boeing 737 Max 9 panel was properly attached. One interesting thing the video mentions is that a company called JD.com, which is listed on the US stock market, had their shares fall after they revealed some \"suspicious\" revenue. The video also provides updates on the economic monitor, particularly international trade numbers and trade balance figures. It's worth noting that even though there are concerns about things like politics and conflicts happening around the world, the market volatility is actually quite low right now. The video pays special attention to really big companies like Apple, Google, and Amazon, which have seen a bit of a decline lately. The host talks about how the Hang Seng, which is a stock market index in Hong Kong, and the Australian dollar have both dropped in response to China's poor performances. There's also a mention of Boeing, which has had some recent developments regarding its 737 Max 9 aircraft fleets being grounded, and the oil prices, which have gone up after going down before. To end the video, Ong gives a cautious outlook about the market and mentions that traders are waiting for important figures to be released later in the week.
