On an earnings call held by Alphabet, Sundar Pichai spoke about the future of Google products and how they have fared over the quarter and YoY. While Pichai confirmed that YouTube, Cloud and hardware businesses are the most promising \u2018bets\u2019, he also added that there has been incredible momentum in some of the core products and machine learning. \u201cWe had a phenomenal quarter and Google continues to lead the shift to AI-driven computing. We are working towards making this incredible technology available to everyone around the world. It\u2019s our focus on infusing our products and platforms with product learning and the AI that\u2019s driving our success,\u201d he said.\n\nGoogle Lens Alphabet announced the Q2 results for the year 2017 earlier this week. On an earnings call held by Alphabet, Sundar Pichai spoke about the future of Google products and how they have fared over the quarter and YoY. While Pichai confirmed that YouTube, Cloud and hardware businesses are the most promising \u2018bets\u2019, he also added that there has been incredible momentum in some of the core products and machine learning. \u201cWe had a phenomenal quarter and Google continues to lead the shift to AI-driven computing. We are working towards making this incredible technology available to everyone around the world. It\u2019s our focus on infusing our products and platforms with product learning and the AI that\u2019s driving our success,\u201d he said. Google Lens At Google IO, it was announced that Google Lens will be available later this year. Lenses is a vision-based computing capability that can understand what are you looking at and help you take action based on that information. YouTube YouTube now has 1.5 billion monthly viewers. People are watching an average of 60 minutes of content a day on their phones and tablets. \u201cThat\u2019s incredible and it helps thousands of passionate video creators make money,\u201d said Pichai. Television is now the fastest growing screen for YouTube as the watch-time on TV screens has nearly doubled YoY. This quarter, Google has unveiled six new ad supported originals from celebrities including Ellen Degeneres and Kevin Hart. Advertiser feedback on these new shows has been extremely positive, according to Pichai. Google Cloud Platform It is said that Google Cloud platform (GCP) has continued to grow impressively across products sectors and geographies and is increasingly being used by large enterprise customers in regulated sectors. \u201cTo be more specific about our momentum with big customers in Q2, the number of new deals to be closed are worth more than half a million dollars and it\u2019s three times what it was last year,\u201d said Pichai. Google continues to invest in new data centres around the world to provide the fastest and the most reliable services for its new customers and the existing ones. Computing and Advertising platforms Speaking about the two platforms, Pichai said, \u201cOur computing and advertising platforms are driving great results for our partners. There are now more than two billion monthly active Android devices around the world. It\u2019s really humbling to know that so many people use Android.\u201d At Google IO this year, Google gave developers an early access to Android O which plans to focus on vitals like battery life and performance. Google Play, on the other hand, continues to be a vital distribution platform for developers. Eighty-two billion apps were downloaded from Google Play in the last year alone which is 11 apps for every person on the earth. \u201cWe continue to work on next generation computing platforms, virtual and augmented reality. By the end of this year, there will be 11 day dream ready devices on the market from manufacturers like Samsung, LG, Motorola and Asus,\u201d he added. Advertising Platforms Elaborating on machine learning and its involvement at Google, Pichai said, \u201cMachine learning is critical to helping advertisers and app developer analyse data in real time to reach consumers with more useful ads and measure campaign effectiveness.\u201d At Google marketing, this quarter, Google launched the \u2018Google attribution\u2019which is a comprehensive measurement tool that allows marketers to measure the impact of their campaigns across devices and channels, all in one place with no additional cost. Google has also launched new ad formats and bidding features in Universal ad campaigns to help developers grow their user base on Google Play, Search, YouTube, Gmail and the display network. At Google IO, in 2016, it was announced that there were two billion app installations but today the number is more than five billion. Speaking on online transactions, Pichai stated that around 90 per cent of transactions still happen offline. Google aims to help consumers find what they are looking for in brick-and-mortar stores. He added, \u201cOur store visit technology is instrumental in understanding customer behaviour that starts online and ends in store. This quarter, we also brought local ads and store visits measurement to video.\u201d Google continues to witness success with their bumper ads which is the six second ad format. Pichai said that both brand and viewers love the format as it is the ideal length to capture attention. L\u2019Oreal, Xbox, Clinique and Nutrogena have all seen great success with bumpers.\r\n  It\u2019s said that \u2018Google preferred\u2019 continues to grow as hundreds of brands are now buying it. In the US, the numbers have nearly tripled since it launched three years ago.\r\n  Pichai said that Google is not just helping large brands but also millions of small businesses get online and grow. Every month, Google helps drive 100 million visitors to business websites and creates more than three billion direct connections between businesses and their customers. \u201cThese interactions drive huge economic opportunities in growth for small businesses.\u00a0 Small businesses can now build a website on their mobile phones in under 10 minutes using the listings on Google,\u201d he added. Speaking on publisher\u2019s growth, he said that helping publishers grow their revenues remains a huge focus at Google. He said, \u201cWe are using the power of automation and machine learning to improve our auction algorithm for publishers. The 50 improvements we made since 2016 are generating 15 per cent more revenues for publishers using double click ad exchange.\u201d \u201cMany of these products that make people\u2019s life easier are being powered by machine learning. One focus area for us this quarter has been enabling our machine learning algorithm to learn and make our products faster. Our ability to rapidly deploy the best machine learning in all of this quarter enabled us to launch all sorts of smart features to help moderate comments, suggest smart replies in Gmail and improve translations. We rolled out new machine learning features in Google maps, YouTube, Gmail and Google photos which now has more than 500 million monthly users who back up 1.2 billion photos and videos every day,\u201d he said.

Although specific figures were not disclosed, Mohapatra mentioned that Adobe witnessed double-digit growth in India in 2023. \"We are observing fantastic adoption of our creative suite of products. We have seen notable usage among top banks such as HDFC, ICICI and Axis Bank, as well as airlines like Air India, Indigo and Vistara,\" she added. Mohapatra also noted some sectors are yet to fully leverage Adobe products, namely heavy industries, the healthcare sector and B2B businesses, which are still hesitant to experiment with MarTech. \"While B2C companies have largely been early adopters, B2B adoption remains in progress. Although hospitals and healthcare in a few mature markets have embraced our products, there is room for growth in India,\" she remarked. The automotive sector, according to Mohapatra, is now showing increased interest in MarTech. \"After banking and airlines, we anticipate our third wave of collaboration with auto companies. We are currently in the process of finalizing several deals, which we will announce soon. With FMCG, our operations are predominantly global,\" she stated. \u201cWorld over, businesses are prioritizing their digital investments to improve marketing agility and customer engagement, while driving growth and profitability. Adobe products are playing an essential role in driving the digital economy. We\u2019re excited to be joined by our customers and partners from India, as we showcase our next in line innovations that will pave the way for customer experiences of the future,\u201d Mohapatra added. The Adobe Summit commenced on Tuesday morning with a keynote session by Adobe Global CEO Shantanu Narayen, who made several key announcements and spoke of Adobe's collaboration with other companies, particularly those working with generative artificial intelligence and about establishing broad industry standards. \"Responsible innovation cannot be an afterthought. We are actively combatting misinformation by advocating for content credentials as an industry standard to establish trust in digital content,\" Narayen, also Chairman and President of the company, affirmed. He further explained how GenStudio, which builds upon Adobe\u2019s generative artificial intelligence model released the previous year, is enabling planning, creation, management, and measurement of campaigns. Anil Chakravarthy, President of Digital Experience Business at Adobe, highlighted the transformative potential of generative AI in reshaping brand-customer relationships and driving profitable growth while delivering new digital experiences. Last year, Adobe launched Firefly, its image generation model, with plans to expand it to video, audio, and 3D model generation. Speaking of the reception of Firefly in India, Mohapatra noted that there was significant initial interest followed by gradual adoption. \"India is an experimental market. While Firefly initially received maximum attention in India, purchasing decisions take time here. Many digital marketing organisations have licensed Firefly in the past year, positioning themselves as early adopters. Additionally, some tech companies have also embraced it. As we move towards Firefly Image Model 2, we anticipate even higher quality images and pictures for our clients,\" Mohapatra concluded.

The products expand the Customer Experience Management (CXM) solutions that enterprises have relied on to bring data, content, and customer journeys together to delight customers and build loyalty over time. \u201cGenerative AI enables a fundamental shift in the relationship between brands and their customers, creating a transformative moment for business leaders to drive profitable growth while delivering new digital experiences,\u201d said Anil Chakravarthy, president, Digital Experience Business at Adobe. \u201cThe ability to personalize every interaction has become the key growth driver in Customer Experience Management for enterprises around the world, and Adobe is leading the way in making this a reality with powerful generative AI deeply integrated into existing workflows.\u201d GenStudio With Adobe GenStudio, Adobe is unveiling a new generative AI-first application that empowers brands (and users of various skill levels) to create content, access brand-approved assets, measure performance of campaigns, and more. With connections across Adobe Experience Cloud and Adobe Creative Cloud applications, it provides everything a team needs to address their organization\u2019s Content Supply Chain, which is an end-to-end business process that every company needs to deliver the content required for marketing campaigns and personalized customer experiences. For most organizations, however, their content supply chain is a web of disconnected workflows, teams and systems that often break down. At the same time, the demand for content that is personalized and engaging is exploding. GenStudio capabilities span: \u2981 Workflow & Planning: Allows users to track and view campaigns, manage campaign briefs, see tasks assigned to them, and more. GenStudio also connects directly to applications such as Adobe Workfront, Adobe\u2019s project management software. \u2981 Creation & Production: Brands can find images and generate variations through Adobe Firefly, along with Custom Models that fine tune Adobe Firefly with a brand\u2019s own assets, to ensure that content is on-brand. This unlocks personalization at scale for content creation and production, eliminating manual tasks. \u2981 Asset Management: A content hub allows users to easily find assets across their organization. It connects GenStudio with Adobe Experience Manager Assets\u2014a leading digital asset management system used by brands to manage their library of images, videos and other content\u2014where any user can search for an asset and also create personalized variations with Firefly in Adobe Express, the all-in-one content creation application. \u2981 Delivery and Activation: Brands can create different variations of marketing assets for different distribution channels, with copy that is both audience-centric and on-brand. Users will be alerted if content is not on-brand, with suggestions on how to remedy it. \u2981 Insights & Reporting: GenStudio provides a feedback loop for brands to understand which generated assets and campaigns are performing best, down to the attribute level. These attributes can then be used to inform generative AI prompts. GenStudio is also connected to Adobe Customer Journey Analytics, to drive a holistic measurement of customer experiences across channels such as web and mobile. In addition to GenStudio, Adobe is also unveiling generative AI capabilities in specific applications such as Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) Sites, a content management system that enables brands to create high-performance pages across any digital property (from web to mobile to apps). With the new AEM Sites variant generation, brands can take a single marketing asset and create numerous variations of copy that speak to different audiences. Teams can take a web page for instance and generate variants where the copy is personalized for target personas across different industries, job roles, age groups, and more. And with the new Adobe Content Analytics, brands can understand the performance of AI-generated content, down to the attribute level. The system can analyze and pinpoint elements (colors, objects, styles) that resonate with target audiences, providing a necessary feedback loop to ensure that AI-generated content also aligns with business goals. Adobe unveils Adobe Experience Platform AI Assistant The Adobe Experience Platform AI Assistant enables brands to boost the productivity of teams involved with delivering a great customer experience. It democratizes access to a broader set of users, while also helping individuals spur new ideas. This is made possible through a simple conversational interface that can answer technical questions and will automate tasks, simulate outcomes and generate new audiences and journeys within Adobe Experience Cloud applications. Users can ask questions to uncover high-performing customer segments for instance\u2014or ask the AI Assistant to create a segment that is more likely to embrace a certain promotional offer. This can then be leveraged to drive widescale personalization campaigns. The AI Assistant can also help users leverage Adobe\u2019s enterprise applications more effectively, through querying support materials in Adobe Experience League. Adobe Experience Platform AI Assistant brings all this to life with generative AI and a powerful conversational interface, as well as Adobe\u2019s Generative Experience Models that bring together Large Language Models and Adobe\u2019s product knowledge with unique insights based on customer data, campaigns, audiences and business goals\u2014all in a brand-safe way and with a privacy-first mindset. New capabilities in customer journey orchestration Adobe also announced Adobe Experience Cloud innovations that empower brands to enhance customer engagement by orchestrating impactful cross-channel journeys. A new unified experimentation capability enables brands to increase the volume of tests to pinpoint customer paths that maximize conversion and drive reuse of offers across channels. Brands can support experimentation across content, channels and audiences, with machine learning models, and centralized administration to push winners and resolve conflicts. New capabilities in Adobe Journey Optimizer bring together brand-initiated and customer-initiated interactions within a journey. This ensures that as brands interact with consumers on channels such as the web, social media and mobile, any real-time changes in user behavior or preferences are captured, triggering new experiences. Adobe also unveiled Adobe Journey Optimizer B2B Edition, a new enterprise application built on Adobe Experience Platform. This enables sales and marketing teams to target specific buying groups within customer accounts, a departure from broad based marketing. It leverages unified data in Adobe Experience Platform and generative AI to personalize the journey, through a web chat bot for instance.
