There is a lot of angst on Wall Street about the stocks of Apple (AAPL Quick QuoteAAPL  -  Free Report)     and Alphabet (GOOGL Quick QuoteGOOGL  -  Free Report)     this year. Both are off record highs set earlier in the year and neither one is performing like NVIDIA, up triple digits. Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B Quick QuoteBRK.B  -  Free Report)    owns Apple shares. Warren Buffett bought a big position in the company in 2016 and considers it one of the four lynchpins of Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s business. Buffett loves it so much, he gushes about Apple at nearly every Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting. Berkshire Hathaway Bought Apple on the Cheap It may be hard to believe today, but Apple was out of favor in 2016 when Buffett dove in. It traded with a forward P/E as low as 10.6 that year. Apple\u2019s 2024 forward P/E is 28. No one is calling Apple a value stock in 2024. Apple also had a cheap P/S ratio in 2016. The high that year was 2.8 and the low was 2.3. Currently, Apple trades with a P/S ratio of 7.3. It\u2019s not over 10, which is considered expensive, but 7.3 is above the current average of the S&P 500 at 4.2. Apple also had an attractive P/B ratio in 2016. It\u2019s high was 4.7 and low was 3.9 that year. A P/B under 3.0 usually indicates value. Currently, Apple\u2019s P/B ratio is a sky-high 38. Criteria for Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway to Buy a Stock Buffett loves companies with great free cash flow and Alphabet has doubled its free cash flow since 2019. In 2023, it had annual free cash flow of $69.5 billion, up from $30.9 billion in 2019. Buffett also likes companies that are doing share buybacks and Alphabet announced a $70 billion buyback in April 2023. Does Alphabet have a moat? Berkshire Hathaway looks for companies with competitive advantages of a \u201cmoat.\u201d Alphabet\u2019s advertising revenue has been a moat over the last two decades, although some are questioning whether AI might eat into it. But Alphabet also has YouTube, which recently posted its best quarter for ad revenue ever. Buffett also likes companies with great management who have been in a place for years. Alphabet fits that bill. Will Buffett Buy Shares of Alphabet for the Berkshire Hathaway Stock Portfolio? Tune into this week\u2019s podcast for Tracey\u2019s analysis of Alphabet\u2019s valuation.

This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1988 it has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +24.15%  per year. These returns cover a period from January 1, 1988 through March 4, 2024. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple, equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zacks Ranks stocks can, and often do, change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available, pricing information was not collected, or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations. Zacks may license the Zacks Mutual Fund rating provided herein to third parties, including but not limited to the issuer.
