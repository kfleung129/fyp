    "text": "Google parent Alphabet Inc.\u2019s stock has been on a tear, achieving a record all-time high last week as it rumbles toward projected bang-up results for the quarter on Tuesday. A rebound in advertising sales, growing optimism about its plans for generative artificial intelligence and the routine shedding of workers in the past several weeks all have analysts and investors in buoyant spirits. \u201cWe believe Google can grind higher even after rising 58% in 2023\u201d because of accelerating ad revenue, easy comparisons, strong  search and cloud sales and AI tailwinds, Jefferies analyst Brent Thill wrote in a note to investors last week, summarizing the mood around Alphabet\u2019s \n        GOOGL,\n        +0.04%\nGOOG,\n        +0.21%\n       stock. He lifted his price target on Alphabet shares to $170 from $165 while maintaining a buy rating.

Those buyers expect YouTube\u2019s share to rise slightly from 24% in 2023 to 25% in 2024-25. The survey results prompted Cowen analyst John Blackledge earlier this month to raise his price target on Google shares to $170 from $155 and to maintain an outperform rating. Evercore ISI\u2019s Mark Mahaney is keenly focused on advertising revenue. He projects $67.4 billion in fourth-quarter revenue, 2% above street estimates. He\u2019s particularly enthused by YouTube/YouTube TV, which is  benefiting from the Hollywood strikes. Amid all the sunny outlooks, however, there is a dark cloud: antitrust regulation. Even as the Justice Department awaits a verdict in its lawsuit against Alphabet, the Federal Trade Commission is investigating the generative-AI investments and partnerships of Alphabet, Amazon.com Inc.\u00a0\n        AMZN,\n        +0.31%,\n      \u00a0Anthropic, Microsoft Corp.\u00a0\n        MSFT,\n        -0.17%\n and OpenAI Inc.

[They] have the potential to meaningfully alter Google\u2019s business strategy and add risk to out-year results.\u201d The stock looks like a bet on Trump himself more than a company with significant revenue and profits.
