For years, the firm was seen as a thought leader in the space, showing off advanced chatbots at all its annual technology events. But, when AI became a reality last year, investors got all nervous, fretting that Google\u2019s parent was suddenly behind the curve. In fact, they even went one further, worrying that the company\u2019s bread and butter \u2013\u00a0search \u2013 could be disrupted by the technology and that Alphabet could lose everything that made it what it is today. Fast forward a year, and most of those jitters have faded \u2013\u00a0if not outright vanished. Search revenue has accelerated nicely, posting more than 10% growth in the third quarter. That\u2019s not quite the 20% growth the firm \u2013 and its investors \u2013 had become used to, but it\u2019s much better than was feared only a year ago. Simply put, investors won\u2019t want to see any growth reversal in search and you can expect 10% (or above) to be greeted warmly. Mind you, while it\u2019s nice that AI hasn\u2019t killed Alphabet\u2019s golden goose, investors aren\u2019t convinced that AI is actually helping the firm. Google\u2019s cloud business \u2013 which ranks third in size behind Amazon\u2019s AWS and Microsoft\u2019s Azure \u2013 revealed an unexpected growth slowdown during the last quarterly update. And that was a blow, as it had been outpacing its rivals and grabbing share. It sent Alphabet\u2019s stock lower and it\u2019s partly why Alphabet shares trade at a cheaper valuation than the others. But this time around, if search maintains a healthy growth clip, and Google\u2019s cloud business can pick up again to, say, 25% growth or better, then Alphabet could barge its way back into the AI club. And that would likely send its shares higher. \u2013Alphabet is expected to announce earnings on Tuesday, January 30th, after the close of trading in New York. ai alphabet earnings stocks us alphabet amazon Disclaimer: These articles are provided for information purposes only.
