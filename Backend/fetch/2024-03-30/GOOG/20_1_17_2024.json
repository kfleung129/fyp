    "text": "Wing Introduces Larger Drone for Bigger Orders: 5 Pound Payload Alphabet\u2019s Wing, one of the pioneers in commercial residential drone deliveries, has announced the introduction of a larger aircraft to its fleet. The announcement was made in a company blog post by Wing CEO Adam Woodworth. The new drone is designed to simplify and streamline larger orders, a move that is expected to optimize the company\u2019s operations. \u201cToday, we offer the ability for customers to fulfill larger orders, beyond what fits on one aircraft,\u201d writes Woodworth. \u201cTo better serve that 30% and further optimize our business, we will be introducing an additional aircraft to complement our existing fleet.\u201d The new drone is part of Wing\u2019s Aircraft Library approach to development, where the team works on a variety of configurations based on core components already in use for their flight-proven aircraft. The new aircraft will have the same round-trip range of 12 miles and can cruise approximately 65 miles per hour, all while carrying a standard cardboard delivery box with a payload up to five pounds. This announcement comes on the heels of Walmart\u2019s recent announcement of a major expansion of drone delivery in the Dallas/Fort Worth metroplex with partners Wing and Zipline. Wing was one of the very first drone delivery companies to complete commercial residential deliveries, with a robust history in Australia and in their original test community of Christianburg, VA. Since then, the company has expanded residential drone delivery programs around the world. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to better serve our partners and customers with both aircrafts,\u201d Woodworth adds. \u201cWing intends to work with partners and regulatory stakeholders to introduce this new aircraft in our service areas within the next 12 months.\u201d  With the new aircraft carrying more food, medicine, and household essentials, customers in urban and suburban areas will be able to bundle their orders better\u2014and Wing will have better capacity to deliver them in one quick trip. This development marks another significant step in Wing\u2019s commitment to making drone delivery a reality for more shoppers.
