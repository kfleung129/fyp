    "text": "The stock of the technology giant Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) has been on a rocky if ultimately positive road since the start of 2024 as the battle to remain on the cutting edge of the ongoing artificial intelligence (AI) boom has only heated up. Indeed, while the Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT)-backed OpenAI and its flagship ChatGPT platform remain at the forefront of the zeitgeist on the software side, and the semiconductor giant Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) continues to dominate the hardware arena, new competitors have entered the fray in the form of \u2013 most notably \u2013 Elon Musk\u2019s GrokAI. Google, however, seemingly received a major boon in the weekend leading up to Monday, March 18, as Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) \u2013 so far a laggard in the AI race \u2013 has reportedly entered talks with GOOGL that could see the latter power iOS\u2019 artificial intelligence features. In this climate of heightened competition, as big tech companies rush to the top, Google appears to remain relatively favored by Wall Street analysts. Out of the 37 experts analyzed by the stock analysis platform TipRanks, 29 rate the giant as a \u201cbuy.\u201d Additionally, the fact that 8 out of the 37 remain neutral on the stock does little to diminish Alphabet\u2019s overall \u201cstrong buy\u201d rating. The average 12-month price target, however, reveals that the bullishness is somewhat tempered as it would see GOOGL stock climb 9.26% to 164.59. Generally, there is a relatively limited range in expert predictions as the highest target, assigned by Wolfe Research in late January, stands at $180 \u2013 19.31% above the press time price \u2013 while the lowest, given by Wells Fargo, is set at $141 \u2013 a 6.54% downside. While it remains to be seen if the possible Apple deal will have a major long-term effect on Google\u2019s stock market performance, it has proven enough for GOOGL shares to open on Monday with a 6.81% surge to $151.85. The market\u2019s opening on March 18 also represents the biggest move for Alphabet\u2019s stock in recent time frames and accounts for the bulk of the company\u2019s 9.79% rise in the last 5 trading days. In the long term, however, Google\u2019s performance has mostly been strong \u2013 despite the jitters in Q1 of 2024, and the company is 8.75% in the green year-to-date and 48.90% in the last 52 weeks.
