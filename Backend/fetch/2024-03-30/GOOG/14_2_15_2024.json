    "text": "Shares of Nvidia rose 2.5 per cent on Wednesday, closing with a market capitalisation of about US$1.83 trillion, and topping the search giant\u2019s value of roughly US$1.82 trillion, data compiled by Bloomberg show. With the gain, the chip maker has become the world\u2019s fourth-most valuable company. Saudi Aramco, valued at about US$2 trillion, looms as the next milestone. While other big tech shares have hardly performed badly in 2024, juxtaposed with Nvidia\u2019s rally they appear to be relegated to the slow lane. The other mega-cap tech firms have already announced earnings, and Nvidia is slated to report February 21. \u201cExpecting another strong report, but the bar has been raised,\u201d Susquehanna Investment Group analyst Christopher Rolland wrote in a note Wednesday. Wall Street analysts are seeing signs of continued robust demand for Nvidia\u2019s AI H100 accelerators. The chip maker\u2019s sales have been driven by AI spending at its biggest customers, including Microsoft and Meta Platforms. At least five brokers have hiked price targets for Nvidia this month. Analysts on average have boosted 2024 revenue estimates by more than 100 per cent over the last 12 months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. "
