    "text": "Stock Analysis If you're not sure where to start when looking for the next multi-bagger, there are a few key trends you should keep an eye out for.   Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed.  Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine.    Speaking of which, we noticed some great changes in Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) returns on capital, so let's have a look. Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business.  The formula for this calculation on Alphabet is: Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities) 0.26 = US$81b \u00f7 (US$397b - US$86b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023). Thus, Alphabet has an ROCE of 26%.  That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 9.0% earned by companies in a similar industry.
