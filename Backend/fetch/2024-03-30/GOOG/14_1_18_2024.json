    "text": "Its not been a happy beginning to new year 2024 for tech employees across the world. More than 7,500 employees have already been laid off this year in the first two weeks of January. And there doesn't seem to be any light at the end of this dark tunnel for employees, with Google CEO Sundar Pichai warning of more layoffs. Sundar Pichai Warns Of More Layoffs At Google/Reuters Google and its parent Alphabet's CEO Sundar Pichai has warned his employees to brace more layoffs. In an internal memo shared with Google employees on Wednesday, Pichai said\u00a0\u201cWe have ambitious goals and will be investing in our big priorities this year.\u00a0The reality is that to create the capacity for this investment, we have to make tough choices.\u201d So far, those \u201ctough choices\u201d at Google have included not just layoffs but also reorganizations in the tech giant's hardware, search, shopping, ad sales, maps, policy, core engineering, and\u00a0YouTube teams. \u201cThese role eliminations are not at the scale of last year\u2019s reductions, and will not touch every team,\u201d CEO Sundar Pichai wrote in the memo, as per a report by American technology news website TheVerge. Pichai added that he knows it\u2019s very difficult to see colleagues and teams impacted. Pichai said this year's layoffs are about \u201cremoving layers to simplify execution and drive velocity in some areas.\u00a0Many of these changes are already announced, though to be upfront, some teams will continue to make specific resource allocation decisions throughout the year where needed, and some roles may be impacted,\u201d Pichai wrote in the memo.
