In recent weeks I have routinely been asked by investors what I consider to be the biggest risk to this market. My answer is twofold; 1. From a big-picture perspective, the slowing in corporate profits and thus the late-stage of the business cycle that we find ourselves should keep stocks from rising at prevailing rates. Indeed, they may trot sideways to lower through a multi-quarter lens. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips 2.\u00a0 From more of a market structure perspective much of the gains in the U.S. stock market the first nine months of 2018 came from a few mega-cap technology stocks. Those stocks have such a large weighting in the broader indices, and thus in most U.S. investor\u2019s portfolios, that even a \u201cnormal\u201d corrective move of 10%-20% could have larger reverberations than usual across the stock market.

I call those types of support areas \u201cconfluence support,\u201d which in this case now is made up of horizontal support as well as multiyear diagonal support as marked by the two gray lines. While a bounce and seller exhaustion or a bullish reversal has yet to take place, this to me looks like an opportune spot to buy some GOOGL stock for a trade. Click to Enlarge Moving averages legend: red \u2013 200 day, blue \u2013 100 day, yellow \u2013 50\u00a0day On the daily chart, we see a little closer how this confluence ares of support lines up. Also note that from a momentum perspective, using the daily MACD oscillator in black at the bottom of the chart, we see what is called positive divergence, where the price has continued to struggle but momentum may have made a temporary low in late October. I have yet to see a real wash-out type of selling in GOOGL stock, but if tech stocks are to get any kind of bounce soon into year-end then buying some around the $1,000-$1,050 area with a next upside target closer to $1,120 looks like a good trade setup to me. Position size for this trade in my eye should be conservative given that we have yet to see real wash out selling or a bullish reversal. Once we see such price action one could consider adding to this long position. Get FREE ACCESS to Serge\u2019s renowned Stock Market Scanner with actionable trade ideas.
