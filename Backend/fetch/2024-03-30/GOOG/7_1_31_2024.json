    "text": "Alphabet, the parent company of Google, paid $1.8B in 2023 to get out of leases globally, incurring $269M in accelerated rent and depreciation last year. During the fourth quarter alone, Alphabet paid $1.2B to end office leases early, according to the company's Q4 earnings results, released Tuesday. The moves are a reversal for the company from its pre-pandemic days, when it gobbled up real estate near its Mountain View, California, headquarters and elsewhere in the state and the country. In 2018, Alphabet\u2019s real estate empire was equivalent to 14 of San Francisco's 1.4B SF Salesforce towers,\u00a0the San Francisco Chronicle reported. Google also had plans to develop a\u00a0huge mixed-use development\u00a0on 84\u00a0acres in the Diridon Station area\u00a0in downtown San Jose. The company\u00a0hit the brakes on that effort last year, the San Jose Spotlight reported,\u00a0due in part to\u00a0market conditions. Alphabet has given up office space in both Mountain View and Los Angeles, per CoStar, reversing commitments the company made early in 2023, as Bisnow reported. The company has conducted several rounds of layoffs in the last two years, with the most recent coming earlier this month. Despite financial hits from leaving its leases, Alphabet recorded a strong Q4\u00a0in 2023, as the company focuses on AI and innovation investments. The company\u2019s Q4 consolidated revenues were $86B, up 13% from this time last year, although\u00a0shares sank in after-market trading Tuesday\u00a0and early trading Wednesday\u00a0on missed expectations from Google's\u00a0ad business. \u201cWe remain committed to our work to durably re-engineer our cost base as we invest to support our growth opportunities,\u201d President and Chief\u00a0Investment Officer Ruth Porat said in a news release. On the earnings call, Porat said the company will continue to end new deals for office space and invest in higher growth areas, CoStar reported. Success!
