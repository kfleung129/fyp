In an episode of the bi-weekly BG2POD podcast aired on Feb. 8, co-hosts Brad Gerstner and  Bill Gurley discussed about innovators\u2019 dilemma and how AI's phase change may affect the biggest names in tech. Innovators\u2019 Dilemma: The innovators\u2019 dilemma Alphabet, Inc. GOOGL GOOG is facing currently is that almost the entirety of its profits come from an advertising model around 10 blue links, said Gerstner, founder of technology-focused investment firm\u00a0Altimeter Capital. \u201cThat is just at its core seems somewhat at odds with what Perplexity is doing, what ChatGPT is doing in the age of answers,\u201d he said. Box co-founder Aaron Levie, who joined as the guest in the episode, weighed on the differences  between Google and the likes of Perplexity and ChatGPT. \u201cThe big problem is like you go to a search box, you type in search and they give you a lot results and Perplexity and ChatGPT are just totally different product interfaces, and so they can\u2019t clearly make the Google homepage just do that,\u201d he said. Gerstner pointed out that, in 1999, Google was just a different interface to the portals that existed at the time. He also expressed surprise at why Yahoo, which had an existing business model that required it to sell real estate, didn\u2019t just copy Google then.

Firstly, Google\u2019s user interface is subject to disruption, he said. Secondly, Google is making its users\u2019 lives harder by providing several links with the most pertinent one a user is looking for buried at the bottom, he asserted. \u201cTheir business model is to throw their customers in a cage match and let them compete with each other to the death,\u201d Gurley said. Gerstner expressed doubts regarding Google\u2019s success with this approach. \u201cEven the people who invented the damn Blue Lake model don\u2019t believe that that is where this thing end,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd all I\u2019m saying is the idea that Google can replicate a 99% monopoly and take all of that pool of profits with it, into this new world after letting ChatGPT become the verb, at least at the start, for what this new world is, it just, you know, that to me is almost impossible to believe.\u201d Gerstner noted that the consensus view is that Google is going to dominate the new tech the way it dominated the world of search. \u201cIf they pull that off, I hope I am a shareholder along the way,\u201d he said. \u201cThat will be one of the greatest jiu jujutsu in the history of capitalism,\u201d he added. In a post on X, Gerstner delved into the pushbacks for Google. Sergey Brin and Larry Page, who co-founded Google, knew at that time the 10 blue links were merely a waypoint en route to answers. But as query growth slowed, ad loads increased, raking in dollars, he said. \u201cNow the whole $GOOG machine is geared to more paid clicks, which must actually be attacked to win at answers,\u201d Gerstner said. He also recommended that OpenAI, the company behind the hugely popular ChatGPT chatbot, change the name of the company to ChatGPT and \u201csingularly focus on winning the consumer prize en route to AGI,\u201d and leaving the enterprise side of the business to partner Microsoft. \u201cThe battle to be my trusted assistant/my answer engine \u2013 is a multi-trillion prize,\u201d he said. Alphabet\u2019s Class C shares ended Friday\u2019s session down 1.51% at $141.76, according to Benzinga Pro data.
