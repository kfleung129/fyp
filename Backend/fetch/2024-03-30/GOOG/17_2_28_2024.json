    "text": "Google CEO Sundar Pichai addressed the controversy around its Gemini AI service generating misleading and historically inaccurate images Tuesday, in an internal note saying the issue was \u201ccompletely unacceptable,\u201d a week after the company paused its ability to generate images of people. Google CEO Sundar Pichai called Gemini's missteps \"unacceptable\" in an internal note. In an internal note first reported by Semafor, Pichai wrote he was aware that some of Gemini\u2019s responses \u201chave offended our users and shown bias\u201d and added: \u201cTo be clear, that\u2019s completely unacceptable and we got it wrong.\u201d Pichai said teams are \u201cworking around the clock to address these issues\u201d and the company has seen a \u201csubstantial improvement,\u201d without going into further detail. The CEO\u2019s note then promised a \u201cclear set of actions\u201d to resolve the issue, including structural changes, refreshed product guidelines, technical recommendations, better evaluations and red-teaming (a process of simulating harmful behavior to spot vulnerabilities). Pichai\u2019s note also signaled that the company will move forward with its AI roadmap and \u201cbuild on the product and technical announcements\u201d made in the past few weeks. Addressing concerns of bias in Gemini\u2019s AI model, Pichai wrote: \u201cWe\u2019ve always sought to give users helpful, accurate, and unbiased information in our products. That\u2019s why people trust them. This has to be our approach for all our products, including our emerging AI products.\u201d 3.58%. That is how much Google\u2019s stock value has fallen since the end of last week as the company scrambled to deal with the fallout. The selloff shaved $90 billion off the company\u2019s market cap Monday before the stock mounted a slight recovery over the next few days to end at $140.10 per share. Google widely launched Gemini earlier this month, replacing its former AI-powered chatbot Bard. Built on the company\u2019s latest AI models, Gemini was touted as a competitor to Microsoft and OpenAI\u2019s offerings like CoPilot, ChatGPT and DALL-E and other generative AI tools like Midjourney and Stability AI\u2019s Stable Diffusion. The controversy around Gemini\u2019s image generation tool emerged last week after users found they were able to generate historically inaccurate images like Black vikings, racially diverse Nazi soldiers and a female pope. Billionaire Elon Musk, who is building xAI as a competitor to Gemini, attacked Google\u2019s service, calling it \u201cwoke\u201d and \u201cracist.\u201d Other outlets like the Verge pointed out Gemini\u2019s inaccuracies, noting that a prompt for a \u201cUS senator from the 1800s\u201d generated images of a Black woman, even though the first Black woman was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1992. Google halted the service from generating images of people after the controversy spiraled and said the company would \u201cfurther tune\u201d Gemini to offer more accurate historical contexts.
