Read more Key notes Google\u2019s AI tool Gemini, known for generating images and text, has come under fire for producing biased and offensive content. The tool was suspended last week after users reported issues such as: These issues sparked public criticism, with some accusing Google of harboring an anti-white bias. In response, Google CEO Sundar Pichai acknowledged the problems and called them \u201ccompletely unacceptable.\u201d He emphasized Google\u2019s commitment to providing unbiased information and building products that deserve user trust. Pichai outlined a plan to address the concerns, including: While acknowledging the challenges, Pichai emphasized Google\u2019s continued commitment to advancing AI responsibly. He underlined the importance of learning from mistakes and building helpful products that earn user trust. The full note from Pichai to Google employees, first reported by Semafor, is below. I want to address the recent issues with problematic text and image responses in the Gemini app (formerly Bard). I know that some of its responses have offended our users and shown bias \u2013 to be clear, that\u2019s completely unacceptable and we got it wrong. Our teams have been working around the clock to address these issues. We\u2019re already seeing a substantial improvement on a wide range of prompts. No AI is perfect, especially at this emerging stage of the industry\u2019s development, but we know the bar is high for us and we will keep at it for however long it takes. And we\u2019ll review what happened and make sure we fix it at scale. Our mission to organize the world\u2019s information and make it universally accessible and useful is sacrosanct. We\u2019ve always sought to give users helpful, accurate, and unbiased information in our products. That\u2019s why people trust them. This has to be our approach for all our products, including our emerging AI products. We\u2019ll be driving a clear set of actions, including structural changes, updated product guidelines, improved launch processes, robust evals and red-teaming, and technical recommendations. We are looking across all of this and will make the necessary changes. Even as we learn from what went wrong here, we should also build on the product and technical announcements we\u2019ve made in AI over the last several weeks. That includes some foundational advances in our underlying models e.g. our 1 million long-context window breakthrough and our open models, both of which have been well received. We know what it takes to create great products that are used and beloved by billions of people and businesses, and with our infrastructure and research expertise we have an incredible springboard for the AI wave. Let\u2019s focus on what matters most: building helpful products that are deserving of our users\u2019 trust. Meanwhile, experts believe the controversy stems from technical shortcomings rather than deliberate bias. They argue that the issue lies in the software \u201cguardrails\u201d that control the AI\u2019s output, not the underlying model itself.
