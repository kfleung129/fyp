Alphabet\u2019s shares have gained 54.4% in the past year compared with the Zacks Computer & Technology sector\u2019s growth of 46.6%.In this regard, Google recently announced that the \u201cPhoto Stacks\u201d feature of Google Photos is now getting added to Android.The feature automatically groups similar photos within a short time frame, resulting in one image in the main grid. This is indicated by a number and icon in the Photos tab.Further, this grouping feature displays images in a carousel, with options to set top picks, remove photos, or keep some but delete others to clean up the library.Alphabet is expected to gain solid traction across Android users on the back of its latest move. Alphabet Inc. price-consensus-chart | Alphabet Inc. Quote Apart from the Photo Stacks feature, Google introduced a system-wide photo picker in Android 13, allowing apps to import photos without requiring permission to view the user's library, a method adopted by some apps.Alphabet also updated Google Photos capabilities on Android by introducing an AI-powered \"Highlight videos\" feature for Android users, replacing the previous \"Movie\" maker functionality. The new \"plus\" icon opens a \"Create new\" sheet, allowing users to create albums, collages, cinematic photos and animations.The company also added another Google Photos feature in Android 14, which allows developers to create share sheets with app-specific actions, replacing Google Photos' custom implementation with a native one. The \"Sharing image\" sheet slides up, allowing users to select more images and use the Markup tool. All the above-mentioned endeavors will bolster the company\u2019s Android offerings, which, in turn, will strengthen its Google Services segment, which constitutes the majority of the total revenues.Notably, Alphabet revamped its Android bookmarks page for Google Chrome, featuring larger image previews for saved links and folders and displaying blue folders for core bookmarks and available image previews.The company also added new features to its Google Messages app, including a \"plus\" shortcut, offering Android users a redesign, including a left-facing compose field and an emoji shortcut, along with Magic Compose, a new Gallery icon and a plus menu at the right.Alphabet\u2019s growing endeavors to strengthen Google Services offerings are expected to aid its overall financial performance in the days ahead.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 total revenues stands at $283.39 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 11.26%.The consensus mark for 2024 earnings is pegged at $6.74 per share, which has risen by 5 cents in the past 30 days.
