    "text": "This latest round of Google layoffs are also impacting Alphabet\u2019s X with a restructuring that sees the Moonshot Factory move to a new funding model. According to Bloomberg, X is undergoing a \u201crestructuring\u201d that sees dozens of layoffs centered around \u201csupport staff.\u201d The big change is a new structure meant to let projects \u201cmore easily spin out of X as independent startups with support from Alphabet and outside backers.\u201d This means Alphabet won\u2019t be solely funding these efforts. For example, Waymo in 2020 raised $3.25 billion in its first external investment round. External sources might include venture capital, \u201cfamily offices, sovereign wealth funds, private equity firms and strategic investors, or companies operating in the same industries that the moonshots are targeting.\u201d Notably, Alphabet was previously hesitant about these projects raising outside capital. Under the previous model, which dates back to the inception of Alphabet, projects ready to graduate were limited by how the parent company \u201ccould only accommodate so many Other Bets,\u201d which today includes Access/Fiber, Calico, CapitalG, GV, Verily, Waymo, and X. Bloomberg reports how \u201cstartups within X often faced a choice between waiting for a spot to open up or striking out on their own.\u201d During the January 2023 layoffs, X was said to be prioritizing projects with \u201cmore immediate revenue-generating potential.\u201d This led to projects being killed earlier than usual, with a focus on AI bets over hardware.
