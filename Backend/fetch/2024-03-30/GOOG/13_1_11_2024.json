    "text": "BREAKING: Futures Loom After 'Good' Inflation Data     Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) late Wednesday laid off hundreds of workers, as cost-cutting continues at the internet giant, according to reports. The company has not announced when it will report fourth quarter earnings for GOOGL stock. The layoffs impacted both hardware and software units, the reports said. A Google spokesperson told the Wall Street Journal that it's\u00a0\"responsibly investing in our company's biggest priorities and the significant opportunities ahead.\" The co-founders of Fitbit, James Park and Eric Friedman, will also be leaving Google as part of the reorganization, Google said. Google acquired smartwatch maker Fitbit in January 2022 for $2.1 billion. In December, other reports said Google plans to reorganize its digital advertising business amid stepped up efforts to integrate artificial intelligence into automated platforms. Alphabet cut 12,000 jobs, or about 6% of staff, in its\u00a0largest-ever layoffs\u00a0almost a year ago. The company had over 182,000 employees as of Sept. 30, the WSJ report said. As of Thursday afternoon on the stock market today, GOOGL stock was down a fraction to 141.78. Google stock has gained 2.5% in 2024 after jumping 58% last year. Also, Google stock holds an entry point of 139.42 and trades within a 5% buy zone, according to IBD Marketsmith analysis.
