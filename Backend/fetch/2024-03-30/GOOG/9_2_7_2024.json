    "text": "Most readers would already be aware that Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stock increased significantly by 11% over the past three months. Since the market usually pay for a company\u2019s long-term fundamentals, we decided to study the company\u2019s key performance indicators to see if they could be influencing the market. In this article, we decided to focus on Alphabet's  ROE. Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors\u2019 money. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. View our latest analysis for Alphabet Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula: Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Alphabet is: 26% = US$74b \u00f7 US$283b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023). The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.26 in profit. So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or \"retains\" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics. First thing first, we like that Alphabet has an impressive ROE. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 11% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. Probably as a result of this, Alphabet was able to see a decent net income growth of 18% over the last five years. As a next step, we compared Alphabet's net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 6.2%. Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. What is GOOGL worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether GOOGL is currently mispriced by the market. Given that Alphabet doesn't pay any dividend to its shareholders, we infer that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits to grow its business. In total, we are pretty happy with Alphabet's performance. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth.
