    "text": "The keepers of the Dow Jones Industrial Average will have to make at least one change to the venerable index next week, and there\u2019s a very good chance they\u2019ll make a couple of others, as well. S&P Dow Jones Indices will have to tweak the Dow \n        DJIA\n       on Feb. 26, the day Walmart Inc.\u2019s \n        WMT,\n        -0.91%\n       three-for-one stock split takes effect. Before Walmart\u2019s stock split, the company, which reported fourth-quarter earnings on Tuesday, was the 17th largest component of the Dow. The split will lower Walmart\u2019s stock price by two-thirds. Since the Dow is a price-weighted index \u2014 meaning stocks with higher prices have more influence on the index\u2019s price than those with lower prices \u2014 both Walmart and the consumer-staples sector of which Walmart is a part will have a lot less influence on the Dow\u2019s price. In contrast, the S&P 500 index \n        SPX\n       is market-capitalization weighted, meaning a company\u2019s market value determines the stock\u2019s impact on the index\u2019s price. When Walmart\u2019s stock split takes effect after the Feb. 26 open, the \u201cdivisor,\u201d or the number by which a stock\u2019s price change is divided to determine the impact on the Dow\u2019s price, will also have to change. The current divisor is 0.15172752595384. Read: Why you can count on the Dow making changes in February The last time the Dow\u2019s divisor changed was on Aug. 31, 2020, when Apple Inc.\u2019s \n        AAPL,\n        -1.06%\nfour-for-one split took effect. One week before Apple\u2019s split took effect, the Dow\u2019s keepers announced three other changes to the index\u2019s members, to offset the reduction in Apple\u2019s influence and to \u201cdiversify\u201d the index in order to \u201cbetter reflect the American economy.\u201d As of Jan. 31, the consumer-staples sector had a 7% weighting in the Dow and a 6.1% weighting in the S&P 500, so a diminished representation of that sector with a lower Walmart stock price wouldn\u2019t put the weightings out of whack. Also read: Here\u2019s where Walmart\u2019s stock would rank in the Dow after 3-for-1 stock split The Dow\u2019s keepers are famously tight-lipped about if, when and what kind of changes might be made. But these are the sectors with the biggest differences in weightings between the Dow and the S&P 500 as of Jan. 31 (the Dow doesn\u2019t include transportation or utility companies and currently doesn\u2019t include any real-estate investment trusts): Information technology \n        XLK\n       had a 19.7% weighting in the Dow and a 29.5% weighting in the S&P 500. Some of the largest IT-sector components by market capitalization that aren\u2019t in the Dow are Nvidia Corp. \n        NVDA,\n        +0.12%,\n       Broadcom Inc. \n        AVGO,\n        +0.51%\n       and Oracle Corp. \n        ORCL,\n        +0.27%. The financial sector \n        XLF\n       had a 21.5% weighting in the Dow and a 13.1% weighting in the S&P 500. The Dow\u2019s current financial components are Goldman Sachs Group Inc. \n        GS,\n        +0.59%,\n       Visa Inc. \n        V,\n        +0.02%,\n       Travelers Cos. \n        TRV,\n        +0.57%,\n       JPMorgan Chase & Co. \n        JPM,\n        +0.39%\n       and American Express Co. \n        AXP,\n        -0.03%.\n       Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. \n        BRK.B,\n        +0.86%\n       is the financial stock with the biggest market cap, at $885.2 billion, that is not in the Dow. And the communications services sector \n        XLC\n       had a 2.4% weighting in the Dow but an 8.9% weighting in the S&P 500. Some of the largest companies by market cap that aren\u2019t in the Dow are Alphabet Inc. \n        GOOGL,\n        +0.04%\nGOOG,\n        +0.21%,\nMeta Platforms Inc. \n        META,\n        -1.68%\n       and Netflix Inc. \n        NFLX,\n        -1.01%. Something unusual happened in the stock market this quarter: Both the S&P 500 and Cboe Volatility Index, better known as the Vix, rose.
