High-growth segments like AWS and Advertising further support margin expansion and FCF generation. Overweight, PT $165, 19% Upside Alphabet\u2019s fundamentals are robust, ensuring it remains a driving force in the digital economy and Generative AI advancements. With a focus on innovation, particularly in Search and YouTube ads, Alphabet anticipates healthy growth.
