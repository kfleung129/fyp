    "text": "Despite multiple efforts with the Bard and Gemini chatbots, Google never really dug itself out of the hole it found itself in when OpenAI released ChatGPT in November 2022. After embarrassing results from Gemini\u2019s AI image generation feature, there are growing calls for Sundar Pichai to step down as the search giant\u2019s CEO. Gemini\u2019s AI image generation tool was received very poorly and became the butt of many jokes due to being \u201ctoo woke\u201d and for \u201chistorical inaccuracies.\u201d The company faced such criticism that it was forced to pull the image generation feature from the chatbot and said that it will only be brought back after it was fixed. It got so bad that Pichai addressed the issues in a statement to employees, calling it \u201ccompletely unacceptable.\u201d Google-parent Alphabet\u2019s stock also plummeted in the meanwhile. But now, the focus has shifted to wider issues with the company\u2019s culture and there are calls for Pichai to step down as CEO, reports Business Insider. Google had already made such errors. During a public demonstration of Bard, Gemini\u2019s predecessor, the chatbot made an embarrassing mistake when asked a question about the James Webb Space Telescope. This makes it look like Google is rushing products to the market before they are completely finished. Now that can be acceptable if it comes from a startup like OpenAI or SpaceX, which work with the philosophy of \u201cfail faster and reiterate,\u201d but Google is an established company that we expect to get things right before they push it to customers. This represents a fundamental problem for the company \u2014 it is a major corporation that is now forced to act like a lean, mean startup just so that it does not fall behind in the AI race. The current consensus is that it is already losing that race. Analyst Ben Thompson wrote in his publication Stratechery that Google needs a major shift in culture. He had previously accused the company of being too \u201ctimid\u201d in the AI race. But now, he thinks it is going in a different direction. \u201cIf timidity were the motivation, then it\u2019s safe to say that the company\u2019s approach with Gemini has completely backfired; while Google turned off Gemini\u2019s image generation capabilities, it\u2019s text generation is just as absurd,\u201d he wrote. Thompson pointed to an example where Gemini was asked who was worse, Elon Musk tweeting memes or Hitler. The chatbot said it is \u201cdifficult to say definitively who had a greater negative impact on society.\u201d While many decisions by the Tesla billionaire are questionable and probably were against the interests of society, what Gemini said is downright imbecilic. Thompson says this instance means that even Gemini\u2019s text generation feature needs to be pulled down. \u201cGoogle is a company that should dominate AI, thanks to their research and their infrastructure. The biggest obstacle, though, above and beyond the business model, is clearly culture. To that end, the nicest thing you can say about Google\u2019s management is to assume that they, like me and everyone else, just want to build products and not be yelled at,\u201d concluded Thompson, rather diplomatically. With Gartner predicting last month that search engine volumes will drop 25 per cent by 2026 due to AI chatbots and other virtual agents, this could very well be Sundar Pichai\u2019s Steve Ballmer movement. When Ballmer was heading Microsoft, the company missed out on the smartphone revolution, meaning that both Apple and Google raced to the top of the market with iOS and Android respectively. \u201cThe most recent saga only further raises increasingly louder questions around whether this is the right management team to guide Google into this next era,\u201d wrote Bernstein business analyst Mark Shmulik in a research note published last week, according to Business Insider. Aravind Srinivas, the CEO of Perplexity AI, gave his own answer for the questions of whether it is necessary for Pichai to step down and who will take his place \u2014 \u201cSundar is also the CEO of Alphabet, and he is best positioned to appoint the CEO of Google, whether it\u2019s Nat (who I really admire as a great operator) or others or someone internal or having himself continue,\u201d wrote the former OpenAI research in a post on X, formerly Twitter. Google\u2019s struggle with a changing tech industry landscape has been bleeding the company for more than a year now. It said that it spent more than $2.1 billion in layoffs last year as it fired more than 12,000 employees. Google\u2019s latest earnings report says that its digital ads and cloud computing businesses are steadily growing but Search remains its primary source of revenue, generating $48 billion.
