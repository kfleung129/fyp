    "text": "Let's talk about the popular Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL). The company's shares saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the NASDAQGS. The company is now trading at yearly-high levels following the recent surge in its share price. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company\u2019s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let\u2019s take a look at Alphabet\u2019s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. See our latest analysis for Alphabet The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to our valuation model. It\u2019s trading around 5.2% below our intrinsic value, which means if you buy Alphabet today, you\u2019d be paying a fair price for it. And if you believe the company\u2019s true value is $147.31, then there isn\u2019t much room for the share price grow beyond what it\u2019s currently trading. Is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since Alphabet\u2019s share price is quite volatile, we could potentially see it sink lower (or rise higher) in the future, giving us another chance to buy. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market. Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it\u2019s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by 57% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Alphabet. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation. Are you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in GOOGL\u2019s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven\u2019t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value? Are you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping an eye on GOOGL, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for the company, which means it\u2019s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.
