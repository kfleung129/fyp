In a memo titled \u201c2024 priorities and the year ahead\u201d that staffers received Wednesday evening, Pichai said, \u201cwe have ambitious goals and will be investing in our big priorities this year.\u201d In the memo, which was obtained by CNBC, Pichai said company leadership is gearing up to share its AI goals for the year this week and will publish its 2024 OKRs (objectives and key results). \u201cThe reality is that to create the capacity for this investment, we have to make tough choices,\u201d Pichai wrote. For some teams that means eliminating roles, which includes \u201cremoving layers to simplify execution and drive velocity,\u201d he added. The Verge was first to report on the memo. A Google spokesperson didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Pichai's latest messaging signals continued cost cuts at Google following numerous rounds of layoffs that began in January 2023, when the company announced\u00a0it was eliminating 12,000 jobs, or roughly 6% of the full-time workforce. Google also cut back on some perks as well as laptops and equipment. Since the calendar turned, Google has eliminated several hundred additional jobs in areas including central engineering, hardware and advertising. Pichai said in Wednesday's memo that, \"to be upfront, some teams will continue to make resource allocation decisions.\" He said layoffs won\u2019t be at the scale of last year\u2019s reductions and \u201cwill not touch every team.\u201d Shares of Google parent Alphabet jumped 58% last year as tech stocks rallied following a brutal 2022, driven in part by excitement about AI. Revenue in the third quarter returned to double-digit growth alongside a rebound in the digital ad market. Last month, Google launched its largest and most capable AI model, Gemini. In some tests, the model's performance incrementally surpassed the GPT-4 model from OpenAI, creator of ChatGPT.
