It is added to years divisible by 4, such as 2024, 2028, and 2032, to keep our calendars in sync with the Earth\u2019s orbit around the Sun.

Individuals born on this day are often referred to as \u201cleaplings.\u201d As explained by the National Air and Space Museum, a calendar year is typically 365 days long, loosely defining the number of days it takes the Earth to complete one orbit around the Sun. However, it actually takes Earth 365.242190 days to orbit the Sun. This extra time must be accounted for to prevent the seasons from drifting. If not accounted for, over a period of about 700 years, summers in the northern hemisphere would begin to occur in December. Every four years, an extra day is added to the calendar, such as February 29, also known as Leap Day. This additional 24 hours ensures the calendar stays in sync with the Earth's movement around the sun. Check out more of Benzinga\u2019s Consumer Tech coverage by\u00a0following this link.
