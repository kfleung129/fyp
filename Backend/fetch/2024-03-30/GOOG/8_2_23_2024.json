    "text": "After blockbuster earnings, Nvidia Corp.\u2019s (NASDAQ: NVDA) market cap is larger than that of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL), the owner of Google, and Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), the owner of cloud computing giant AWS. The question raised by this is whether artificial intelligence (AI) has a better economic future than search or cloud computing. (These 25 American industries are booming.) Nvidia\u2019s market cap is $1.96 trillion. Alphabet\u2019s is $1.80 trillion, and Amazon\u2019s is $1.81 trillion. In the past year, Nvidia\u2019s shares are up 278% to $801. Amazon\u2019s are up 82% to $174, while Alphabet\u2019s are up 58% to $145. The Nasdaq is 45% higher than a year ago. Most of Nvidia\u2019s revenue comes from AI chips. Of its $22.1 billion in revenue in the most recent quarter, a small part ($2.9 billion) came from gaming. AI was virtually all of the balance. Overall revenue was up 265% year over year. Amazon\u2019s revenue rose 14% to $170 billion in the most recent quarter. AWS\u2019s cloud business had a revenue increase of 13% to $24.2 billion. Some investors think AWS is worth more than Amazon\u2019s e-commerce business because cloud computing has been a major driver of tech revenue and stock valuations for several years. Based on Amazon\u2019s stock price compared to Nvidia\u2019s, AI may have replaced cloud computing as the core of tech growth across the industry. In the most recent quarter, Alphabet\u2019s revenue rose 13% to $86.3 billion. Its core ad business, Google and YouTube combined, had revenue of $76.3 billion, up 13%. Search has been a critical technology for over a decade, and Google has a market share of over 90% in many countries. A look at the revenue growth of the three companies answers the question of comparison. For now, AI revenue is growing much faster than search or cloud computing revenue. Many analysts believe that may be true permanently. Based on this alone, the distance between Nvidia\u2019s market cap and those of Amazon and Alphabet will continue to grow in Nvidia\u2019s favor.
