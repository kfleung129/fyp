    "text": "Alphabet Inc. is in the process of developing a new generative AI chatbot named Gemini, which is set to replace the previous model, Bard. The Gemini chatbot has attracted attention from influential publications and is projected to be a significant revenue generator for Alphabet. However, it has also faced criticism for instances of unrelated or inaccurate responses to user queries, as pointed out by Marc Andreessen. Both users and tech billionaires have called for improvements in its responses. Alphabet's Gemini has also been under scrutiny for censorship issues. Despite these challenges, the Gemini rollout is gaining momentum and is expected to be a major player in the gen-AI field. The Gemini models are multimodal, capable of performing a variety of tasks, from transcribing speech to generating artwork. Alphabet offers a subscription to U.S. customers for Gemini Advanced at $19.99 a month. This subscription includes access to a more powerful Ultra 1.0 AI model. Alphabet's market capitalization is projected to exceed $2 trillion in the upcoming quarters, driven by the potential of Gemini and Google's dominance in the U.S. search-engine market. The GOOG stock has been assigned an 'A' grade, indicating a bullish trend. Traders and investors use our platform. Top website in the world when it comes to all things investing.
