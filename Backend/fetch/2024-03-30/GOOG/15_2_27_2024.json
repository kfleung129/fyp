    "text": "Alphabet is falling amid renewed fears that the Google owner\u2019s missteps in artificial intelligence are putting its search business at risk. The stock dropped as much as 4.4% Monday following last week\u2019s pause of a Google image generation feature that drew criticism over inaccurate historical depictions of race. Alphabet shed more than $70 billion from its market value.  Problems with AI tools may fuel the perception that Google is \u201can unreliable source for AI\u201d and create an opening for competitors, Melius Research analyst Ben Reitzes warned in a research note. \u201cWe have been arguing that Search behaviour is about to change \u2013 with new AI-infused features,\u201d said Reitzes. \u201cThis \u2018once in a generation\u2019 change by itself creates opportunities for competitors, but even more if a meaningful portion of users grow concerned about Google\u2019s hallucinations and bias.\u201d Last week, Google acknowledged inaccuracies in image generation depictions of people and said it\u2019s addressing the problems. Google aims to resume the feature in the \u201cnext couple of weeks,\u201d Demis Hassabis, head of the research division Google DeepMind, said on Monday at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona.
