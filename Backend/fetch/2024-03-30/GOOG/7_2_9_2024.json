The results came amid an exciting earnings season. Here are some key analyst takeaways from the release. Check out other analyst stock ratings. Roth Capital Partners: Pinterest\u2019s stock came under pressure in after-hours trading on Thursday, after the company reported a revenue miss for the fourth quarter and announced its first-quarter revenue guidance \u201cbelow high-end buyside expectations,\u201d Kulkarni said in a note. He added, \u201c1Q EBITDA & front-end loaded 2024 margin commentary likely spooked high-end expectations.\u201d The two positive surprises from Pinterest were its getting Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL)(NASDAQ:GOOG) on board as an advertising partner overseas and monthly active users (MAUs) coming in above expectations, the analyst further stated.  Wedbush: Pinterest reported mixed results for the fourth quarter, with revenue short and adjusted EBITDA ahead of Street expectations, Devitt said in a note. \u201cExpectations were elevated heading into the print,\u201d he added. Although revenue growth disappointed, management has \u201cfirmly communicated that the impact of recent product and partnership developments will materialize over multiple quarters,\u201d the analyst wrote. \u201cFurther, Pinterest announced a new third-party ad integration with Google, which should help improve monetization in international markets,\u201d he further stated. Piper Sandler: Pinterest missed Q4 revenue expectations and management indicated that \u201cweakness in F&B late in the quarter drove a 100bps headwind that continues into 1Q,\u201d Champion wrote in a note. He added, however, that the company signed a new traffic partnership with Google\nPinterest\u2019s first-quarter guidance calls for around 250 to 500 basis points of sequential acceleration in revenues, the analyst stated. \u201cNew product and DR tailwinds outweigh any temporary vertical-specific headwinds,\u201d he added. JPMogan: Although Pinterest missed revenue expectations, it reported strong user growth and product innovation, Anmuth said. \u201cWe expect mgmt to remain focused on operational discipline, but to also invest in R&D (primarily hiring talent for AI) and S&M (B2B marketing to attract advertisers),\u201d the analyst wrote. \u201cSeasonally, we believe 1Q should have the highest margin expansion of the year due to comps and as hiring picks up,\u201d he added.  Stifel: \u201cPINS announced that its second 3P ad demand integration partner is Google, which is currently ramping, with the goal of tapping into its under-monetized International markets,\u201d Kelley wrote in a note. The analyst added that the company\u2019s Amazon (NASDAQ:AZMN) integration was \u201cprogressing nicely,\u201d with room for improvement, and that \u201cboth 3P integrations are expected to contribute to revenue growth in 1Q24.\u201d Baird: \u201cQ4 results and Q1 guidance missed elevated expectations,\u201d Sebastian said. \u201cImportantly, however, we don't see any structural issues to change the narrative,\u201d he added. The analyst stated that the company seems to be on track for \u201cmid-teens CAGR and healthy margin expansion over the next 3-5 years through a combination of user growth, increasing monetization, and key partnerships with Amazon and Google, among others.\u201d Goldman Sachs: Pinterest reported \u201csolid\u201d results for the fourth quarter, with upside in MAUs and adjusted EBITDA, Sheridan said. Digital ad revenues came more in-line with prior estimates \u201cagainst market expectations that had risen significantly in the last few weeks across the sub-sector,\u201d he added.  \u201cIn addition, the forward revenue guide implies some slight re-acceleration in Q1 as the company continues to make progress in its mix of product initiatives toward more shoppable content, direct response/bottom-funnel ad budgets and partnerships aiding in wider scaled monetization,\u201d the analyst further wrote.
