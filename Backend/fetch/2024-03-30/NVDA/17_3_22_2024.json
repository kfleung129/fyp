    "text": "BREAKING: Core PCE Inflation In Line With Views     Internet cloud service providers have comprised the first wave of buyers of artificial intelligence systems from Nvidia (NVDA). The next wave is likely to be sovereign nations, a Wall Street analyst says. Nvidia stock rose Friday. \"Nvidia sits on the cusp of an entirely new wave of demand from global enterprises and sovereigns \u2014 with each sovereign potentially as big as a large U.S. cloud customer,\" UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri said in a client note. At its GTC 2024 conference this week, Nvidia mentioned Japan, Malaysia, South Korea and Sweden as customers, Arcuri said. The company also mentioned the Middle East market, where Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates are likely buyers, he said. Those are in addition to major projects underway with Singapore, Switzerland and France. Arcuri reiterated his buy rating on Nvidia stock and raised his price target to 1,000 from 800. On the stock market today, Nvidia stock rose 3.1% to close at 942.89. Nvidia shares have risen for five consecutive trading days. The graphics-chip maker saw its stock surge higher this week on news from its GTC 2024 conference. Arcuri predicts Nvidia will generate sales of $112.5 billion in calendar 2024, up 94% from last year. Analysts polled by FactSet are looking for sales of $105.6 billion this year. \"We now see another solid growth year in calendar 2025 with revenue approaching $150 billion (about 30% growth),\" he said. Wall Street is targeting sales of $131.5 billion next year. Nvidia stock is on five IBD stock lists: IBD 50, Leaderboard, Big Cap 20, Sector Leaders and Tech Leaders.
