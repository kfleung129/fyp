    "text": "In an interview with CNBC's Jim Cramer, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang explained why his company is bullish on humanoid robotics. At GTC, its annual conference, this week, the artificial intelligence powerhouse announced new hardware and software aimed at the burgeoning robotics industry. This new tech is meant to help robot makers develop and produce robots, including but not limited to humanoid robotics. Huang said he thinks the humanoid form factor in robotics could potentially transform manufacturing. \"We're in a world where, \u00a0in order to write a software for a computer, we use data, or training examples, and the computer learns from the examples,\" he said. \"Well, we have the most examples of human(s) moving around of just about any other data.\" Huang suggested \"we built the world for ourselves,\" and used a car factory as an example, saying that manufacturing lines were created for people. Using data from humans will make robots the most productive they can be at these tasks, he said. Eventually, he predicted, factories will see a robot orchestrating a bunch of manufacturing robots that are building cars that also will be robotic.  Huang also touched on Nvidia's many partnerships in Big Tech and beyond, saying his company is \"a market maker, not a share taker.\" He asserted that Nvidia's technology will create jobs. \"This is going to create jobs, it's going to make companies more productive,\" he said. \"When companies are more productive, their earnings improve, or their revenues go up. When that happens, they hire more people.\" Correction: A previous version of this story mischaracterized Nvidia's role in robotics.
