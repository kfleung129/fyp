The company\u2019s valuation: roughly $2 billion. The Figure web site says it\u2019s \u201can AI Robotics company building the world\u2019s first commercially viable autonomous humanoid robot.\u201d Noting the chronic shortage of employees in the U.S. economy, the web site states its intent is to build a general-purpose humanoid: \u201cWith the first humanoid by our side in the workforce, we\u2019ll have the ability to create and produce so much more, address drastic labor shortages, and reduce the number of workers in unsafe jobs.\u201d It\u2019s first robot, called Figure 01, \u201cbrings together the dexterity of the human form and cutting edge AI to go beyond single-function robots and lend support across manufacturing, logistics, warehousing, and retail.\u201d \u201cFigure 01 is AI-powered and self-reliant, ready to produce an abundance of affordable, more widely available goods and services to a degree which humanity has never seen,\u201d the company states. \u201cAs we reach the upper limits of our production capability, humanoids will join the workforce with the ability to think, learn, and interact with their environment safely alongside us.\u201d According to a story in The Wall Street Journal, the investment money will be used by Figure to accelerate commercial deployment of its robots. Also, the company said it signed an agreement with BMW to use Figure robots for automotive manufacturing. The company said this month that \u201cits robots could complete a real-world task like moving a box onto a conveyor belt,\u201d according to the Journal story. \u201cThe startup has posted\u00a0videos of its robots that look like something out of a sci-fi movie. In one, a robot puts a pod in a Keurig coffee machine, though a human had to place the cup down. In another video, an ungainly robot walks across a room.\u201d Other investors include Parkway Venture Capital,\u00a0Align Ventures,\u00a0ARK Venture Fund,\u00a0Aliya Capital Partners,\u00a0Tamarack, Boscolo Intervest and\u00a0BOLD Capital Partners,. Industries such as railways are moving from traditional inspection methods to using AI and ML to perform automated inspection of\u2026. The high-performance computing (HPC) market is witnessing a notable shift towards the cloud, partially driven by the benefits of enhanced energy efficiency. According to Hyperion Research nearly every organization running HPC workloads is either already using or investigating the cloud to accelerate application performance, with the cloud market for HPC workloads forecast to reach $11.5 [\u2026]  Name * Email * Website Notify me of follow-up comments by email.
