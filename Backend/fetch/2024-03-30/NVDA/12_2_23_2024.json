    "text": "Nvidia share price surged to an all-time high on Thursday with its market capitalisation witnessing the biggest single-session increase in history, topping Meta Platforms\u2019 historic gain just three weeks ago. Nvidia shares jumped 16%, adding about $277 billion in market capitalization and bringing its total market value near $2 trillion. The addition in market value eclipsed the $197 billion gain made by Facebook-parent Meta at the start of the month. The shares of the chipmaker rallied after it reported blowout results that cemented Wall Street bets on the potential for its artificial intelligence technologies. The company\u2019s guidance also beat Wall Street estimates, driven by AI spending at its biggest customers, including Microsoft Corp. and Meta. A series of estimate-beating results means the shares have been getting cheaper on a price-to-earnings basis, Bloomberg reported.
