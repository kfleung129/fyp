After all, the \u201cMad Money\u201d host once hailed Huang as \u201cthe da Vinci of tech.\u201d But how does Huang compare to Elon Musk, the visionary entrepreneur celebrated for revolutionizing transportation on Earth with Tesla and in space with SpaceX? Commercial real estate has beaten the stock market for 25 years \u2014 but only the super rich could buy in.

His answer was unequivocally affirmative. \u201cYes, and I\u2019ll tell you why,\u201d Cramer explained. \u201cI think that Musk can see around the corner. But I think that Jensen is thinking about a legacy of changing the entire paradigm about the way the world is. Jensen is creating single handedly an industrial revolution.\u201d Cramer's remarks followed Nvidia's announcement of exceptional quarterly results. The chip giant reported that its Q4 revenue surged by 265% year-over-year, while its earnings per share skyrocketed by 765%. Nvidia shares shot up 16% after earnings. Over the last 12 months, the stock has seen a gain of over 236%. While shareholders are celebrating Nvidia's massive success, it might be worth noting that the company's innovative leaps are grounded in a philosophy that embraces \u201ca tolerance for failure.\u201d Huang earned his master\u2019s degree in electrical engineering from Stanford University in 1992. In 2011, he returned to his alma mater to deliver a lecture on the challenges and rewards of building a company. Central to his discourse was the concept of failure. \u201cIf you want to be successful, I would encourage you to grow a tolerance for failure,\u201d he stated. However, Huang clarified that he's not advocating for failure per se. Read more: Rich young Americans have lost confidence in the stock market \u2014 and are betting on these 3 assets instead. Get in now for strong long-term tailwinds \u201cIf you fail often enough, you actually might become a failure \u2014 and that's different than being successful,\u201d he explained. \u201cSo the question is, how do you teach someone how to fail, but fail quickly? And to change courses as soon as you know it's a dead end?\u201d The answer, according to Huang, is something called intellectual honesty. The approach is straightforward: \u201cWe assess on a continuous basis whether something makes sense or not. And if it's the wrong decision, let's change our mind.\u201d He contended that to create a company capable of inventing \u201camazing things that solves problems for the world that it sometimes didn't even know it had,\u201d building a tolerance for risk-taking is crucial. At the same time, it\u2019s also essential to \u201cteach people how to fail but fail quickly and inexpensively.\u201d According to Huang, this mindset is vital because innovation is predicated on experimentation, which necessitates exploration, and exploration may lead to failure. \u201cUnless you have a tolerance for failure, you will never experiment and if you don't ever experiment, you will never innovate. If you don't innovate, you don't succeed,\u201d he concluded.
