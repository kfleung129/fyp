    "text": "Justin Sullivan/Getty Images News NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares were on track to snap their six-day winning streak on Friday, noting their first decline since Jan. 03. The company inched 0.36% lower to $546.22 by 1244 ET as a Financial Times report urged the chief executives of certain U.S. chip manufacturers to testify before Congress, as the panel intensifies its scrutiny of companies with interests in China. Throughout the six-day rally, the stock gained about 15.25%. Overall, on a 12-month reading, NVIDIA has soared 242.62%. The stock recently reached its new all-time high level. Its 200-day moving average was 31.35%. Looking at Seeking Alpha's Quant ratings, NVIDIA had a Hold rating with a score of 3.49 out of 5. The company received an A+ for its profitability and growth prospects. The stock, however, got an F for valuation, a grade unchanged from the last six months. Turning to the Wall Street community, about 47 sell-side analysts surveyed in the last 90 days rated NVDA as a Buy or higher. Meanwhile, another four analysts rated the company as a Hold. Seeking Alpha analysts generally saw the Santa Clara-based company as a Hold. SA Analyst Nicholas Ward endorsed the company as a Buy commenting, \"Nvidia's strong growth potential, particularly in the AI sector, suggests that the stock's rally is not ending anytime soon.\" \"NVDA shares rose by 246% last year\u2026and yet, analysts believe that its EPS is going to rise by 268% once the Q4 results are officially tallied up,\" Ward added.
