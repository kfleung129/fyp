So, let\u2019s analyze what lies ahead for NVIDIA (NVDA) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) in the chip landscape this year. Read on to know more\u2026. Jan 23, 2024 The semiconductor industry\u2019s 2024 outlook appears promising, driven by the recovery in demand, especially in two prominent end markets, PCs and smartphones and numerous technological innovations. Moreover, the heightened attention to the strategic importance of chip manufacturing to national and economic security is a crucial catalyst of the industry\u2019s growth. Amid this backdrop, fundamentally sound chip stock Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSM) seems well-poised to capitalize on the industry\u2019s tailwinds. However, given its mixed prospects, investors could wait for a better entry point in NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA). Semiconductors are a crucial component in multiple applications across end-use sectors, including consumer electronics, automotive, computing, networking and communications, industrial equipment, healthcare, military, and clean energy. In addition, the growing popularity of technologies like AI, machine learning, and IoT will offer growth opportunities to chip companies. In 2023, the semiconductor industry had a challenging year, the seventh downturn since 1990, with sales projected to decline 9.4% (to $520 billion) for the year. However, the industry is well-positioned to rebound in 2024, with global chip sales reaching an impressive $588 billion, indicating a 13% year-over-year growth. The memory sector is a vital driver of this growth. In terms of end markets, both PC and smartphone sales are anticipated to increase by 4% this year, following declines of 14% and 3.5% in 2023, respectively. Returning to growth for these two end-use sectors is very important for the semiconductor industry. As we enter 2024, semiconductor companies will increasingly emphasize on product innovations, targeting developments in generative AI and large language models (LLMs) and boosting demand for high-performance GPUs in data centers and high-performance computing (HPC). According to Deloitte, the market for AI chips appears to be strong in 2024 and is predicted to reach more than $50 billion in sales for the year or 8.5% of the value of all chips to be sold. In the long term, some forecasts suggest that AI chips (mainly gene AI chips) could total $400 billion in sales by 2027. Favorable government initiatives further drive the chip industry\u2019s prospects. In August 2022, President Biden signed the CHIPS Act of 2022 into a law that allocated about $52.70 billion over the next five years to boost domestic manufacturing and research and development (R&D) of semiconductors. 10 STOCKS TO SELL NOW! \u201cResurgent market demand and increased government incentives worldwide are powering an upsurge in fab investments in key chipmaking regions and the projected 6.4% rise in global capacity for 2024,\u201d said Ajit Manocha, SEMI President and CEO. As per SEMI\u2019s latest quarterly World Fab Forecast report, the global semiconductor capacity is projected to rise by 6.4% this year to reach record high 30 million wafers per month (wpm) mark for the first time after increasing 5.5% to 29.6 wpm in 2023.
