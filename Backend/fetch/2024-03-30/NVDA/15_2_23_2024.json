Nvidia added US$277-billion (R5.3-trillion) in stock market value on Thursday, Wall Street\u2019s largest one-day gain in history after the heavyweight chip maker\u2019s quarterly report beat expectations and reignited a rally fuelled by optimism about artificial intelligence. The company\u2019s stock soared 16.4% to close at $785.38, a record-high close, lifting its market capitalisation to $1.96-trillion after its January-quarter report late on Wednesday showed demand for its specialised chips used in AI computing continued to outpace analysts\u2019 already-high expectations. The Santa Clara, California-based company\u2019s results fed new fuel to a global rally in technology stocks linked to AI, propelling the S&P 500, Europe\u2019s Stoxx 600 and Japan\u2019s Nikkei share average to record highs. Traders exchanged $65-billion worth of Nvidia\u2019s shares on Thursday, accounting for almost a fifth all trading in S&P 500 stocks. Nvidia\u2019s one-day increase in stock market value was the largest in Wall Street\u2019s history, easily beating a record $196-billion gain by Meta Platforms on 2 February after the Facebook parent declared its first dividend and posted robust results. The rise in Nvidia\u2019s market value on Thursday eclipsed the entire value of Coca-Cola, at $265-billion. Its gain made Nvidia the US stock market\u2019s third-most valuable company, pulling ahead of Amazon.com and Alphabet after jockeying with the two tech powerhouses in recent weeks. Microsoft and Apple, valued at $3.06-trillion and $2.85-trillion, respectively, are Wall Street\u2019s two most valuable companies. Nvidia\u2019s stock has now climbed 58% in 2024, accounting for more than a quarter of the S&P 500\u2019s increase year-to-date. That makes Nvidia\u2019s outlook crucial not just for direct shareholders, but for owners of index funds widely held in retirement savings accounts. \u201cThe people who made the most money in the gold rush of the mid-1800s were the ones providing the tools to get the job done, not those hunting for the precious metal,\u201d said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. \u201cNvidia is effectively playing the same role today in this tech revolution.\u201d Soaring demand for Nvidia\u2019s chips used by companies rushing to upgrade their AI offerings helped the Silicon Valley firm forecast a whopping 233% growth in current-quarter revenue, above market expectations of a 208% rise. Other chip makers exposed to AI also rallied, with AMD jumping about 11% and Broadcom adding 6.3%. The Philadelphia chip index rallied 4.97% to a record high in its biggest one-day gain since May 2023. The S&P 500 surged 2.11% to a record high, and the Nasdaq jumped nearly 3%, leaving it just short of its first record-high close since November 2021. Nvidia, which controls about 80% of the high-end AI chip market, reported fourth-quarter revenue jump of more than threefold from a year ago to $22.1-billion. Some analysts, however, worried that US curbs on chips sales to China may be hurting its revenue growth. Sales in China amounted to about 9% of Nvidia\u2019s fourth-quarter sales, down from 22% in the prior quarter. Rapid increases in analysts\u2019 financial estimates mean Nvidia\u2019s forward earnings valuation has fallen, even after its stock more than tripled last year. Ahead of Nvidia\u2019s report, it was valued at about 30x expected earnings, down from 49x a year before, according to LSEG data. Still, many investors worry about the rapid pace of Nvidia\u2019s gains. \u201cWe\u2019ve got well ahead of expectations and baked in a lot for the next three years,\u201d said Paul Nolte, senior wealth adviser and market strategist at Murphy & Sylvest. At least 17 brokerages raised their price targets after results. Among the most bullish, Rosenblatt Securities raised its price target to $1 400 from $1 100, implying a $3.5-trillion stock market value. UBS cut its price target to $800 from $850, reflecting \u201csome potential slowing in revenue growth\u201d.\u00a0 \u2014 Noel Randewich, Medha Singh and Amruta Khandekar, (c) 2024 Reuters Get the best South African technology news and analysis delivered to your e-mail inbox every morning.
