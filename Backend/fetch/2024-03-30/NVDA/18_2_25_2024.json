    "text": "Nvidia\u2019s stock price jumped 16 per cent on Thursday, increasing the company\u2019s market value by a staggering $273 billion in just one day, a record amount. The chipmaker has been seeing soaring demand for its semiconductors, which are used to power artificial intelligence, or AI applications. The company\u2019s revenue more than tripled in the latest quarter compared with the same period a year earlier. It\u2019s the latest sign that the excitement surrounding artificial intelligence likely won\u2019t subside anytime soon. Nvidia, which has positioned itself as one of the most prominent players in AI, has been producing some eye-popping numbers. Here\u2019s a look: In all, just 26 of the 500 companies in the S&P 500 have market caps above $273 billion, including Nvidia. Nvidia\u2019s total market value as of the close of trading on Thursday. It recently passed Amazon and Alphabet to become the third most valuable public company, behind Microsoft ($3.051 trillion) and Apple ($2.845 trillion). The company was valued at around $580 billion a year ago. Revenue for the fiscal year ended January 28, more than double Nvidia\u2019s revenue for 2022 and about six times what it was five years ago. Wall Street expects Nvidia\u2019s revenue to top $100 billion in fiscal year 2025. That\u2019s Nvidia\u2019s net margin, or the percentage of revenue that gets turned in profit. Looked at another way, almost 50 cents of every $1 in revenue Nvidia took in last year went to its bottom line. By comparison, Apple\u2019s net margin is 25.3 per cent and Microsoft\u2019s is 34.1 per cent. Both those companies have significantly higher revenue than Nvidia, however.
