    "text": "NVDA delivered a tremendous performance in 2023, which catapulted Nvidia up the list of the world\u2019s largest companies. While the simplest way to get exposure to Nvidia is simply to buy the company\u2019s stock, investors who are looking for a more diversified approach can invest into ETFs with Nvidia stock. In this article, we\u2019ll help you narrow down your search if you are looking for the best ETFs that hold Nvidia. Without further ado, let\u2019s get started with our list of the best ETFs with Nvidia stock. We made sure to feature a diverse range of ETFs that hold NVDA shares, providing options for investors with different risk appetites and outlooks on investing.  ETFs that track the S&P 500 index are fundamental to a strategy of long-term, passive investing, offering broad exposure to the major companies in the United States. This of course also includes Nvidia, ranked as the world's 6th largest company by market capitalization as of January 2024. Among the large variety of S&P 500-focused ETFs available, we chose to highlight the BlackRock iShares S&P 500 ETF. It stands as the world's second-largest ETF, with assets of over $420 billion. With an expense ratio of just 0.03%, it's among the most cost-effective options available. At the time of writing, Nvidia's stock represents the 4th largest investment of the IVV ETF, representing about 2.95% of the fund's total weight.  The Invesco QQQ Trust Series I (QQQ) is the leading ETF tracking the Nasdaq-100 index, which encompasses 101 of the largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange. This ETF has a fairly competitive expense ratio of 0.20%. Unlike the S&P 500, the Nasdaq-100 index is heavily weighted towards technology firms and tends to show greater volatility. While the S&P 500 is often preferred for long-term, passive investing, Nasdaq-100 based ETFs like QQQ present an attractive option for investors bullish on the U.S. technology sector for the long haul. At the time of writing, Nvidia ranks as the 4th largest component in the QQQ ETF, accounting for approximately 4.48% of the fund's total weight. Investing in an ETF like QQQ offers greater exposure to Nvidia compared to an S&P 500 ETF.  Fidelity Growth Opportunities ETF (FGRO) is an actively managed semi-transparent ETF that aims to outperform the Russell 1000 Growth index. The fund selects its investments based on both fundamental analysis as well as broader economic conditions. Semi-transparent ETFs such as FGRO disclose their holdings with a delay. As of the most recent disclosure, Nvidia was the fund\u2019s second largest holding with a weight of 7.86%. FGRO\u2019s largest holding was Microsoft, which represented 10.61% of the fund\u2019s assets. As an actively managed fund, FGRO has a relatively high expense ratio of 0.59%. However, if you\u2019re looking for an actively managed ETF with significant exposure to NVIDIA, it can be an option worth considering.  The VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) is a popular ETF that is designed to track the MVIS US Listed Semiconductor 25 Index. The ETF is significantly invested into Nvidia, as it represents 22.3% of the fund\u2019s holdings at the time of writing. The fund\u2019s second largest holding is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, with a weight of 9.47%. If you\u2019re bullish on the global semiconductor industry and want significant exposure to Nvidia, SMH is a good choice. This ETF has found strong traction with investors, as it has over $13 billion in assets. However, it\u2019s important to keep in mind that the ETF only holds shares in 25 different companies, which means it\u2019s not the strongest in terms of diversification.  While Nvidia has been a strong performer for the past decade, the company\u2019s shares began skyrocketing in late 2022 when the public launch of OpenAI\u2019s Chat GPT chatbot created a surge in interest for artificial intelligence, where Nvidia\u2019s hardware is used heavily. The Global X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence ETF (BOTZ) is an ETF designed to track the Indxx Global Robotics & Artificial Intelligence Thematic index. NVDA is the largest holding of the BOTZ ETF by a considerable amount. At the time of writing, 17.36% of the fund\u2019s $2.4 billion AUM is taken up by NVDA. The second largest holding of the BOTZ ETF is robotics company Intuitive Surgical, with a weight of 10.85%. At 0.69%, BOTZ has a fairly high expense ratio for a passively managed fund. However, it\u2019s still one of the best ways to gain exposure to the cutting-edge technologies of AI and robotics.  T-REX 2X Long NVIDIA Daily Target (NVDX) is a leveraged exchange-traded fund (ETF), presenting a high-risk investment choice for those seeking double the exposure to Nvidia's stock performance. This fund aims to amplify NVDA's daily performance by 200%. Such leveraged ETFs, including NVDX, are not intended for long-term investment strategies but are more appropriate for short-duration trading. This means that even if you are very optimistic about Nvidia's future, investing in a leveraged ETF like NVDX is advisable only if you have a specific short-term trading plan. Although NVDX has a relatively high expense ratio of 1.05%, it can still be a more cost-effective method for obtaining leveraged exposure to Nvidia compared to other alternatives. As you can see, there is a broad range of ETFs that hold Nvidia. Depending on the ETF, the exposure to NVDA can vary significantly, ranging from just over 2% to well over 10%. Ultimately, the choice will depend on how much risk you are willing to take on, and how much you value a highly diversified portfolio.
