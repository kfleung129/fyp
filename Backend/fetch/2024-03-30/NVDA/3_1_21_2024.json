    "text": "Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, the US artificial intelligence chip company, has visited Beijing to attend the company's 2024 Beijing New Year Party, during the senior executive's first trip to the Chinese mainland in several years. People familiar with the matter told China Daily that Huang has also visited offices in Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen in Guangdong province in low-key manners this week. Meanwhile, photos and videos released by people, including Nvidia's employees, on social media platforms show that Huang wore traditional northeastern China clothing to perform a dance for Nvidia's employees during the company' new year party in Shanghai. Huang's trip came as the Wall Street Journal quoted anonymous sources saying that top Chinese cloud firms have told Nvidia they do not want its slower artificial intelligence chips and that they would prefer using homegrown chips from companies such as Huawei amid the US government's restrictions on Nvidia's most advanced AI chips to China.
