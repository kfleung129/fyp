    "text": "After NVIDIA (NVDA.US)\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0  had announced a new generation of GTU called \"Blackwell\", UBS published a research report on this. Since attending several events at NVIDIA's GTC 2024, the broker considered the company is on the cusp of an entirely new wave of demand from global enterprises and sovereigns. UBS expected that there are opportunities for countries to become large customers in the U.S. cloud computing industry, including the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Sweden, Japan, South Korea and Malaysia. The broker envisioned 2025 as a year of solid growth for the company, with revenue forecast to grow 30% to nearly US$150 billion, raising its TP from US$800 to US$1,100 accordingly, and its EPS forecasts for FY2026 and FY2027 (each ending in January) by 8% and 19%, respectively.Concerns about supply of NVIDIA and whether the company can beat street consensus have not subsided, but the broker saw any recent share pullback as an attractive entry point, given the broader development outlook, and rated the company Buy.(Real-time Streaming US Stocks Quote; Except All OTC quotes are at least 15 minutes delayed.)AAStocks Financial News "
