Nvidia\u2019s share price is already up 50% this year and trading at $726.13 U.S. per share. That brings the stock\u2019s 12-month gain to 252%. Options trading activity indicates that Nvidia\u2019s shares could move a further 11% up or down following its quarterly results in coming days, according to data from options analytics service ORATS. Nvidia\u2019s stock has moved an average of 6.7% after its earnings reports over the past three years, ORATS data shows. At the same time, analysts are warning that Nvidia\u2019s earnings could prove to be a make-or-break moment for the U.S. stock market.
