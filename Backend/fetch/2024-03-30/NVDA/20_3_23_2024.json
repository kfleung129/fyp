    "text": "In 2023 and 2024, the rising tide has been lifting generative artificial intelligence boats. Nvidia NVDA is an obvious beneficiary, but SoundHound AI SOUN stock has caught people\u2019s attention. You may have heard about Nvidia\u2019s blowout fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 financial report. Nvidia isn\u2019t the only AI company with impressive revenue growth. For a well-rounded AI market exposure, invest in both Nvidia and SoundHound AI. A Famous Company Invested in SoundHound AI Nvidia is a kingmaker among AI-related businesses, so it speaks volumes if Nvidia invests in an AI company. Prospective shareholders should be interested to know that Nvidia invested $3.7 million in SoundHound AI. Why would Nvidia pour so much money into SoundHound AI? Perhaps Nvidia\u2019s management envisions robust growth for the niche market that SoundHound AI serves. SoundHound AI CEO Keyvan Mohajer recently explained in an interview that, while Nvidia creates the \u201cinfrastructure for AI,\u201d SoundHound \u201cputs that infrastructure to good use. So the synergy is very clear.\u201d This synergy means that there\u2019s room for both Nvidia and SoundHound AI to ride the gen-AI trend higher. SoundHound AI\u2019s specialization is AI-powered voice software, which businesses could use for customer service. This could be a largely untapped, niche market. Mohajer stated that there\u2019s a \u201c$100 billion opportunity\u201d as SoundHound AI\u2019s products enable voice-AI functionality in televisions and other devices, and even automobiles. SoundHound AI\u2019s Revenue Growth Is Undeniable Still, discerning investors don\u2019t just want to see opportunities. They also want to see improvement in the hard data. As it turns out, SoundHound AI has the data to back up the bull case for SOUN stock. Much like Nvidia, SoundHound AI is a revenue grower. Specifically, in the fourth quarter of 2023, SoundHound AI\u2019s revenue increased 80% year over year to $17.1 million. Furthermore, SoundHound AI\u2019s gross margin improved by 6 percentage points YOY to 77%. This capped off an impressive performance for the full year of 2023, in which SoundHound AI\u2019s gross margin increased by 6 percentage points YOY to 75%. While there is still room for SoundHound to improve its fundamentals, its full-year 2023 net earnings loss of 40 cents per share is certainly better than the company\u2019s net loss of 74 cents per share from 2022. SOUN Stock Could Be a Worthy Add-on AI Investment SoundHound AI shares have rapidly gained value this year. The upward momentum could continue throughout 2024 as businesses discover the many use cases for gen-AI voice software. This doesn\u2019t mean investors have to choose SoundHound AI or Nvidia. It\u2019s entirely possible to own both NVDA stock and SOUN stock, even if Nvidia is the better established company. Going forward, you should monitor SoundHound AI\u2019s progress as a notable, Nvidia-backed up-and-comer.
