Nvidia\u2019s valuation has skyrocketed in recent years as tech companies clamor for its AI chips. / Adobe Stock Nvidia has long held the generative AI industry in the palm of its hand; many AI companies rely on the chip manufacturer\u2019s graphics processing units (GPUs) in order to train neural networks, and the company\u2019s valuation has skyrocketed as a result. But some big tech companies, weary of Nvidia\u2019s growing monopoly over such a vital and profitable technology, are stepping up their efforts to create alternative chips, The New York Times reported earlier this week. Amazon, for example \u2013 which announced plans in September to invest as much as $4bn in AI company Anthropic \u2013 has developed the second iteration of its proprietary AI chip, called Trainium. Microsoft and Meta have also unveiled plans to begin developing on their own chips. As the Times article points out, however, Nvidia\u2019s huge head start and momentum in the AI chip industry will make it difficult for other big tech companies to viably compete anytime in the near future. Advertisement In its earnings report for the final quarter of 2023, published on Wednesday, computing giant Microsoft showed that its ongoing investments in AI are bearing fruit \u2013 but also continuing to generate significant costs. \"We\u2019ve moved from talking about AI to applying AI at scale,\" Microsoft chief executive officer Satya Nadella said in a statement. \"By infusing AI across every layer of our tech stack, we\u2019re winning new customers and helping drive new benefits and productivity gains across every sector.\u201d The company's total revenue for Q4 of last year grew by around 18% (compared to the same time period in 2022) to $62b, a figure which slightly exceeded average analyst estimates, Reuters reports. Microsoft chief financial officer Amy Hood also said during a call with investors that the company expects \u201ccapital expenditures to increase materially on a sequential basis driven by investments in our cloud and AI infrastructure.\u201d Microsoft hit a $3t valuation last week and has taken Apple\u2019s place as the company with the highest market cap in the world. Advertisement Following the October signing of the Executive Order on Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence, officials from the Biden White House met on Monday to discuss plans for requiring AI companies to submit results from safety \u2013 or \u201cred-teaming\u201d \u2013 tests, the Associated Press reports. The executive order was based upon the 1950 US Defense Protection Act, which gives the president broad authority to intercede in domestic industry in the face of a national security threat. The executive order mandated that the National Institute of Standards of Technology \u2013 part of the US Department of Commerce \u2013 develop a standard framework for analyzing the safety of AI systems developed by private companies.

The Italian Data Protection Authority, also known as Garante, has determined that ChatGPT-creator OpenAI has breached the European Union\u2019s Global Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) law. The watchdog temporarily banned ChatGPT in Italy in March of last year, based on a determination that OpenAI did not have legal authority to glean personal data to train the large language model behind ChatGPT and also citing concerns about the lack of effective age restrictions on the platform. Garante announced in a statement on Monday that \u201cbased on the outcome of its fact-finding activity\u201d it had concluded that OpenAI had violated \u201cthe provisions contained in the EU GDPR.\u201d The watchdog has given OpenAI a period of 30 days to submit counterarguments. \u201cWe believe our practices align with GDPR and other privacy laws, and we take additional steps to protect people\u2019s data and privacy,\u201d OpenAI said in a statement following this week's announcement from Garante. \u201cWe want our AI to learn about the world, not about private individuals. We actively work to reduce personal data in training our systems like ChatGPT, which also rejects requests for private or sensitive information about people.\u201d WPP, one of the biggest ad gency holding companies in the world, announced a plan during a Capital Markets Day event in London earlier this week to invest more than $316m in AI. \u201cAI is transforming our industry and we see it as an opportunity, not a threat,\u201d said WPP CEO Mark Read. \u201cWe are already empowering our people with AI-based tools to augment their skills, produce work more efficiently and improve media performance, all of which will increase the effectiveness of our work.\u201c Like much of the marketing industry, WPP hit some financial roadblocks in 2023 as tech clients cut back on spending. The holding company hopes that its investments in AI will lead to a more secure footing in the future, but its forecasted revenue growth for 2024 is iimited to 1%. The US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) announced earlier this week that it\u2019s preparing to crack down on automated phone calls that have been created with the use of AI. The news follows an incident from New Hampshire last week in which residents received a call from an AI-generated voice clone of President Biden encouraging them not to vote in the state\u2019s primary election. The state\u2019s attorney general\u2019s office has launched an investigation into the calls. The FCC's ban proposal, which will reportedly be voted upon within the next few weeks, would be part of the 1991 Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA), an amendment to the 1934 Communications Act which, among other things, prohibits the use of an \u201cartificial or prerecorded voice\u201d directed towards residential phones \u201cto deliver a message without the consent of the called party.\u201d For more on the latest happenings in AI, web3 and other cutting-edge technologies, sign up for The Emerging Tech Briefing newsletter. \u00a9 Carnyx Group Ltd 2022 | The Drum is a Registered Trademark and property of Carnyx Group Limited.
