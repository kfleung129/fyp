We began the screen with the 30 companies whose stocks are held within the SOXX portfolio, then added the 30 additional companies in the S&P Composite 1500 Index XX:SP1500 that are in the semiconductor industry, as determined by FactSet, or in the Semiconductors and Semiconductor Equipment Global Industry Classification Standard group. The S&P Composite 1500 is made up of the S&P 500 SPX, the S&P MidCap 400 MID and the S&P SmallCap 600 SML.
