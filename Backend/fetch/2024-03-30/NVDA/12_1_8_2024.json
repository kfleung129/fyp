Published: 21:56 08 Jan 2024 GMT Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares closed at a record level on Monday after the company introduced a new line of graphics processors and software designed to run generative artificial intelligence applications on personal computers. The semiconductor giant\u2019s latest offerings include three models of its GeForce RTX (NYSE:RTX) 40 Super Series desktop graphics processing units. The top-of-the-line GeForce RTX (NYSE:RTX) 4080 Super is capable of generating AI images 1.7 times faster and video 1.5 times faster than the equivalent model from the previous generation of Nvidia technology. The new chips are also optimized for a superior gaming experience, with the ability to power games with ray tracing at 4K resolution. In addition to the hardware, Nvidia has also announced new RTX-accelerated AI software and tools for developers and consumers. These tools are designed to enhance PC experiences with generative AI, offering more realistic gaming, high-definition images enhanced by AI, and improved dialog by in-game characters. The company has emphasized that there are currently 500 applications tuned to work better with AI and Nvidia\u2019s RTX technology. The new graphics cards will be available starting January 31. The GeForce RTX 4080 Super will be offered at $999, while the other GPUs in the series will cost $599 and $799 and be available later this month. Nvidia's latest products are part of a broader industry trend towards \"AI PCs,\" which aim to provide a more secure and responsive AI experience by running AI software on the PCs themselves rather than over the internet. The company is positioning personal computers as a platform for individual use of so-called \"large language models\" and is working with leading manufacturers to introduce a new wave of \"AI-ready\" laptops with the new chips. Nvidia's stock rose as much as 6.4% in New York trading Monday, taking it back above $500 to close at a record high of $522.23. The company's market value has surpassed $1 trillion, making it the most valuable company in the history of the semiconductor industry.
