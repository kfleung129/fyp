    "text": " Artificial intelligence (AI) could transform the economy by performing tasks that humans cannot do and making existing workers more productive. Goldman Sachs believes the technology will add $7 trillion to the global economy over the next decade, while Cathie Wood\u2019s Ark Investment Management estimates that figure at $200 trillion. Investors are rushing to buy AI stocks Nvidia, Microsoft, AlphabetAnd Amazonall of which have increased dramatically in the past year. But other AI stocks aren\u2019t doing so well. C3.ai Share prices have more than doubled in 2023, but remain 82% below all-time highs.  In the same way, Upstart The stock is down 93% from its all-time high.  These cases prove that developing AI alone is not enough: companies must build solid businesses. Separating the AI \u200b\u200bwinners from the losers won\u2019t be easy for investors in the long run, but exchange-traded funds (ETFs) can take away that challenge. Image source: Getty Images. Table of Contents An ETF can contain dozens or even hundreds of individual stocks, neatly packaged into one security for investors to purchase.  They provide exposure to specific market segments (such as AI) and are typically actively managed, meaning a team of professionals will adjust the ETF\u2019s portfolio as necessary. That takes a lot of pressure off individual investors.  And because an ETF can hold so many stocks, one bad performance won\u2019t lead to catastrophic financial losses. There are a number of AI-focused ETFs available to investors, but the Roundhill Generative AI and Technology ETF (NYSEMKT: CHAT) it\u2019s noticable.  It was launched in 2023 and is already beating the benchmark returns S&P500 Table of contents.  Here\u2019s why it\u2019s a buy now. The CHAT ETF invests in companies developing the platforms, infrastructure and software needed to bring AI to life.  The ETF holds 47 different stocks, but the top 10 investments account for 45.5% of the portfolio\u2019s total value. The story continues That top 10 (and the portfolio as a whole) includes some of the most popular names in the AI \u200b\u200bspace: stock CHAT ETF Portfolio Weighting 1. Nvidia 8.36% 2.Microsoft 7.26% 3. Alphabet (Google) 5.55% 4. Metaplatforms 4.25% 5.Adobe 4.03% 6.Salesforce 3.55% 7. Amazon 3.27% 8. Baidu 3.23% 9. Arista Networks 3.10% 10. ServiceNow 2.92% Data source: Roundhill Investments.  Portfolio weightings as of March 24, 2024 and subject to change. Nvidia produces the world\u2019s most powerful graphics processing units (GPUs) for data center infrastructure, designed to handle AI workloads.  The stock rose 239% last year, making it the best performer in the entire S&P 500 index. Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon are home to the world\u2019s largest cloud computing platforms, where millions of companies can access AI models to build their own applications. Adobe uses generative AI to make its leading photo and video editing software even more powerful, and Sales team uses the technology to improve its customer relationship management software for businesses. Several household names are also outside CHAT\u2019s top 10.  They contain Advanced micro devicesthat develops AI chips for the data center and for computing purposes, and Oraclea world-class data center operator for AI developers. Palantir Technologies and C3.ai also appear in the ETF. The CHAT ETF is already up 18.9% through 2024, crushing the S&P 500 index\u2019s 10.3% return.  The ETF launched in May 2023 and has returned 41.7% since its inception, surpassing the S&P 500\u2019s 26.5% return over the same period. It\u2019s no surprise, considering stocks like Nvidia and Metaplatforms have delivered triple-digit percentage gains over the past twelve months.  Stocks such as Microsoft, Salesforce, Amazon, AMD and Service now are also all up better than 50% in the past year. Each of the companies in the CHAT ETF is at the forefront of the AI \u200b\u200brevolution, and given the substantial value this technology could create over the next decade, it should continue to outperform the S&P 500. However, investors should consider concentration risk.  This ETF could plummet if AI doesn\u2019t live up to the hype, as most of the stocks mentioned above would lose a significant portion of their value. The CHAT ETF is a good option for investors looking for a simple way to own AI stocks as part of a diversified portfolio.
