    "text": "Good morning. Who was the best CEO of 2023?\u00a0Fortune used to publish an annual Businessperson of the Year list, but stopped in 2020\u2014a year in which Elon Musk took top prize.\u00a0That frees me to take my own stab this year, which I do here for your Friday enjoyment. I started, as we always do at Fortune, with a screener from data guru Scott DeCarlo, which looked at total returns over the last year and the last three years.\u00a0Then I added a good dollop of my own judgment, based on my understanding of the role that the CEO and the company played in driving important economic events of the year.\u00a0My top five: 1. Jensen Huang, Nvidia2. Satya Nadella, Microsoft3. Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase4. Lars Jorgensen, Novo Nordisk5. Sundar Pichai, Alphabet AI is obviously the big driver here, powering three of the five, and providing huge returns to investors.\u00a0Nvidia offered a stunning 239% return for the year and 280% over three years; Microsoft returned 58% and 73%; and Alphabet returned 58% and 59%.\u00a0I gave Nadella the edge over Pichai because he played the moment beautifully, partnering with OpenAI in a way his predecessors never would have, and rescuing Sam Altman from his board crisis. (I excluded Altman for failing Board Management 101.). Dimon, of course, emerged from the banking crisis of 2023 as the world\u2019s greatest banker\u2014if he hadn\u2019t already earned that title several times before.\u00a0He is, without doubt, the GOAT.\u00a0And Jorgensen rode the other world-changing development of 2023\u2014Ozempic. By the way, Huang topped Fortune\u2019s Business Person of the Year list in 2017\u2014a year in which Dimon took the number two spot\u2014and Nadella topped the list in 2019. \u00a0Those three have staying power. Yale\u2019s Jeff Sonnenfeld highlighted his three favorites in a piece for Fortune yesterday\u2014CVS Health\u2019s Karen Lynch, Intel\u2019s Pat Gelsinger, and Salesforce\u2019s Marc Benioff.\u00a0I am a big fan of all three.\u00a0But while Benioff offered returns on a par with my top five last year, he had a more lackluster three years.\u00a0And while Gelsinger and Lynch are both on admirable world-changing missions, they have a ways to go to show success. A few sentimental favorites worth mentioning:\u00a0ServiceNow CEO William McDermott has something going on that is getting plaudits from customers and employees alike, and also providing an 82% annual return to shareholders.\u00a0Adobe\u2019s Shantanu Narayen remains the sleeper in the tech crowd. And Occidental\u2019s Vicki Hollub is my favorite among the oil majors, proving you can run a great oil company and care about the climate at the same time. Who/what am I missing?\u00a0Send me your thoughts, and I\u2019ll share the best next week.\u00a0Other news below.
