    "text": " NVIDIA\u2019s AI chip supply faces constraints, with insufficient CoWoS advanced packaging production capacity at TSMC potentially being the main issue. According to Economic Daily News, NVIDIA is also providing advanced packaging services to Intel, with a monthly capacity of about 5,000 units. It is expected to join NVIDIA\u2019s advanced packaging supply chain as early as the second quarter in 2024, grabbing a share of TSMC\u2019s related orders. Industry sources cited by the Economic Daily News\u00a0believe that Intel\u2019s participation will help alleviate the tight supply of AI chips. TSMC declined to comment on the rumors on January 30th. As per industry sources cited by Economic Daily News, Intel\u2019s entry into NVIDIA\u2019s advanced packaging supply chain is expected to lead to a significant increase of nearly ten percent in total production capacity. As per\u00a0industry analysis cited in the report, even with Intel joining to provide advanced packaging capacity for NVIDIA, TSMC remains NVIDIA\u2019s primary supplier for advanced packaging. When considering the expanded production capacity of TSMC and other related assembly and testing partners, it is estimated that they will supply approximately 90% of advanced packaging capacity for NVIDIA. Supply chain sources cited by the report further indicate that TSMC is ramping up its advanced packaging production capacity. Production capacity is estimated to increase to nearly 50,000 units in the first quarter of this year, representing a 25% increase from the estimated nearly 40,000 units in December last year. While Intel may potentially provide NVIDIA with nearly 5,000 units of advanced packaging capacity, this accounts for about 10% of the total. However, Intel is reportedly not involved in NVIDIA\u2019s AI chip foundry orders. Intel has advanced packaging capacity in Oregon and New Mexico in the United States and is actively expanding its advanced packaging capabilities in its new facility in Penang. It is noteworthy that Intel previously stated its intention to offer customers the option to only use its advanced packaging solutions, expected to provide customers with greater production flexibility. Industry sources also indicate that the previous shortage of AI chips stemmed from three main factors: insufficient capacity in advanced packaging, tight supply of high-bandwidth memory (HBM3), and some cloud service providers placing duplicate orders. However, these bottlenecks have gradually been resolved, and the improvement rate is better than expected. (Photo credit: Intel) Read more  "
