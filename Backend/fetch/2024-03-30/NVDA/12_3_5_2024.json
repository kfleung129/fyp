Nvidia increased its market share from Q3\u201923, with AMD increasing its market share year over year. Graphics card shipments increased by 6.8% quarter to quarter and 32% year over year. Since Q1 2000, over 2.3 billion AIBs, worth about $482 billion, have been sold. The market shares for the desktop discrete-GPU suppliers shifted in the quarter, as Nvidia\u2019s market share decreased from last quarter by 2%, and AMD\u2019s share increased year over year by 7%. Intel, which entered the AIB market in Q3\u201922 with the Arc A770 and A750, remained flat, as the company has yet to gain significant traction in the add-in board market. Nvidia continues to hold a dominant market share position at 80%. Shipments of desktop CPUs and graphics add-in boards have increased for three quarters in a row. AMD\u2019s quarter-to-quarter total desktop AIB unit shipments increased 17%, while Nvidia\u2019s quarter-to-quarter unit shipments increased 4.7%, contributing to the strong quarter for graphics add-in board shipments. \u201cToday\u2019s AIBs, although seemingly expensive, offer an astonishing amount of computing power to a wide variety of applications from AI to CAD, to gaming, photo/video editing, and visualization. They are a potpourri of processors and dedicated compute engines. And, they run crazy fast and drive huge arrays of high-speed private memory, while driving multiple 4K monitors at 120 Hz or higher. Consumers at all levels intrinsically know this, and maybe can\u2019t express the technical details fully, but can very explicitly tell you if the AIB meets their expectations in price-performance for the applications they care about,\u201d said Jon Peddie, president and founder of Jon Peddie Research. \u201cAnd the answer is\u2014they are pretty damn happy and vote with their dollars. This marks the fourth quarter of increased sales for AIBs, and with the backlog of new games and AI-based applications, it looks like the demand is going to stay fairly high. We are entering a golden age for AIBs, but let\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves and overreact as we did in the past with crypto and Covid.\u201d C. Robert Dow, analyst for Jon Peddie Research, added: \u201cThe graphics add-in board market enjoyed significant growth during Q4 2023. The clear growth during the last three quarters, along with the stabilization in overall graphics add-in board prices, signals a return to seasonality for the market. Early indications for Q1 are that the market is remaining stable. Both Nvidia and AMD released new AIBs in January, and those prices have remained close to the introductory MSRP, which is a good sign for consumers looking to upgrade their systems.\u201d Jon Peddie Research\u2019s AIB report is now available and sells for $3,000.
