    "text": "Nvidia, a tech giant currently valued at over $2.2 trillion, faced near-collapse in 1996 as a result of a failed contract with video game company Sega. CEO and co-founder Jensen Huang admitted to experiencing significant failures and was faced with the challenge of building chips for gaming consoles using an experimental approach that ultimately proved to be technically poor and incompatible with Microsoft\u2019s DirectX software interface. Huang made the difficult decision to confess the mistake to Sega and ask for their understanding and support, which ultimately saved Nvidia from going out of business. Acknowledging the error and asking for help was a rare display of humility for a CEO, but Huang believed it was the best course of action for the company\u2019s survival. By being honest with Sega and agreeing to part ways, Nvidia was able to use the funds from the contract buyout to develop a new chip, the RIVA 128, which supported higher graphic resolutions and became a hit product. This turnaround marked a significant moment for Nvidia, as it demonstrated the power of admitting mistakes and seeking assistance when needed. Huang emphasized the importance of confronting mistakes and seeking help with humility, even for the most successful individuals. He recognized that it can be challenging to admit failure and ask for assistance, especially for those in positions of power and influence. However, he believed that this willingness to address errors and request support was crucial in saving Nvidia from collapse and ultimately leading to its continued success in the tech industry. The experience with the failed Sega contract taught Huang valuable lessons about the importance of being transparent, admitting mistakes, and seeking help when necessary. He shared these insights with graduating students at National Taiwan University, highlighting the significance of humility in leadership and decision-making. By sharing his personal story of overcoming a major setback, Huang offered a valuable lesson in resilience and the power of learning from failures. Nvidia\u2019s success story, driven by Huang\u2019s willingness to admit mistakes and ask for help, serves as a powerful example of the impact humility can have in business and leadership. By choosing to be honest with Sega, Huang was able to secure the company\u2019s future and pave the way for its growth and innovation in the tech industry. This narrative of overcoming challenges through humility and perseverance serves as a source of inspiration and motivation for aspiring entrepreneurs and leaders in navigating the complexities of the business world. In conclusion, Jensen Huang\u2019s experience with the failed Sega contract and the subsequent turnaround for Nvidia underscores the importance of humility, transparency, and resilience in overcoming setbacks and achieving success in the business world. By admitting mistakes and humbly seeking assistance, Huang was able to save Nvidia from collapse and set the stage for its future growth and innovation. This story serves as a powerful reminder of the value of learning from failures, embracing vulnerability, and leveraging support to overcome challenges and achieve long-term success in the tech industry.
