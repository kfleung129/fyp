To say its share price has skyrocketed over the past year is a bit of an understatement. But given investors are piling in to buy Nvidia stock are we seeing the signs of another tech bubble? Or will the stock continue to soar given the unprecedented thirst for AI chips? In this article we\u2019re going to take a deep dive in the performance of Nvidia\u2019s share price over the past year or so, and discuss how investors can capitalise on the AI boom. Click on a link to head straight to a specific section, or scroll down for all of the details\u2026 Founded in 1993, Nvidia made its name designing and manufacturing graphics processing units (GPU) for the gaming industry after traditional computer processing units were becoming increasingly insufficient . Since then company has expanded into the artificial intelligence (AI) field and has enjoyed stupendous success. Today Nvidia is the world\u2019s leading maker of AI chips with its hardware accounting for roughly 95% of applications in the machine learning sphere. ChatGPT, for example, was trained on 10,000 of Nvidia\u2019s chips. Not only is demand for Nvidia chips red hot right now but thanks to a lack of competition, the firm is also making a massive profit on each chip it sells. Rumour has it that Nvidia makes a 800+% profit on each H100 GPU chip it churns out (assuming a \u2018street value\u2019 of around $25,000 to $30,00). Despite Nvidia\u2019s rapid rise to fame, the Californian-based firm didn\u2019t enter the world of AI on a whim. The company had its eye on the sector way back in 2014, with Nvidia\u2019s CEO at the time describing AI as\u201cone of the most exciting applications in high-performance computing\u201d. Clearly he was right, and Nvidia\u2019s gamble has well and truly paid off. Nowadays Nvidia looks pretty much unstoppable thanks to its complete domination of the AI chip market and this is why some analysts are comparing the firm\u2019s extraordinary rise to the likes of Google in the late 1990s, and Apple in the 2000s. Whatever your thoughts on the hype surrounding Nvidia right now, nobody can escape the fact the chipmaker\u2019s value recently surpassed $2,000,000,000,000. That\u2019s two TRILLION dollars (\u00a31.55tn). This is a remarkable valuation, especially when you consider Nvidia was worth less than half of that a year ago. To put Nvidia\u2019s soaring value into in perspective, if you had a time machine and went back to 2019, a single Nvidia share would\u2019ve set you back just $37 USD.\u00a0 Today one Nvidia share costs $919 (at the time of writing on Friday 8 March 2024), which equates to rise of 383.78% in five years. Over the past 12months Nvidia\u2019s share price is up almost 300%, and up 90% year-to-date. Here at Money Magpie, we can\u2019t tell you whether now is a good time to buy Nvidia shares, or whether it would be wiser to sit tight and wait until the next dip. That\u2019s because when it comes to investing, it\u2019s extremely difficult to accurately predict the direction of a stock, especially in the short-term. Just because a stock has soared in value doesn\u2019t mean it will continue soaring. On a similar note, if a stock has just plummeted in value then it\u2019s just as likely to continue falling as it is to rebound So, while we can\u2019t tell you whether the direction Nvidia stock is heading, what we can do is give you 3 reasons why you should, and 3 reasons why you shouldn\u2019t, load up on Nvidia stock right now\u2026 Here are 3 reasons why investors may be tempted to gain exposure to Nvidia: Now we\u2019ve given you some reasons to invest in Nvidia, here are 3 reasons why you shouldn\u2019t: So, while Nvidia is dominating the AI chip market right now, there is no guarantee it will stay in Number 1 spot and if it doesn\u2019t, the value of stock could easily plummet. If you\u2019re interested in gaining exposure to AI there are essentially two ways to go about it. If you\u2019re looking to invest in individual companies, then buying shares directly through an investment broker is the way to do it. Note: If your chosen AI stock is US-based, then there are a few things you need to know \u2013 see how to buy US shares in the UK. If you don\u2019t particularly want to invest in a single firm, then buying an AI exchange-traded fund (ETF) can provide an effective and low-cost way to gain exposure to lots of AI stocks at once. Some examples of ETFs focusing on AI include the WisdomTree Artificial Intelligence UCITS ETF, and the L&G Artificial Intelligence UCITS ETF.
