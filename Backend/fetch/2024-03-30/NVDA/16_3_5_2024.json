    "text": "The generative artificial intelligence (AI) trade can\u2019t seem to slow down. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) continues to do most of the heavy lifting for the semiconductor industry and the broader tech sector. Undoubtedly, the days of the Magnificent Seven may be coming to an end as the performance of its constituents begins to vary by a widening margin. In any case, I think there\u2019s no doubt that Nvidia was the most magnificent of the batch. And it may very well continue its magnificent run until it\u2019s left in a league of its own. Who knows? By year\u2019s end, we may be left with the Magnificent One (NVDA stock) as all that remains of Jim Cramer\u2019s famed Magnificent Seven. In this piece, we\u2019ll concentrate on some of the less-loved AI stocks that could outpace Nvidia stock in the latter 10 months of 2024. Undoubtedly, the following AI stocks to buy are moving into year\u2019s end with a lower bar and perhaps a greater means to surprise to the upside in coming quarters. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW) stock suffered quite the meltdown following the release of its latest quarterly results and a rough sales outlook. Though the numbers weren\u2019t abysmal, investors had some pretty high hopes that the firm could not meet. Additionally, the sudden CEO change was not on the radar of such hopeful investors. As you may know, few things rattle investors quite like uncertainty and surprises. With Frank Slootman out and Sridhar Ramaswamy \u2014 an AI technologist who\u2019s been at Snowflake for less than a year \u2014 in, questions linger as to where the company heads from here and if it\u2019s still the growth juggernaut it once was. Indeed, leadership changes bring forth a haze of uncertainty. And perhaps the most significant source of investor disappointment was Slootman stepping away from the post. Recent volatility suggests some investors aren\u2019t willing to stay aboard the Snowflake ship with a new captain. After shedding nearly 5% on Monday, adding to the recent ~20% post-quarter flop, Snowflake seems to have some freshly lowered expectations baked in. If Ramaswamy can prove he\u2019s the right person for the job (his extensive AI background is a huge overlooked plus), perhaps SNOW could be able to outrun NVDA stock from here. Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) is another software company that could give Nvidia a run for its money as it looks to double down on generative AI. CEO Marc Benioff has been incredibly vocal about AI\u2019s potential and the firm\u2019s role in the so-called fourth industrial revolution for many years. Despite reporting lukewarm quarterly earnings alongside softer sales guidance (9% growth on the high-end), the stock proceeded to march higher in the following sessions. Over the past week, shares are up around 5%, helping CRM stock break to new highs past $308. With the announcement of its first-ever dividend, it seems like Salesforce is a cloud king experiencing a coming of age. Sure, the best growth days may be over. But with a new dividend and the means to increase margins, Salesforce may very well be a blue chip that could continue to surprise us all. Either way, I view the outlook as too conservative. And with that, I expect rising over the bar won\u2019t be nearly as difficult as it would be for the likes of Nvidia. Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK) has been sailing through some turbulent tides in the architecture, engineering and construction scene of late. With major advancements in the field of generative AI, it seems like AutoDesk will need to harness the power of AI or run the risk of being disrupted. Thus far, it looks like AI is going to be a tailwind for the firm as it gives its computer-aided design tools a shot in the arm. Though the company\u2019s fourth-quarter numbers (revenue rose 9%) were encouraging, I believe generative AI innovations could be key to a potential year-end breakout for ADSK stock. Autodesk\u2019s AI design tools can save users money while making them more productive. In short, such tools represent a catalyst that can help the firm navigate through what remains of macro headwinds. At 33.3 times forward price-to-earnings, ADSK stock is a low price for what I consider to be one of the market\u2019s generative AI underdogs.
