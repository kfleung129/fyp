    "text": "(Bloomberg) -- A surprise endorsement from Nvidia Corp. may have excited some investors over the prospects for Samsung Electronics Co. to catch up in the artificial intelligence race, but others remain unconvinced.

While Jensen Huang seems to have indicated that Nvidia will buy some HBM chips from Samsung as well, SK Hynix has gotten a big jumpstart by supplying previous generations of the technology. \u201cIt\u2019s true that Samsung Electronics has become more attractive than in the past,\u201d said Yoon Joonwon, a fund manager at DS Asset Management Co. \u201cBut it\u2019s too early to buy it on expectations for its HBM business.\u201d Read More: Samsung Jumps Most in Six Months After Nvidia CEO\u2019s Backing The AI theme has been more of a boon for SK Hynix so far, with its shares roughly doubling over the past year, outpacing Samsung\u2019s 30% gain. The difference lies in SK Hynix\u2019s lead in HBM chips, which work alongside processors crucial for the training of large language models. Samsung is more exposed to the cyclical demand and pricing of commoditized traditional memory, given its market share in consumer devices. That\u2019s why it was a surprise when Huang reportedly said he plans to buy Samsung memory too. His comments helped boost shares of South Korea\u2019s most valuable company to a 9% weekly gain, their biggest in more than three years. Options traders have been more ambivalent. Bets on both directions soared this week for Samsung, including puts wagering on a 70% drop in the next three months and calls that will cash in if the stock surges 300% in the same time span. Day traders took a contrarian stance on the Huang boost. While institutional investors poured cash into Samsung shares Wednesday and Thursday, retail traders sold 3 trillion won ($2.3 billion) worth of the stock on a net basis, a record two-day withdrawal. \u201cMajority opinion is still that Samsung won\u2019t be getting the call on HBM3E from Nvidia,\u201d said Cha So-yoon, a fund manager and equity team head at BNK Asset Management Co. \u201cIf there is a turnaround in tech sentiment, it will be great for both companies but SK Hynix doesn\u2019t appear to be losing its HBM hegemony.\u201d --With assistance from Jeanny Yu.
