    "text": "The AI Boom already arrived. That was made abundantly clear last month when the world\u2019s leading maker of AI chips \u2013 Nvidia (NVDA) \u2013 reported that its revenues grew more than 260% in the last quarter of 2023 and management said that revenues are set to rise another 230% during this quarter. But, while the mainstream media and most investors are obsessing over the hyperbolic growth happening at Nvidia right now, the most important players in this industry \u2013 including Nvidia itself \u2013 have moved on to the next big thing: AI 2.0. AI 2.0 is something we\u2019ve been following for a while now. We\u2019ve long felt that it will be the next frontier of AI development and the next wave of major AI growth. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips But it is just now hitting its major inflection point. As of last month, we learned that Nvidia itself is betting big on AI 2.0. They aren\u2019t alone. Microsoft (MSFT) \u2013 the world\u2019s largest AI company \u2013 is betting big on AI 2.0, too. So is OpenAI, the world\u2019s most influential AI startup. And Amazon (AMZN), Tesla (TSLA), Samsung and the world\u2019s richest men, Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos. All of them are pouring millions of dollars into AI 2.0. The next wave of AI has arrived. It is time for you to join these powerful people and bet on AI 2.0 alongside them. So what exactly is AI 2.0? AI 2.0 is the real-world manifestation of AI technologies through humanoid robots. Yes, I\u2019m talking about AI-powered robots like the ones you\u2019ve seen in science fiction movies such as iRobot. Source: Designer GPT It seems like a \u201cpie-in-the-sky\u201d dream that humanoid robots are actually the next wave of AI. But they are. And that wave has already arrived. Tesla is developing a humanoid robot right now called Optimus that can already fold clothes, make eggs, exercise, and dance. The ultimate goal for these robots is for commercial use, but also for manufacturing, warehousing and retail use as well. Say goodbye to labor shortage issues. So what, you might be saying? Tesla sees a world in the not-too-distant future where hundreds of thousands of these robots are everywhere, helping people all across the globe complete menial tasks like cooking, cleaning, organizing, and more. Elon Musk is even on record saying that Optimus could be bigger than Tesla\u2019s core vehicle business over time. He\u2019s not delusional. Or, if he is, then so is Jeff Bezos. The former Amazon founder and CEO is reportedly pouring $100 million through his venture fund into a humanoid robot startup called FigureAI. He clearly sees a bright future for humanoid robots, too. Again, though, he and Musk aren\u2019t alone. Guess who else is investing in FigureAI? Bezos\u2019 old company, Amazon. They\u2019re pouring $50 million into FigureAI. Microsoft is investing in OpenAI, too. They\u2019re committing $95 million to FigureAI. Nvidia is involved, too, with a $50 million investment into FigureAI. So is OpenAI. The ChatGPT creator is already the biggest investor in FigureAI and they\u2019re throwing another $5 million into the firm alongside Microsoft and Nvidia. Intel and Samsung are also reportedly throwing money into FigureAI right now. Folks \u2013 the writing is on the wall. You may think of AI-powered humanoid robots as a science fiction concept. But the world\u2019s most powerful companies and people, and the world\u2019s foremost AI innovators, clearly think humanoid robots are the next frontier of AI. They see them as AI 2.0. And they\u2019re dedicating millions of dollars to build AI 2.0 right now. This is the next evolution of the AI Boom. It is happening right now. You need to grab your slice of the pie.
