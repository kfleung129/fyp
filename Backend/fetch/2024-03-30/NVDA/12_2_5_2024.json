    "text": " Just because NVDA stock hit record highs, doesn't mean there won't be a bullish surprise Advertisement Source: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com After last year\u2019s powerful rally, is our Nvidia\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) stock\u00a0forecast flipping from bullish to bearish? No way! If you feel like you \u201cmissed out,\u201d don\u2019t fret. Instead, get in the winner\u2019s circle as the demand for Nvidia\u2019s\u00a0artificial intelligence compatible chips won\u2019t likely subside anytime soon. Maybe you\u2019re worried that Nvidia stock will crash after last year\u2019s epic rally, like technology stocks did in the year 2000. In response to that concern, we can quote Yardeni Research President Ed Yardeni. \u201cIt\u2019s possible. If so, then it has a lot more upside before it crashes \u2014 if it crashes.\u201d Rather than worrying about a potential crash, analyze Nvidia\u2019s appeal and reasons for its success. Nvidia\u00a0has another opportunity to shine on Feb. 21 when the company reports its quarterly earnings results. Without a doubt, the perma-bears hope that NVDA stock crashes and burns on that day. That\u2019s unlikely to happen. We don\u2019t have the quarterly results from Nvidia yet, but we have them from Big Tech giants like Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). These and other technology firms affirmed their commitment to investing in artificial intelligence (AI) technology. This helps to explain why NVDA stock rallied after these other companies reported their quarterly earnings. Even when it wasn\u2019t Nvidia\u2019s time to shine, the market understood that if Big Tech businesses demand AI-compatible processors, that\u2019s massively bullish for Nvidia. Bank of America Global Research analyst Vivek Arya elaborated on this point, writing, \u201cResults from top U.S. cloud customers suggest solid motivation for spending in genAI.\u201d Global X analyst Mayuranki De also seemed to support this line of thought. De observed that Meta Platforms\u2019 \u201ccommitment to AI\u2026 includes billions in Nvidia chips to build a strong compute infrastructure for AI development.\u201d Really, you don\u2019t have to wait until Nvidia reports its quarterly earnings results if you want to invest in the company for the long term. The aforementioned Big Tech companies will probably continue to demand Nvidia\u2019s AI-enabled chips for years to come. Besides, CEO Jensen Huang expects AI-chip demand to increase internationally as nations invest in their own \u201csovereign AI capabilities.\u201d Speaking of international affairs, it\u2019s well known that the U.S. has restricted certain AI-chip exports to China. Nvidia has a brilliant workaround solution to these restrictions, however. The solution is Nvidia\u2019s H20 graphics card, which the company designed specifically for the Chinese chip market. Granted, the H20 won\u2019t be as powerful as Nvidia\u2019s flagship H100 AI chip. Yet, having less computing power what will allow Nvidia to export the H20 to China. Just consider the potential for revenue generation here. Reportedly, the H20 graphics card will cost $12,000 to $15,000 apiece. So, don\u2019t worry about whether Nvidia will dominate China\u2019s AI chip market\u00a0or not. The H20 graphics card doesn\u2019t have to be a number-one blockbuster seller in order to be a major moneymaker for Nvidia in 2024. Some critics will always find excuses to stay out of a perfectly valid trade. They were wrong about Nvidia stock in 2023 and missed out on terrific buying opportunities. They\u2019ll surely continue to be stubborn this year despite all of the evidence of Nvidia\u2019s AI-chip market prowess.\u00a0Thus, our NVDA stock forecast calls for probable gains in 2024, and the stock absolutely deserves a confident \u201cA\u201d grade.
