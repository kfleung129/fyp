Synopsys (SNPS) provides technology including testing, chip design and software security for the semiconductor industry. It partners with specialty-chip maker, Nvidia (NVDA), a leader in artificial intelligence technology. Synopsys uses AI in its electronic design automation used in data analytics. It collaborates with chip and AI leaders Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Intel (INTC) and Microsoft (MSFT) on design, verification, testing and manufacturing. \"AMD is very excited about the opportunities we see to provide our design teams with generative AI capabilities that will enable them to more efficiently deliver multiple generations of leadership products,\" said Mydung Pham, vice president of Silicon Design Engineering at AMD. On, Jan. 16, Synopsys announced it will acquire engineering simulation software designer Ansys (ANSS) for about $35 billion. The Ansys purchase is expected to increases Synopsys' footprint in the chip, automobile and aircraft industries. Synopsys holds the No. 1 spot out of 12 stocks in the computer software-design group. The group rose to No. 42 out of the 197 IBD industry groups from No. 101 four weeks ago. Synopsys stock kept Friday's momentum going and rose in early trading Monday morning.
