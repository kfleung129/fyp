    "text": "Today we're going to take a look at the well-established NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). The company's stock led the NASDAQGS gainers with a relatively large price hike in the past couple of weeks. The company is now trading at yearly-high levels following the recent surge in its share price. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock\u2019s share price. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let\u2019s examine NVIDIA\u2019s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there\u2019s still a bargain opportunity. View our latest analysis for NVIDIA NVIDIA appears to be overvalued by 35% at the moment, based on our discounted cash flow valuation. The stock is currently priced at US$495 on the market compared to our intrinsic value of $367.26. This means that the buying opportunity has probably disappeared for now. But, is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Given that NVIDIA\u2019s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility. Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it\u2019s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to more than double over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for NVIDIA. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation. Are you a shareholder? NVDA\u2019s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading above its fair value. However, this brings up another question \u2013 is now the right time to sell? If you believe NVDA should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards its real value can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed. Are you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping tabs on NVDA for some time, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its true value, which means there\u2019s no upside from mispricing. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for NVDA, which means it\u2019s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop. In light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved.
