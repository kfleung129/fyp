    "text": "STORY: Data center operator Equinix and Nvidia are offering the chip firm's supercomputing systems to corporate clients Many large businesses have shown interest in owning AI computing systems for security and privacy The new service will make it easier for them to do so, giving firms better control over their data instead of renting out Nvidia's chips from cloud computing providers like Amazon or Microsoft Under the deal, Nvidia has trained Equinix staff in how to build and run its systems Corporate customers will purchase Nvidia systems, but pay Equinix to build and run them while still keeping ownership "
