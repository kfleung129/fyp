    "text": "Nvidia Corp, recognized for its leading role in the AI industry, has witnessed its stock value rise above $800. The company's technological expertise is highlighted through its partnership with Meta to develop what is claimed to be the 'world's fastest AI supercomputer.' This collaboration is a significant endorsement of Nvidia's advanced technology and its pivotal role in shaping the future of technology. On the other hand, Aswath Damodaran, a professor at New York University, has voiced caution about Nvidia's long-term investment potential. He highlighted the company's current high pricing and stressed the need to scrutinize the long-term upside. This viewpoint stands in contrast to other opinions in the financial sector.
