Tech peers Amazon (AMZN) and Intel (INTC) each advanced 0.4%. Nike (NKE) fell 7% after the company forecast sales would decline slightly in the first half of its 2025 fiscal year, overshadowing a fiscal 2024 third-quarter earnings beat. Financial stocks slipped, led by Visa (V), down 2.3%, and Goldman Sachs (GS), down 1.7%.

Nvidia-Backed SoundHound AI Tumbled This Week on Short-Selling Report, Downgrade Shares in SoundHound AI Inc. (SOUN) shot up after Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) disclosed a stake in the AI voice solutions provider last month, but the past few days have been less than stellar for the company. Its volatile shares are down about 33% this week following a short seller\u2019s report on Tuesday, then a reported downgrade of the stock to \"underweight\" from \"overweight\" by Cantor Fitzgerald analysts on Wednesday. A short-selling report issued by Capybara Research titled \"Lies, Damned Lies, and Cheeseburger 'AI'\"\u00a0alleges that SoundHound AI is a \"failing company peddling lies and deception.\" \u201cAfter 18 years of losses, and multiple pivots, the company still has no clear path to profitability,\u201d the short sellers allege, saying they \"believe that SoundHound is worth $1.00 per share or less,\" well below its price Friday afternoon around $6 a share. A spokesman for SoundHound wasn't immediately available to comment on the Capybara Research report on Friday. Shares of SoundHound were off about 10% at $6.03 a share shortly before markets closed Friday. -Nisha Gopalan Nvidia, Alphabet Lead Nasdaq on Analyst Love Tech giants Nvidia (NVDA) and Alphabet (GOOGL) were among the S&P 500\u2019s best-performing stocks on Friday after analysts expressed confidence both companies have benefits left to reap from AI investment. UBS analysts on Friday raised their price target on Nvidia stock to $1,100, a 38% increase from their prior target and more than 15% above its price on Friday. Analysts said the company \u201csits on the cusp of an entirely new wave of demand from global enterprises and sovereigns.\u201d Analysts suggest that investment in artificial intelligence by national governments, including those of Japan, South Korea, and Sweden, could each deliver the company as much business as a large U.S. cloud customer. Meanwhile, Wedbush analysts on Friday added Google parent Alphabet to their \u201cBest Ideas List\u201d and raised their price target to $175 from $160. \"We think Google benefits from structural search and generative-AI advantages that insulate the company from competitors and potential shifts to conversational chatbots,\" analysts wrote. The company\u2019s stock has lagged those of its mega-cap peers Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN) this year, in part due to a disappointing earnings report and controversy around images generated by its Gemini AI model. \"While longer-term debates related to generative AI persist, we think the setup has become more attractive in recent weeks with a reversal in sentiment emerging,\u201d said Wedbush. Sentiment got a boost earlier this week, they say, from reports Google was in talks to license Gemini to Apple (AAPL) for use in future operating systems. Nvidia shares were up 2.6% at $938.50 late in the session on Friday, putting the stock on track to close at a record high. Alphabet shares gained 2.1% to trade at $150.74. Tesla Shares Slide as EV Maker Reportedly Scales Back Production in China Tesla (TSLA) shares fell in intraday trading Friday following a report that the company has slowed production at its facility in Shanghai, China. Production at Tesla's Shanghai facility, where the electric vehicle (EV) maker produces its Model Y and Model 3 vehicles, has been scaled back to operating five days a week from the prior schedule of six and a half days a week, Bloomberg reported. The EV maker reportedly told workers and suppliers to expect certain production limits to last through April. Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The move to reduce production comes amid growth concerns as the EV market has cooled and as Tesla faces rising competition. Analysts at Wells Fargo (WFC) and UBS (UBS) downgraded Tesla's stock last week, with UBS analysts calling it a \"growth company with no growth.\" Tesla shares were down about 1.5% at $170.26 Friday afternoon. The company has had a rough start to the year, with its stock price down more than 30% so far in 2024. -Aaron McDade Reddit Slips on Second Day; Astera Labs Continues Its Run Reddit (RDDT) shares fell on Friday, their second day of trading, after surging nearly 50% in the first social media IPO since 2019. Reddit soared yesterday, rising as high as $57.80 per share, well ahead of the $34 IPO price the company set on Wednesday. Share gave up some gains, but still closed at $50.44.\u00a0On Friday afternoon, they were trading 5.5% lower at $47.65. Reddit was the second new issue to surge on its first day of trading this week. Astera Labs (ALAB) surged 72% on Wednesday and has continued to rise above its $36 IPO price. On Friday, the stock was up about 4% at nearly $67. The debuts could breathe new life into the IPO market, which effectively froze in 2022 and 2023 as interest rates rose and appetite for new offerings remained muted. Nike Stock Falls Despite Earnings Beat as Retailer Issues Weak Sales Guidance Nike (NKE) stock fell nearly 6% in after-hours trading Thursday as the athletic apparel company provided a sluggish outlook for revenue that offset a better-than-expected quarterly earnings report. Shares initially surged after Nike said that revenue in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 inched up to $12.43 billion while earnings per share came in at 77 cents, both surpassing the consensus view of analysts. During the company's earnings call, Chief Financial Officer Matthew Friend reiterated the expectation that full-year fiscal 2024 revenue will be up about 1%. However, he said the company projects a low single digit decline in revenue in the first half of fiscal 2025. \"(T)his reflects near-term headwinds from lifecycle management of our key product franchises, more than offsetting the scaling of new products, as we shift our product portfolio toward newness and innovation,\" Friend said. \"This also continues to reflect the subdued macro outlook around the world.\" Nike shares fell 7.6% to $93.16 Friday afternoon, hitting their lowest levels since last September. -Aaron McDade and Stephen Wisnefski FedEx Stock Surges as Earnings Get a Boost From Cost-Cutting Efforts FedEx (FDX) shares soared Friday morning after the logistics company reported quarterly earnings that topped analysts' expectations, as ongoing cost-cutting efforts gave a boost to the bottom line. The shipping giant late Thursday posted adjusted net income of $966 million and diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $3.86 for the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Both numbers were higher than the year-earlier quarter and well ahead of estimates compiled by Visible Alpha. FedEx said that its efforts to trim costs and improve efficiency helped offset a decline in revenue, which fell to $21.7 billion from $22.2 billion in the year-earlier quarter. Revenue has decreased year-over-year for several consecutive quarters as FedEx has struggled to maintain the level of demand for its services that hit all-time highs during the pandemic. FedEx said it is reducing its planned capital spending for full-year fiscal 2024 to $5.4 billion, compared with the previously announced $5.7 billion. The company sees permanent cost reductions related to the DRIVE program\u2014the cost-cutting program it announced almost a year ago\u2014of $1.8 billion in 2024. FedEx shares were up 7.7% at $286 midday Friday, after rising as high as $291.27 earlier in the day. The stock is trading at its highest levels since mid-2021. -Aaron McDade DWAC Stock Slips as Shareholders Approve Trump Merger Shares of Digital World Acquisition Corp. (DWAC) fell on Friday after shareholders approved the blank check company\u2019s merger with Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), the parent company of Donald Trump\u2019s social media platform, Truth Social. TMTG could begin trading under the ticker \u201cDJT,\u201d which stands for Donald J. Trump, as early as next week. It has been a long and winding road to Friday\u2019s vote. The merger was first announced more than two years ago, but has been delayed amid regulators' investigations of DWAC and Trump\u2019s business. Donald Trump, who is embroiled in several high-profile court cases and racking up hundreds of millions of dollars in legal expenses and penalties, is set to own more than 50% of the business. That stake would be worth more than $3 billion at DWAC\u2019s current valuation. Under the terms of the merger agreement, he is required to hold onto those shares for a 6-month lock-up period. But it\u2019s possible he could be relieved of that obligation by the new company\u2019s board. DWAC shares were up about 10% ahead of the vote on Friday. They tumbled after the approval and traded about 4% lower late in the morning. Stocks Making the Biggest Moves Premarket Gains: Losses: Stock Futures Slip After Two-Day Rally Futures contracts connected to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were less than 0.1% lower in premarket trading. S&P 500 futures were down a little more than 0.1%. Nasdaq 100 futures traded 0.3% lower about an hour before markets opened.
