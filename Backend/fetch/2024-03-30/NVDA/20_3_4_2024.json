Three weeks after surpassing Google\u2019s parent company Alphabet to become the fourth most valuable company in the world, NVIDIA has now overtaken Saudi Aramco in market value. This makes the AI chipmaker the third most valuable company in the world and in the United States, trailing only behind Apple Inc. and Microsoft Corp. At the close of Friday\u2019s trading session, NVIDIA\u2019s market capitalization stood at $2.06 trillion, marking its inaugural venture above the $2 trillion threshold. Meanwhile, Saudi Aramco experienced a decline in value, settling at $2.03 trillion, as per data gathered by Bloomberg. There are only four companies in the world with a market value above $2 trillion and NVIDIA has joined their ranks. Meanwhile, there\u2019s only one company whose value is above $3 trillion, and that\u2019s Microsoft. But the intense surge in NVIDIA\u2019s share price has solidified the chip maker\u2019s dominance in the high-end AI chip market, where it captures around 80 percent of the market share. The driving force behind NVIDIA\u2019s meteoric rise lies in the unprecedented demand for its AI chips, which power data centers for complex tasks essential in AI applications. The demand for NVIDIA\u2019s H100 accelerators remains robust, particularly from major clients like Microsoft and Meta Platforms, as Wall Street foresees sustained growth for the company. NVIDIA\u2019s top-tier GPU lineup, featuring the Turing and Ampere series, is like the superhero of graphics cards, delivering unmatched performance and versatility that\u2019s driving breakthroughs left and right across different fields. But NVIDIA isn\u2019t just about killer hardware. They\u2019ve built a bustling ecosystem around their GPUs, teaming up with developers and industry pals to fine-tune AI algorithms for their gear. And let\u2019s not forget their savvy acquisitions, like nabbing Mellanox Technologies and ARM Holdings, which have boosted NVIDIA\u2019s abilities and put them front and center in the AI revolution. While its share shot up mainly because of its lineup of impressive inventory, the company\u2019s CEO, Jensen Huang is also investing in other AI companies. The companies are: chip designer Arm Holdings, medical AI company Nano-X Imaging, Recursion Pharmaceuticals which uses AI to find new drugs, a self-driving truck company Tusimple Holdings and developer of AI voice recognition SoundHound AI, reported The Motley Fool blog. Nvidia put the most money into Arm Holdings, but SoundHound AI\u2019s stock is doing the best. It\u2019s gone up 180 percent this year, making it worth $1.5 billion. "
