He said CEOs should have the most direct reports, in an interview with Stanford GSB. \"I don't believe in a culture, in an environment, where the information you possess is why you have power,\" he said. Nvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang, doesn't believe in gatekeeping. Huang, who oversees 50 direct reports, said that \"by definition,\" CEOs should have the most direct reports of anyone at a company. He made the comment during an interview with Stanford's Graduate School of Business on Tuesday. Huang's rationale is that those who report to the CEO (theoretically) require the least amount of oversight, so CEOs have more bandwidth than other managers. And taking on more direct reports could help CEOs level the playing field, too. According to Huang, the more people a CEO directly communicates with, the less likely an employee's stance at a company will be determined by their access to critical information. \"I don't believe in a culture, in an environment, where the information you possess is the reason why you have power,\" he said. In Huang's view, the role of the managers is not to broker power between workers but to collectively motivate the company's workforce. \"Our position at the company should have something to do with our ability to reason through complicated things, lead other people to achieve greatness, inspire, empower other people, support other people,\" he said. \"Those are the reasons why the management team exists, in service of all the other people that work at the company.\" The AI chipmaker has captured headlines since it announced its blockbuster earnings for the fourth quarter of 2023 late last month. And while Huang manages more people than other big-name CEOs (Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has 16 direct reports), Nvidia has close to 30,000 employees, according to a company report from 2023. So, Huang is only overseeing a small fraction of Nvidia's employees. While Huang might be an outlier (and overachiever) as a manager, the number of direct reports CEOs are taking on is on the rise. CEOs' direct reports doubled from five in the mid-1980s to close to 10 in the mid-2000s, according to the Harvard Business Review. That's a pretty optimal number. Hal Gregersen, formerly the executive director of the MIT Leadership Center, previously told BI the ideal number of direct reports \u2014 whether you're a CEO or lower-level manager \u2014 is between six and twelve.

That's despite the growing concerns Washington has expressed about an anticipated Israeli military offensive in Rafah, where more than a million displaced Palestinians are sheltering.Some members of President Joe Biden's party are calling for him to cut U.S. military aid. The new arms packages include more than 1,800 MK84 2,000-pound bombs and 500 MK82 500-pound bombs, said the sources, who on Friday (March 29) confirmed a report in the Washington Post.Israel faces strong international criticism over its bombing campaign and ground offensive in Gaza, which had killed at least 32,700 people as of Saturday (March 30), according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run enclave.The decision on weapons follows a visit to Washington by Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant this week when he discussed Israel's weapons requirements with U.S. counterparts.Washington gives $3.8 billion in annual military assistance to its longtime ally Israel, which is the leading recipient of U.S. foreign aid.It has been sending air defenses and munitions, demonstrating how Biden's administration continues to support Israel ... despite an increasingly public rift with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.Some Democrats and Arab American groups have criticized that support and say it gives Israel a sense of impunity.Biden on Friday acknowledged, quote, \"the pain being felt\" by many Arab Americans over the war in Gaza and U.S. support for Israel and its military offensive, which was launched after Hamas attacked southern Israel on October 7, killing 1,200 people.The White House declined comment on the weapons transfers, and the Israeli embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
