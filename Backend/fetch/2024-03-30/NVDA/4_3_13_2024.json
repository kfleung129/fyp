Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA Corporation NVDA, Meta Platforms, Inc. META, Atmos Energy Corporation ATO, Consolidated Water Co. Ltd. CWCO and Toll Brothers, Inc. TOL. Here are highlights from Tuesday\u2019s Analyst Blog: Fed Chair Jerome Powell always emphasized that interest rate cuts later this year will be fitting, but they are reliant on the path of the economy. Talking about the economy, the labor market continued to exhibit strength with 275,000 nonfarm jobs added in February, much higher than the forecasted 200,000, per the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Payrolls are, thus, almost double the number of monthly jobs needed to keep up with growth among the working-age population. However, it's the rise in the unemployment level and moderation in wage growth that has bolstered the expectation of an interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve in June. The unemployment rate increased 0.2 percentage points to 3.9% in February. It has been hovering at 3.7% in the previous three-month period. When it comes to wage growth, average hourly earnings increased 4.3% year over year, less than expectations of a 4.5% annual pace. Notably, average hourly earnings increased 4.4% year over year in January. The Fed, meanwhile, has kept the benchmark fed funds rate steady between 5.25% and 5.5%. The central bank intends to lower the rate by the end of this year and further trim rates in 2025 as inflationary pressure has slowed down considerably amid a resilient economy (read more: 5 Top Stocks to Gain From Lower Interest Rates in 2024). Now, with the Fed likely to remain dovish and trim interest rates this year, tech, utility and construction companies are positioned to gain the most. Tech stocks thrive in a low-interest rate environment. This is because, in the case of rising interest rates, the future cash inflows of tech companies are affected, leading to an increase in borrowing costs and lesser profit margins. Hence, interest rate cuts bode well for tech players. Utility companies, being capital-intensive, have higher levels of debt. In a low-interest rate scenario, their debt levels decrease, helping such companies pay off dues and register profits. Construction businesses also benefit from lower interest rates since the borrowing cost of projects is reduced. We have thus highlighted five stocks such as NVIDIA Corporation, Meta Platforms, Inc., Atmos Energy Corporation, Consolidated Water Co. Ltd. and Toll Brothers, Inc. that are well-positioned to make the most of the Fed's aim to trim interest rates. These stocks flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).
