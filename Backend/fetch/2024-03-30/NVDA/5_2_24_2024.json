    "text": "Feedback Nvidia Corp\u2019s shares rose 0.4% Friday to close at a $1.97 trillion valuation after briefly topping the $2 trillion mark in intraday trading. The gain cements Nvidia\u2019s position as the world\u2019s fourth-most valuable company after rallying nearly 60% since the beginning of the year, with a market capitalization that\u2019s only behind Microsoft, Apple Inc. and Saudi Aramco. While Apple and Microsoft took over two years to go from $1 trillion to $2 trillion, Nvidia is on track to accomplish that in under a year\u2019s time as the stock rides Wall Street\u2019s AI frenzy. Nvidia shares surged after it reported blowout results that reaffirmed Wall Street bets on the potential for its artificial intelligence technologies. The chipmaker also gave guidance above expectations, driven by AI spending at its biggest customers, including Meta Platforms Inc.

The chipmaker reported a 486% year-over-year gain in earnings per share excluding certain items in its fiscal fourth quarter. The company also said it expects first quarter revenue of about $24 billion, handily beating analyst estimates. In turn, bulls rushed to boost their price targets \u2014 the average is now about $863, implying a more than 9% upside, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
