At 12.06pm (AEDT) on Friday, March 15, the S&P/ASX 200 had fallen 1.39% to 7606 points.  Pity the poor schoolchildren in Miss I. Elder\u2019s class at Wormit Primary School in Scotland in 1984.\u00a0 Elder was a terrible teacher who made her kids do maths, according to a message in a bottle found washed up on a beach ~10km from the school recently. Jenny Smith told the BBC she was filling bags with trash along the Tay Estuary in Angus when she found the message in a bottle. \u201cI picked up three bin bags of rubbish and found this bottle, and I thought there was something like a felt-tip pen inside it,\u201d Smith says. Instead she found a map with an elastic band around it. Smith says the girl who drew the map had cleverly used wax crayon as the outside wrapping protecting it from water that had managed to seep in over the years. Inside the map was three messages, written by a trio of 8-year-olds. \u201cPlease please help me,\u201d one of the notes reads. \u201cI am one of the crew of Wormit Primary School and have been taken captive by the terrible Miss I. Elder. \u201cMy name is Kelly McColm and I am age 8. \u201cWell back to Miss L. Elder, she makes us do awful work like sums and I am just managing to write this letter in private. PLEASE someone help me!\u201d Jenny wrote a post on the local Wormit Community Facebook Group about the messages in a bottle and quickly received responses, including one from Linda Bell, who still lives in the village. \u201cWhen I first read Jenny\u2019s Facebook post and saw that the date on the letters from Wormit Primary was June 1984, I thought that I must know who the letters were written by,\u201d Linda told the BBC. \u201cWhen I read further, I realised that one of the pupils that wrote one of the letters was me and the other two letters were written by my primary school friends, Anna and Kelly.\u201d   And today\u2019s message in a bottle for investors is the \u201cASX has continued its pretty crappy week hitting a three-week low on Friday, March 14, 2024.\u201d Just two sectors remain in the green at lunchtime today with energy rising 0.86% and realestate barely up 0.1%. Leading the laggards is the materials sector which has slumped 2.16%, followed by discretionary down 1.92% and financials falling 1.64%. Major banks are all heading downwards today, with Westpac (ASX:WBC)\u00a0 the weakest performer down ~3%. Iron ore miners are also falling with Fortescue (ASX:FMG) losing 2.77% at lunchtime.\u00a0 Lithium miners are suffering losses with Liontown Resources (ASX:LTR) down by 6.2%. Tabcorp Holdings (ASX:TAH) is down 6.27% after announcing its embattled CEO and managing director Adam Rytenskild has resigned. \u201cThe Tabcorp board became aware of inappropriate and offensive language used by Mr Rytenskild in the workplace,\u201d TAH says in the ASX announcement. \u201cMr Rytenskild will receive only the termination payments required by law and under his contract and will forfeit all his unvested short term incentive and long term incentive awards.  Ariadne Australia (ASX:ARA) is paying 0.25 cents fully franked\nCAR Group Limited (ASX:CAR) is paying 34.5 cents 50 per cent franked\nDuratec (ASX:DUR) is paying 1.5 cents fully franked\nKaizen Global Inv (ASX:KGI) is paying 5 cents fully franked  Overnight on Wall Street, the tech-heavy NASDAQ and the broader S&P500 both lost 0.3%. The Dow Jones Industrial fell over 100 points or 0.35% to end its 3-day winning streak. Hotter-than-expected PPI data was released overnight which combined with higher than anticipated US inflation figures, released earlier this week, had investors pondering if the US Federal Reserve might wait longer than expected to cut interest rates. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the producer price index for final demand rose by 0.6% in February, double the unchanged 0.3% increase in January and the most since August 2023, with the price of fuel and food surging. Economists surveyed by Reuters had anticipated a 0.3% uptick in the PPI with the higher than expected number along with the latest inflation figures raising concerns inflation prices may once again be ticking upwards. Also overnight, initial jobless claims came in unexpectedly lower, but retail sales disappointed. The PPI figures are the last of the major reports to come in before the Fed meets next week. Selling in New York was focused on property stocks, utilities, and healthcare \u2013 the three major laggards overnight. At lunchtime in Sydney US futures are pointing to another weaker night on Wall Street to end the week.  Oil prices have retreated at lunchtime coming off their upward trend as domestic US demand improves and the squeeze continues on the geopolitical front. WTI is currently down 0.06% to US$81.21/barrel, while Brent is down 0.12% to US$85.32/barrel. Iron ore continues its downward trajectory falling 1.86% to US$1.05/tonne. Prices of the steel making material are down almost 11% this week and 22% YTD following a host of concerns including a glut of global supply and decreasing demand in China. Gold is up 0.05% to US$2162.09/ounce, while copper has also risen, up 0.38% to US$4.05/lb. The Aussie dollar is down 0.28%, currently buying US67 cents, while the world\u2019s most popular cryptocurrency is down 0.17% today to US$70,603.
