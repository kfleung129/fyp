Its largest investment of $147.3 million was in Arm Holdings, the chip designer that Nvidia failed to buy after the $80 billion deal hit the antitrust hurdle two years ago.\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\tShow Full Article Its largest investment of $147.3 million was in Arm Holdings, the chip designer that Nvidia failed to buy after the $80 billion deal hit the antitrust hurdle two years ago. Nvidia had indicated interest in purchasing shares of Arm during the British company\u2019s Nasdaq debut last year. \nShares of Arm that has said its processors complement Nvidia\u2019s chips for AI work in data centers were up 2.1%. \nShares of biotech firm Recursion Pharmaceuticals, in which Nvidia invested nearly $76 million, gained 18.3%.\nLast year, Nvidia said it would invest in Recursion to speed up training of the Salt Lake City, Utah-based firm\u2019s AI models for drug discovery.\nThe Silicon Valley megacap firm also invested nearly $3.7 million in conversational voice assistants developer SoundHound AI, sending its shares 23% higher. \nIt bought shares of Israel-based medical device company Nano-X Imaging, which uses AI software to analyze reports. Nano-X shares rose 80% higher.\nAutonomous driving technology TuSimple Holdings, which delisted from the Nasdaq last week, also drew $3 million in capital from the chipmaker.    \n\u201cThis is a way to collaborate with one of the smartest people in the business.. and gives Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang the opportunity to collaborate on projects moving forward,\u201d said Thomas Hayes, chairman at Great Hill Capital.\nNvidia revealed its new stakes as of Dec. 31 in a 13-F filing with the U.S. SEC late on Wednesday.\nSoundHound shares were the most actively traded across U.S. stocks trading before the bell, with 29 million shares changing hands by 8:05 a.m. ET, nearly three times its 25-day moving average, according to LSEG data.\nShares of other small-cap chipmakers rose in tandem, with C3.ai adding 1.4% and BigBear.ai Holdings gaining 7.3%.\n (Reporting by Medha Singh in Bengaluru, Additional reporting by Bhanvi Satija and Johann Cherian; Editing by Krishna Chandra Eluri and Arun Koyyur)\nDisclaimer: This report is auto generated from the Reuters news service.
