    "text": "Cathie Wood, CEO and CIO of Ark Invest, warned about the trend of NVIDIA (NVDA.US)\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0  in a letter to shareholders on Thursday. She believed that without an exponential growth in software revenues to support the overexpansion of GPU capacity, it wouldn't be surprising to see a spending pause for the company in the future. A correction in inventory overhang may also happen, especially for cloud customers, which account for more than half of NVIDIA's data centre sales.She also pointed out that, unlike Cisco Systems (CSCO.US)\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0  in the dot-com era, NVIDIA faces competition not only from the likes of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD.US)\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 , but also from customers such as Tesla (TSLA.US)\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 , which is also designing its own AI chips.Related NewsBitcoin Regains US$70,000-mark; Cryptos SpikeWood, however, missed out on NVIDIA's recent rally, as its flagship ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK.US)\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0  dumped as many as 772,900 NVIDIA shares in the two months to January last year. At NVIDIA 's closing price on Wednesday, the sold shares would have a value of US$685 million, roughly 6x what Ark earned from the sale.(Real-time Streaming US Stocks Quote; Except All OTC quotes are at least 15 minutes delayed.)AAStocks Financial News "
