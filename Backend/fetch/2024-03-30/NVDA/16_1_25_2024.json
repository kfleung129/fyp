    "text": "Gilnature Bespoke Investment Group noted Thursday that the technology sector\u2019s weight within the S&P 500 (SP500) has recently jumped above 30%. This marked the first time the segment has been this heavily weighted since 2000. The process has been led by the influence of trillion-dollar market-cap tech giants, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). Apple and Microsoft both hold market caps north of $3T while Nvidia sits near $1.5T. According to the data presented by Bespoke Investment, the three mega-cap giants represent more than half of the tech weighting in the S&P 500. AAPL, MSFT and NVDA together accounted for a 17.8% weighting in the world\u2019s largest ETF SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:SPY), which tracks the performance of the index. For reference, MSFT represents 7.23% of SPY, AAPL has a 6.96% weighting in SPY, and NVDA represents 3.61% of the fund. See the below chart put together by Bespoke Investment Group:  Shares of companies like Microsoft, Apple and Nvidia are not only heavily weighted in the S&P 500 but they also represent the bulk of many tech-focused exchange traded funds. Some funds that have a large allocation towards the three stocks are as follows: Vanguard Information Technology ETF (VGT), Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK), Fidelity MSCI Information Technology Index ETF (FTEC), iShares Global Tech ETF (IXN), and iShares U.S. Technology ETF (IYW). 2024 Year-to-Date Price Action: SPY +2.5%, MSFT +7.9%, AAPL +1.7%, NVDA +25.7%, VGT +6.1%, XLK +6.9%, FTEC +6.1%, IXN +6.4%, and IYW +7.5%.
