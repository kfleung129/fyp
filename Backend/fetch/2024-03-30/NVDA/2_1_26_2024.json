    "text": "The heads of the world\u2019s two most valuable chip firms met in Taipei over dinner to discuss the Taiwanese firm\u2019s role as producer of the Nvidia chips that now power the majority of generative AI training systems worldwide, Huang told reporters in Taipei. 01:36 AI chip maker ordered by US government to halt exports to China While Nvidia has said little about that low-profile tour, Huang talked openly Thursday about Taiwan and TSMC\u2019s pivotal role in Nvidia\u2019s business as well as the broader semiconductor sector. \u201cThe single greatest challenge in AI, of course, is scaling the capacity of AI,\u201d Huang said before heading into his company\u2019s local annual new year celebrations. \u201cAnd so we\u2019re working very hard, TSMC, all of our supply chain partners here, are working very hard to keep up with the demand.\u201d \u201cThis year is going to be a huge year,\u201d he added. Huang declined to answer questions about its China business. The Nvidia chief has previously warned that an escalation in US sanctions, designed to staunch the flow of AI training chips to China, could drive local firms to develop their own alternatives. That could harm American tech leaders in the long run. Born in Taiwan, Huang is feted like a celebrity on an island whose economy depends on technology and semiconductors in particular. Local media often feature him checking out his favourite haunts and, this week, broadcast a clip of the executive at a noodle place. Huang on Thursday acknowledged the island\u2019s most critical industry. \u201cIt\u2019s a rebirth of the computer industry and that\u2019s why Taiwan is so central to that,\u201d he said. \u201cTSMC, the ecosystem of Taiwan system makers are all going to participate in this new era of computing.\u201d "
