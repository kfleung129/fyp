    "text": " You are a very lucky investor if you are an owner Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) or Super microcomputer (NASDAQ:SMCI) last year.  Since the start of 2023, Nvidia\u2019s shares are up 530%, while Supermicro\u2019s are up a whopping 1,300%. In other words, if you invested $10,000 in each company on January 1, 2023, you would have almost $205,000.  But after that kind of performance, many investors may be wondering if they can still invest in these two AI leaders without risking serious capital loss in a few months. So, is either of these two stocks a buy now?  And if so, what is the better purchase? Table of Contents Nvidia makes best-in-class graphics processing units (GPUs) that are perfect for training AI models.  GPUs can handle intensive calculations efficiently, making them the best tool for the job.  When a customer wants to build a supercomputer that can train AI models, they don\u2019t order a handful of GPUs;  it orders thousands.  With Nvidia\u2019s flagship GPU, the H100, costing an estimated $30,000 each, that\u2019s a huge growth driver for Nvidia. However, you can\u2019t just connect these GPUs together with a few cables and be done with it.  You need a specialized server that properly connects these devices together and combines them into clusters to maximize efficiency.  That\u2019s where Super Micro Computer comes into the picture. While some tech giants may have this expertise in-house, many do not, so they contract Supermicro to build their servers.  Supermicro has many different server designs based on the application and expected workload, so all kinds of customers can find what they need. This highlights the first difference between these two investments: Nvidia is a company that almost all AI-focused companies work with, while only a few work with Supermicro.  This doesn\u2019t mean Supermicro is doomed to failure, but it is a risk factor that investors should consider.  Supermicro could be dethroned by a competitor who undercuts prices, while Nvidia could only be knocked off its pedestal by someone who makes a more powerful GPU \u2013 something competitors have long struggled to do. The story continues When examining each company\u2019s financials, Nvidia is also starting to pull back. Both companies are growing quickly and their forecasts for the next quarter are also quite strong.  In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended January 28), Nvidia\u2019s revenue rose 265% year over year to $22.1 billion.  It also gave guidance for first-quarter revenue of $24 billion, indicating growth of 234%. Supermicro also delivered strong results, with revenue rising 103% to $3.67 billion in the second quarter of 2024 (ending December 31).  For the next quarter, Supermicro expects growth of 188% to 219%, putting the company in the same range as Nvidia. While Nvidia experienced the first wave of GPU demand, Supermicro\u2019s growth is just beginning.  However, the stock has already responded with a strong price increase as investors know what kind of growth to expect based on Nvidia\u2019s performance over the past year. As a result, Supermicro\u2019s stock is much more expensive than Nvidia\u2019s on a price-to-earnings (P/E) basis. NVDA PE ratio chart (forward). It\u2019s wise to use a price-to-earnings ratio when a company is undergoing massive change because it uses analyst projections to determine its value.  There\u2019s still room for error (since no one has a crystal ball), but it gives investors an idea of \u200b\u200bwhat they\u2019re paying for. Since Nvidia is cheaper by this metric and has stronger growth and vital product positioning, I think it\u2019s a much better buy than Super Micro Computer. Should strong demand for AI continue for a few years, either stock could be an excellent choice, but Nvidia remains the king of AI investment opportunities right now.
