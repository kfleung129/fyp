    "text": "Nvidia Corp.\u2019s NVDA\u00a0recent volatility\u00a0may have given some investors sleepless nights, but a big-ticket hedge fund manager dismissed these worries on Tuesday. Market Now Tale Of Many Worlds: Speaking at the International Futures Industry conference in Boca Raton, Florida,\u00a0Ken Griffin, the founder and CEO of multinational hedge fund\u00a0Citadel, described the current stock market as a tale of many worlds. He remarked, \u201cYou\u2019ve got the Magnificent 7, you\u2019ve got this incredible story that\u2019s just ripping through the equity market about the transformative changes that are coming with AI, and then you\u2019ve got much of the market... priced [at] earnings levels that are far more in line with historical averages, particularly across the industrial base.\u201d Griffin suggested that investors could adopt a bifurcated approach to the market. \u201cSo it\u2019s... a moment in time where... in some sense, you can sign up for big bold, you know, these companies that are changing the future, or you can put your money to work in areas of the market where price-earnings ratios are much more in line with historical averages and have a very different risk-reward profile,\u201d he explained.

However, he remained optimistic about Nvidia\u2019s prospects, stating, \u201cThe team at Nvidia looks like they\u2019re really on top of their game right now... They\u2019ve done just an incredible job.\u201d He emphasized Nvidia\u2019s significant role in the AI narrative, highlighting the company\u2019s adeptness at capitalizing on this trend. Griffin also noted the diminishing barriers to entry for large-language models,\u00a0citing\u00a0Anthropic, an AI startup backed by\u00a0Google\u00a0and\u00a0Amazon, as a notable competitor to\u00a0OpenAI. \u201cThe barriers to the production of a world-class model appear to be somewhat lower than we had thought they were 9 months ago or 12 months ago,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know who the next Nvidia is going to be,\u201d Griffin admitted. \u201cI don\u2019t know where AMD is going to land in their race against Nvidia, I don\u2019t know where Intel is going to land. But right now, Nvidia sits in a pretty good position,\u201d he concluded. Nvidia saw a 1.51% increase to $933.04 in premarket trading on Wednesday, according to\u00a0Benzinga Pro data.
