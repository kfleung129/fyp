    "text": " Consider a two-pack of AI-hardware superstars with AMD and NVDA Advertisement Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) might seem like it\u2019s playing second fiddle to chip maker Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). However, it\u2019s a mistake to overlook AMD stock in 2024, and we\u2019re assigning it an \u201cA\u201d grade. We recommended staying long with NVDA stock prior to Nvidia\u2019s fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 earnings report. Hopefully, you listened and profited handsomely from that successful call. Like Nvidia, AMD provided good quarterly results. AMD\u2019s revenue increased by 10% YoY in Q4 2023. Nvidia\u2019s exceptional quarterly results may overshadow AMD for some investors. That\u2019s a shame, as the same market catalysts that could benefit Nvidia should also provide growth opportunities for AMD. Before we delve into Nvidia versus AMD, we should direct your attention to a news item that hardly anyone\u2019s talking about. Specifically, AMD is partnering with interoperability platform Wormhole. Through this collaboration, the two companies will deploy AMD\u2019s accelerators to support the development of multi-chain applications. According to the press release, this partnership represents AMD\u2019s \u201cstrategic move into the Web3 space.\u201d At the same time, it\u2019s also AMD\u2019s foray into the blockchain, or more specifically, blockchain-network\u00a0security and trust enhancement. AMD seeks to \u201cleverage its hardware expertise to accelerate blockchain interoperability and enhance security\u201d through the collaboration with Wormhole. Where is all of this leading? Eventually, AMD and Wormhole envision the \u201cdeployment of zero-knowledge light clients across major blockchains.\u201d That\u2019s a long-term goal, of course, and it won\u2019t be achieved tomorrow or next week. Nevertheless, if you\u2019re generally bullish on the blockchain, stay tuned as AMD\u00a0and Wormhole are poised to make waves in this space. It was a shot heard around the world. As Nvidia released its blockbuster Q4 FY2024 results, CEO Jensen Huang declared that \u201cAccelerated computing and generative AI have hit the tipping point.\u201d Huang added, \u201cDemand is surging worldwide across companies, industries and nations.\u201d Clearly, this demand surge should benefit not only Nvidia, but rival AI-hardware designer AMD, as well. This explains why AMD stock jumped along with NVDA stock (albeit not quite as high) after Nvidia released its quarterly earnings report. This was a \u201csigh of relief\u201d moment for AI chip makers and not just for Nvidia\u2019s shareholders. Huang isn\u2019t the only chief executive with a notable quote, by the way. AMD\u00a0CEO Lisa Su famously estimated that the value of the AI-chip market could expand to $400 billion in the next four years. Thus, what\u2019s positive for Nvidia is also positive for AMD in the long run. There\u2019s room for more than one competitor in this space, even if Nvidia is often seen as the market leader. To quote a Barron\u2019s report, AMD is \u201cwidely viewed as offering the one clear alternative to\u201d Nvidia\u2019s graphics processing units. Huatai Research analyst Purdy Ho elaborated on this important point. He believes that \u201cAMD\u2019s MI300 is one of the most competent products poised to challenge Nvidia.\u201d Moreover, on the topic of AI chips, Ho reported that Lamini AI \u201chas announced the receipt of MI300 and plans to use it in training large models.\u201d Even while Nvidia is the darling of the market, AMD stock certainly has the potential to rally in 2024 and deserves an \u201cA\u201d grade. AMD\u2019s collaboration with Wormhole could be a quiet but impactful game-changer. The AI-hardware market\u2019s \u201ctipping point\u201d should benefit both Nvidia and AMD this year and in the coming years. Therefore, investors should consider owning shares of both companies for a double-shot of AI power in their portfolios. On the date of publication, Louis Navellier had a long position in NVDA.
