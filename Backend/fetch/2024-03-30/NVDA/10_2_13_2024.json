    "text": "With data centers dominating revenue, here\u2019s what we think of Nvidia\u2019s stock. Nvidia NVDA is set to release its fourth-quarter earnings report on Feb. 21, after the market close. Here\u2019s Morningstar\u2019s take on what to look for in Nvidia\u2019s earnings and stock. The data center segment remains in focus Artificial intelligence will be top of mind We see many moving pieces within the AI market for Nvidia and its peers. Some questions we have: Reuters recently reported that Nvidia is building a custom chip design unit that might help build specialized AI chips for others. We\u2019ll be interested in any insight around this initiative, and the opportunities it might open for Nvidia. All these items will help us inform our estimates for future data center revenue growth, and in turn free cash flow generation and our fair value estimate. With its 2-star rating, we believe Nvidia\u2019s stock is overvalued compared with our long-term fair value estimate of $480 per share, which implies an equity value of over $1.1 trillion, a fiscal 2024 price/adjusted earnings multiple of 45 times, and a fiscal 2025 forward price/adjusted earnings multiple of 31 times. Our fair value estimate (and Nvidia\u2019s stock price) will be driven by its prospects in the data center segment and AI GPUs, for better or worse. We anticipate a massive expansion in the AI processor market in the decade ahead, and we see room for tremendous revenue growth both at Nvidia and for competing solutions from either external chipmakers (like AMD or Intel INTC) or in-house solutions developed by hyperscalers (such as chips from Alphabet GOOGL, Amazon AMZN, or others). Nvidia\u2019s data center business has already achieved exponential growth, rising from $3 billion in fiscal 2020 to $15 billion in fiscal 2023. The firm should see an even higher inflection point in fiscal 2024, as we expect data center revenue to more than double to $41 billion. We don\u2019t view this spike as coming from frontloaded orders or a buildup of excess capacity, as we model 46% growth in fiscal 2025 data center revenue to over $60 billion. We model growth of 23%, 20%, and 13% in the following three years, driving the segment\u2019s revenue to $100 billion in fiscal 2028. We doubt that any enterprise wants to be left behind, nor does any cloud computing provider want to be shorthanded when providing AI GPUs to customers. Read more about Nvidia\u2019s fair value estimate. We assign Nvidia a wide moat thanks to intangible assets around its graphics processing units and, increasingly, switching costs around its proprietary software. This includes the Cuda platform for AI tools, which lets developers use Nvidia\u2019s GPUs to build AI models. Nvidia was an early leader and designer of GPUs, which were originally developed to offload graphic processing tasks on PCs and gaming consoles. The firm has emerged as the clear market share leader in discrete GPUs (it has a share of over 80%, per Mercury Research). We attribute this leadership to intangible assets associated with GPU design, as well as the associated software, frameworks, and tools developers need to work with these GPUs. In our view, recent introductions like ray-tracing technology and the use of AI tensor cores in gaming applications are signs Nvidia has not lost its GPU leadership in any way. The firm\u2019s average selling prices are often twice as high as those of its closest competitor, AMD. Meanwhile, we don\u2019t foresee any companies becoming a third relevant player in the GPU market. Even Intel, the chip industry behemoth, has struggled for many years to build a high-end GPU that would be adopted by gaming enthusiasts; its next effort at a discrete GPU is slated to launch in 2025. We do see integrated GPU functionality within many of Intel\u2019s PC processors. We perceive such integrated solutions as \u201cgood enough\u201d for nongamers but not on par with high-end GPU needs. Read more about Nvidia\u2019s moat rating. We assign Nvidia an Uncertainty Rating of Very High. The firm is an industry leader in GPUs used in AI model training, and it has carved out a good portion of demand for chips used in AI inference workloads (which involves running a model to make a prediction or output). We see a host of tech leaders vying for this leading AI position. We think it is inevitable that leading hyperscale vendors, such as Amazon\u2019s AWS, Microsoft MSFT, Google, and Meta Platforms META, will seek to reduce their reliance on Nvidia and diversify their semiconductor and software supplier base, including the development of in-house solutions. Google\u2019s TPUs and Amazon\u2019s Trainium and Inferentia chips were designed with AI workloads in mind, while Microsoft and Meta have announced semiconductor design plans. Among existing semiconductor vendors, AMD is quickly expanding its GPU lineup to serve cloud leaders. Intel also has AI accelerator products, and it will likely remain focused on this opportunity.
