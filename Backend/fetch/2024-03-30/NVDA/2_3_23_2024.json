Nvidia\u2019s stock rose nearly 2 per cent to $901 after Huang and Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress answered questions from investors at the company\u2019s annual developer conference in San Jose, California. The shares had dipped nearly 4 per cent earlier in the day. \u201cWe think we\u2019re going to come to market later this year,\u201d Kress said, referring to the company\u2019s new AI chip, which the company debuted on Monday. Huang estimated that companies operating data centers will spend more than $250 billion a year to upgrade them with accelerated computing components that Nvidia specializes in developing. He said that market was growing by as much as 25 per cent a year. Nvidia is shifting from selling single chips to selling total systems, potentially winning a larger chunk of spending within data centers. \u201cNvidia doesn\u2019t build chips, it builds data centers,\u201d Huang said. Called Blackwell, Nvidia\u2019s new processor combines two squares of silicon the size of the company\u2019s previous offering. Nvidia also detailed a new set of software tools to help developers sell artificial-intelligence models more easily to firms that use its technology. Nvidia is working with contract chip manufacturer TSMC (2330.TW) to avoid bottlenecks in packaging chips that slowed shipments of its previous flagship AI processor, Huang said. \u201cThe volume ramp in demand happened fairly sharply last time, but this time, we\u2019ve had plenty of visibility\u201d into demand for Blackwell chips, Huang said. Some analysts said Wall Street has already factored in the debut of the B200 Blackwell chip, which the company claims is 30 times faster at some tasks than its predecessor. The Blackwell chip will be priced between $30,000 and $40,000, Huang told CNBC. Huang later clarified that comment, saying Nvidia will include its new chip in larger computing systems and that prices will vary based on how much value they provide. \u201cThe Blackwell technology shows a significant performance uplift compared to Hopper (the current flagship chip) but it\u2019s always hard to live up to the hype,\u201d said David Wagner, portfolio manager at Aptus Capital Advisors. In a discussion about Nvidia\u2019s cooperation with South Korean chipmakers, Huang said Nvidia is qualifying Samsung Electronics\u2019 (005930.KS) high bandwidth memory (HBM) chips. Reuters reported last week that Samsung\u2019s HBM3 series have not yet passed Nvidia\u2019s qualification for supply deals. Samsung\u2019s cross-town rival SK Hynix (000660.KS) on Tuesday said it has begun mass production of next-generation HBM3E chips, with sources saying initial shipments will go to Nvidia this month. At the center of Wall Street\u2019s AI euphoria, Nvidia\u2019s stock has more than tripled over the past 12 months, making it the US stock market\u2019s third-most valuable company, behind only Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Apple (AAPL.O). Even after that meteoric rally, Nvidia is trading at about 35 times its expected earnings, cheap compared with its PE of 58 a year ago, according to LSEG data. That decline in Nvidia\u2019s PE valuation is the result of analysts massively increasing their estimates of the chipmaker\u2019s future earnings, and if those forecasts turn out to be too optimistic, Nvidia\u2019s stock risks plummeting back to earth. Nvidia expects major customers including Amazon.com (AMZN.O), Alphabet\u2019s (GOOGL.O) Google, Meta Platforms (META.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O), OpenAI and Tesla (TSLA.O) to use its new chip. Its hardware products will likely remain \u201cbest-of-breed\u201d in the AI industry, Morningstar analysts said, lifting their estimates for Nvidia data-center revenue for 2026 and 2028. \u201cWe remain impressed with Nvidia\u2019s ability to elbow into additional hardware, software, and networking products and platforms,\u201d they said. The software push shows how Nvidia, whose chips are mostly used to train large-language models like Google\u2019s Gemini, is trying to make its hardware easier to adapt for companies rushing to integrate generative AI into their businesses. Many analysts expect Nvidia\u2019s market share to drop several percentage points this year, as competitors launch new products and the company\u2019s largest customers make their own chips, although its dominance is expected to remain unchallenged.
