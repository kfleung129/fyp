Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. And in light of that, the trends we're seeing at NVIDIA's (NASDAQ:NVDA) look very promising so lets take a look. Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. The formula for this calculation on NVIDIA is: Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities) 0.46 = US$21b \u00f7 (US$54b - US$9.1b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2023). Thus, NVIDIA has an ROCE of 46%.  That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 11% earned by companies in a similar industry.
