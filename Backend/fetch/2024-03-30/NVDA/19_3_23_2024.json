    "text": "Published on By The budget 3D card GeForce RTX RTX 3050 with 6 GB of memory may become more expensive in the near future.  According to the Chinese resource IT Home, citing a message published on Board Channels Forums, NVIDIA sent notifications to its partners demanding an increase in the price of the GeForce RTX 3050 6GB.  This is how the company reacts to growing sales of video cards and the shortage of its supply. Image: MSISpecific numbers are also provided.  The price of GeForce RTX 3050 6GB on online platforms should be increased from 1400 yuan ($195) to 1500 yuan ($210).  At the same time, Nvidia requires accelerator manufacturers and distributors to monitor not only inventory, but also update prices in a timely manner.\nBoard Channels Forums is represented by employees of video card companies, employees of system integrators and companies that manufacture finished devices under contract, so there is no reason not to trust this data.  In addition, earlier leaks from forum participants about the video card market were repeatedly confirmed. Specific numbers are also provided.

In addition, earlier leaks from forum participants about the video card market were repeatedly confirmed. Nvidia created a GPU with a TDP of 1.2 kW and an AI accelerator with a TDP of 2.7 kW.  The company has revealed new details about Blackwell Nvidia doesn\u2019t want price cuts for RTX 40 graphics cards. The company will reduce GPU production ahead of the RTX 50 launch and free up capacity for the H100 Nvidia will upgrade the GeForce RTX 4060, GeForce RTX 4060 Ti and GeForce RTX 4070.

Published on By AMD has solved the problem with overclocking the memory of the Radeon RX 7900 GRE video card, and recent tests have shown that the adapter now looks much more attractive.  Of course, for those who want to resort to overclocking.  The authors of Hardware Unboxed took the Sapphire adapter and overclocked it to 2.7 GHz for the core and 21.2 GHz for the memory.  As you can see, the performance increase turned out to be quite good.  At 1440p, the overclocked card became 12% faster relative to the reference one, and at 4K the increase was almost 17%, which is very good by modern standards. As a result, after overclocking, the RX 7900 GRE competes with the RTX 4070 Ti at 1440p, and reaches the RTX 4070 Ti Super at 4K.  At the same time, the RX 7900 GRE in Europe costs from 570 euros, the RTX 4070 Ti \u2013 from 700 euros, and the RTX 4070 Ti Super \u2013 from 840 euros.  Of course, Nvidia cards can also be overclocked, but the price difference will still remain. Published on By Not only new Intel video cards, but also a new processor appeared in the SiSoftware Sandra database today.  The Lunar Lake model included in the Samsung Galaxy Book5 Pro is registered in the software database, revealing some of its parameters.  The unnamed CPU contains only eight cores (four large and four small), but for Lunar Lake this is the maximum.  The presence of only eight threads confirms leaks that future Intel CPUs do not support Hyper-Threading. The processor operated at frequencies of 1.6-2.8 GHz.  These are clearly far from the final frequencies, but Lunar Lake is created with an eye to maximum energy efficiency, so perhaps they will not have very high frequencies.  The CPU also has 12 MB of L3 cache and a Xe2-LPG (Battlemage) generation GPU with 4 Xe cores and a frequency of 1.85 GHz. According to the latest roadmap, Lunar Lake is expected at the end of this year. Published on By Intel Meteor Lake processors only exist in mobile versions.  Or not?  The IBASE MI1002 industrial motherboard indicates that Intel is either planning or has already released Core Ultra as a desktop CPU.  The board with the LGA 1851 socket is designed for Meteor Lake-PS, which Intel has not officially presented.  There were rumors and leaks about such desktop CPUs, but then it became known that Intel abandoned the idea.  True, there was also evidence that such processors would still be released, but not in retail, but would be available to mini-PC manufacturers.  Whether such mini-PCs will appear in retail is still anyone\u2019s guess, but in the industrial sector, as we see, yes. As for the parameters of such CPUs, they are not yet available.  Most likely, these are just mobile models in a different socket \u2013 Intel has already done this.
