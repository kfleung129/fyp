So, investors might consider grabbing chip stocks Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), ROHM Co (ROHCY), and SMART Global Holdings (SGH), which possess the potential to outperform NVDA. Read on\u2026. Jan 15, 2024 While NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) may not be able to sustain its exceptional run due to macroeconomic hurdles and its elevated valuation, there are definitely opportunities to generate superior returns in the dynamic chip industry landscape. Thus, investors looking to capitalize on the favorable industry trends could consider buying Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (SWKS), ROHM Co., Ltd. (ROHCY), and SMART Global Holdings, Inc. (SGH), which hold the potential to outperform NVDA in the upcoming months. The United States expands export restrictions on NVDA\u2019s AI chips to some countries in the Middle East beyond China. According to the company, this limitation will affect its A100 and H100 chips designed to speed up machine-learning tasks. A few months ago, NVDA\u2019s stock fell nearly 4% on fears that widening U.S. chip curbs would sap growth in China, its third largest market, and curtail the AI-driven boom in its business. NVDA\u2019s fiscal third-quarter revenue grew 206% year-over-year to $18.12 billion, handily beating expectations. Its net income increased from $680 million to $9.24 billion. Moreover, management guided 231% year-over-year revenue growth in the next quarter. However, NVDA, which has been at the forefront of artificial intelligence developments with its tailor-made graphics processing units, said its China business would take a hit from tighter export controls. NVDA\u2019s valuation also appears significantly elevated. In terms of forward non-GAAP P/E, the stock is trading at 44.68x, 88.2% higher than the 23.74x industry average. Its forward EV/Sales of 22.85x is 696.1% higher than the 2.87x industry average. Moreover, the stock\u2019s forward EV/EBITDA multiple of 41.23 is 163.4% higher than the industry average of 15.65. However, the global semiconductor industry is estimated to grow at a CAGR of 16% to $616.50 billion by 2024 on the back of ongoing product innovation, growing semiconductor demand from AI data centers, next-generation computing, and HPC applications, along with the growth of semiconductors in passenger vehicle and automotive electrification. Furthermore, government interventions, such as the CHIPS and Science Act, further fortify the semiconductor industry\u2019s prospects. The Act sets aside approximately $53 billion toward bolstering semiconductor manufacturing, research, and the creation of a skilled workforce in the U.S. Given the favorable industry trends, SWKS, ROHCY, and SGH could offer better returns than NVDA. Therefore, let us dive into the fundamentals of these three Semiconductor & Wireless Chip industry picks, beginning with number three. Stock #3: Skyworks Solutions, Inc.
