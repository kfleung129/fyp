    "text": "By Christopher Gannatti, CFA, Global Head of Research Nvidia\u2019s earnings report brought much intrigue. Consider this headline from the\u00a0Financial Times: \u201cNvidia Is Nuts, When\u2019s the Crash?\u201d1 The results over the past year have been amazing, yes, but there are no precedents for a company growing from a market capitalization below a $1 trillion to $2 trillion in less than a year.1 Does the hype match reality? The CURRENT share price is not necessarily a reflection the past, but rather a view on the FUTURE. One analyst believes Nvidia\u2019s current valuation would be well supported IF the company can grow their current revenues tenfold and do so with an operating margin around 55% over the coming 10 years. We cannot know today if that will happen, but note the entire\u00a0semiconductor\u00a0market\u2014meaning all sales of all semiconductors, not just\u00a0AI\u00a0accelerators\u2014has been $500\u2013$600 billion in recent years.3 Continued execution on an exponential growth thesis, while not impossible, is a very high hurdle to clear. Nvidia has been a public company for a long time\u2014it went public in 1999 at $12 per share.1\u00a0Before the extreme feelings of FOMO (fear of missing out) kick in, remember the role of graphics processing units (GPUs) in artificial intelligence applications did not hit the mainstream until the so-called \u201cAlexNet\u201d moment in 2012.5 This means that we can look at Nvidia\u2019s revenues, year by year, for quite a long time in figure 1.  Now, revenues are not profits. However, the growth story of Nvidia\u2019s net income is even more impressive than the revenue growth component, as we see in figure 2:  The Nvidia A100, H100 and soon B100 AI accelerator chips are really systems and not chips that individuals would buy. The value lies more in building a network of these systems\u2014usually thousands or tens of thousands of them\u2014versus just buying a couple. Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg indicated Meta would, by the end of 2024, have 350,000 Nvidia H100s\u2014which could represent $9 billion.5\u00a0That does not feel like type of regular purchase, but we shall see. The\u00a0Magnificent 7, excluding Nvidia (the so-called Mag 6) represent a large chunk of the customers that are currently spending the money to support Nvidia\u2019s ongoing, blockbuster results. Microsoft, Amazon.com and Alphabet are running the world\u2019s three largest public cloud infrastructure platforms. If the customers want to train and run models on Nvidia chips, these firms need to buy Nvidia chips. If one provider slows down, it creates an opportunity at the others. The Mag 6 have been increasing their capital expenditures. If we compare the level of reported capital expenditures at these firms and the overall level of revenues that Nvidia has reported, blunt analysis indicates almost 40% of the total capex could be represented by Nvidia\u2019s revenues. We do not know what each of these companies is spending at Nvidia, although anecdotal evidence abounds that companies need to keep ordering from Nvidia for risk of being shut out of future production runs if they slow down.  Nvidia\u2019s results are so remarkable that it is difficult for any company to compare. When considering thematic investments, similar to venture capital, there can be a power law at work, in which, instead of all companies delivering a result close to average, we should likely see a small number of firms delivering astronomical results and other companies with terrible results. Fortunately, the astronomical results can cancel out the terrible results over time. For strategies focused on AI, Nvidia is clearly an essential company but the success will not move forward based on a single company. The semiconductor value chain is complex, and we advocate thinking about the relationships exemplified within it\u2014for instance, the fact that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) is fabricating Nvidia\u2019s advanced chips. Nvidia is not, currently, making the physical chips. When considering different AI strategies, we note that it is more important to look under the hood and simply understand\u2014what is the Nvidia exposure? What is the Magnificent 7 exposure? There are not correct and incorrect answers, but it\u2019s important to make sure the degree of exposure to these different kinds of things is monitored over time and fits the view the investor is looking to implement. 1\u00a0Dan McCrum, \u201cNvidia Is Nuts, When\u2019s the Crash?\u201d\u00a0Financial Times, 2/16/24.\n2\u00a0Nvidia\u2019s market cap on 2/18/23 was roughly $532 billion, while on 2/2/24 it was around $1.9 trillion.
