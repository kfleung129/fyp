    "text": "NVIDIA Corp, currently trading at 33 times earnings, is experiencing significant growth, as noted by Deepwater Asset Management co-founder Doug Clinton. The company's robust performance is seen as evidence of a healthy market. For the current quarter, NVIDIA is expected to post earnings of $5.35 per share, indicating a change of +390.8% from the year-ago quarter. The earnings estimate for the current fiscal year is $23.22, indicating a year-over-year change of +79.2%. For the next fiscal year, the earnings estimate is $25.77, indicating a change of +11% from what NVIDIA reported a year ago. In addition to its financial performance, NVIDIA is considering another stock split due to its remarkable surge in market value, which has escalated by over $1 trillion this year. This consideration is aimed at making shares more accessible, especially to small retail investors deterred by the high share price. Despite no confirmation from NVIDIA on an impending split, its ongoing rally and popularity among retail traders underscore its robust market presence. Traders and investors use our platform.
