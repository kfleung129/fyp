    "text": " Valuation concerns aside, Nvidia stock remains a must-own in the tech sector Advertisement Source: Evolf / Shutterstock.com Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock has started 2024 just as it finished 2023, hotter than a pistol, up 28% year-to-date and 211% over the past year. Nothing can stop it. ThinkAdvisor.com interviewed investment strategist Harry Dent Jr. about the 2024 market outlook. Dent argued that the S&P 500 could lose 86% of its value in 2024. However, try not to take the doom and gloom too seriously. He also suggested that January would foretell the pain ahead.\u00a0Well, Nvidia\u2019s up 28% this month, while the index has gained over 3%, a respectable number given its convincing performance in 2023. Is it too late to buy NVDA stock? I\u2019ll look at both sides of the argument. Well, it is if you listen to Harry Dent. He believes the apocalypse will soon be upon us. In Dent\u2019s defense, I saw a chart recently (I\u2019ll be damned if I could remember where) that made a convincing case that stocks were ready for a bit of a shakeup. On Jan. 24, Nvidia\u2019s market cap hit $1.5 trillion for the first time. It hit $1 trillion in May 2023. With 2.47 billion shares outstanding, it can get to $2 trillion with another 33% gain. If successful, that would be a 631% gain from its October 2022 low of around $112. Based on the analyst EPS estimate for 2024 of $11.07 a share, it\u2019s currently trading at 56x earnings. Its five-year average forward P/E is 42, so there\u2019s no question it\u2019s not a cheap buy right now. However, with 49 of 53 analysts rating it Overweight or Buy, anything\u2019s possible. InvestorPlace\u2019s Josh Enomoto declared in early November that Nvidia had a high price-to-earnings ratio relative to its AI and machine learning peers. Further, he suggested NVDA stock was more expensive than 90% of its tech peers. As a result, he was near-term bearish on the stock. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any doubt that Nvidia has to hit its ambitious growth targets. The average analyst estimate for revenue growth in 2024 is 119% and 58% in 2025, with 2024 and 2025 EPS of $3.34 and $12.31, respectively, for its share price to keep moving higher. That\u2019s not a slam dunk. In July 2017, I wrote about why the perception Nvidia\u2019s stock was expensive at the time \u2014 it traded at 55x its trailing earnings and 14x sales \u2014 wasn\u2019t entirely accurate. I used McCormick & Company\u2019s (NYSE:MKC) acquisition of Reckitt Benckiser\u2019s (OTCMKTS:RBGLY) French\u2019s and Frank\u2019s Hot Sauce brands to illustrate why value is relative. \u201cNvidia\u2019s fiscal 2017 free cash flow was $1.5 billion, or 22% of its annual revenue. McCormick\u2019s free cash flow was $658 million or 15% of its annual revenue,\u201d I wrote in 2017. \u201cIf McCormick is willing to pay seven times sales for a business that likely doesn\u2019t generate free cash flow equal to or greater than 15% of its annual revenue, Nvidia shareholders paying 14 times sales is the price you pay to own a business that generates 50% more free cash flow relative to annual revenue.\u201d The most impressive part of that quote concerns free cash flow. In fiscal 2017, it was $1.5 billion. Bank of America recently highlighted that Nvidia should be able to generate $100 billion in free cash flow over the next two years, more than 3x what it generated over the past two and 56x what it did seven years ago. \u201cOf the ~$100 billion [of] free cash flow, we estimate only ~$30 to $35 billion could be deployed for buybacks, leaving a meaningful $65 to $70 billion in ammunition for new organic and inorganic growth initiatives,\u201d Business Insider reported BofA analyst Vivek Arya\u2019s comments from a Jan. 4 note to clients. While there\u2019s no question we are in the early innings of AI, and the leadership positions could change over time, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any doubt that it\u2019s Nvidia\u2019s game to lose. Until someone can show they\u2019re up to the challenge of toppling the company from the top of the AI mountain, its stock seems destined to keep moving higher. I believe it\u2019s still a buy. However, pick up half a position now, and the other half should it correct into the low $500s or high $400s.
