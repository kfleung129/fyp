According to the report, the company is discussing selling both new and existing shares, and employees may tender some of their holdings. Terms haven\u2019t been finalized and could still change, the report added. Nvidia-backed CoreWeave previously raised $642 million in a minority stake sale in December that valued the company at $7 billion. The round consisted of Fidelity Management & Research Company, Investment Management Corporation of Ontario, and J. P. Morgan Asset Management, among others. In August, the cloud service startup made headlines for raising $2.3 billion in debt collateralized by Nvidia's (NASDAQ:NVDA) artificial intelligence chips. "
