AI-related businesses will be focused on rolling out the game-changing technology smoothly. Monday, the Paris-based electrical-hardware company Schneider Electric unveiled a collaboration designed to do just that. Schneider and Nvidia are working to industrialize the data-center business. Schneider \u201cwill leverage its expertise in data center infrastructure and Nvidia\u2019s advanced A.I. technologies to introduce the first publicly available AI data center reference designs,\u201d reads part of a news release. Practically speaking, the pair are introducing standards and standard processes to power-hungry AI data centers. Every new center doesn\u2019t need to be a brand-new design from the ground up. The result should make building and maintaining AI data centers easier and less expensive. \u201cThis provides organizations with the necessary infrastructure to tap into the potential of AI, driving innovation and digital transformation across industries,\u201d said Ian Buck, Nvidia\u2019s vice president of Hyperscale and HPC, or high-performance computing. Data centers aren\u2019t a new phenomenon, but the ones used for training AI models demand more power, hardware, and software than traditional server farms. At a \u201ctypical data center today, the density would be up to 20 kilowatts a rack\u201d of computers, Pankaj Sharma, executive vice president of Schneider\u2019s secure power division and data center business, told Barron\u2019s, referring to the amount of power those computers need to run. Twenty kilowatts amount to about 300 incandescent light bulbs. \u201cWith these A.I. deployments, and the compute capability of the servers coming from Nvidia, the density on a rack could go to as much as up to 150 kilowatts,\u201d Sharma said. That is closer to 2,500 light bulbs. A.I. brains require a lot of fuel. The International Energy Agency estimates that data centers now account for about 2% of global electricity demand. It says demand to run data centers could double by 2026. That rapid demand growth is one reason standardization and planning make sense. The collaboration is another example of how the AI boom is helping businesses beyond Nvidia. Some of the AI news is reflected in Schneider stock. Through Monday trading, shares were up almost 50% over the past 12 months and had gained more than 200% over the past five years. The S&P 500 was up about 30% and 85%, respectively, over those two spans. Nvidia stock is another story. Shares were up roughly 240% over the past 12 months and up about 1,900% over the past five years. \u201cI\u2019ve seen the shift and growth cycles of the enterprise to the cloud, cloud to ecommerce\u2026everything around blockchain and then you had metaverse just a few years ago,\u201d said Sharma. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen anything like [A.I.] in my career. This one is for real.\u201d NVIDIA Corp. NVDA (U.S.: Nasdaq) Schneider Electric SE ADR SBGSY (U.S.: OTC) Advertisement - Scroll to Continue "
