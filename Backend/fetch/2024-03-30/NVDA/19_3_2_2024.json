February was nothing short of amazing for Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock. During the month, $431bn was added to its market cap. On 21 February, $272bn alone added to its value. For context, that\u2019s more than FTSE 100 stalwarts BP, Unilever, and GSK combined! Its share price rocketed a whopping 25.6% across the month. Year to date, the stock is up 64.2%. In the last 12 months, it has risen 239.3%. If I\u2019d purchased Nvidia shares five years ago, I\u2019d be sitting on a monumental 1,923.4% gain. As far as returns come, it doesn\u2019t get much better. And that has me thinking. I own some Nvidia shares. As I write, I\u2019ve made an 86.8% gain on my investment. But with the market clearly bullish on the future of the company, should I be rushing to buy more? The main reason for its surge was the release of its final quarter and full-year results, which blew analysts\u2019 expectations out of the water. In brief, it posted record revenues for the year, rising to $60.9bn, 126% higher than in 2022. Net income also climbed by an incredible 581%. Similarly, the fourth quarter saw it post a record quarterly revenue of $22.1bn. Sales for its Data Center jumped 409% year over year. Nvidia can\u2019t seem to slow down. But where do we go from here? The stock is one of the hottest on the market right now. Can it sustain this incredible form? There\u2019s certainly an argument to be made that it will. That\u2019s especially after CEO and founder Jensen Huang said the AI (artificial intelligence) industry is now at its \u201ctipping point\u201d. AI has boomed in the last few years. And as a front-runner, I think Nvidia could be in store for more gains. It\u2019s best known for manufacturing graphics processing units (GPUs). It\u2019s forecasted the firm has between a 90% and 95% market share. Companies including Meta, Tesla, and Microsoft are just a few of the customers rushing to buy Nvidia\u2019s GPUs. But it\u2019s not all plain sailing, although it might seem that way. The stock has soared. But that always comes with a risk. Apollo Global Management recently said that the top 10 largest companies in the S&P 500, which includes Nvidia, are \u201cmore overvalued than the top 10 companies were during the tech bubble in the mid-1990s\u201d. With that, there\u2019s the risk that we see large volatility. I must also remember that this is a fast-evolving industry. Nvidia has burst onto the scene. What\u2019s to say one of its competitors doesn\u2019t do the same and steal the limelight? However, I\u2019m excited about where Nvidia could head in the next five to 10 years. And even further for that matter. I think there\u2019s potential we see big fluctuations in its share price in the times ahead. The market now has large expectations for the business, so any signs of slowdown could panic some investors. But Nvidia is a market leader. In the years and decades to come, I\u2019m expecting the business to keep thriving. I\u2019m keen to pick up some more stock.
