    "text": "Canada now finds itself with a growing need for the supercomputers necessary to capitalise on the work of its academics, he said. Such a national approach to the AI boom stands to drive an expansion of data centres that would need Nvidia\u2019s know-how and hardware. Huang now wants to expand his company\u2019s customer base by persuading corporations and government agencies to build their own AI infrastructure. Nvidia, which has become Wall Street\u2019s favourite bet on AI, has managed to exceed analysts\u2019 expectations for the past few quarters of earnings, and it may need to find new markets to maintain that streak. Nvidia may prove the exception. It is arguably the only tech company that has showed significant revenue growth from AI that has already transformed the chip supplier from a niche player to the biggest beneficiary of the AI boom. Analysts are projecting that the surge in demand for Nvidia\u2019s products will turn it into the biggest company by revenue in the semiconductor industry as early as 2025. "
