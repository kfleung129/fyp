    "text": " The divergence between small- and large-cap stocks matters for the stock market... and for your job Advertisement Source: iQoncept / Shutterstock Most small-cap stocks are still in a bear market. When a rising tide does not lift all boats, everybody drowns. We have never seen anything like this \u201cnew bull market\u201d before in history, where the top names in the S&P 500 are so disproportionately driving total returns, while most stocks are nowhere near their 2021 highs. We know the reason why \u2013 it\u2019s obvious and it\u2019s something I\u2019ve been saying for months. We are in a bear market, with a few stocks participating in a bubble. Higher interest rates are putting a tremendous squeeze on companies, and the risk of a credit event remains in place. There\u2019s no other explanation. So, what do we do with this information? Is it possible that the broader market will start to catch up to mega-cap tech names like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)? It\u2019s certainly possible. But it doesn\u2019t change the near-term reality and risks. As noted by my friend Bob Elliott, we\u2019ve never seen small-cap sensitivity to interest rates ever look like this before. Small-caps hold the key. https://t.co/OOfkx7vj2u It might be easy to dismiss the importance of small-cap stocks, especially with mega-cap names leading the way in all stock market indices. However, investors must remember that small businesses drive a huge part of the American economy, and of the American labor market. Unemployment would surge if some of these small firms ceased existing. These firms also are a key part of continued economic growth. So, while everyone is focused on the millions of dollars being made by investing in Nvidia, Rome is burning. Most companies are struggling. This can not last. It is unsustainable, and either resolves itself with a small-cap melt-up, or large-cap breakdown. The divergence is real, and yes, it very much matters not just for stock market health, but for your job too.
