(AFP via Getty Images) If the initial stock-market reaction to Nvidia\u2019s GTC conference has been underwhelming, Wall Street is still backing the chip maker. \u201cWe continue to be impressed with the company\u2019s full-stack strategy and product offerings including chips, hardware platforms, software, and microservices,\u201d wrote Raymond James analyst Srini Pajjuri in a research note on Tuesday, reiterating a Strong Buy rating on Nvidia stock with no target price. Pajjuri said he expects Nvidia can raise its average selling price for the new Blackwell chips by between 50% and 60% against the current top-range H100, which was being sold last year for $25,000-$30,000 each.

Nvidia shares were down 2.1% at $865.84 in premarket trading. Advertisement - Scroll to Continue "
