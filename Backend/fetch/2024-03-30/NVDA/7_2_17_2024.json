Billionaire investors like Ray Dalio and Paul Tudor Jones snapped up shares in the last quarter of 2023. Others, including the Carolina Panthers owner David Tepper, are more bearish on the stock. Excitement on Wall Street about Nvidia is reaching a fever pitch after the chipmaker\u2019s market value surpassed that of both Amazon and Google's owner, Alphabet, this week. Traders believe the semiconductor giant\u2019s shares could swing by as much as 11%, according to data reported Thursday by Reuters. Nvidia is set to report its earnings for the final three months of 2023 on Wednesday. Meanwhile, a slew of 13F filings this month showed that some of America's biggest and best-known investors piled into the stock in the final quarter of 2023. Ray Dalio\u2019s Bridgewater Associates boosted its Nvidia stake by more than 450% to $133 million over the three months to December 31, the hedge fund reported Wednesday. Meanwhile, Kenneth Fisher\u2019s Fisher Investments upped the size of its position by $800 million to $4.4 billion, while Paul Tudor Jones\u2019 Investment Corp. bought shares worth $59 million. Other billionaire investors, including the Carolina Panthers owner David Tepper and the legendary short-seller Jim Chanos, trimmed their positions amid concerns that the chipmaker\u2019s recent surge wouldn\u2019t last. Steve Cohen\u2019s Point72 snapped up put options on 4,200 shares, which enable it to benefit if Nvidia\u2019s stock price falls. The Nvidia trading frenzy comes after a massive surge in its shares, which has lifted the chipmaker\u2019s valuation from $360 billion to $1.83 trillion over the past 13 months and established it as one of the market\u2019s dominant Big Tech stocks. It has trounced its rivals such as Alphabet and Amazon over that time, with the stock up over 400% since the start of 2023. Artificial intelligence has fueled the rally, with investors seizing on the fact that Jensen Huang\u2019s company is the world\u2019s dominant producer of the graphics processing units needed to power large language models like OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. \u201cIf AI is the next industrial revolution, then absolutely we could see Nvidia\u2019s valuation surge continuing,\u201d Kathleen Brooks of the online broker XTB told Business Insider. \u201cMaybe we\u2019ll see a bit of a split in the Magnificent Seven,\u201d she added, referring to the group of tech stocks that drove the bulk of the S&P 500\u2019s returns in 2023. \u201cBut Nvidia will be really leading the way.\" Correction: February 17, 2024 \u2014 An earlier version of this story misspelled the name of an XTB employee. Her name is\u00a0Kathleen Brooks, not\u00a0Katherine Brooks. Read the original article on Business Insider "
