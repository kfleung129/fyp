Last updated: 15:35 12 Jan 2024 GMT, First published: 14:21 12 Jan 2024 GMT Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares rallied by\u00a0more than 13%\u00a0to new highs on Nasdaq this week, prompting sceptics to wonder if the stock could be overvalued, overbought, or\u00a0stuck in a growing bubble. Last year, its stock tripled in value\u00a0as excitement around artificial intelligence (AI) began to build, and since then has continued to climb. The stock, already a standout performer in the S&P 500 last year,\u00a0broke new records this month. This\u00a0latest rally in the tech company\u2019s stock follows the unveiling of several new AI products at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2024 in Las Vegas this week. The tech company\u2019s share price edged 1.7% higher in a single day on Tuesday, lifting an otherwise lacklustre Nasdaq market that day, and by Friday was trading\u00a0at $548.22 per share. Deutsche Bank equities research analysts said\u00a0on\u00a0Wednesday\u00a0that \u201cinvestors may be getting a little carried away with the AI story for semicaps\u201d. \u201cFor example, a 10% increase in AI penetration of servers would drive huge revenue to Nvidia, but could require as little as 40k wpm of logic capacity. That's dwarfed by Apple.\u201d But could Nvidia\u2019s stock be overvalued? Because\u00a0its stock is trading above historic levels, this has led some observers to speculate that the stock could be overvalued, or overbought, while others believe it could be the start of a new upward trend suggestive of potentially more skyrocketing highs for the company. Nvidia\u2019s market capitalisation on Nasdaq is about US$1.35 trillion, nearly half of the valuation that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL, ETR:APC)\u2019s market-leading US$2.9\u00a0trillion stock boasts, with\u00a0Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s\u00a0US$2.87\u00a0trillion market cap not far behind. Nvidia\u2019s valuation might raise eyebrows because it is a much younger company than Apple or Microsoft, though it has been quietly gaining ground for two decades, and is\u00a0a year older than Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN, ETR:AMZ). It was founded in California in 1993 as a gaming technology company and listed on the stock market in 1999, while Apple\u00a0and Microsoft had a headstart, as they were set up in the mid-seventies. For clues as to whether its stock could be overvalued, it might be helpful to look at the wider tech market to get a picture of how valuation trends have played out in recent decades. The\u00a0dot com boom and bust cycle that began in the mid-nineties had burst by the early noughties, but the crash was survived by all three companies. Financial services firm Kepler Chevereux\u2019s analysts\u00a0S\u00e9bastien Sztabowicz and Ruben Devos\u00a0wrote: \u201cOver the past two decades, the only time the upcycle has lasted for more than two to three years was after the tech bubble crash in 2001. \u201cThe market surged by 37% in 2000, then crashed by 32% in 2001 and stabilised in 2002.\u201d The semiconductor market shot up in the four years after the dot com crash and remains a structurally growing market. Kepler forecasts that it could grow at a rate of 7% to the end of this decade, driven by demand for data centres and artificial intelligence (AI). Analysts suggest the\u00a0semiconductor market has now \u2018bottomed out\u2019 and that an inventory correction is gradually coming to an end, suggesting the market could be about to enter another expansion phase. Kepler named Nvidia as the \u2018clear beneficiary\u2019 of the generative AI market boom, and an undisputed leader in graphics processing units. \u201cNVIDIA is the clear leader in the build-out of accelerated computing and Generative AI, with an estimated share of more than 85% in AI training models,\u201d Sztabowicz and Devos wrote. Nvidia's quarterly sales\u00a0soared to US$20 billion in the fourth quarter of 2024, ending in January, according to the analysts'\u00a0estimates, up from US$6 billion in the recent trough period of the third quarter of its fiscal year 2023. The computer processor and microchip developer has beaten expectations nearly every quarter since the start of 2024, the analysts said. In Las Vegas this week, Nvidia\u00a0unveiled a new suite of technology at CES 2024 including\u00a0drive solutions for autonomous AI-powered electric vehicles developed by Li Auto, Great Wall Motor, ZEEKR and Xiaomi, and new 3-D modelling for car companies. It also rolled out new graphics card chips (RTX 4080) for\u00a0gaming developers and teamed up with Getty Images on a generative AI offering on the stock image platform. In addition, it\u00a0launched the Nvidia Avatar Cloud Engine to enable developers to build interactive AI-based avatars. This year, Nvidia\u00a0is expected to\u00a0launch its next generation of products, including\u00a0the H200 core processing line in the second quarter and the B100 greater bandwidth processors in the second half. Nvidia holds a 70% market share of the AI processor\u00a0market globally, and an up to 90% share in AI training models. The tech company is\u00a0strengthened by both\u00a0its rapid core innovation and through its partnerships. Nvidia\u00a0and Apple are developing their own chips using Arm architecture. One of Nvidia's\u00a0most fruitful\u00a0relationships is with Amazon. Adam Selipsky, Chief Executive Officer of Amazon Web Services (AWS), said in December that the companies had expanded their partnership.\u00a0Nvidia\u2019s latest hardware will be integrated into Amazon EC2 and DGX cloud technology will be available as part of its web services. AWS is expected to be the first cloud provider to use Nvidia's GH200 Superchips for the cloud. Nvidia isn\u2019t the only chip maker to have had a rally lately. Kepler and Deutsche downgraded BE Semiconductor Industries\u00a0after its latest surge, with the latter citing scepticism in the potential for AI advances to sustain the semiconductor market for long. Demand for inventory will be important, perhaps more so than innovation,\u00a0this year and going into next year, and the impact of reduced demand from China cannot be ignored.
