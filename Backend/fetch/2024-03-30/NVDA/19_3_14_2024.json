Will their latest offerings maintain them position as the world\u2019s dominant AI chip supplier? (AI Video Summary) NVIDIA, a technology company, is causing a lot of excitement with its upcoming conference. This conference is important because it will be the first in-person event since the pandemic started. People are eagerly waiting for the CEO to reveal their new flagship products, which adds to the anticipation. Around 16,000 people are expected to attend the conference, which is double the number from the previous in-person event in 2019. Recently, NVIDIA has been making headlines for its impressive performance in the stock market. Just by looking at the chart, you can see that the company's stock has been growing significantly. In late February, NVIDIA's value reached over $2 trillion, and now it's only $400 billion away from surpassing Apple as the second most valuable company on Wall Street. This is a big deal, as it would put NVIDIA ahead of Microsoft as well. The reason for NVIDIA's stock surge is mainly due to the excitement around artificial intelligence (AI) and AI chips. Investors are optimistic about the potential of AI, and this has increased the demand for NVIDIA's products, driving up their share price. Although we don't know yet what the new products at the conference will be, it's important to keep an eye on the announcements because they could have a big impact on the stock price.
