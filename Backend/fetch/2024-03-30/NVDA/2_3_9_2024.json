    "text": " For crypto investors Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has become the only stock watching for clues about the future direction of AI-powered crypto tokens.  As Nvidia stock rises, so does the AI \u200b\u200bcrypto token market. So as Nvidia stock rises after a monster earnings report in February, AI crypto tokens are rising too.  Some are up 300% in the past month, and it\u2019s all coming from a renewed sense of excitement around the AI \u200b\u200bmarket.  But are these AI crypto tokens actually worth buying? Table of Contents Recognizing that this is still early days for artificial intelligence, the only AI crypto token that currently has my attention is: Collect.ai (CRYPTO: FET), which is up almost 400% in the last 30 days and almost 300% this year.  As of March 7, Fetch.ai had a market cap of $2.2 billion and ranked 51st among all cryptos in terms of total market cap. The purpose of the token is to build, deploy and monetize AI by creating an open network for AI agents.  That\u2019s quite a mouthful, but it really just means that Fetch.ai wants to provide a marketplace for paid AI services. In theory, every time you need a task done by an AI bot, you go to the Fetch.ai marketplace and hire the right person to do the job for you.  You would then use the Fetch crypto token to pay for the service. What makes Fetch.ai so interesting is that it is very similar in concept to the new ChatGPT Store, which now lets you hire custom AI bots to perform certain tasks for you.  Considering that far more people know about ChatGPT than Fetch.ai, I\u2019m not entirely convinced that the crypto should be worth $2.2 billion, but you can start to see why some investors are getting excited about its long-term prospects.

A new partner is Deutsche Telekom, which is investigating possible applications for AI bots. The story continues This could become a great example of AI bots providing utility at scale, and it ties into the whole idea of \u200b\u200binvesting in Nvidia in the first place.  After all, it is large blue chips such as Deutsche Telekom that will buy Nvidia\u2019s semiconductors and use the data centers. You should definitely do your due diligence in this sector if you want to benefit from the long-term convergence of AI and crypto.  Otherwise, you could end up in the same situation we saw with metaverse crypto tokens in 2021-2022. Investors sensed a huge market opportunity around the metaverse, and a few major metaverse crypto tokens eventually reached billions of dollars in market caps.  But nowadays no one is buying metaverse crypto tokens. And that\u2019s because metaverse crypto tokens never figured out how to appeal to more people than young gamers and early tech adopters.  Major brands moved into the metaverse, hoping to find new customers and new revenue streams, but things never really went as planned. And that\u2019s a concern I have about Fetch.ai.  Sure, the idea of \u200b\u200busing paid AI bots sounds great, but will it ever appeal to a mainstream audience?  It would be great to see more examples of people actually using Fetch.ai bots in their daily lives. If we were forced to choose just one AI crypto token right now, it would be Fetch.ai.  For just over $2 per token, you can theoretically gain access to virtually unlimited benefits if the use case for autonomous AI agents in the enterprise market goes as expected. That said, it might be better for risk-averse investors to focus on blue chip names in the AI \u200b\u200bmarket, such as Nvidia, rather than trying to make speculative bets on AI crypto tokens they\u2019ve never heard of .  Picking winners in an emerging tech market is always tough, so for now I\u2019m sticking with Nvidia, which is up over 80% this year, as the best way to play the future in AI.
