    "text": "Akash Girimath\n\nFXStreet Worldcoin (WLD) price has been on an up-only trend for the last five days and shows no signs of stopping. However, there might be a bit of a slowdown as WLD approaches a key breakout level that could further propel the Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based token higher. Read more on AI and Nvidia earnings - Link Worldcoin price created two local bottoms on January 23 and February 5, which hinted at a potential double-bottom pattern. WLD shot up 15% from the second swing low and is currently approaching the $2.66 hurdle, adding credibility to the said technical formation. A decisive candlestick close above $2.66 will confirm a breakout for Worldcoin price from the double-pattern. This technical formation forecasts a nearly 20% upswing to $3.19, which is obtained by adding the distance between the peak and second bottom to the breakout point. Until that happens, Worldcoin price is likely going to consolidate below $2.66, allowing sidelined buyers to accumulate WLD.

But if the results on February 21 are lackluster, it could result in a sell-off for the AI-token Worldcoin. In such a case, if WLD produces a twelve-hour candlestick close below $2.29, it will invalidate the bullish thesis. This steep correction would promote a break in the potential recovery of the altcoin and potentially trigger a near-10% correction to the January 23 swing low at $2.07.

Ripple has overcome a critical resistance level and flipped into a support floor on the weekly time frame. This development happened\u00a0while XRP tightly consolidated\u00a0for roughly 250 days. Investors can expect XRP to kickstart a massive rally. Optimism\u00a0volatility\u00a0has shrunk in the ours leading to the network\u2019s cliff unlock. It joins the likes of dYdX\u00a0and Sui, which have similar events on their calendars. As token unlocks are often considered bearish catalysts, investors should\u00a0brace for a reaction after the event. Bitcoin could clear $73,777 peak as BTC bulls resurface. Ethereum might fall 10% before next leg up as ETH RSI teases with sell signal. XRP could lose $0.6000 threshold as Ripple bulls fail to show up. Jito price action shows a potential cup and handle formation. Based on theoretical measurement rules, a successful breakout could yield a 56% rally to $6.0.\u00a0A breakdown of the $3.86 support level would create a lower low for JTO and invalidate the bullish thesis. Bitcoin (BTC) price action remains unchanged as it trades below the 2021 ATH for the fourth consecutive week. With Grayscale\u2019s ETF outflows slowing down, investors expect a positive outlook for the crypto markets, but the short-term directional bias, at least from a technical perspective, remains bearish for BTC.
