Login Wall Street\u2019s rally paused after Nvidia topped the $US2 trillion market cap mark and the S&P 500 rose above 5100 points. Shares opened higher, then reversed. They were mixed with about half hour left in the session. At the close in New York, the S&P 500 was 0.03 per cent higher to 5088.80. After initially rising as high as 5111.06, the index fluctuated. The Dow edged higher, the Nasdaq Composite slipped. Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist for LPL Financial, said while Nvidia delivered on every level \u201cmarkets being markets will want \u2013 and need \u2013 more\u201d. As for Nvidia, it surged as high as $US823. 94 within minutes of opening, before it too reversed direction, finishing with a modest 0.4 per cent rise to $US788.17, giving it a market valuation of $US1.97 trillion. Tom Essaye, author of Sevens Report, said the relentless rally has entered a new phase. \u201cA new justification for this market is becoming necessary if we look at valuation, sentiment and what\u2019s priced in. \u201cStarting with valuation, the S&P 500 is now trading at 21X 2024 S&P 500 earnings per share of $US243/share. A 21X multiple isn\u2019t just high, it\u2019s largely unheard of unless there\u2019s ongoing Quantitative Easing [central banks buying assets] and 0 per cent rates.\u201c Essaye said the message from sentiment indicators is clear: \u201cInvestors are extremely bullish about the outlook and not overly concerned about risks.\u201d Meantime, economists continue to pare back expectations that the US is heading towards a recession. A monthly survey by Bloomberg found that economists now see a 40 per cent chance of recession in the next year - the lowest reading since mid-2022. Economists led by Jan Hatzius at Goldman Sachs said they are pushing back their expectation for the first interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve to June, from May. In addition, Goldman has pared its forecast for five rates in 2024 to four \u2013 June, July, September, and December. However, it lifted to four, from three previously, more cuts in 2025, to the same terminal rate of 3.25-3.5 per cent. Hatzius said: \u201cWe continue to see the January inflation data as an outlier and expect core PCE inflation to fall to 2.5 per cent year-on-year by the May meeting and 2.2 per cent by the June meeting.\u201d The latest core PCE data will be released next week. Capital Economics also pushed its forecast for the first cut this calendar year to June. It still forecasts 100 basis point cuts in 2024 and another 100 basis point cuts in 2025 to reach the same terminal rate as Goldman. CE\u2019s Paul Ashworth said: \u201cWe remain confident that inflation will return to the 2 per cent target on a sustained basis. If we\u2019re also right that GDP growth will dip below 2 per cent in q4/q4 terms this year, then the Fed should still shift policy from a restrictive stance back to nearer neutral next year.\u201d ASX futures up 4 points or 0.1% to 7605 near 8am AEDT Nvidia extended its rally though it failed to hold above the $US2 trillion mark for long. There\u2019s a raft of views on how investors should interpret Nvidia\u2019s move and how to position. Fundstrat Global\u2019s Tom Lee: \u201cThe biggest takeaway of stocks surging on the heels of strong Nvidia quarterly results signifies (to me) there is substantial \u2018dry powder\u2019 on the sidelines.\u201d One of the key signs for an interim top, Lee said in a note, would be for equities to fall on good news and \u201cthat is not the case currently\u201d. Lee argues that of the three general signs of a near-term top, none are in place: buying power exhausted - NYSE margin debt still low; stocks \u201cfall on good news\u201d - not the case yet; and, market technicals breakdown - S&P 500 bounced off 20-day moving average. Still, Lee said in conversations with investors, \u201cwe found many recently cautious. Citing both the higher inflation readings, and their generalised belief that the equity gains are so concentrated, that this was a sign of some sort of unhealthy market. In addition, there were some stocks down on big EPS or guidance misses. But as we note above, this negative sentiment is not a sign of a top\u201d. Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak + Co, said the significant valuation divergence between Nvidia and other AI-related stocks has become more pronounced. \u201cOne of the most astonishing aspects of Nvidia\u2019s advance is that the stock has rallied 156 per cent since the day before its earnings report since last May (which is when the euphoria surrounding the AI phenomenon really took off) and yet its forward P/E ratio has dropped from 53x to 33x earnings. \u201cThis shows that there is an excellent fundamental backing to the great rally for this particular stock. However, this is not particularly true for some of the other AI names. Since last May\u2019s big blowout report from Nvidia, Palantir\u2019s forward P/E has climbed from below 50x to more than 70x. For Advanced Micro Devices, it has jumped from 27x to 50x their forward estimate and for Microsoft, it has moved from 28.5x to 35.5x.\u201d Maley said Nvidia \u201cwill very likely give you more upside performance if the group continues to rally but it will also give you more protection in a decline. \u201cUsually, the best performer in a strong rally for a sector on the way up is also the worst performer on the way down. Given its valuation, this should not be the case for Nvidia, at least for the foreseeable future.\u201d Companies expected to report results on Monday: Adairs | Dalrymple Bay Infrastructure | Endeavour Group | Liberty Financial | NIB Holdings | Praemium | Suncorp | TPG Telecom Wednesday is set as the most important day of the week with January CPI on the schedule and a policy meeting at the Reserve Bank of New Zealand. eToro\u2019s Josh Gilbert on price pressures: \u201cExpectations are for inflation to rise 3.5 per cent year-over-year, stalling slightly from January\u2019s 3.4 per cent and snapping a streak of continuous easing. Market pricing has shifted in recent weeks, but June is still the first meeting where the expectation is a cut. The good news for the RBA is that data is most likely coming in as expected, leaving the potential for three cuts on the table in 2024.\u201d TD Securities on the RNBZ: \u201cIt\u2019s a close call for the RBNZ but we expect the Bank to hike by 25 basis points given the RBNZ\u2019s household inflation expectations survey. A big jump in five-year inflation expectations will certainly raise eyebrows at the RBNZ and cast credibility on the Bank if they don\u2019t take action. We also expect the Bank to signal a subsequent hike, pinning the terminal rate at 6 per cent for this hiking cycle.\u201d On Thursday, Australia will release retail sales data. Here\u2019s NAB\u2019s view: \u201cWe expect a strong rebound in retail sales for January as the shifting seasonality that weighed in December unwinds. That is also what we saw across our seasonally adjusted transactions data. We pencil in 1.8 per cent month-over-month (consensus 1.5 per cent).\u201d High tax rates fuelling avoidance schemes High personal tax rates are spurring the use of trusts, companies, SMSFs and negatively geared property to minimise tax, accountants and tax practitioners say.
