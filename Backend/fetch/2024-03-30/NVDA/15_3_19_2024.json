    "text": "Fat Tail Daily Investment Ideas From the Edge of the Bell Curve By Callum Newman, March 20, 2024 The Godfather of Artificial Intelligence (AI) speaks! We could call him the King of Wall Street too. Or the King of semiconductors. Or simply Jensen Huang. He\u2019s the CEO of the hottest stock in the world: Nvidia [NASDAQ:NVDA]. NVDA is now the third most valuable listed company in the world. Which is also to say, in history. Mr Jensen just unveiled Nvidia\u2019s latest AI superchip \u2013 known as \u2018Blackwell\u2019. The Australian Financial Review reported\u2026 \u2018The famous\u00a0Moore\u2019s law of computing power, Huang said, holds that computing power increases by 100 times every 10 years. \u2018In the last eight years, he says Nvidia has increased the power of artificial intelligence by 1000 times. \u2018And we have two more years to go. That puts it in perspective: the rate at which we\u2019re advancing computing is insane, and it\u2019s still not fast enough.\u2019 This is not hyperbole. I\u2019ve been around a long time. I can remember when NVDA was the best performing stock on Wall Street in 2016 and 2017 too. Its expertise here is unparalleled\u2026and has a long history to back it up. If Huang says their advancing computing at an \u2018insane\u2019 level, I believe him. I\u2019m not telling you to buy NVDA. But it\u2019s clear to me that AI is not a flash in the pan. This thematic is going to run for years. And the ripples now from Nvidia\u2019s big splash will spread far and wide. We explored last week how this could send productivity, margins and profits up right across the stock market. You can see the impacts on the ASX already. For example\u2026 It might seem bizarre to go from the hottest tech stock on the planet to a department store that\u2019s over 100 years old. But Myer [ASX:MYR] has been in the news lately too. They need to replace their retiring CEO, John King. Whom did they choose? They chose a lady called Olivia Worth. This was notable because Worth has no direct executive retail experience. She ran Qantas\u2019s Loyalty (Frequent Flyer) program before this \u2013 and very successfully too. Her strengths are ecommerce, data and \u2013 obviously \u2013 loyalty. Myer\u2019s board knows perfectly well that its future lies in this direction. Myer has 4.3 million \u2018active members\u2019 as part of its Myer One membership. Every time they make a purchase, Myer gets a look at what, how and where they buy. In other words, they are absorbing data from 4.3 million people making multiple spending decisions. They\u2019re now overlaying AI on top of it. In their latest update, Myer said\u2026 \u2018Enhanced analytics, AI and machine learning models are driving greater CRM benefits and providing stronger platform for personalisation, producing highest incremental revenue on record from own channels.\u2019 There you have it. AI leading to more profits for even the most stolid company. Kogan.com [ASX:KGN] has said something similar. It also has a multimillion customer base. Part of Kogan\u2019s recent resurgence is because it\u2019s brought its previously bloated inventory under control. AI is going to help retailers and other firms predict demand and therefore their inventory requirements. And that\u2019s the key lesson here. Please remember this one point above all: AI is a prediction technology. But it needs data. The more data, the better. That\u2019s precisely what loyalty programs like Myer One deliver by the truckload. This is going to make retailers more efficient. They\u2019ll need less working capital and, all else being equal, report higher profits and return on equity. This is just a small hint of the efficiency that AI promises. Kogan, by the way, is up 80% this year. I just launched a special report on 5 ASX small caps stocks that I believe the AI megatrend will benefit. Kogan is not one of them\u2026and nor is Myer. The stocks in this report sit at the riskest end of the market and carry high volatility. I wanted stocks with more exciting potential. Curious? I hope so! AI is minting millionaires across America from stocks like Nvidia. The best news for all of us is this tech doesn\u2019t stop at the Californian border. It\u2019s washing over the ASX right now\u2026ready to lift the economy to new heights. Check out my Top 5 \u2018AI\u2019 plays here.
