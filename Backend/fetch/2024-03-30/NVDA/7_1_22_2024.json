    "text": " Nvidia's reign of terror over the AI market will end. The question is when Advertisement Source: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com We talk about stocks going \u201cto the Moon\u201d all the time. Sometimes, like with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock, they do. But all stocks return to fundamental value. Those on the Nvidia rocket, like me, constantly face the question of when to get off. The answer, so far, has been not yet. Since the hype over AI got going a year ago, NVDA stock is up 233%. Just since the start of January, it\u2019s up 20%. If you got in five years ago, as I did, you\u2019ve got a 10-bagger, a gain of 1,416%. My personal strategy was to get my money out and let the rest ride. I bought 100 shares before it split 4:1 in 2020. I sold 100 of those shares and got my investment out. Then I stupidly sold another 100. Now I\u2019m sitting. I explained why Nvidia is so dear in November. It\u2019s not the hardware. It\u2019s the development software, its Cuda toolkit, that developers find essential. No one has its range of inference platforms for models and workloads. In the 1990s we talked often about the \u201cWinTel\u201d monopoly of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Windows running on Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) chips. Cuda means Nvidia is both the Microsoft and Intel of the AI revolution. It took Nvidia almost nine years to develop Cuda, and it will take time for others to follow. Just not nine years. That\u2019s why NVDA stock is going to the Moon. Cloud Czars like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) are buying Nvidia chips with both hands. They\u2019re buying at any price because their customers need Cuda. It\u2019s not like the Czars aren\u2019t trying to work around this. Much of the work is being done through open source processes, like OpenAI\u2019s Triton. The debates around these languages are complex. The point is the debates exist, and at some point Cuda will face serious competition. Nvidia still has advantages in hardware  and (perhaps most important) branding. Across corporate America thousands of programming teams are now building language models and training corporate databases, seeking practical advantages. Telling managers without tech experience you\u2019re using AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) hardware, or some open source language is a tough ask. The C-Suite wants to tell shareholders they\u2019re going with a winner. Right now, that means delivering, and deploying, with Nvidia. This will change. Alphabet or Meta will show off something worthwhile, done without Nvidia, and that will change the equation. Right now, you want to watch Google, which is laying off people while dangling stock in front of developers. It\u2019s when Google finds its footing that you want to pull the parachute on Nvidia. They have the hardware, the scale, and (perhaps most important) the fear to compete. You also want to watch Amazon, and its partnership with Anthropic. Getting Anthropic providing value with Amazon hardware will be a big deal. Nvidia\u2019s reign of financial terror over the AI market will end. When it does the stock will fall. But it\u2019s hard to say when that will happen. I set a price target of $500/share late last year, before going on my Christmas break. Since then, Nvidia has blown past it. The stock is now selling near $600. At that price, its market cap is just $150 billion less than Amazon\u2019s. Its price to earnings (PE) ratio is nearly as high, at 78. When the fall back to reality happens, it will be sudden, and it will be final. Nvidia is still a great company, but there will be blood on the exchange floor when its stock falls to Earth.
