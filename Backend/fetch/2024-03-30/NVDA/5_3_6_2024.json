The chipmaker has been seeing soaring demand for its\u00a0semiconductors, which are used to power artificial intelligence, or AI applications. The company\u2019s revenue more than tripled in the latest quarter compared with the same period a year earlier. It\u2019s the latest sign that the excitement surrounding artificial intelligence likely won\u2019t subside anytime soon. Nvidia, which has positioned itself as one of the most prominent players in AI, has been producing some eye-popping numbers.

The previous record one-day jump was Meta Platform\u2019s gain of $205 billion on Feb. 2 of this year. In other words, Nvidia\u2019s one-day gain is more than the total market values of market stalwarts Bank of America ($265 billion) and Coca-Cola ($263 billion).

The company was valued at around $580 billion a year ago. $60.9 billion Revenue for the fiscal year ended Jan. 28, more than double Nvidia\u2019s revenue for 2022 and about 6 times what it was five years ago.

Both those companies have significantly higher revenue than Nvidia, however.
