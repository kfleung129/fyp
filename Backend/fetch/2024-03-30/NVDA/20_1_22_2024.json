    "text": "Last Friday, the three widely followed indexes closed out a second straight winning week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite gained 0.7%, 1.2% and 2.3%, respectively. The S&P 500 hit its first all-time closing high in 2 years and confirmed that, by one measure, it had entered a bull market. Investors\u2019 mood was mixed throughout the week, with a prevailing uncertainty about the timeline for rate cuts. While numbers coming in from various sectors remained relatively strong, falling jobless claims especially indicated that the labor market continues to remain resilient. Expectations for a rate cut of at least 25 bps in March moved down to 52% to close out the week, according to CME's FedWatch Tool. The steep fall of these expectations which were hovering round the 80% mark the week before indicates that even as investors are currently anticipating rate cuts from the Fed, it may not be as early as March. Regardless of market conditions, we, here at Zacks, provide investors with unbiased guidance on how to beat the market. As usual, Zacks Research guided investors over the past three months with its time-tested methodologies. Given the prevailing market uncertainty, you may want to look at our feats to prepare better for your next action. Here are some of our key achievements: Shares of Annexon, Inc. ANNX have gained 75% (versus the S&P 500\u2019s 7.5% increase) since it was upgraded to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) on November 15. Another stock, The Pennant Group, Inc. PNTG, which was upgraded to a Zacks Rank #2 on November 17, has returned 23.3% (versus the S&P 500\u2019s 7.1% increase) since then. Zacks Rank, our short-term rating system, has earnings estimate revisions at its core. Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements. A hypothetical portfolio of Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks returned +20.63% in 2023 vs. +24.83% for the S&P 500 index and +15% for the equal-weight S&P 500 index. The portfolio of Zacks Rank #1 stocks is an equal-weight portfolio, while the S&P 500 index is a market-cap-weighted index that has been notably distorted by the concentrated performance of mega-cap stocks in 2023. We are not trying to cherry-pick here. But since this Zacks Model portfolio, consisting of Zacks Rank #1 stocks, is an equal-weight portfolio, the equal-weight S&P 500 index is the appropriate benchmark for comparison. Looked at this way, this portfolio has handily outperformed the index. The Zacks Model Portfolio - consisting of Zacks Rank #1 stocks \u2013 has outperformed the S&P index by more than 13 percentage points since 1988 (Through January 1st, 2024, the Zacks # 1 Rank stocks generated an annualized return of +24.18% since 1988 vs. +10.88% for the S&P 500 index).You can see\u00a0the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks Rank #1 stocks here >>> Check Annexon\u2019s historical EPS and Sales here>>> Check Pennant\u2019s historical EPS and Sales here>>> Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Shares of Dream Finders Homes, Inc.

While the Zacks Rank is our short-term rating system that is most effective over the one- to three-month holding horizon, the Zacks Recommendation aims to predict performance over the next 6 to 12 months. However, just like the Zacks Rank, the foundation for the Zacks Recommendation is trends in earnings estimate revisions. The Zacks Recommendation classifies stocks into three groups \u2014 Outperform, Neutral and Underperform. While these recommendations are determined quantitatively, our analysts have the flexibility to override them for the 1100+ stocks they closely follow based on their better judgment of factors such as valuation, industry conditions and management effectiveness than the quantitative model.
