Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari increased the price target for NVDA stock from $625 per share to $800 per share. That has the firm expecting a potential growth of 20.9% for the company\u2019s shares over the next 12 months. It\u2019s also an incredibly bullish price prediction compared to the analysts\u2019 consensus of $612.68 per share. The latest coverage of Nvidia also has the Goldman Sachs analyst reiterating his \u201cbuy\u201d rating for the company\u2019s shares. For comparison, the analysts\u2019 consensus rating for NVDA is a moderate buy based on 39 opinions. Here\u2019s what Hari had to say about Nvidia and the price target increase in a note to clients obtained by CNBC: \u201cConsistent with recent years and quarters, we expect Nvidia\u2019s FY4Q (January) results and FY1Q (April) outlook in its core Data Center segment to illustrate the ongoing wallet share shift from general-purpose compute (i.e. CPU) in favor of accelerated computing (i.e. GPU).\u201d NVDA stock is up 3.1% as of Monday morning and is up 37.4% year-to-date as of Friday\u2019s close.
