NVDA shares fell 5.55% on Friday and, in the process, snapped a six-session winning streak. A portfolio manager on Friday warned about further downside. What Happened: \u201cMonday morning could be a rude awakening,\u201d said Jeff Kilburg, founder of boutique investment management firm KKM Financial, as he discussed Nvidia\u2019s stock in a CNBC interview. He noted that Nvidia lost about $225 billion in market cap from its intraday peak on Friday. After closing down at $875.28, the stock lost an incremental $24+ in the after hours, he added. \u201cIf you look \u2026 technically there\u2019s a gap all the way down to 625 where the 50-day moving average is where it hasn\u2019t been in a long time,\u201d Kilburg said. The gap-down the portfolio manager referred to is backfilling the gap-up the stock made in late-February following the release of the company\u2019s fourth-quarter results. Source: Yahoo Finance Examining Friday\u2019s stock move, Kilburg said, \u201cIt feels like the fever broke.\u201d About 14 months ago, the stock had a market cap of about $350 billion and has since risen to $2.2 trillion, he added. \u201cIt seems like just two months ago when it was trading $550 to $600 it could not go any higher, and, sure enough, today, it actually went up to $974,\u201d Kilburg said. He also said his firm was buying puts, which may have seemed senseless for a stock that appeared it was never going down. \u201cLuckily that chain worked out very well today,\u201d he said.

Deepwater Asset Management\u2019s Gene Munster said he expects the AI bubble to last for another three to five years before bursting. Wedbush\u2019s Dan Ives sees the AI revolution in its first leg, as he said the current\u00a0AI frenzy is nowhere near what took place between 1999 and 2000. During the\u00a01999 dot-com bubble burst, sky-high valuations, lack of monetization andinfrastructure, weak balance sheets, froth business models and a macro backdrop characterized the tech world, he said. With Nvidia enjoying a dominant position in the market for AI accelerators, it is likely that the company will continue to be an outsized beneficiary of the AI revolution in the near- to mid-term.
