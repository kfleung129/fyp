    "text": " Nvidia\u00a0(NVDA), Wall Street\u2019s buzziest stock, keeps flying higher. The chipmaker and face of the artificial intelligence boom reported another quarter of\u00a0blockbuster results\u00a0and better-than-expected guidance, sending its stock soaring 8.5% last weeks. Those results helped prompt Morningstar\u2019s equity research team to lift their fair value estimate for Nvidia stock to $730 from $480 share. Nvidia\u2019s stock price is up 60% for the year, after gaining 239% in 2023. \u201cThis is not the path of your typical company,\u201d says Morningstar equity strategist\u00a0Brian Colello. \u201cThe business has transformed remarkably in just a few quarters.\u201d It\u2019s extremely uncommon \u201cfor an already-large established business to grow 300% per year, 500% per year in certain parts,\u201d he adds. Nvidia\u2019s unprecedented growth has continually surprised Wall Street veterans. Analysts say it\u2019s very possible the stock can keep running higher. While risks always exist, Colello points to a handful of reasons to be confident about Nvidia\u2019s growth prospects. First, he says, much of Nvidia\u2019s revenue comes from the largest tech companies in the world, which are racing to offer cloud computing services to their customers. Nvidia\u2019s technology is an essential part of that service. \u201cThese are trillion-dollar companies, to begin with,\u201d he explains. \u201cThey\u2019re the companies that can afford it.\u201d Second, Colello points out that all the hype surrounding AI is translating into real-world investments. \u201cWe don\u2019t think this is an area where [companies] are going to skip out on development and risk falling behind,\u201d he says. Third, there\u2019s a place for AI technology both when times are good and bad. If business is booming, companies are willing and able to invest in AI as an important tool for the future. If business isn\u2019t as good, companies may turn to AI to reduce inefficiencies and cut costs. Here are five charts that show Nvidia\u2019s strong growth under the hood, and the ways the company is continuing to drive returns for investors.  Right now, Morningstar analysts consider Nvidia stock to be fairly valued, meaning its market price is in line with our assessment of its intrinsic value. But Colello says that could change quickly: \u201cIt would not surprise me if a year from now, this is a thousand-dollar stock or more.\u201d Nvidia may remain the most dominant player in the space and continue to pull in tens of billions more from the biggest tech companies each year. In that case, \u201cthey will earn enough to justify today\u2019s price, and it might be cheap,\u201d according to Colello. The risk to this outlook is that other cloud companies will continue to look for ways to retain or gain footing in the market. That would put a dent in Nvidia\u2019s dominance and the outlook for its stock. Source: Morningstar Direct, February 22, 2024 Even among the \u201cMagnificent Seven,\u201d Nvidia stands apart as one of the most powerful drivers of the entire stock market\u2019s returns. The stock contributed 13% of returns to the\u00a0Morningstar US Large-Mid Cap Index\u00a0over the past year, and 16% over the past two years. Since January 1, 2022, it has contributed a staggering 31.5% of that index\u2019s returns. When the stock is rising, that concentration can be good for the market overall. But when it\u2019s falling, it can mean outsize losses. \u201cAs it\u2019s become a larger portion of the market, changes in its price will also skew the broad market\u2019s average,\u201d says\u00a0Dave Sekera, Morningstar\u2019s chief US market strategist. Source: PitchBook Data, February 23, 2024 Over the past two years, Nvidia has seen 192% earnings growth, far more than any of its peers in the Magnificent Seven. That strong growth has sent its stock soaring.  Nvidia\u2019s data centre business is \u201cthe only segment that should matter to investors,\u201d writes Colello. This includes the graphics cards that are used in generative AI applications. Revenue for the segment has risen from $3 billion in fiscal 2020 to $47.5 billion in fiscal 2024, a jump of nearly 1,500%. Next year, Colello is projecting data center revenues of $101 billion, double this year\u2019s figure. He points to evidence of strong, lasting demand for AI technology to support his forecast, which he describes as sustainable.  All that revenue is translating into profit for Nvidia and its shareholders. The company\u2019s adjusted earnings per share have risen from $3.34 in the 2022 fiscal year to nearly $13 in the 2024 fiscal year. Colello expects earnings per share of roughly $26.50 in the next fiscal year. An unprecedented story like Nvidia\u2019s also brings unprecedented risks. Morningstar\u2019s equity analysts assign the stock a Very High Uncertainty Rating, meaning it\u2019s relatively difficult to pinpoint its exact fair value. That\u2019s no surprise, since \u201cthe competitive landscape in AI seems to be changing almost weekly,\u201d Colello writes. He notes that investors shouldn\u2019t rule out the threat of competition from other chipmakers or cloud companies, or the possibility that AI investment could slow down. \u201cTo some degree, right now [Nvidia] is a story stock,\u201d says Sekera. \u201cThere\u2019s still a lot more potential upside, depending on how AI develops over the next few years. But that also applies to the potential downside.\"  "
