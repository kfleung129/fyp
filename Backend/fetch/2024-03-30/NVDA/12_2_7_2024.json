The Magnificent Seven gave investors a great rally in 2023, accounting for most of the S&P 500's gains. But their gains turned out to be more uneven than in the prior year, with a couple even entering negative territory on an annual basis. In total, the seven stocks contributed a 53% gain to the S&P 500 through the year ended Feb. 6, 2023, according to Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist for LPL Financial.\u00a0For the year ended Feb. 5, 2024, that increased to 59.7%.

Nvidia (NVDA) contributed the most with 32.8%, up from just 6.4% in the prior year, while Tesla (TSLA) actually weighed the index down by 12.6%. In the prior year, it contributed 7%.\u00a0 Meta (META) was a distant second and helped the S&P 500 gain 15.6% followed closely by Microsoft's (MSFT) 14.8%.
