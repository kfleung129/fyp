The company\u2019s stock hit record highs on Monday after analysts raised their outlook on the company. \u2014 AFP NEW YORK: Nvidia is on the verge of overtaking Alphabet as Wall Street\u2019s third most valuable company. The dominant artificial intelligence (AI) chipmaker ended Tuesday with a market capitalisation above Amazon\u2019s for the first time in two decades. Nvidia\u2019s shares slipped 0.17%, leaving its stock market value at US$1.78 trillion, eclipsing Amazon\u2019s US$1.75 trillion value after the online shopping and cloud-computing heavyweight\u2019s stock declined 2.15%. Google-owner Alphabet\u2019s stock dipped 1.62%, leaving its market capitalisation at US$1.81 trillion. Nvidia has been a top beneficiary of technology companies\u2019 race to build AI into their products and services, with its graphics processors in short supply as Meta Platforms and other Big Tech companies buy billions of US dollars worth of its components. Mizuho in a client note raised its price target for Nvidia\u2019s stock to US$825 from US$625 ahead of the Santa Clara, California, company\u2019s quarterly results due on Feb 21. The stock ended Tuesday at US$721.28. Lead times for Nvidia\u2019s top-shelf H100 processor have declined, \u201cbut overall demand far outstrips supply\u201d, Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh wrote, adding he sees \u201csubstantial AI upside\u201d for Nvidia, Broadcom and Advanced Micro Devices. Nvidia controls about 80% of the high-end AI chip market, a position that has sent its stock up 46% this year after more than tripling in 2023. Technology-related companies, including Microsoft and Meta, have also rallied to record highs on AI optimism. Alphabet has put chatbot technology into its Google search engine while marketing generative AI tools to cloud customers. Its stock hit an all-time high a day before its quarterly report on Jan 30 failed to meet investors\u2019 high expectations and sent its shares tumbling. Alphabet\u2019s stock remains up 4% in 2024. Nvidia\u2019s market capitalisation briefly overtook Amazon\u2019s on Monday, but Amazon was back on top by the end of that trading session. The previous time Nvidia was more valuable than Amazon was in 2002, when they were each worth under US$6bil. By mid-2004, Nvidia\u2019s stock market value had tumbled to under US$2bil as Alphabet listed its shares at a valuation of US$23bil. An early leader in the AI race, Microsoft in January overtook Apple to become the world\u2019s most valuable company, now valued at over US$3 trillion. State oil giant Saudi Aramco is the world\u2019s third most valuable publicly listed company, according to LSEG. Widely viewed as lagging in the AI race, Apple\u2019s stock has dropped 4% in 2024. Saudi Aramco has a US$2 trillion market capitalisation, although over 90% of it is closely held by the government of Saudi Arabia and less than 2% of its shares are available for trading by investors. \u2014 Reuters Tags / Keywords:\nNvidia\n                                                                ,\n                                                                                                MarketCapSurge\n                                                                ,\n                                                                                                AIRevolution\n                                                                ,\n                                                                                                TechStocks\n                                                                ,\n                                                                                                AlphabetAmazonChallenge\n                                                                ,\n                                                                                                Top3Battle Topic:  Report it to us.
