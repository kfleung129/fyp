    "text": "Ever wondered how to make $27 billion in just 15 minutes? Mark Zuckerberg has your answer. Last Friday, his company, Meta Platforms (META), saw its stock price skyrocket higher by 19%. It took the market cap of the company from just over $1 trillion to $1.2 trillion. Zuckerberg, the CEO and co-founder of Meta, owns 13.5% of the tech giant. So when the stock rallied 19% in minutes, the value of his stake increased by about $27 billion. The percentage gain alone is every investor\u2019s dream \u2013 double digits in a day is a great result. But when you consider the value that gain added to Meta, that\u2019s when things get wild. Here are some other ways of looking at it\u2026 In 15 minutes, Meta added more value than: It\u2019s a long list, and I\u2019m sure you get the picture. And when you put it in perspective like that, it\u2019s the biggest single move in value of any company in any market in the world\u2026 ever. The question is, why? What triggered this mega-move from Meta? And can we expect more? Big Tech is flying over the last year. So is this a train you want to be on board, or has it pulled into its proverbial final stop? Meta\u2019s market cap is now on a trajectory toward $2 trillion. The reason is simple: It smashed the expectations on its earnings results last week. And the forward-looking part of its release was heavily tilted toward one thing\u2026 Artificial intelligence (AI). Susan Li, Meta\u2019s chief financial officer, said in her commentary, \u201cWe expect higher infrastructure-related costs this year.\u201d She went on to say, \u201cWe also expect to incur higher operating costs from running a larger infrastructure footprint.\u201d So Meta is warning that costs are going to increase. Why the mania then? Well, we know where those costs are coming from. When they say \u201cinfrastructure,\u201d they really mean the hardware running their AI. Zuckerberg recently said that by the end of this year, Meta will be running around 350,000 Nvidia H100 graphics processing units (GPUs). I found an H100 GPU to buy online\u2026 And it costs over $40,000: Now, Meta is unlikely paying top dollar for its H100s. But if it did, we\u2019re talking about $14 billion in GPU costs. That may be why Zuckerberg said AI will be the company\u2019s biggest investment in 2024. So, yes, AI is still driving mega-cap Big Tech to seemingly never-ending new highs. The investor in me now thinks, well\u2026 How high can these companies go? Nvidia is still ripping higher (thanks in part to companies like Meta buying up all its tech). And it\u2019s fast closing in on a $2 trillion market cap. However, even when you combine both their market caps, they still fall about $158 million short of the titan that is Microsoft. Microsoft recently crossed the $3 trillion mark in terms of market cap. A little while back (before I joined Palm Beach Research Group), I wrote in another publication that Microsoft was the kind of stock I think investors should avoid. Now, truth be told, I wasn\u2019t saying Microsoft was a bad investment. In fact, over the last year, it\u2019s been an incredible performer. And there\u2019s plenty of great reasons to consider it for a portfolio even now. But my argument was that one of the things you\u2019ve got to consider with any investment is opportunity cost. When you put capital into one investment, what are you forgoing by not putting it into something else? For instance, Microsoft is up about 54% in the last year. That\u2019s a great winner in anyone\u2019s book. But Meta is up 166%. And yes, a big part of that was last week\u2019s move. But even before that, it was up around 126%. Would you have preferred Microsoft or Meta over the last year? Nvidia, too, is up 219% in the last year. That\u2019s bonkers for a mega-cap stock. Again, though, that\u2019s great, but what about other AI stocks? You can do well in companies like Microsoft, but at what cost? Have you ever heard of Super Micro Computer (SMCI)? It makes data center servers and develops storage and networking technologies. In days gone by, data center tech has been kind of boring. But now with the fancy AI wrapper on it, investors are starting to realise AI really means data\u2026 lots and lots of data. This equates to bigger spending on data centers and data storage and networking tech. And that means companies like Super Micro are also riding the AI wave higher. If you think Meta, Nvidia, and Microsoft have been great AI stocks in the last year\u2026 Super Micro was trading at about $90 this time last year. Today, it\u2019s up around $620 at the time of writing. That\u2019s a 588% gain. All that has come from an increase in demand for AI hardware. It\u2019s meant Super Micro has seen record revenues, big profits, and increases in its forward-looking revenue numbers. CEO Charles Liang said in the company\u2019s latest earnings release, \u201cOur current end customers continue to demand more of Super Micro\u2019s optimized AI computer platforms and rack-scale Total IT Solutions.\u201d Again, it\u2019s AI driving the company forward. Symbotic (SYM) is another company that\u2019s largely overlooked. Its AI application isn\u2019t as obvious as some. The company itself is in the business of automating warehouses. That means AI-powered robots and software to pick stock, move pallets, and load trailers. Over the last year, Symbotic\u2019s stock price has gone from around $17 to $50, a tidy 194% turnaround. OK, so not quite Nvidia levels, but still beating out Meta and Microsoft. Of course, you can\u2019t invest in everything. And you won\u2019t always pick the big winners. But what\u2019s very clear is that it\u2019s not just Big Tech that wins as AI grips the markets. In fact, I\u2019d say the smarter move is to broaden your horizons. Yes, you can do well with companies like Microsoft, Meta, and Nvidia. And they still may prove to be solid blue-chip investments that should be considered for the right part of a portfolio. But will they do in 2024 what they did in 2023? Or is it worth looking at companies that aren\u2019t as obvious when you think of AI? What about companies involved in robotics and automation? \u201cBoring\u201d data center and server companies? Or companies that are on the edge of developing new kinds of computing and processing that will level up AI in the future? My take is Microsoft, Meta, and Nvidia aren\u2019t bad stocks. It\u2019s just that if you\u2019re looking for outsized returns in 2024, then maybe the less obvious plays are the smarter ones. Until next time, Sam Volkering\nAnalyst, Palm Beach Daily P.S.
