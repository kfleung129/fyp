    "text": "Nvidia Corp. co-founder Jensen Huang celebrated the new year with staff during his first trip to China in four years, a low-key tour that coincided with growing concerns about Beijing\u2019s ability to get around US chip restrictions. He visited Nvidia\u2019s offices in Shenzhen, Shanghai and Beijing earlier this month, according to a person familiar with the matter. Images and video of the 60-year-old\u00a0donning colorful traditional garb\u00a0and dancing with staff emerged online over the weekend. It wasn\u2019t clear if he\u2019d held formal meetings with other executives or officials, said the person, who asked not to be named discussing a private visit. Huang embarked on his tour\u2014first reported by state newspapers off Chinese social media posts\u2014as Nvidia\u2019s artificial intelligence accelerators become pivotal in a tech race between Washington and Beijing. Huang has\u00a0warned\u00a0that an escalation in sanctions designed to cut off the flow of AI training chips could drive Chinese firms to develop their own alternatives. That could harm American tech leaders in the long run, he has said. The Nvidia co-founder\u00a0name-checked\u00a0Huawei Technologies Co.\u2014which in 2023\u00a0alarmed\u00a0Washington by including an advanced made-in-China processor in a smartphone\u2014as a potential rival. An Nvidia representative confirmed Huang had celebrated the upcoming Lunar New Year with staff, without elaborating. Nvidia, which more than\u00a0tripled\u00a0its market value in 2023 thanks largely to its pivotal role in AI development, is up another 20% this year as investors bet on its sector leadership. It\u2019s designed versions of its semiconductors for China that it says are compliant with successive rounds of US sanctions, as Washington\u00a0watches\u00a0closely. Among the social media posts, one person describing himself as an Nvidia staffer shared an\u00a0image\u00a0of Huang handing over a raffled Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 graphics card. The CEO has since\u00a0moved on to Taiwan, according to local newspaper EDN, for his fourth visit to the island in less than a year. \u00a9 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.
