Notwithstanding, the gains in the past 12 months are 6 times higher than its composite NASDAQ index. Consequently, NVIDIA is up 239%, with the gains expected to continue for one of the best technology stocks. The key to NVIDIA\u2019s stock price prediction is its recent breakout. The stock breached a key barrier at $500, the previous all-time high, signifying it has set a new price floor. The breakout grew buyer interest, with the stock moving in a parabolic pattern afterwards.   As expected, NVIDIA\u2019s breakout attracted analysts\u2019 ratings. Fairlead technical analyst Katie Stockton says the breakout offers NVDA a long-term uptrend momentum. The analyst doesn\u2019t expect the bullish momentum to stop until the stock reaches $600. Stockton\u2019s rating is consistent with other analysts monitored by TipRanks, who hold a higher target. The consensus estimate for the stock is a strong buy, with an average price target of $662.39. Strong fundamentals are also responsible for the robust ratings.

However, NVIDIA is overbought, with an RSI reading of 72 on the daily chart. Given the strong fundamentals and breakout, we anticipate Nvidia\u2019s momentum to continue. Volume indicators support buyer strength, which backs up the prediction. A $600 valuation could be met sooner than later. Nonetheless, Nvidia could make brief pauses and pullbacks before the trend continues. This is consistent with the overbought conditions, although brief declines could offer stronger comebacks. Buying Nvidia is recommended after corrections. The stock has room to run, with the price rising to $600 and higher. However, investors are better off buying on potential market dips as long as NVIDIA remains above $500. Copy expert traders easily with Plus500. Invest in stocks like Tesla & Apple.
