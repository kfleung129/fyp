Announcer: Wall Street Unplugged looks beyond the regular headlines heard on mainstream financial media to bring you unscripted interviews and breaking commentary direct from Wall Street right to you on Main Street. Frank Curzio: How\u2019s it going out there? It\u2019s March 20th. I\u2019m Frank Curzio. This is the Wall Street Unplugged podcast where I break down the headlines and tell you what\u2019s really moving these markets. On today\u2019s show. My final four picks for the NCA tournament, which include\u00a0 no number one seeds, believe it or not. Yes, that means no Yukon, the official launch\u00a0 of our Cursio AI newsletter. Also gonna talk about how to find the next\u00a0 Microsoft\u2019s Apples, Googles within the AI space. But first, let\u2019s begin with the latest from\u00a0 NVIDIA\u2019s GTU Conference. Holy s**t, that\u2019s the only two words I have to say. So Nvidia and CEO Jen-Hsun Huang\u00a0 introduced a new hardware. And more importantly, because NVIDIA\u2019s always seen\u00a0 as a hardware company, but there\u2019s software\u00a0 and those developments coming in 2024 and beyond. Now, I\u2019m sure most\u00a0 of you never heard of this conference before. That was even as far as last year. I think it\u2019s been going on for 15 years now. So it\u2019s multi-day conference. Now it\u2019s become the biggest day in tech\u00a0 where it\u2019s surpassing Apple\u2019s iPhone launch,\u00a0 which Tim Cook hosts every September. But there was 11,000 people that attended the conference. Most of \u2019em are top developers, creators. Another 20 30,000 of her that attended virtually. And the CEO Jen-Hsun did not disappoint. I\u2019m gonna give a shout out. Congrats to Cramer\u00a0 who interview Jen-Hsun at the conference,\u00a0 which I thought was really good, especially\u00a0 after he put pressure on the CEO to split his stock\u00a0 and said, what are you getting to split?\u00a0 And he\u2019s like, well, I\u2019d like to split and we\u2019ll see. It\u2019s better for the employee. So I guess you could expect\u00a0 a split coming in the stock, which again,\u00a0 has no fundamental value,\u00a0 but means a lot in terms of the stock price. \u2019cause there\u2019s proof of that. So that\u2019s all that matters, right?\u00a0 One is higher stock price gonna give\u00a0 access to more people buying. And you\u2019re gonna have people, I\u2019m a fundamental analyst. Nothing changes fundamentally, okay? Nothing. But there is change in sentiment when it comes to the price. And when companies split,\u00a0 you normally see over the next six months,\u00a0\u00a0 So more people, more access,\u00a0 he says, especially for his employees. But I thought the interview was pretty good. You could tell a gym and, and a lot of us, right?\u00a0 It\u2019s like a brand new market. Like what do this mean? What do these chips mean?\u00a0 What\u2019s does software mean? What\u2019s going on?\u00a0 Everyone\u2019s learning, trying to learn as fast as they can\u00a0 because there\u2019s so much money going into the sector\u00a0 and it\u2019s still in its very early stages. But the biggest announcement came\u00a0 with Nvidia introduced a new Blackwell B 200 chip. Okay? I don\u2019t wanna get technical here,\u00a0 but last year at this conference,\u00a0 Nvidia introduced a hopper, which is h and it\u2019s H 100 chip. And they said in the middle of the year, we\u2019re gonna have an\u00a0 upgrade to that, which is the H 200 chip,\u00a0 which is the most powerful. These are the most powerful chips in the\u00a0 world, used to power everything. AI, what everyone\u2019s buying. And the H 200, just to let you know,\u00a0 is just starting to ship now. And they\u2019re talking about the Blackwell B 200 ship. That\u2019s how far two generations in front of everyone. And when you look at this Blackwell trip, it it, it powers\u00a0 trillion parameters, multi-mode models. And I say, what the hell\u2019s a parameter?\u00a0 It\u2019s basically how data gets transformed. And if you look at a chat, GBT, which was launched in 2018,\u00a0 amazing, one of the biggest technology launches of our time. This had 117 million parameters\u00a0 to be looking at CHATT four, which is one\u00a0 of the most powerful AI systems in the world. Which by the way, is not even the fastest. Claude three is the fastest right now, has close\u00a0 to a hundred IQ chat. GT put that in perspective. The average person in the\u00a0 United States has an IQ a little bit less than a hundred. That\u2019s where chat GT is right now\u00a0 that uses 1. 7 trillion parameters. The new Blackwell chip is gonna be able\u00a0 to power 10 trillion parameters. So imagine by 2025 ChatGPT being\u00a0 five times faster, right?\u00a0 Just one year. I mean,\u00a0 I\u2019m not even gonna throw in the hyper parameters,\u00a0 which is the machine learning on top of that influence\u00a0 how the machines learn, how they perform,\u00a0 the new algorithms by themselves. But when you look at Nvidia,\u00a0 they\u2019re on an island by themselves. It used to be viewed as a hardware company. It\u2019s not. It\u2019s creating all this software around it. And it, it\u2019s like having 15 individual companies\u00a0 because they\u2019re targeting every single industry\u00a0 and they\u2019re building these systems around their chips. And as you build this infrastructure, in order for you\u00a0 to use a competitor, you have\u00a0 to destroy all the infrastructure and start from scratch. And if you do that, look what happens. Look what happened to Apple. Great announcement with Google, powering the AI\u00a0 through their smartphone. Look what happens to companies that are falling behind. You\u2019re going to see it because I\u2019m seeing it. I\u2019m seeing it in so many small mid-caps\u00a0 that are using this technology when everyone\u2019s saying\u00a0 they\u2019re getting it, and these companies have been doing it\u00a0 for two years and you\u2019re seeing the\u00a0 results, it\u2019s incredible. When I look at Nvidia\u00a0 and what they\u2019re doing, creating this moat\u00a0 and partner, it\u2019s a different model. I love different models. I love studying\u00a0 models for businesses. I love it. It\u2019s one of my favorite things to do. \u2019cause you realize, you know,\u00a0 what the hell is Netflix doing?\u00a0 Why are they trading at 200 times pe you know, instead\u00a0 of looking and saying, which I do now,\u00a0 why is company trading at a premium?\u00a0 What do they offering to deserve that premium?\u00a0 You know, back in the day to be like 200\u00a0 times for earnings, you\u2019re crazy. I\u2019m not even going near it. Well, there\u2019s probably a reason\u00a0 why it built. Look at where Nvidia was, 10, 15 years. Nvidia was, look where, where Netflix was, look\u00a0 where all these companies were with these massive PEs\u00a0 and how they trillion dollar companies today. It\u2019s where they\u2019re going. But the model\u00a0 that they have now, and it comes Nvidia, it, it, it\u2019s,\u00a0 it goes against a traditional technology model,\u00a0 which is Meta Google, Apple. I have to f*****g own everything and keep everything. It\u2019s mine, mine, mine. It\u2019s why the metaverse, which is the omniverse now,\u00a0 which they\u2019re talking about, which I\u2019ll get to in a minute,\u00a0 why it hasn\u2019t fully developed. \u2019cause they want full control. They want control\u00a0 of everything and they have it. That\u2019s not what the internet was made for,\u00a0 but they were able to do it and control everything. And we really didn\u2019t realize that until COVID,\u00a0 until election season. And, and what you\u2019re allowed to say\u00a0 and what you\u2019re not allowed to say before you get kicked off\u00a0 these platforms where you thought it was your content,\u00a0 you owned it and you didn\u2019t. That\u2019s not what NVIDIA\u2019s doing. They\u2019re building these systems to say they\u2019re\u00a0 proprietary to your business. You own it. We\u2019re gonna build everything for you. We\u2019re gonna make it as easy as possible. We\u2019re gonna tailor it to your business. And it\u2019s not like, here\u2019s a chip, here you go. Everybody go buy it. It\u2019s what do you need?\u00a0 How can we build these systems? How much power do you need?\u00a0 I mean, it\u2019s just such light years in terms of even\u00a0 how much power these chips use, which is going to,\u00a0 they just, they\u2019re looking ahead constantly looking ahead,\u00a0 five years, 10 years ahead where you can\u2019t say, well,\u00a0 NVIDIA\u2019s chips, well why use them?\u00a0 Because they, they require so much more power. No, they don\u2019t. So when I, I, I look at what they\u2019re doing in terms\u00a0 of the model, in terms of the partnerships. Let\u2019s just partner with everyone this way. Everyone has to flow through their systems. All the cloud companies hold everything. Let\u2019s flow through Nvidia, let\u2019s use Nvidia. They\u2019re trying to create their own chips,\u00a0 but they can\u2019t create the chips\u00a0 and everything around it that makes these things work. And the time they figure it out, they\u2019re gonna have\u00a0 to destroy their whole entire model\u00a0 and build it from scratch, which is gonna force them\u00a0 to be light years behind the competition. Which we know what happens,\u00a0 especially in this incredibly fast moving industry where\u00a0 holy cow, every week new announcements come out,\u00a0 chat t four\u2019s the greatest thing ever. And it\u2019s not even the fastest\u00a0 and the most productive right now. Claude three already surpassed them. That\u2019s a lot of technical jargon. You\u2019re like, what?\u00a0 Yeah, Frank, I just don\u2019t get it. I, I understand. Well, lemme break this down for you. Make it really, really simple. AI is not even in the first inning of its growth. It\u2019s about to change the landscape of every single industry,\u00a0 every industry, finance, healthcare, software development,\u00a0 gaming, supply chain, social media infrastructure,\u00a0 industrials, agriculture, e-commerce,\u00a0 transportation, everything. And I\u2019m seeing it implemented in\u00a0 across all these industries. As you take a deep dive in the financials, what I do,\u00a0 trade a little bit, but traders look at prices\u00a0 and they say, wow, look at the price of Nvidia\u00a0 and how far it\u2019s gone up. It\u2019s parabolic and it\u2019s in a bubble. Actually, Nvidia, you could argue, was in a much, much,\u00a0 much bigger bubble three months, six months, a year ago. And when you\u2019re looking at the,\u00a0 at at again, they\u2019re just looking at the price. They\u2019re not looking at earnings exploding,\u00a0 they\u2019re not looking at margins. They\u2019re not looking at at, you know, sales exploding\u00a0 from 5 billion to 20 billion and a quarter. Are you kidding me? And bubbles have created,\u00a0 expectations of what\u2019s gonna happen in the future. It\u2019s not based on all this money coming in. Now. These guys have the numbers. If you look at the historical PE over the last 10 years\u00a0 for Nvidia it\u2019s probably 50 ish, 45. It\u2019s trading at 35 times forward earnings. Right now it\u2019s cheaper now\u00a0 that it\u2019s been in the last 3, 4, 5 years outside\u00a0 of when a crash probably in 2022, really quick. Now you\u2019re calling it a bubble. So\u00a0 by focusing on all these markets\u00a0 and not targeting one thing here, one thing here,\u00a0 one consumer, one business, it\u2019s a hundred\u00a0 trillion dollar total addressable market that they dominate. So when you see those forecast call for AI\u00a0 to add 15 trillion to GDP by 2030, I think\u00a0 that forecast is gotta come to fruition\u00a0 by 2027, much, much quicker. And AI is such a big trend. Sometimes it\u2019s difficult to see,\u00a0 to understand the actual impact it could have. It requires looking into the future, having an imagination\u00a0 of where we could actually go. I mean, similar to the internet,\u00a0 the early nineties was 30 years ago. Holy s**t, am I old? Where from, Hey,\u00a0 you better get a website or you\u2019re gonna be left out\u00a0 and you know, I don\u2019t wanna find a\u00a0 website or whatever to everyone. You better have an email then it\u2019s text smartphones\u00a0\u00a0 social media, cryptocurrencies. Did you see all that stuff? Did you see it in 2010?\u00a0 Did you even see it seven years ago\u00a0 of where we would be today?\u00a0 Trillion dollar companies. I mean, it\u2019s such a fast moving market. It it\u2019s really incredible when you look at it, it,\u00a0 there\u2019s an incredible chart here that, that I wanna try\u00a0 to bring up and lemme see if I could find it really quick. And it just shows the, the forecasts\u00a0 when you\u2019re looking at the forecast of where they were\u00a0 predicting this, this adoption compared to right now. And when you look at it, it, it\u2019s, this is, so this is\u00a0 artificial general artificial intelligence, right?\u00a0 So when you look at a A GI\u00a0 and what is a GI, so a GI is\u00a0 how a computer, like once we hit a GI, it means\u00a0 that a computer\u2019s operating exactly like a\u00a0 human pretty much. Now I\u2019m gonna show this\u00a0 to you and bring this up. So if you\u2019re watching this on YouTube,\u00a0 it says AI accelerated faster than forecast. If you look at 2019, okay, so this is pre,\u00a0 g BT three average, right?\u00a0 So this is, this is before catchy two\u2019s launched 2019. They were predicting 80 years before we hit that,\u00a0 before we hit a GI this is in 2019. By 2020 they updated that to 50 years\u00a0 by 2021, it\u2019s 34 years. By 2022 it\u2019s 18 years. And now in 2023, again, we just started 2024,\u00a0 they\u2019re forecasting it to happen in eight years\u00a0 based on this trend of being wrong. If you take that trend of being wrong,\u00a0 we\u2019re gonna get to that point in two years. In two years you might be saying, what the hell?\u00a0 I mean, Frank, what the hell does that mean?\u00a0 So if you have a computer that can do\u00a0 and perform all the tasks that you wanted to\u00a0 and act like a human, just imagine, like from,\u00a0 from my perspective, imagine having, a, a, you know,\u00a0 three frank COOs\u00a0 and what you could achieve with that in terms of, okay,\u00a0 I\u2019m calling everyone, right?\u00a0 I, I like everyone subscribed to, to new services. Now we offer that in,\u00a0 and you know, I\u2019ll have a 10 minute\u00a0 phone call with new subscribers. It\u2019s a service that we offer. I don\u2019t think anyone else offers a guy in the name\u00a0 of the door\u2019s gonna actually talk to you\u00a0 because I\u2019m not looking for a quick sale. I\u2019m looking to establish a relationship with you. And a lot of those times those relationships are amazing\u00a0 \u2019cause everybody\u2019s brilliant in some way. I believe. I truly believe that there\u2019s people, I know a lot\u00a0 of stuff that I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m pretty good at\u00a0 what I do when it comes to stocks. This why you listen to me and try\u00a0 to provide you ideas and things like that. But imagine having someone, having this system, being able\u00a0 to, to to learn e everything that I do\u00a0 and be able to answer questions, be able to, to, you know,\u00a0 focus on customer service. I imagine how important that would be if you have a problem\u00a0 with customer service and,\u00a0 and the guy you know,\u00a0 that\u2019s basically talking has his name on the door,\u00a0 or you\u2019re gonna get the exact thing that he would say. I mean, it\u2019s hard to comprehend where\u00a0 we\u2019re so early in this stage. It\u2019s going to keep learning, keep learning, keep learning. And and I think Jensen said, that, you know,\u00a0 Moby Dick could be read in in a second. Okay, that\u2019s awesome. Holy cow. It could be read in less than a second. What\u2019s,\u00a0 what\u2019s unbelievable to me is\u00a0 after it reads it in a second, it\u2019s gonna be able\u00a0 to answer any single question you have on that book. Try to think about that. That may require you taking mushrooms\u00a0 or smoking a joint or whatever. But if you sit down and really think about this\u00a0 and then you start researching on the internet, this is\u00a0 where I\u2019ve been for the past few months\u00a0 and going in rabbit holes, I\u2019m like, holy s**t,\u00a0 where this is going to lead to. And the funny thing is, I didn\u2019t really get it too long ago. I was like, man, AI and these big company, it\u2019s not that. I mean, you know what I see coming, I mean Omniverse,\u00a0 one\u2019s called the metaverse, right?\u00a0 Everybody, it\u2019s here. You can create\u00a0 players robots that that act\u00a0 and function just like players\u00a0 that are gonna be in this world with you 3D rendering,\u00a0 which, you know, I sampled this technology\u00a0 and it was with Steph Curry,\u00a0 it was a ba it was a real basketball game that was taped for\u00a0 that was a week old and it had a consumer electronics show. And you put the glasses on and you\u2019re not an avatar,\u00a0 you almost like an invisible camera. And you can go anywhere inside the game. You\u2019re playing Cleveland\u00a0 and I\u2019m on the court, I\u2019m watching Steph Curry,\u00a0 like cross dribbling and, and and,\u00a0 and you know, just, you know, go to the hole and,\u00a0 and I\u2019m at half court, I\u2019m turning around,\u00a0 it\u2019s behind me, it\u2019s in front of me. But that whole 3D rendering and stuff, you need faster. You actually need faster speeds for that. But that\u2019s coming as well. And when it does, what is that gonna provide?\u00a0 It\u2019s gonna provide me to put on, you know,\u00a0 whatever headset you want\u00a0 and actually be at the Super Bowl,\u00a0 being able to watch it anywhere. Being able to interact with people in real time. That is coming, that is coming\u00a0 being anywhere, any place you wanna be. I mean you have that. And,\u00a0 and again, I\u2019m saying I sample these systems. My daughter has a, the new, vision quest\u00a0 and it\u2019s incredible right now. But just the interaction where you want more people. The reason why the Fortnite and the Roblox so big. \u2019cause you got these so many people\u00a0 and Call of Duty so many people in there. But imagine having those people where they\u2019re,\u00a0 they\u2019re basically different personalities,\u00a0 but they\u2019re built by these robots and bots. Now you have this real world interaction,\u00a0 different personalities, different everything. It\u2019s gonna create more\u00a0 and more people wanting to be in that world. Spatial computing, whatever you wanna call it. But it, it\u2019s like, you know, the the, this digital\u00a0 universe on top of our universe, which is incredible. It\u2019s incredible. Research is stuff. It\u2019s unbelievable. I mean, you think AI is not around. AI is, it\u2019s not even in the smartphone yet. It\u2019s not even in the smartphone. I mean that, what was it yesterday,\u00a0 the day before Apple announced?\u00a0 Oh, Google, okay, it\u2019s not even in the smartphone. So now you\u2019re gonna have a whole entire refresh cycle\u00a0 of an industry that\u2019s basically peaked in terms of sales. Everybody has a smartphone now. It\u2019s hard to upgrade because they\u2019re just so freaking good. You don\u2019t need to, you know, Apple needs\u00a0 to put out a phone every year, but you\u00a0 really don\u2019t need a phone every year. They force you to get a phone every three years, right?\u00a0 They, you know, kinda admitted that and got sued for that. I mean, I know owning a phone store, it\u2019s not even computers\u00a0 yet, like the standard. It\u2019s very little and only 5%\u00a0 of companies are currently using AI within their businesses. Only 5%. And people are like, it\u2019s a bubble. Listen, there\u2019s some stocks that are in a bubble. A quick hint. Uh, anyone\u00a0 who has AI in their name isn\u2019t in a bubble. You shouldn\u2019t have to put your AI in your name. But the ones that are currently using AI,\u00a0 they\u2019re seeing earnings and sales explode. And it\u2019s not a lot of companies, it\u2019s just starting. But not only are they seeing the,\u00a0 the lowing cost considerably. So if you look at it, what does this mean that the companies\u00a0 that are implementing AI today, right now, right now,\u00a0 these are the names that are gonna become the next leaders. The next Microsofts Apples Googles of the world. Okay?\u00a0 That\u2019s the basis of launching my cur AI newsletter. Okay?\u00a0 It\u2019s officially, I told\u00a0 you it was gonna have the launch date. It\u2019s gonna be on Tuesday, March 26th,\u00a0 so 7:00 PM on Tuesday\u00a0 and be holding a free web event, taking questions live,\u00a0 took everything about AI could register by going to\u00a0 www.CurzioAI.com. This is gonna be our third web event, which we\u2019re starting\u00a0 to do a lot because we\u2019re getting\u00a0 amazing reviews for these things. \u2019cause it\u2019s cool, it\u2019s real, it\u2019s not b******t. You\u2019re not reading something that you don\u2019t know who wrote. It\u2019s me. You see it, it it\u2019s, you know, the q and a lives\u00a0 and stuff like that and a live of events. It\u2019s really, really cool. I love doing live stuff. But the first two events that we did revolved around crypto\u00a0 and six months ago we highlighted\u00a0 how Bitcoin was trading at 25,000 was about surge. It was a hard sell because crypto was getting annihilated. That\u2019s why we discounted Crypto Intelligence. And people came in and I\u2019m glad they did. I mean Bitcoin surged and we said it was gonna surge\u00a0 because you\u2019re gonna have all these ETFs getting approved\u00a0 just before the halving and even after the halving. Bitcoin does fantastic\u00a0 and it\u2019s pulled back and it should pull back. It\u2019s up incredibly. And\u00a0 after the halving forget it,\u00a0 this thing\u2019s gonna go, it\u2019s gonna go. So then we had another event,\u00a0 which was only three months ago. And what do we say? Said Hey, if you\u2019re going going\u00a0 to own this stuff, right Bitcoin,\u00a0 we told you Bitcoin\u2019s gonna go higher. It\u2019s going higher. But you wanna own the alt coins. I mean the meme stocks, some of \u2019em up 10000%. I\u2019m not telling you if you wanna take a chance on some\u00a0 of them, you\u2019re not gonna see any of those\u00a0 in the newsletter. But when you look at these altcoins, right,\u00a0 that these utility tokens, they outperformed Bitcoin\u00a0 by three to one And over 18 month period after the halving. So start positioning yourself\u00a0 and we have 22 positions on our portfolio\u00a0 and as of Friday the average gain in these positions,\u00a0 the average even a couple loses in the portfolio\u00a0 is over 200%. I\u2019m not bringing this up to pat myself in the back. You guys know that I shouldn\u2019t, according\u00a0 to every marketing strategy\u00a0 and every book 1 0 1, never ever, you know,\u00a0 it\u2019s kinda like politicians never admit that you\u2019re wrong. I love going over my losers. I have more winners and losers. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t mind because you learn\u00a0 the most when you lose money. When, when you have those losers\u00a0 and you wanna figure out, what did I get wrong?\u00a0 \u2019cause that\u2019s gonna make you better\u00a0 and doing that over 30 years. Yes, you have lots of mistakes. So this is about patting myself on the back. What it\u2019s about is if you wanna be a great investor,\u00a0 you have to go to where the puck is going. We told you where the puck was going six months ago\u00a0 with Bitcoin and then three months\u00a0 after what everyone was, where the puck is at\u00a0 Bitcoin telling you to buy Bitcoin. We were telling you to buy all coins. Now everyone\u2019s telling you to buy alt coins when you\u2019re in\u00a0 them and up a lot When it comes\u00a0 to this event on Tuesday at 7:00 PM\u00a0 This is not about buying Nvidia super micro Meta, Google,\u00a0 Amazon, okay?\u00a0 That\u2019s where the puck is. That\u2019s what everybody\u2019s talking about. Who\u2019s the hardware companies are gonna benefit?\u00a0 Who the big companies gonna benefit? Who\u2019s it?\u00a0 It\u2019s not about that. This is gonna be about\u00a0 where the puck is going. And you need to understand that in this trend. \u2019cause it\u2019s one of the most fascinating trends\u00a0 that you see since the invention of the internet. It\u2019s here. There\u2019s no b******t around it. Okay?\u00a0 You have b******t trends. The ultimate confirmation of a trend that\u2019s not a fad\u00a0 is spending CapEx. Look at the amount of money that is pouring into this. Just look at NVIDIA\u2019s numbers. Holy s**t, we\u2019ve never seen anything like\u00a0 this ever, ever, ever. And there\u2019s a reason why\u00a0 because if you have the best systems,\u00a0 if you have the best services, now when you are working\u00a0 with cloud companies, whether it\u2019s AWS Azure, Microsoft,\u00a0 if it\u2019s Dell, notice how good Dells do. And even Hewlett Packer, you could\u00a0 throw in there some of these bigger names. They want, you wanna be able to combine your services,\u00a0 your AI systems with these companies. And that\u2019s why they need to get ahead of this. That\u2019s why they\u2019re spending so much money Now\u00a0 where the puck is going in that presentation. I promise you one thing I\u2019m gonna blow your f-ing mind out\u00a0 with the research that I\u2019ve uncovered. I haven\u2019t seen it everywhere. I mean people are talking about all\u00a0 kinds of things within AI, generative AI ChatGPT,\u00a0 this again, this isn\u2019t going to be about that. It is about the next wave, which is the small\u00a0 and mid-cap companies that are currently using AI\u00a0 that are already seeing an explosion\u00a0 in almost every single metric. And they\u2019re doing this while cutting their employees. And that\u2019s something as someone a covered financials all my\u00a0 life, you don\u2019t see, you have to spend money\u00a0 to make money when you\u2019re cutting 10% plus\u00a0 of your workforce, you\u2019re trying to save money,\u00a0 you\u2019re cutting costs, but yet you\u2019re seeing\u00a0 more productivity. The holy grail of every business\u00a0 that is happening with a few companies. \u2019cause there select companies that have been doing this over\u00a0 the past two years while everyone else is playing up. So one name recommending Curzio AI in the newsletter,\u00a0 Charles Sub\u2019s gonna have access to,\u00a0 it\u2019s in the healthcare industry. This is just one industry. And listen to this Competitors all over the place,\u00a0 even in Cramer\u2019s interview he mentioned it to in healthcare\u00a0 with Jensen and stuff like that. That was yesterday. They\u2019re all using AI\u00a0 because they\u2019re forced to be using AI\u00a0 because it\u2019s all about, you know,\u00a0 data discovery, all this stuff. And, but a lot of \u2019em are late to the party. Some of them are using raising capital\u00a0 and they\u2019re raising capital with unfavorable terms. \u2019cause then rates are really high. Some\u00a0 are using warrants or whatever. And they\u2019re buying like specific AI companies\u00a0 that you may not have heard of. Most of the best ones have been bought in the\u00a0 private market by the big guys. But they\u2019re incorporating AI into their businesses. And some of \u2019em are a little bit further along than others. And I\u2019m researching these going,\u00a0 wow, this is a pretty cool company. Wow, if this works happen, then all\u00a0 of a sudden I see a company trading\u00a0 at a massive, massive premium. This company doesn\u2019t generate really any revenue\u00a0 as a $500 million market cap. It\u2019s a company that\u2019s not gonna show up at any screens. And I found it just because I tell everyone,\u00a0 when you do your research and you find a stock pick\u00a0 that you really wanna buy within a specific industry,\u00a0 do comp analysis com, comparative analysis. \u2019cause chances are you might find another name\u00a0 that could be a little bit cheaper, has better technology\u00a0 that you never heard of or\u00a0 trust me it happens to be all the time. I\u2019m like, wow, this is a really good name. And then I see something else like this. This is a much better play\u00a0 and a lot of times it\u2019s not gonna be on anyone\u2019s radar. So this company, while all\u00a0 of its competitors are getting into AI\u00a0 and some of \u2019em are just exploring it,\u00a0 they\u2019ve been doing this for three years. So again, it\u2019s barely generating any revenue. So it looks crazy expensive\u00a0 and it\u2019s not showing up on any screens,\u00a0 but it just signed six partnerships. Two with big two big pharma companies\u00a0 That could, and this is from the company. It could result in $900 million plus in\u00a0 royalties inside few years. It\u2019s crazy considering it\u2019s a $500 million mark cap company. Now what does that mean? As someone\u00a0 that covers biotech when it comes to revenue,\u00a0 you could easily, easily, easily place,\u00a0 if you have a growing biotech company generating revenue\u00a0 easily a 10 times sales number on it easily. That\u2019s probably a conservative in biotech. And if you did that for this $500 million mark company\u00a0 and this forecast comes to fruition,\u00a0 this is a $10 billion plus company,\u00a0 which is a 20 x from here. I know you\u2019re like 20 x. That\u2019s b******t. You should, your b******t radar should go up when somebody\u00a0 says that you should. I\u2019ll be the first to tell you that. Until you see\u00a0 that the greatest tech investor in the world,\u00a0 which is my opinion, just took a stake\u00a0 in this company in February. And by the way, I love this name. Before finding that data point which was buried someplace\u00a0 wasn\u2019t as easy to find plus a CEO to founder. I\u2019m like, all right, these guys selling\u00a0 or the insider selling, you know, you have, you know,\u00a0 a company that that has gone up\u00a0 and it\u2019s $500 million market cap and it went higher\u00a0 and then it pulled back and they did a nice capital raise. \u2019cause they\u2019re spending a lot of money to build this system. \u2019cause it\u2019s state of the art. It\u2019s the whole entire package. It\u2019s not just a system where, hey, let me see some\u00a0 of your compounds, we\u2019ll throw this in here. Here\u2019s AI, this could work. They actually have a system where they take it\u00a0 and it\u2019s called a wet lab. And they use it\u00a0 with those compounds in a six week study along\u00a0 with all their data, through their learning, through AI. And now they formulate it and say, here you go Pfizer. Here you go Merck. Holy s**t. \u2019cause When you look at the healthcare industry,\u00a0 there\u2019s 16 million compounds in the libraries\u00a0 of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world. And what does that mean, right?\u00a0 These compounds, these little compounds, right?\u00a0 They, they stay on the shelves and you wanna\u00a0 mix and match those compounds. You can come up with the best drugs ever. However, you\u2019re not really pushing the issue\u00a0 because it costs over $2 billion\u00a0 and takes over 13 years to bring a new drug to market. I know we all, hell hate the healthcare companies. I understand we all hate \u2019em, especially through COVID. You had like Pfizer getting bribes. The FDA you have, you know, the, the prices\u00a0 that these guys charge you. You never want to cure. You want a treatment only, you know,\u00a0 again, these guys are\u00a0 businesses and they wanna generate money. I think the US outside of one other country,\u00a0 only two countries, I think that,\u00a0 that allow healthcare companies to advertise in the media. And correct me if I\u2019m wrong on that, I\u2019m pretty sure. But with those costs, 2 billion\u00a0 to bring a new drug to market. with over 2 billion in costs. This company through its AI platform right now that works,\u00a0 is cutting the preclinical time to bring a drug\u00a0 to market from five years\u00a0 that preclinical stage to two years. And that preclinical costs from 45 million to $15 million. Take a second and think of the possibilities. How will not every single big pharma company use\u00a0 this small company\u2019s platform?\u00a0 A service that shortened the timeframe to bring a drug\u00a0 to market from 13\u00a0 and a half years to say overall maybe eight or nine. And that guys, it\u2019s a real f*****g big deal considering\u00a0 these patents are only for 20 years. So the time they come to the market,\u00a0 and that\u2019s an average of 13\u00a0 and a half year, it could take 15 years. Imagine how much money you make every single\u00a0 year that you\u2019re able to save. Not to mention the cost to bring it to market. I mean you see tens of billions of dollars\u00a0 and more sales just by using this company. What is that worth to the biggest\u00a0 pharmaceutical companies in the world?\u00a0 That\u2019s why they\u2019re all going into AI. Now this is one company in one industry\u00a0 that become the next Amgen, the next Eli Lilly,\u00a0 the next a hundred billion Eli Lilly may be the first\u00a0 trillion dollar healthcare mark cap company. But these are the ideas\u00a0 that are gonna make their way into the Curzio AI newsletter. And the first newsletter that I\u2019m launching in seven years,\u00a0 I just launched newsletters on every trend. I believe it\u2019s something. The last one was crypto. Look where we are on crypto. It\u2019s gonna be different from\u00a0 almost every other newsletter out there that covers AI. Since the names even the one I just meant you,\u00a0 you\u2019re not gonna see, it\u2019s not gonna show up on on screens. It requires lots of working hours. It requires lots of digging with this name. I found by researching for the companies\u00a0 before this in detail,\u00a0 before OneNote had this one as a comparison, I\u2019m like,\u00a0 why is this one trading at such a high premium?\u00a0 What, what\u2019s going on here? Again,\u00a0 that should not be a red flag. That should be like, let me see why\u00a0 this company\u2019s trading at such expense valuation. What kind of technology that they have\u00a0 that people are paying such a high premium. And it may be nothing and that might be a good short,\u00a0 but you should be digging when you see\u00a0 expensive companies don\u2019t run. I used to run and I missed so many. I missed the Apples and the Microsoft when I was\u00a0 younger, I missed them. I didn\u2019t get it. I didn\u2019t get it. I didn\u2019t understand Netflix. I didn\u2019t understand. I I compare them to a cable company. It\u2019s trained three times if outta a cable\u00a0 company, why am I gonna buy it for?\u00a0 Because they\u2019re not competing against cable companies. Every single cable company was competing against Netflix. They own the pie. Tesla owns the pie\u00a0 for EVs it\u00a0 where they\u2019re bigger than all the mark caps combined while\u00a0 everyone\u2019s trying to get in now they can\u2019t even get in\u00a0 and trust me, Tesla, it\u2019s on a downturn\u00a0 and low on prices sort\u00a0 of first cyber truck the other day too. It it, it reminded me of, of the $6 million Man was it,\u00a0 it was something from that old, almost like a, you know,\u00a0 night rider that tank, that kit fought it. It just looks like a, it looks like a toaster. It was just like, but people are gonna buy it\u00a0 and they\u2019re gonna be all right Tesla, they\u2019ll be fine. A little bit of a downturn. Now we\u00a0 know EVs and stuff like that. I think Rivian is gonna be fine as well. Great company. But that\u2019s how you have to value some\u00a0 of these companies when you look at them\u00a0 it\u2019s like don\u2019t look at them as a comparison to, you know,\u00a0 how I could take market share. They\u2019re becoming the pie and everyone\u2019s looking. Take market share from them. That\u2019s when you change your landscape. That\u2019s why I love looking at models. To me it\u2019s fascinating. I mean my boring s**t to you, I don\u2019t know. To me it\u2019s fascinating \u2019cause that\u2019s\u00a0 what you find the greatest ideas\u00a0 and this is an opportunity\u00a0 to find some of the greatest ideas. \u2019cause there\u2019s, companies have been doing this\u00a0 for three years that have been partnered with Nvidia\u00a0 for three years talking about. But no one\u2019s really paying attention\u00a0 \u2019cause they\u2019re small caps and everyone loves the big guys\u00a0 especially over the past few years since COVID\u00a0 own seven larger stocks\u00a0 and disappear now 35% of, of the market. And I got news for you that numbers,\u00a0 that percentage gonna go a lot higher. So you\u2019re looking at AI newsletter, these are the ideas,\u00a0 it\u2019s small mid caps going deep into them. And I\u2019m gonna show you during this event how deep I go. I\u2019m not gonna make it boring. And you don\u2019t have to do s**t. You don\u2019t have to do any of this. I\u2019m doing it for you. All you have to do is recommend the stock. I\u2019m gonna tell you re just buy the stock I tell you to buy,\u00a0 which I\u2019m gonna be investing in these personally as well\u00a0 do also could be sampling new AI technologies,\u00a0 which are coming out like every single week. It\u2019s fascinating. Exclusive interviews. I\u2019m taping one a little bit later today. That person happens to be the director\u00a0 of AI for the Mayo Clinic. It doesn\u2019t get better than that. Looking for new ideas. I was on the phone an hour for this guy. I could been on the phone for for three hours with him. It just, I felt terrible. I was asking so many questions\u00a0 like I gotta do an interview with you. These are gonna be exclusive interviews for the newsletter. Maybe we\u2019ll offer a glimpse of that of\u00a0 what he\u2019s saying on, on on Tuesday. I\u2019m taping it later. And look, I\u2019m not gonna BS you\u00a0 and you look at Tuesday\u2019s AI event. It it, it\u2019s gonna be roll around selling our,\u00a0 our new product Kurzi AI, right?\u00a0 It\u2019s the first newsletter again. I launched at seven years. Yes, attendees are gonna get a special deal since\u00a0 we\u2019re only marketing this to Curzio followers. We\u2019re not, you know, you\u2019re not seeing this in on Yahoo\u00a0 Finance or anything like that. But you don\u2019t have to buy anything. I just want you to attend the event. It\u2019s free. It\u2019s gonna be a quick presentation. You\u2019re gonna sit back, take all your questions live. Daniel\u2019s gonna be here with me as well. Daniel Creech taste,\u00a0 Wall Street Unplugged Premium with me all the time. Lots of compliments on him, which is cool. We sit here, it\u2019s fun. I\u2019ll be drinking beers, hanging out. And a lot of times the last two times we did this\u00a0 with the webinar, a lot of people stayed on,\u00a0 which is rare with these events. You say, okay, I got the event. All right, I got the off. Okay, I\u2019m gone. But it\u2019s really cool\u00a0 because we\u2019re answering all the questions. You get to ask the questions live\u00a0 and you know, look, I\u2019m independent. Nobody owns me. I\u2019m gonna tell you how it is. Sometimes that might hurt your feelings,\u00a0 but I\u2019m not gonna b******t you. You could say Frank\u2019s an idiot. I don\u2019t agree with his opinion. He\u2019s a effing idiot. But what you\u2019ll never say is I don\u2019t trust him. I\u2019m gonna tell you exactly how I feel. I\u2019m gonna tell you what names to avoid, which there\u2019s some\u00a0 of them are definitely in your portfolio right now\u00a0 that you have to be really, really careful. And I\u2019ll tell you why. Tell you why. It\u2019s actually gonna be one of our, our, our bonus reports\u00a0 of AI names to avoid. \u2019cause some of those you could say are in a bubble. Definitely in a bubble. You attend this event, you ask questions,\u00a0 you\u2019re gonna see stuff that you\u2019re not\u00a0 seeing any place else. And trust me, it\u2019s gonna blow your mind\u00a0 because it doesn\u2019t, it\u2019s not easy to blow my mind. I\u2019ve seen everything I\u2019ve seen Wall Street,\u00a0 where Wall Street is designed\u00a0 to always f**k the retail investor. It\u2019s how do we get the retail the most excited\u00a0 to sell them all the crap that we could dump to them. That\u2019s Wall Street. That\u2019s it. I\u2019ve been there, I didn\u2019t do that but I\u2019ve been there. That\u2019s what SPACs are about. That\u2019s what so many of these companies are about. It\u2019s all about, you know, getting retail investors\u00a0 so excited about something where they\u2019re not even gonna\u00a0 look at the fundamentals or anything. They\u2019re just gonna buy this s**t. And you have guys like Chamath and hedge fund managers\u00a0 and Branson buying 10 jets\u00a0 after telling everyone, wow, you know, we\u2019re all going\u00a0 to space and this company\u2019s great\u00a0 and selling it 35, it\u2019s a dollar, it\u2019s going outta business. Virgin Galactic. That\u2019s the s**t you have to contend with. That\u2019s why I do this. Seriously. I don\u2019t have to work. I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t have to do this. I\u2019ve done well enough in\u00a0 my life where I could just do one podcast\u00a0 and say okay, I\u2019m gonna shut the business and that\u2019s it. But I\u2019m passionate about this\u00a0 and there\u2019s tens of millions of people, million\u00a0 that want someone out there they could actually listen to\u00a0 that they could trust. You don\u2019t have to agree with everything I say, that\u2019s fine. Just being able to trust someone and say, okay, I get it. I mean holy s**t, if an industry isn\u2019t,\u00a0 I\u2019ve never seen an industry of more dire need than\u00a0 that right now, ever. There\u2019s just so much b******t out there\u00a0 and it\u2019s insane and it\u2019s crazy. That\u2019s the industry, unfortunately the industry I\u2019m in,\u00a0 where sometimes we get lumped with that b******t,\u00a0 which p****s me off\u00a0 when you\u2019re looking at, at this industry\u00a0 and AI, You have to have\u00a0 to have to have money allocated\u00a0 to the sector in the right areas. You could own Nvidia. I\u2019m not saying not to own Nvidia,\u00a0 I\u2019m just saying you\u2019re not gonna be a\u00a0 millionaire buying Nvidia here. Even if you bought it last\u00a0 year, you\u2019d be up a hundred percent. You\u2019re not gonna be a millionaire. It\u2019s not gonna be like 20, 30 x to to move the needle. Some of these stocks, they\u2019re\u00a0 probably gonna go a lot higher. But it\u2019s a small ones\u00a0 that are not gonna have AI in their name,\u00a0 that are not gonna have divisions of AI that they can say,\u00a0 Hey, we generated X millions because of AI. It\u2019s how they\u2019re using AI within these divisions. And you\u2019re going to see the earnings explode. You\u2019re gonna see sales explode, you see margins go higher\u00a0 and the cost get cut. And I\u2019m gonna show examples of this where it\u2019s hard to find,\u00a0 but when you see it, you\u2019re gonna be like ho,\u00a0 like things I haven\u2019t seen for 30 years\u00a0 covering the fundamentals. That\u2019s why I\u2019m like w whoa, what happened to Microsoft?\u00a0 How did Microsoft lay off? 13% of it,\u00a0 its employees cut CapEx by 4 billion\u00a0 and see almost a tripling in earnings\u00a0 that never, ever, ever happens. You don\u2019t see that. How did it happen?\u00a0 And that\u2019s how you find these companies. When you look under the hood, there\u2019s a lot\u00a0 of opportunities out there to be\u00a0 next Microsoft Apples and videos. I\u2019m gonna show you exactly how did it significantly\u00a0 increase your odds of finding one of these, holding them\u00a0 buying and holding them and just forgetting about them. And there\u2019s small caps\u00a0 that are gonna start taking market share from the\u00a0 big caps from bigger names. I\u2019m not talking about the big technology companies are\u00a0 so big and positioned so well,\u00a0 but there\u2019s industry leaders across all these sectors\u00a0 that are late to the party. And these smaller names are just, they\u2019re starting\u00a0 to spend a lot of money in getting into,\u00a0 they\u2019re more nimble, they\u2019re, they\u00a0 can make decisions a lot quicker. It\u2019s less bureaucratic from these small companies\u00a0 that is these big companies and convincing the right person. I\u2019ve seen that even in the drug discovery area\u00a0 where one company I had a while ago in one\u00a0 of our newsletters is like AI\u2019s b******t. Now he is like, oh, oh, you know,\u00a0 no we\u2019re gonna get into AI. Well there\u2019s nine companies now that are into it\u00a0 and the one company I\u2019m recommending\u00a0 has been in for three years. You\u2019re late, you\u2019re in trouble,\u00a0 you\u2019re gonna lose market share now you gotta make a big\u00a0 splash, a big move. Buy AI, buy a company,\u00a0 maybe buy this company or tr whatever. But when you fall behind now if you fall behind,\u00a0 this isn\u2019t something, oh well they\u2019re doing something in\u00a0 three years this is gonna happen. You could fall behind immediately. Apple is the biggest company\u00a0 and the greatest company on the planet\u00a0 and in six months you saw all these other technology\u00a0 companies significantly outperformed the biggest\u00a0 because they were a few months late on AI. Few months with the biggest company\u00a0 with a hundred billion at its fingertips to spend\u00a0 and to buy anything they want. That\u2019s how effing quick this is moving\u00a0 that should have you excite as an investor, just have\u00a0 to know where to look in the right areas. And I\u2019m gonna show you that on Tuesday. So it\u2019s next Tuesday, March 26th, 7:00 PM I was going\u00a0 to do it this Thursday. However, it\u2019s the most important day in the world,\u00a0 which is opening day of March Madness. And I\u2019m like, there\u2019s no way for my sake\u00a0 or everyone else\u2019s sake that I\u2019d have that then,\u00a0 even though you\u2019d be able to watch a\u00a0 replay a couple days later or whatever. Uh, but I don\u2019t care how exciting the event would be,\u00a0 it\u2019s not gonna be more exciting than basketball\u00a0 and open day of the big dance,\u00a0 which you guys know that I love. Okay, speaking of March Madness,\u00a0 I dunno if I should give you my final four picks\u00a0 because I taped a special podcast yesterday,\u00a0 so it\u2019s on iTunes and I cover it. It\u2019s like 15 minutes really in depth details. Uh, my Final four does not include any number one teams\u00a0 and only includes one number two team. And I think I have candidates go into Sweet 16\u00a0 \u2019cause they\u2019re supposed supposed to get both\u00a0 of their best players back. And when they\u2019re at full strength, they beat Houston,\u00a0 they beat Tennessee, they, they beat Connecticut. You know, something like you, they\u2019re not gonna lose\u00a0 as quick as everybody believes. They lost the last few games. But I just found out yesterday\u00a0 night that one of their top players, their top player,\u00a0 which not Dickinson, it\u2019s McCullough, is not going to play\u00a0 for the tournament, which is a big deal. I mean, Natalie\u2019s the leading score,\u00a0 he\u2019s the best defender on the team\u00a0 and there\u2019s a shot that they could lose in the first round. But other than that, a lot of analysis, a lot\u00a0 of details go to iTunes. And again, you can really see me get into it. And I will say this, if you have a spouse\u00a0 that\u2019s not into college basketball,\u00a0 have them fill out a bracket this year. I mean, the parody this year is incredible. I mean, so much so if you look, and I\u2019ve never seen this\u00a0 and I watched college basketball for 40 years. Can 51 May maybe 45 years. I mean, that\u2019s been my life basketball\u00a0 such a long time before this. Uh, I\u2019ve never seen like the top three teams lose\u00a0 the top three or four\u00a0 or the four number one seats\u00a0 lost on the way into the tournament. Usually they win their tournaments. But it\u2019s not just that they lost Houston lost\u00a0 by 30 to Iowa State. They were supposedly the best team. Probably gonna be number one seat head of Connecticut. Okay?\u00a0 Number one seat Purdue lost a Wisconsin. Wisconsin is a s**t show. That team\u2019s terrible. That team\u2019s terrible. They\u2019ve been terrible all year. And by the way, Virginia making that tournament over St. John\u2019s is an effing joke. It\u2019s an effing joke. I mean, St.\u00a0 John\u2019s won the last seven games. They did everything required of them. And then they came down to the last game playing Connecticut\u00a0 and they lost by five to the best team in the nation on a\u00a0 neutral court by five. If you look at the last eight games from from Connecticut,\u00a0 they blew out every single team other than St.\u00a0 John\u2019s. They\u2019re averaging 90 points a game. I, this is a team that could have\u00a0 made a massive, massive run. And just to see Virginia, really? Virginia, come on. Six Mountain West teams come on. Three biggest team. Come on. That\u2019s just my rant. Nothing else. You had Purdue lost to Wisconsin\u00a0 and then North Carolina lost to North Carolina State. North Carolina State was terrible. Now they made this amazing run. How doesn\u2019t North Carolina win that game?\u00a0 And they, it wasn\u2019t close. They got a beaten. These are three of them won seats. And then you have Yukon who was in the Big East\u00a0 who really wasn\u2019t that good this year. And Yukon is not better than they were last year. It\u2019s very difficult to repeat. And they are by far in the hardest bracket of four teams\u00a0 that could actually win coming out of that bracket. So it\u2019s the only hint,\u00a0 only little tease I\u2019m gonna give you to listen to it again. It\u2019s on there. My final four picks. People like to listen. I like the Super Bowl where I get it wrong all the time. And I tell you guys so you can make money off of my pick. I think I was, three times in the past 13 years\u00a0 for a Super Bowl when it comes to, college basketball. It\u2019s a little different. Uh,\u00a0 but yeah, you\u2019ll have fun with that. And take a look at my picks again, no number one seeds,\u00a0 which you\u2019re not gonna see out there and it should be fun,\u00a0 but have someone that doesn\u2019t really have a lot\u00a0 of knowledge of college basketball. Don\u2019t fill a bracket out\u00a0 because they are eight, nine seeds\u00a0 that could beat one seeds. It, it\u2019s, there\u2019s a lot of really, really, really good,\u00a0 good teams out there that could beat number one seats. Uh, so it should be fun. I\u2019m looking forward to that tournament. But more\u00a0 importantly, I\u2019m also looking forward to next Tuesday,\u00a0\u00a0 and a and you can register for that event at Curzioai.com. Uh, gonna have a lot of fun. Probably talk about it a little bit more in tomorrow\u2019s\u00a0 podcast, which is Wall Street Unplugged Premium. But definitely take a look at some of the stories, some\u00a0 of the things happened at the video conference. \u2019cause it really, really is exciting. I wanna get too technical. It\u2019s my job to read all the s**t,\u00a0 analyze it, try to explain it to you,\u00a0 to understand hopefully I did that today,\u00a0 but I\u2019m really gonna do that on Tuesday. But, um, there\u2019s some amazing announcements. Uh, and you could see why they\u2019re light\u00a0 years ahead of everybody else. I mean, if you look at AMD AMD\u2019s expected\u00a0 to generate $3 billion off of AI over the next 12 months,\u00a0 and NVIDIA\u2019s expected to generate a hundred billion. So, you know, for, for those of you buying AMD up here\u00a0 with those expectations, that it\u2019s, you know,\u00a0 they\u2019re gotta be able to compete with Nvidia. They\u2019re not, they\u2019re not just be careful. Expectations are so freaking high for AMD right now. They can go higher and can keep going higher and go higher\u00a0 and higher and go up another 300%. I\u2019m just saying that they\u2019re not Nvidia NVIDIA\u2019s a cheaper\u00a0 company growing much faster, seeing the results\u00a0 and AMD doesn\u2019t have what Nvidia has. This whole ecosystem around all their hardware\u00a0 that everyone\u2019s falling in love with\u00a0 and they\u2019re all building this stuff. It\u2019s gonna be really hard for anyone else to compete,\u00a0 especially for a long, long time. So really cool stuff. Looking forward to that presentation, that webinar.
