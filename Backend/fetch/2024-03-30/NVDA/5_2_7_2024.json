    "text": "There aren\u2019t any surprises in my Nvidia\u00a0NVDA stock forecast. It was one of the best-performing names of 2023, with a\u00a0staggering gain of more than 240% and this year is off to a good start with shares up more than 33% Nvidia has been riding high on the booming demand for its artificial intelligence solutions, and it seems like the company could continue to do for the foreseeable future, despite claims that the AI \u201ccraze\u201d may be blown out of proportion. Below are three reasons why I forecast NVDA\u2019s shares to rise above $700 in February. A NVDA Stock Forecast: The AI Factor Nvidia dominates in both gaming GPUs and AI chips. Nvidia dominates about 81% of the market for AI chips used in cloud and data centers. Nvidia\u2019s TensorRT software\u00a0enables fast and efficient inference\u00a0of AI models on edge devices. Despite many Wall Street analysts now saying the AI \u201ccraze\u201d is overblown, businesses in both the United States and elsewhere will probably not temper their demand for these kinds of computing products. Sure, there are businesses certainly playing into the hype of AI to sell certain \u201cAI-enhanced\u201d products, but that still guarantees there will be demand for the chips that make these products work. Nvidia\u00a0announced a $1 billion deal\u00a0to provide India-based companies with its AI chips. This is likely just the beginning of the effect these chips will have on the international stage. Chip Demand to Increase in 2024 To have a sense of chip demand, the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company\u00a0TSM and its business outlook is a great indicator. TSMC is behind the manufacturing of advanced silicon from Nvidia and its competitors, and the contract chip manufacturing has consecutively provided the market with positive news. Last year, in their\u00a0Q3 earnings report, TSM not only boosted revenue guidance but also predicted the \u201cchip slump\u201d was coming to an end. Similarly, in January, CEO C.C. Wei\u00a0mentioned\u00a0the company would return to growth in 2024 due to an overwhelming demand for AI chips, definitively marking the bottom of the chip maker slump. Nvidia will undoubtedly benefit from this demand TSMC\u2019s foresees, and the company will also be a beneficiary of the ending chip slump. While Nvidia\u2019s P/E multiple is high, it\u2019s not stretched thin Nvidia\u2019s stock is trading at a record high, but its forward P/E ratio is well below where it was 12 months ago. Then, the stock was trading at over 54.2x forward earnings. Nowadays, the chip maker\u2019s stock trades for just 33.8x forward earnings. During the height of the AI craze in 2023, Nvidia\u2019s multiple went as a high as 69.7x forward earnings. That\u2019s all to say, despite Nvidia\u2019s valuation looking expensive, it is much less than it was in prior months. Given the extent to which Nvidia could profit from businesses adopting AI solutions, the chipmaker\u2019s current multiple is likely justified.
