Per Briefing.com, Street consensus expects $4.59 in EPS on $20.4 billion in revenue. (Clients have no direct investment in NVDA shares, but instead are long primarily through QQQ and SMH.) Walmart (WMT) reports Tuesday morning, February 20, 2024, before the opening bell. When Walmart reported their Q3 \u201924 in mid-November \u201923, the stock fell from $170 to $150 in the days following on a gross margin miss, and some not very well-explained one-time litigation charges. Here is this blog\u2019s earnings preview for Walmart\u2019s Q4 \u201924 (ends January \u201924). Like Alphabet (GOOG) (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META), Walmart is getting into advertising, which could help margins over and above what AI and supply chain automation might achieve in terms of margin expansion. S&P 500 data: Summary/conclusion: Some say Q4 \u201923 earnings season unofficially ends this week, and this clip from this blog\u2019s quarterly EPS and rev growth rate from LSEG\u2019s \u201cearnings scorecard\u201d shows that expected Q4 \u201923 EPS growth rate is now 9.6% versus 4.4% expected in early January \u201924. Q4 \u201923 earnings wound up much stronger than expected for Q4 \u201923, on mainly inline revenue growth.  Look at that round trip in \u201cexpected\u201d S&P 500 EPS growth starting at the peak on 9/30/23, and then through Friday, 2/16/24. This happens more than you think. Thursday night, February 15th\u2019s earnings reports from Applied Materials (AMAT), Trade Desk (TTD) and Coinbase (COIN) were very strong. It would be great to see Nvidia pull back 10% this week, but with AMAT\u2019s report it also tells me \u201cold semis\u201d like Applied, Micron (MU) are still in the good part of the cycle. The 2nd half of February calendar returns have not been great. I was trying to find the bar chart with 100 years of history on how/where the 2nd half of February returns were displayed (couldn\u2019t find it) but it\u2019s one of the worst 2-week periods of the year. The S&P 500, the Nasdaq 100 and QQQ could use a good flush. None of this is advice or a recommendation. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Investing can involve the loss of principal, even with short time horizons. Readers should gauge their own comfort with portfolio volatility and adjust accordingly. Thanks for reading.
