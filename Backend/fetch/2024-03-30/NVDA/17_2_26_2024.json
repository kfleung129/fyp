But it was nothing compared to the US, where one single stock (obviously, you know which one) was responsible for a vast majority of the gains for major indices. Nvidia\u2019s (NVDA) blowout earnings results fuelled a fresh buying frenzy on Wall Street, where the S&P 500 index surpassed the 5,100 milestone for the first time to set a new record. The Nasdaq hit a fresh all-time high on Friday, as Nvidia\u2019s valuation topped $2 trillion, becoming the first chipmaker to achieve this feat. However, as the session wore on, tech stocks started to ease back, before closing near their lows. This caused the major US indices to post some not-so-bullish-looking candles on their charts, suggesting we could see some weakness on Monday. What\u2019s Next for Stocks? Thursday saw Nvidia experience a remarkable one-day surge. The rally propelled its market capitalization to $277 billion, marking the largest single-session increase in value ever recorded, surpassing Meta's recent $197 billion gain. But after the not-so-strong close on Friday, this has raised question marks about the potential sustainability of this tech-driven rally and its ability to extend across other sectors. Investors are wondering what the diminishing expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts, fuelled by robust data indicating continued strength in the world's largest economy, may mean for stocks going forward. With over-stretched price-to-earnings ratios, many stocks in the tech sector are at risk of giving back some gains. Yet, so far, every dip has been bought, pointing to an insatiable appetite for risk. Let\u2019s see if that changes in the week ahead. With most of the earnings now out of the way, the odds of early rate cuts slashed, and equity benchmarks hitting record highs in a period that historically has not been great for the markets, even the most bullish investors may feel that a correction, even if it turns out to be a small one, is warranted. In a healthy bull market, giving back is never a bad thing. Magnificent 7 Charts Point to Caution The rally in stocks moderated on Friday, as investors presumably took profit on their long positions that they had accumulated during the week, knowing full well there is always the possibility of a correction at these elevated levels.\u00a0 Traders are now left wondering, whether to continue buying any small dips they see or start looking for shorting opportunities once there is a concrete bearish signal to work with. Looking at the charts of the big tech giants, Friday\u2019s price action does warrant some caution for the week ahead. Source: TradingView.com Nasdaq 100 Technical Analysis Source: TradingView.com The Nasdaq formed an inverted hammer on the daily time frame on Friday, which is a warning sign that the bullish trend may have reached exhaustion after a relentless rally. It calls for bullish caution but is not necessarily an indication that the market has topped. The bears need to see a lower low form below last week\u2019s low at 17315 before they can become confident that a peak has been reached. Standing on the way of that level is key support at 17660. This is the area the bulls will need to defend this week if they want to maintain this bullish trend and lift the Nasdaq to a new all-time high. However, if that 17315 level breaks down, then a potential drop to test the December high at 16970 could be on the cards, with the November 2011 high coming at 16769. So, at minimum, I am expecting to see a small pullback this week but have clear plans in case the bears take charge. For now, we can only assume that the retreat is a normal pullback you see in a healthy bullish trend. Let the charts guide you and leave emotions and what \u201cshould\u201d happen aside.
