    "text": "With the reinvigorated interest in artificial intelligence (AI) technology, decentralized platforms that offer related services are facing increased demand, including Render (RNDR), the leading provider of decentralized GPU-based rendering and AI digital rights management solutions. As it happens, the Render Network\u2019s native token is currently witnessing massive gains in anticipation of the largest AI and GPU technology event of the year, NVIDIA GTC 2024, which will take place on March 18-21 in San Jose, California, and host Render\u2019s founder and CEO, Jules Urbach. [1/4] This week\u2019s BTN previews #GTC24, the largest AI and GPU technology event of the year.Read more to learn about breakthroughs in AI and GPU technology that are coming to GTC as well as the details of @julesurbach\u2019s talk featuring @rendernetwork!https://t.co/J8lSTKT1Pd According to the company\u2019s blog post, Urbach will be giving his first live talk at GTC24 since before the COVID-19 pandemic and plans to discuss the future and advancements in the field of distributed GPU computing that the Render Network has been developing. As the blog reads: \u201cIn this year\u2019s talk, (\u2026) Jules will unveil an updated vision for the future of generative AI, spatial media and decentralized GPU computing technologies. The talk explores how underlying GPU technologies can reshape various fields including gaming, visual effects, media, design, in the 2020\u2019s and beyond.\u201d Furthermore, the event, organized by the AI computing behemoth Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), will also feature other major names from the industry, including NEAR Protocol (NEAR) co-founder Illia Polosukhin, OpenAI COO Brad Lightcap and others, who will be showcasing the integration possibilities between blockchain and AI. Upon confirmation that its CEO will attend the conference, the price of RNDR has witnessed a substantial increase that saw it briefly trade above $10 before slightly retracing to the current $9.94, which still represents a 31.74% advance in the last week and a 127.90% gain on its monthly chart, as of data on March 8. Ultimately, this is a good sign for RNDR, which suffered a blow after the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) placed it on the \u201cproblematic\u201d token list last year, and the recent developments might position it as the \u2018Nvidia of crypto,\u2019 as it could become an essential AI infrastructure provider.
