The integration of artificial intelligence and the financial sector might seem like a new development, but it actually has historic roots. \u201cIt\u2019s important to understand that AI has been in banking for decades,\u201d says Malcolm deMayo, vice president of financial services at NVIDIA. \u201cFinancial services have been leveraging machine learning and early versions of neural nets for a long time.\u201d From its early applications to its current sophisticated algorithms, AI has been a steadfast companion in shaping the financial industry's strategies and operations. Its multifaceted use cases, spanning predictive analysis, risk management, and personalized customer experiences, are a testament to its enduring significance. As IT decision makers begin 2024, organizations are expected to use AI to provide better customer experiences, address talent shortages, and improve their ESG sustainability and environmental frameworks, according to NVIDIA\u2019s survey of nearly 500 financial professionals. \u00a0Here\u2019s what you need to know about these three AI use-cases: Click the banner to learn how to effectively leverage your data for more data analytics success. Financiers recognize the cost reduction that AI introduces. More than a third of survey respondents said that AI led to operational efficiencies, and 20 percent said AI reduced the total cost of ownership in 2023. AI can also offer banks better computing power. According to deMayo, \u201cThe traditional computing that\u2019s in every bank\u2019s data center will not run AI efficiently.\u201d But creative tech solutions can support data needs: NVIDIA\u2019s new GPU and software library helped lower the cost of inference by a factor of four, deMayo says. AI can also reduce costs by supporting workload portability for use across hybrid cloud infrastructures, enhancing customer service, and building stronger fraud detection and prevention tools. AI can also help IT leaders identify and derive value from their investment in technology. \u201cThere\u2019s an opportunity to unlock value,\u201d deMayo says, both across internal initiatives and in customer-facing endeavors.

Accelerated large language models make chatbots more effective and less frustrating, increasing customer satisfaction. \u201cBanks have customers who are expecting the same kinds of experiences they get when they jump on their retail e-commerce experience,\u201d deMayo says. \u201cAI gives a very big set of capabilities to help banks deliver on that customer experience desire.\u201d The loads of data that financial institutions handle can be put to more effective use with AI. \u201cWe\u2019re helping them shift through mountains of social news, financial news and financial reports to discover patterns, trends and ideas that they can trade against so that they can deliver more value to their customers.\u201d RELATED: What questions should financial services companies be asking about AI? Many financial institutions are experiencing a labor shortage and are either spending time recruiting the most qualified AI experts or allocating resources to upskill current employees. But using AI technology to improve these labor challenges can help. \u201cThere\u2019s an opportunity to leverage AI as a teacher that can teach at the pace of the individual,\u201d deMayo says, potentially enabling cross-training and upskilling among current employees in addition to onboarding new workers. For example, large language models have the capacity to improve education in banking \u2014 for consumers as well as for employees. DeMayo points to algorithmic trading as a basic example of how financiers have long deployed tech to amplify results. \u201cFinancial institutions have a lot of smart people, and they\u2019ve been using technology that enables them to offer their services for a very long time,\u201d he says. Malcolm deMayo\nVice President of Financial Services, NVIDIA But AI isn\u2019t just about the numbers; it\u2019s about the ethos and principles organizations use as well. In NVIDIA\u2019s 2023 report, 72 percent of respondents said their company understood the ethical issues surrounding AI. And over 10 percent of NVIDIA survey respondents reported that sustainability, social and governance configure into their AI plans. \u201cSustainable computing needs to be something that every organization in financial services is thinking about,\u201d deMayo says. \u201cEnergy usage is an area where we\u2019ve made big strides.\u201d On the whole, AI represents a great deal of opportunities for finance to improve productivity, reduce costs and generate new revenue streams. \u201cAll of the use cases are exciting,\u201d says deMayo.
