    "text": "Home \u00bb Investing Many contrarian investors follow this mindset: buy what\u2019s on the last page of the financial media \u2014 not what\u2019s on the first page. Thus, if you\u2019re a forward-looking contrarian investor who follows this principle, then your focus shouldn\u2019t be on NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), which was front-page news in 2023. Instead, you should look for the next company to take an early lead in a potential hyper-growth industry, much like NVIDIA did. IonQ (NYSE:IONQ) could very well be that company in 2024. It\u2019s off most people\u2019s radars today and is definitely on the last page in the financial press \u2014 if the company is even mentioned at all. In fact, IonQ also has a tie-in with an e-commerce company that you\u2019re undoubtedly quite familiar with. Let\u2019s delve into this intriguing technology company, which could demonstrate NVIDIA-like growth in 2024. For a moment, consider what made NVIDIA so special last year. The company had already been manufacturing processors and accelerators that could be used to power artificial intelligence (AI) applications. Then ChatGPT suddenly boosted the popularity of generative AI, and NVIDIA gained favor on Wall Street for what it was already doing: making powerful generative AI-compatible chips. In the same way, IonQ could become a darling of the market for continuing to do what it was already doing. Specifically, IonQ advances quantum-computing technology and develops extremely fast and powerful supercomputers. You might be thinking right now that quantum computing isn\u2019t a hot topic right now. However, generative AI wasn\u2019t a hot topic at the beginning of 2023, and look what happened next. Furthermore, IonQ might be on the last page of the news, but it has the potential to move its way up to the first page. Not long ago, Fast Company honored IonQ by adding it to its third annual\u00a0list of the Next Big Things in Tech. The press release announcing that honor mentions an important point. IonQ has a $25.5 million project with the U.S. Air Force Research Lab. With this contract, the company is tasked with deploying \u201ctwo barium-based trapped ion quantum computing systems for quantum networking research and application development.\u201d This shows that IonQ isn\u2019t just a flash-in-the-pan startup business. The Air Force wouldn\u2019t trust just any company with such an important project. In the private sector, IonQ has worked with the likes of Hyundai Motor (OTCMKTS:HYMTF), Airbus and General Electric\u2019s (NYSE:GE) GE Research. Thus, both the public and private sectors have demonstrated interest in pursuing the latest and greatest in quantum computing. Moreover, IonQ never ceases to advance its ultra-powerful computers. Recently, the company celebrated a milestone moment, \u201cachiev[ing] 29 algorithmic qubits on a barium platform for the first time.\u201d Qubits can be thought of as a basic building block for measurement in quantum computing. It\u2019s perfectly fine if you don\u2019t understand the ins and outs of supercomputers, as you can still appreciate the landscape-altering possibilities of IonQ\u2019s industry-leading quantum-computing systems. It\u2019s practically indisputable that having a tie-in with e-commerce giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a major coup for small-to-midsized businesses. Consequently, it\u2019s a huge win for IonQ that its Forte quantum computer is now available through Amazon\u2019s Braket Direct program. IonQ\u2019s press release clarifies that Amazon Braket is a \u201cfully managed quantum computing service from Amazon Web Services (AWS).\u201d As you may be aware, AWS is Amazon\u2019s well-known cloud-computing platform. Literally and figuratively, Braket Direct is the Amazon of quantum-computing products. As Amazon Braket General Manager Richard Moulds explains, Braket Direct provides its customers with \u201caccess to quantum technologies needed to build expertise, and expand their research and development horizon.\u201d Getting Forte listed on Braket Direct will undoubtedly increase IonQ\u2019s exposure to quantum-computing specialists and to the public at large. It\u2019s a win-win for IonQ and Amazon but also for the broad range of industries that could benefit from supercomputers in the future. Moulds mentioned some of these industries: \u201cmaterials research, computer vision, machine learning, pharmaceuticals and more.\u201d In the long run, quantum computing\u2019s range of influence could be as deep and wide as that of generative AI. Hence, if quantum computing becomes the next generative AI, then IonQ could actually be the next NVIDIA. It\u2019s a gamble to buy and hold IonQ stock, no doubt, but a small share position may set investors up with a last-page tech phenomenon with exciting first-page prospects.
