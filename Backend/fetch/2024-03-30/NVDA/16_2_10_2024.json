    "text": "The US tech giant wants to claim key shares of the booming market for custom-made chips for cloud computing and artificial intelligence.  Nvidia is creating a new unit that aims to design computer chips specifically for cloud computing firms and advanced artificial intelligence (AI) processors, multiple sources have revealed. The US tech giant, which has become the leading designer and supplier of AI chips, wants to claim a share of the booming market for custom AI chips. The move also aims to shield the California-based company from the growing number of companies pursuing alternatives to its products. Nvidia controls about 80% of high-end AI chip market, a position that has sent its stock market value up 40% so far this year to $1.73 trillion after it more than tripled in 2023.   Nvidia\u2019s customers, which include ChatGPT creator OpenAI, Microsoft, Alphabet and Meta Platforms, have raced to snap up the dwindling supply of its chips to compete in the fast-emerging generative AI sector. Its H100 and A100 chips serve as a generalized, all-purpose AI processor for many of those major customers. But the tech companies have started to develop their own internal chips for specific needs. Doing so helps reduce energy consumption, and potentially can shrink the cost and time to design. Nvidia is now attempting to play a role in helping these companies develop custom AI chips that have flowed to rival firms such as Broadcom and Marvell Technology, said the sources, who declined to be identified because they were not authorized to speak publicly. \u201cIf you\u2019re really trying to optimize on things like power, or optimize on cost for your application, you can\u2019t afford to go drop an H100 or A100 in there,\u201d Greg Reichow, general partner at venture capital firm Eclipse Ventures said in an interview. \u201cYou want to have the exact right mixture of compute and just the kind of compute that you need.\u201d Nvidia does not disclose H100 prices, which are higher than for the prior-generation A100, but each chip can sell for $16,000 to $100,000 depending on volume and other factors. Meta plans to bring its total stock to 350,000 H100s this year.  Nvidia officials have met with representatives from Amazon.com, Meta, Microsoft, Google and OpenAI to discuss making custom chips for them, two sources familiar with the meetings said. Beyond data centre chips, Nvidia has pursued telecom, automotive and video game customers. Nvidia shares rose 2.75% after the report, helping lift chip stocks overall. Marvell shares dropped 2.78%. In 2022, Nvidia said it would let third-party customers integrate some of its proprietary networking technology with their own chips. It has said nothing about the programme since, and this is the first report of its wider ambitions. A Nvidia spokesperson declined to comment beyond the company\u2019s 2022 announcement. Dina McKinney, a former Advanced Micro Devices and Marvell executive, heads Nvidia\u2019s custom unit and her team\u2019s goal is to make its technology available for customers in cloud, 5G wireless, video games and automotives, a LinkedIn profile said. Those mentions were scrubbed and her title changed after Reuters sought comment from Nvidia. Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Meta and OpenAI declined to comment.  According to estimates from research firm 650 Group\u2019s Alan Weckel, the data centre custom chip market will grow to as much as $10 billion this year, and double that in 2025. The broader custom chip market was worth roughly $30 billion in 2023, which amounts to roughly 5% of annual global chip sales, according to Needham analyst Charles Shi. Currently, custom silicon design for data centres is dominated by Broadcom and Marvell. In a typical arrangement, a design partner such as Nvidia would offer intellectual property and technology, but leave the chip fabrication, packaging and additional steps to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company or another contract chipmakers.  Nvidia moving into this territory has the potential to eat into Broadcom and Marvell sales. \u201cWith Broadcom\u2019s custom silicon business touching $10 billion, and Marvell\u2019s around $2 billion, this is a real threat,\u201d said Dylan Patel, founder of silicon research group SemiAnalysis. \u201cIt\u2019s a real big negative \u2013 there\u2019s more competition entering the fray.\u201d Nvidia is in talks with telecom infrastructure builder Ericsson for a wireless chip that includes the chip designer\u2019s graphics processing unit (GPU) technology, two sources familiar with the discussions said. Ericsson declined to comment. 650 Group\u2019s Weckle expects the telecom custom chip market to remain flat at roughly $4 billion to $5 billion a year. Nvidia also plans to target the automotive and video-game markets, according to sources and public social media postings. Weckel expects the custom auto market to grow consistently from its current $6 billion to $8 billion range at 20% a year, and the $7-8 billion video-game custom chip market could increase with the next-generation consoles from Xbox and Sony. Nintendo\u2019s current Switch handheld console already includes Nvidia\u2019s Tegra X1 chip. A new version of the Switch console expected this year is likely to include a Nvidia custom design, one source said.\u00a0Nintendo declined to comment.
