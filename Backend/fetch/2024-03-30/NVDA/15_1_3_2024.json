    "text": "Wall Street\u2019s second day of 2024 is starting like the bumpy first day, with major indexes all in the red, led by technology stocks. Steve Eisman, of \u201cBig Short\u201d fame and now portfolio manager at Neuberger Berman, told CNBC that he\u2019s worried \u201ceverybody is coming into the year feeling too good.\u201d Note, technology is one area the manager favors for 2024, with some Wall Street banks also hoping for more of what they saw in 2023. That may partly explain why Apple and tech stocks got hit so hard by the Barclays\u2019 advice to sell the stock on Tuesday. We stay on the tech sector in our call of the day from a D.A. Davidson analyst, an early fan of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) who is now warning the software sector is \u201capproaching the trough of disillusionment\u201d over the technology. Gil Luria, senior software analyst, said he hasn\u2019t changed his year-ago view that GenAI would be the \u201cmost important transformative technology since the internet,\u201d but notes how companies now regularly trot out related products and strategies. \u201cWe expect the market to do what the market does and compete the gains away from all but a few. We may be experiencing the most FOMO [fear of missing out] shortened cycle to date,\u201d Luria told clients in a note. Chats with industry participants have revealed \u201csignificant obstacles\u201d for enterprise customers in implementing GenAI solutions, as they first need to modernize existing data, and even set up AI committees to deal with cybersecurity impacts and other issues. That means more time will be needed to ramp up those solutions, he said. The analyst expects just a few companies will be able to point to direct GenAI revenue benefits \u2014 Nvidia \n        NVDA,\n       Microsoft \n        MSFT\n       and \u201cgenerously\u201d Adobe \n        ADBE.\n       \u201cWe expect this number to expand this year as a few more companies crack the code and find a new GenAI killer app, but believe it unlikely they all do.\u201d He sees Amazon \n        AMZN\n       and Google \n        GOOGL,\n       via their cloud platforms, along with Snowflake \n        SNOW,\n       leveraging investments in GenAI infrastructure \u201cto allow everybody else to play with their own products.\u201d But as for Nvidia, in a separate note he assumed coverage on the company with a neutral rating and $410 price target, as he warned the AI chip giant is vulnerable to that coming \u201ctrough of disillusionment.\u201d Luria explains many Nvidia\u2019s customers will fill their GenAI capacity over this year, a shift that will start to fade in 2025. Included in his price target is $155 per share for \u201csandbox\u201d revenue coming in from GenAI. \u201cWe believe the value of this sandbox could drop considerably once NVDA growth rolls over.\u201d He\u2019s got a more upbeat view on Amazon, where he assumed coverage with a buy rating and a $195 per share target, up from a previous $157. \u201cWe believe a potential reacceleration of growth in AWS [Amazon Web Services] could drive upside to shares in 2024, as AMZN gets some of the GenAI boost already in MSFT [buy-rated at D.A. Davidson], GOOGL and META \n        META\n       shares,\u201d he said. Finally, Luria discussed Apple in a separate note, assuming coverage with a neutral rating and $166 per share price target, both the same as previously. Apple will likely return to \u201cmoderate growth\u201d this year, boosted by services and easier comparisons on Mac sales, but needs to get \u201cunstuck\u201d on innovation to help generate product growth, as wearables seem to have plateaued, he said. Like Barclays, Luria also sees iPhone domination challenges. \u201cWhile Apple may have a strong hold on existing handset owners because of the strength of its ecosystem, it will need to be more creative in order to convert new consumers to the iOS ecosystem,\u201d notably in places like China. GenAI applications could prompt some of that new innovation, with Apple \u201cin a position to leverage an unparalleled walled garden consumer data set to provide new applications and experiences,\u201d said Luria.
