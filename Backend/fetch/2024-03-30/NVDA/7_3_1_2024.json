She also said equities drew support from a stronger than\nexpected earnings season and enthusiasm about artificial\nintelligence. A note of caution came from Richmond Federal Reserve\nPresident Thomas Barkin, who said U.S. price pressures still\nexist and it is too soon to predict when the Fed will cut rates.
