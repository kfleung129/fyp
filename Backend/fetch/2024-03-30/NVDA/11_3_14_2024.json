Today\u2019s generation calls it \u2018hustle culture\u2019 but Nvidia CEO here has some other perspective for the students. Jensen Huang recently shared some interesting thoughts with students at Stanford University. He talked about something unexpected, the importance of facing difficulties. He told students that facing tough times can make us stronger. He wished them \u201cample doses of pain and suffering,\u201d not to be mean, but because he believes that overcoming hardships helps us grow. He knows from personal experience how facing tough times can shape our character and make us better people. In the interview, Huang credits his work ethic and success to his early job at Denny\u2019s, where he started as a dishwasher and was later promoted to busboy. He emphasised his efficiency and dedication, stating that he never left or returned empty-handed. Reflecting on his journey, he humbly mentioned his ongoing efforts to improve as a CEO. \u201cI think one of my great advantages is that I have very low expectations,\u201d Huang, who graduated with a master\u2019s degree from Stanford in 1992, responded. He mentioned that keeping the bar too high of expectations is not practical, instead try keeping the bar low, for lower expectations. This will eventually help us to be more resilient and keep us prepare for life\u2019s ups and downs. He, like any other successful person, who actually owns a company worth \u00a3 62,770 focusses on his own story that is a proof of his message. He didn\u2019t have an easy upbringing, and he had to work hard to get where he is today. From working odd jobs to facing bullies, he learned that perseverance and hard work are key to success. His story reminds us that it\u2019s okay to struggle on the path to success. \u201cGreatness comes from character and character isn\u2019t formed out of smart people, it is formed out of people who suffered,\u201d he added. While addressing the young students he also mentioned that he believes that true greatness comes from having a strong character. By facing challenges head-on, we can develop qualities like resilience, empathy, and determination. These are the qualities that set us up for success, no matter what obstacles come our way. Jensen Huang\u2019s words may seem surprising, but they carry an important message: facing challenges is part of the journey to success. As we navigate through life, let\u2019s remember that it\u2019s okay to struggle. It\u2019s through overcoming these struggles that we become the best versions of ourselves.
