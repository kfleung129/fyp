Standing on a stage in Silicon Valley, Huang introduced the company\u2019s latest chip, which is 30 times faster than its predecessor for some tasks. He also revealed a new set of software tools designed to help developers sell AI models more easily to companies that use technology from Nvidia. Nvidia\u2019s customers include most of the world\u2019s largest technology firms. At the conference, Nvidia\u2019s chip and software announcements will determine whether the company can maintain its 80 percent share of the market for AI chips. Huang, wearing his signature leather jacket, joked that the day\u2019s keynote would be full of dense math and science and that it was not a concert. Nvidia, once mostly known among computer gaming enthusiasts, has become a recognised leader in the tech industry, on par with giants like Microsoft. In its most recent fiscal year, Nvidia\u2019s sales surpassed $60 billion, more than double its previous year. The new flagship chip called the Blackwell B200, takes two squares of silicon the size of the company\u2019s previous offering and binds them together into a single component. The company claims it can offer up to 20 teraflops of FP4 horsepower using its 208 billion transistors. Huang didn\u2019t give specific details about how well the chip performs when processing large amounts of data to train chatbots, which is the kind of work that has powered most of Nvidia\u2019s soaring sales. He also didn\u2019t reveal the price details. Nvidia Blackwell B200 GPU Nvidia is also shifting from selling single chips to selling total systems. Its latest iteration houses 72 of its AI chips and 36 central processors. It contains 600,000 parts in total and weighs 1,361kg. Its new GB200 \u2018super\u2019 chip combines two B200 GPUs along with a Grace CPU to deliver 30 times the performance for an LLM interference workload. While many analysts expect Nvidia\u2019s market share to decrease several percentage points in 2024 as new products from competitors come to market and Nvidia\u2019s largest customers make their chips, the company has built a significant battery of software products too. The new software tools, called microservices, improve system efficiency across a wide variety of uses, making it easier for businesses to incorporate AI models into their work. Nvidia also introduced a new line of chips designed for cars with new capabilities to run chatbots inside the vehicle. The company deepened its already-extensive relationships with Chinese automakers, saying that electric vehicle makers BYD and Xpeng will both use its new chips. Huang outlined a new series of chips for creating humanoid robots, inviting several of the robots made using the chips to join him on the stage. Nvidia\u2019s major customers, including Amazon.com, Alphabet\u2019s Google, Microsoft, OpenAI, and Oracle, are expected to use the new chip in cloud-computing services they sell, as well as for their own AI offerings.
