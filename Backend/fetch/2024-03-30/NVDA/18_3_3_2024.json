This growth in Nvidia\u2019s revenue kick-started a bullish run for Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins like Ethereum (ETH). BTC has grown from lows to repeatedly hit higher prices, pushing to $60,000 and $62,300, and now, it is charging towards $65,000, targeting new ATHs. Nvidia\u2019s growth triggered a surge in AI tokens. The total market cap of AI tokens breached $15 million, with the upcoming AI platform InQubeta (QUBE) hitting a new high of $0.0245 as it moved into the eighth stage of its presale. InQubeta\u2019s performance has been pulling investors to the platform, showcasing the potential to contend with established tokens like Render (RNDR). It\u2019s no wonder investors expect it to deliver a hundredfold surge as it prepares to list on exchanges. Let\u2019s explore the effect of Nvidia\u2019s earning report on Bitcoin while discussing InQubeta\u2019s move to hit explosive prices. Since the launch of InQubeta\u2019s presale, the token has found rapid success as the go-to investment for investors looking for the best crypto to invest in for massive gains. InQubeta has achieved this status by offering investors with NFTs minted with the value of AI investments. By investing in InQubeta, investors are automatically positioned to profit from the growth of AI. What makes InQubeta an even better crypto to buy is the fractionalized nature of these NFTs. Investing in AI has always been demanding because investors face multiple hurdles, like large equity requirements. But with InQubeta\u2018s investment model, having holdings in this sector becomes straightforward. This idea has attracted many large investors to the platform, especially during its ongoing presale event. The presale, spread across ten stages, has seen the price of QUBE surge from $0.007 to $0.0245. This surge has realized over 264% gains for early investors. Investors who buy into the presale at the current discount are sure to earn 20% returns before the token debuts on tier-1 exchanges. In addition to its innovative investment offerings, analysts have dubbed QUBE the best crypto to buy this year because the stage is set for the token to deliver a bull run of over 100x its listing value. After raising a milestone sum of over $10.5 million from selling over 834 million tokens, InQubeta now has the potential to rival top altcoins like Render. InQubeta remains one of the best crypto to invest in for passive income because it will reward QUBE stakers when they lock their tokens on the platform. QUBE holders are also granted voting rights as it is a governance token, enabling them to play active roles on the platform. Bitcoin recently breached $63,000 after recovering from its fall to $62,000, while altcoins like Ethereum hit $3,200 after charging upwards from $2,800. Many traders expected a fall, and the surge surprised them, highlighting a bullish market trend. Bullish sentiment increased as investors waited for Nvidia to release their Q4 earnings report. It has been a long-standing belief that Nvidia\u2019s growth triggers bullish momentum for Bitcoin and the crypto market, and that\u2019s exactly what it delivered last week. After Nvidia\u2019s Q4 earnings report beat negative expectations, it triggered a market-wide recovery for the cryptocurrency space, especially for Bitcoin and leading altcoins like Ethereum. As a result, Bitcoin has seen significant bullish momentum, positioning BTC to deliver even more explosive prices soon. Experts like Mark Thielen are confident in Bitcoin\u2019s 51% crypto market share dominance. With this development, Bitcoin could hit higher prices, targeting $65,000. The crypto market\u2019s growth, triggered by Nvidia\u2019s revenue growth, proves that the market has been responding to catalyst events. It has heightened investors\u2019 confidence in Bitcoin to hit its ATH as the Bitcoin halving event draws near. InQubeta has also followed through on bullish expectations. Its recent 9% surge proves that QUBE is on a bullish tear and could deliver life-changing returns to investors after it launches. Investors can get in by using the ongoing 15% bonus.
