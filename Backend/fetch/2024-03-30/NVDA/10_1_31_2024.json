    "text": "BREAKING: Core PCE Inflation In Line With Views     Tech stocks took a dive Wednesday, as Magnificent Seven stocks Alphabet (GOOGL) and Tesla (TSLA) sold off in morning trade, along with chip giant Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). But the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose as Wall Street braced for the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision. After the opening bell, the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite tumbled 1.5% in early action. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.1%, while the S&P 500 dropped 0.8%. Among U.S. exchange traded funds, the Nasdaq 100 tracker Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) was down 1.5%, while the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) lost 0.8%. The 10-year Treasury yield fell to 3.96% ahead of today's Fed decision. Further, oil prices threatened to give up Tuesday's gains, as West Texas Intermediate futures fell 0.7%. WTI futures traded above $77 a barrel. January's ADP private payrolls report missed estimates Wednesday morning, as it showed 107,000 jobs were added in January, far below the 145,000 Econoday estimate, vs. 164,000 in December. The Fed decision looms at 2 p.m. ET. That decision will be followed up by a news conference with Fed Chief Jerome Powell. The CME FedWatch Tool shows a 98% chance of the Fed keeping rates steady at the 5.25%-5.5% level. Alphabet\u00a0reported fourth-quarter earnings and revenue that topped analyst estimates. But shares tumbled more than 6% as the search giant's core advertising business slightly missed views.

Microsoft (MSFT)\u00a0beat Wall Street's targets for its fiscal second quarter thanks to strong cloud computing business. Still, shares reversed from early gains to fall 1.4% in morning trade.

Starbucks stock climbed 0.5% in early trading. Elsewhere, Tesla stock sold off 1.5% after a Delaware judge voided Chief Executive Elon Musk's $56 billion compensation plan, siding with plaintiffs who argue that Tesla's board acted improperly in setting the pay deal. On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average moved up 0.35% and the S&P 500 edged 0.1% lower. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite declined 0.8%.
