    "text": "Nancy Pelosi\u2019s investing prowess has once again come under the spotlight. The member of Congress and former house speaker has achieved something that, for many Americans, would be unthinkable: she has already beaten her entire annual salary of around $223,500 with one super stock trade. Commercial real estate has outperformed the S&P 500 over 25 years. Here's how to diversify your portfolio without the headache of being a landlord Take control of your finances in 2024: 5 money moves to start the new year off strong The US dollar has lost 87% of its purchasing power since 1971 \u2014 invest in this stable asset before you lose your retirement fund Pelosi (D-CA) bought $2 million dollars worth of Nvidia (NVDA) call options late last year \u2014 and by Jan. 10, her well-timed trade had already made a whopping $250,000, according to stock trading news site Unusual Whales. This is because the generative AI giant\u2019s stock hit another all-time high on Jan. 10, hitting a record $546 \u2014 and pushing Pelosi\u2019s in-the-money call options up by around 13%. Pelosi\u2019s stock trades often come under scrutiny because, quite simply, she\u2019s made a lot of money from trading during her time in Congress. Together with her venture capitalist husband, Paul, Pelosi has netted millions of dollars in profit from buying call options on other blue-chip stocks such as Salesforce (CRM), Google (GOOGL), Roblox (RBLX) and Disney (DIS). Some have accused the high-profile lawmaker of using her connections and insider information to time the market and score winning deals. But the jury is out on this Nvidia trade. Yes, there is the usual chorus of critics screaming \u201cINSIDER TRADING!\u201d But there is also a large collective commending the congresswoman for her \u201cbuying strength.\u201d Read more: Find out how to save up to $820 annually on car insurance and get the best rates possible In a Reddit thread about the Unusual Whales revelation, one user noted: \u201c13%!?!?

Thanks to high demand for its chips used in AI computing, Nvidia now has a market value of more than $1.3 trillion, leaving it just $250 shy of Amazon (AMZN). Pelosi\u2019s active trading continues to grind lawmaker\u2019s gears. And it\u2019s not just Pelosi raking in the big bucks from well-timed trades. Of the 100 trading members of Congress in 2023, 33% beat the S&P 500 (SPY) with their portfolios, according to Unusual Whales \u2014 with four politicians (Brian Higgins D-NY, Mark Green R-TN, Garret Graves R-LA and David Rouzer R-NC) achieving over 100% gains. That is dramatic in comparison to the S&P 500\u2019s 24.8% gain. In recent years, there has been a growing movement in Washington to ban members of Congress from trading stocks and to stifle any possible corruption and conflicts of interest among lawmakers.
