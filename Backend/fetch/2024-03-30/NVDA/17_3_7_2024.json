    "text": "Nvidia Corp. shares are up for the sixth day in a row, and they\u2019re on track to rack up their sixth straight record high. That\u2019s an example of the type of market activity that has at least one analyst feeling somewhat worried. It \u201cfeels a bit\u00a0unhealthy\u201d to see Nvidia shares \n        NVDA,\n        +0.12%\n       race to new records almost daily, Mizuho Securities desk-based analyst Jordan Klein wrote in a note to clients Thursday morning. And it\u2019s not just Nvidia\u2019s momentum that\u2019s starting to spook Klein, as he notes that shares of \u201cnew\u201d AI winners like Broadcom Inc. \n        AVGO,\n        +0.51%,\n       Marvell Technology Inc. \n        MRVL,\n        -1.98%\n       and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. \n        TSM,\n        -0.47%\n2330,\n        +1.30%\n       were each up in the realm of 6% to 8% last Friday on seemingly no new fundamental information.

Also read:\u00a0It\u2019s not just Nvidia. These companies are finally making real money from AI. Klein called out the \u201cself-reinforcing\u201d nature of the current march higher for chip stocks. \u201cThis takes prices higher, but pushes some of the laggards lower as folks rotate out of losers and chase winners,\u201d he noted. The frenzied market action and the fact that sell-side analysts continue to boost their price targets on semiconductor names are giving Klein flashbacks to the technology sector circa 1999 and 2000. Needless to say, \u201cthat did not end well,\u201d he observed. Nvidia is gearing up for its annual GTC event later this month, and that could be the \u201cblow-off top\u201d moment for the market. He doesn\u2019t think managers want to trim their Nvidia positions before that event, but at same time, he\u2019s not expecting too many surprises from Nvidia\u2019s management team. \u201cI could see some fast money take profits on the headlines, then others see a pullback and get nervous that the launch or event was somehow a disappointment (when it would not be),\u00a0[and] then the flywheel starts working in reverse,\u201d Klein wrote. And since Nvidia is leading the tech rally, he\u2019s not sure which stock could step in to prop up the market if Nvidia were to break. Apple Inc. \n        AAPL,\n        -1.06%,\n       Tesla Inc. \n        TSLA,\n        -2.25%,\n       Alphabet Inc. \n        GOOG,\n        +0.21%\nGOOGL,\n        +0.04%\n       and \u201ceven\u201d Meta Platforms Inc. \n        META,\n        -1.68%\n       don\u2019t have that same power, in his view. Meanwhile, Broadcom and Marvell are due to report quarterly results after Thursday\u2019s closing bell. Neither one is poised to \u201ctank\u201d sentiment around Nvidia and, in fact, both seem more likely to further fuel the excitement, Klein said. Don\u2019t miss:\u00a0Nvidia\u2019s stock sees one advantage that only two other chip makers share Those companies have non-AI businesses that are in decline and muddy their stories, but Klein added that \u201cany\u00a0more bullish tone [or] financial guides from AI products\u201d could send their stocks surging. Klein said he has an overall \u201cpositive\u201d view on the semiconductor sector, though he worries some investors could take profits following Nvidia\u2019s GTC and in the lead up to the next chip earnings season. The stock looks like a bet on Trump himself more than a company with significant revenue and profits. Emily Bary is a MarketWatch news editor based in New York.
