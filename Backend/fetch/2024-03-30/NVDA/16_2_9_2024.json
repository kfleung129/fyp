Read more to find out\u2026. Feb 9, 2024 In this piece, I evaluated two chip stocks, NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) and STMicroelectronics N.V. (STM), to predict the leading player in 2024. However, before diving into specifics, let\u2019s examine the prevailing dynamics influencing the chip sector. Post-pandemic, the chip industry demonstrated remarkable resilience, navigating through supply chain disruptions, geopolitical tensions, and evolving consumer preferences. Despite these challenges, the industry not only persevered but flourished, showcasing its adaptability and capacity to thrive amid dynamic external pressures. Looking ahead to 2024, IDC predicts a significant resurgence driven by recovering smartphone demand and the increasing need for AI chips, with an annual growth rate projected to exceed 20%. Similarly, Gartner (IT) anticipates a parallel surge, forecasting a 16.8% growth in global semiconductor revenue, reaching $624 billion. In line with these optimistic projections, SEMI\u2019s latest quarterly report paints a picture of growth, with a 6.4% surge in global semiconductor capacity expected in 2024, surpassing 30 million wafers per month for the first time. This uptick follows a 5.5% increase witnessed in 2023, reflecting the industry\u2019s momentum. The expansion is not happening in isolation; instead, it\u2019s driven by the adoption of cutting-edge technologies such as generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) and High-Performance Computing (HPC), alongside a resurgence in end demand for chips. With the global demand for chips steadily rising, the industry finds itself in a favorable position for sustained growth. Moreover, increased government incentives and a surge in fab investments act as catalysts for these promising trends. As a result, the chip market is poised to usher in a new era of innovation and prosperity. In terms of price performance, NVDA has gained 33.3% over the past month, while STM marginally plunged during the same period. Additionally, NVDA surged 213.6% over the past year, closing the last trading session at $696.41, whereas STM declined 6.8% during the same period, closing the last trading session at $45.17.
