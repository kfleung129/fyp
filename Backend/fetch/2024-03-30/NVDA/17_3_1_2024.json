    "text": "Microsoft Corp\u00a0MSFT has introduced a new Windows API, DirectSR, aimed at revolutionizing how game developers incorporate AI-upscaling technologies from leading companies like\u00a0Nvidia Corp\u00a0NVDA,\u00a0Advanced Micro Devices, Inc\u00a0AMD, and\u00a0Intel Corp\u00a0INTC\u00a0into their games. As program manager Joshua Tucker described, DirectSR is the crucial connection facilitating games to utilize super-resolution technologies. This new API promises to deliver a smoother and more efficient gaming experience compatible across various hardware platforms, the Verge\u00a0reports. The essence of DirectSR lies in its ability to support multi-vendor super-resolution (SR) technologies through a unified set of inputs and outputs. This approach enables developers to implement a single code path to activate diverse solutions, including Nvidia\u2019s DLSS Super Resolution, AMD\u2019s FidelityFX Super Resolution, and Intel\u2019s XeSS. The advantage for developers is significant, as it absolves them from the need to individually code for each upscaling technology, streamlining the development process. This announcement follows the discovery of an \u201cAutomatic Super Resolution\u201d feature in a test version of Windows 11, which suggested the use of AI to enhance the smoothness and detail of supported games. Microsoft fired 1,900 employees across Activision Blizzard and Xbox in January to create a more sustainable cost structure, equating to about 8% of its Gaming division. Blizzard president Mike Ybarra and Allen Adham, Blizzard\u2019s chief design officer and co-founder, also departed. Blizzard canceled its previously announced survival game. Investors can gain exposure to the AI driven FAANG stocks via\u00a0ProShares UltraPro QQQ\u00a0TQQQ and\u00a0Invesco QQQ Trust, Series 1\u00a0QQQ, which gained 9-25% year-to-date.
