Image source: Getty Images We all want to be that investor who bought that big stock way back when \u2014 the one that made us a millionaire overnight. But honestly, this doesn\u2019t have to be such a crazy notion. In fact, the idea isn\u2019t to find the company that no one else is buying yet. You could still reach that status by buying the stock at the right time and letting time and your investment inch your shares upwards. This is why today we\u2019re going to be taking a look at why Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) could be that stock. Not only has the company created millionaires in the past, but it\u2019s likely to do so again in the future. So, with that, let\u2019s take a look at three things investors should know about Nvidia stock. Sure, Nvidia stock seems to be hitting the headlines again and again over the last few years. The thing is, it\u2019s been around for over 30 years. The tech stock came on the scene in 1993, just as personal computers were starting to take off. Then in 1995, it launched the first mainstream consumer-oriented graphics processing card in the world. This made personal computers powerful, and fast. From there, it became the leader in the graphics card space, growing from its small cap in 1999 to an insane US$1.51 trillion company today. As for shares during that time, investors who have somehow managed to hold onto Nvidia stock in that time have seen shares climb 133,269% as of writing! However, that\u2019s all in the past. Today, chips remain highly in demand, for one thing. But there is even more growth for Nvidia stock to get up against in the future. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve noticed that Nvidia stock has been in the headlines more than most, as artificial intelligence (AI) has become a thing. And it turns out, that\u2019s for good reason. The same computer processes used for its graphic cards can be used for AI as well. The bottom line? It just has to go through a lot of data, fast. In fact, Nvidia stock has already been on the AI train for some time now. The company began experimenting with it back in 2012, building AI processors using its graphics card technology. Then, in 2016, it released the first deep-learning supercomputer. Fast forward, and a whopping 75% of the company\u2019s revenue is coming from AI. Yet demand doesn\u2019t just remain high from current sources, it\u2019s growing all the time. AI and automation need to be a part of basically every business in the future. And Nvidia is the key driver of companies achieving success. So, if you think that Nvidia stock is going to be slowing down, think again. Researchers believe that its AI business will grow 24% on an annual basis all the way until 2030. That\u2019s based on AI growth in general, which is likely to grow from US$200 billion in 2024 to US$1 trillion by 2032. And Nvidia stock continues to be in control of the lion\u2019s share of the market. Is it likely that we\u2019ll see that absurd amount of growth again in the future? Probably not. However, long-term holders are still sure to be bullish on this stock. As AI rises, so too will Nvidia stock right along with it. But even outside AI, it remains a strong company that\u2019s the best of the best and in high demand by companies around the world. Therefore, if you see a short-term dip, take it. That dip could be what makes a large investment worth millions in the years to come.
