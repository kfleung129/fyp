The French CAC40 and German DAX indices also closed at record highs.\nOn Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.11% and the S&P 500 gained 0.08%, but the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.16%. \nThe dollar was poised to record a weekly fall for the first time in 2024 as investors consolidated positions and sought further guidance on global economies.\nThe dollar index rose 0.029%, with the euro down 0.04% to $1.0819.\nOn the data front in Europe, German business morale fell unexpectedly in Europe\u2019s biggest economy in December, an Ifo institute survey showed.\nGerman bond yields were on track for their third straight weekly increase as the economic data and central bank officials continued to chip away at investors\u2019 hopes for rapid rate cuts by the European Central Bank this year.\nJapan\u2019s stock market was closed for a public holiday on Friday, but Nikkei futures rose nearly 1%, suggesting Japanese stocks will extend their record run next week.\nChinese shares wobbled between gains and losses. The Shanghai Composite index rose above the psychologically key 3,000-point mark.
