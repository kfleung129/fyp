A \u201cnew frontier of capital markets\u201d is emerging, and it\u2019s rooted in artificial intelligence, said Nikolai Larbalestier, senior vice president of cloud strategy and enterprise architecture at Nasdaq. At NVIDIA GTC 2024, hosted March 18-21 in San Jose, Calif., financial services was the largest industry in attendance \u2014 a sign of the technology\u2019s rapid influence on market trends. \u201cIn a given day, we handle about 100 billion events, with latency measured at approximately 20 microseconds roundtrip from the edge of our network to that order back to the customer,\u201d Larbalestier said. But with high-performance computing and AI added to the mix, capital market trades are becoming more precise. It\u2019s also allowing predictive analytics and investment strategies to grow exponentially, he said. \u201cWhen we think of the capital markets in the future, we see a parallel infrastructure developing,\u201d Larbalestier said. \u00a0This means that HPC and AI will start to run alongside the current infrastructure that the financial services\u00a0sector has in place, on-prem and in the cloud. The result is \u201ca market that\u2019s more adaptable to the conditions we experience in real time,\u201d he said, one that is receptive to the instant shocks of global events and almost intuitive when it comes to risk management. Here\u2019s how these new capabilities are transforming financial services, from enhancing efficiency to personalizing customer experiences and innovating product offerings.

Generative AI is revolutionizing the way financial advice is delivered to customers, namely by making it more personal. For Trevor Mottl, portfolio manager at Walleye Capital, \u201cthe promise, I think, is personalization. Many of us are privy to financial advisers, and many of us get generic portfolios. The real promise is getting a portfolio just for you. Getting a call when you want the call,\u201d he said. RELATED: How does high-performance computing and artificial intelligence help financial firms? That\u2019s where quantitative finance is headed. By using AI-driven platforms powered by natural language processing and machine learning tools, IT leaders can analyze a customer\u2019s financial data, including spending habits, savings, investments and goals, to offer tailored advice on budgeting, saving, investments and even retirement planning. This approach makes financial advice accessible and affordable to a wider audience, moving beyond traditional wealth management services reserved for high-net-worth individuals. Trevor Mottl\nPortfolio Manager, Walleye Capital Generative AI is also refining market forecasting. Capable of synthesizing and analyzing large volumes of data, these models can identify patterns, trends and insights that are not easily discernible by humans, as NVIDIA GTC 2024 experts noted. Banks and investment firms are modeling market scenarios in real time, which will make predictions even more accurate and informed. \u201cA lot of those high-frequency trades are really price- and microevent-dependent. But when you want to buy a stock, or Warren Buffett wants to buy a stock, what do they do?\u201d asked Mottl. \u201cThey learn about the company. They read, they look at filings and a whole bunch of data that isn\u2019t price, and the trade affects the price.\u201d With Generative AI, Mottl said, quantitative analysts can look beyond price and evaluate \u201ctext or multimodal data to forecast something else.\u201d This includes factors such as industry performance, company news, and performance and economic factors \u2014 all of which can impact price. Ioana Boier, principal solution architect at NVIDIA, said that \u201csentiment analysis\u201d is one example of these newer evaluations leading to more context-based decision-making. In sentiment analysis, a natural language process model uses computational linguistics and collects the good, bad or neutral sentiment in news articles, social media posts, financial reports and other investor sources to get a temperature on a stock, company or trend.

Generative AI is also helping financial firms identify patterns and anomalies that indicate fraudulent activity and credit risk. This not only protects the financial institution's assets but also safeguards customer interests by reducing the number of incidents. \u201cData is the bedrock\u201d on which financial organizations will grow their businesses, Mottl said. And for computing capabilities to excel, IT leaders must continually prioritize clean data, train talent and select the right features to input into AI models. That\u2019s going to be an iterative process. \u201cGenerative AI is still in the very early stages of being integrated into asset management, with years of progress to come,\u201d Mottl said. \u201cThe next 10 years will be some of the most exciting times in our industry,\u201d said Jensen Huang, CEO and founder of NVIDIA. This will be due in large part to how AI is making financial services more efficient, secure and customer-centric.
