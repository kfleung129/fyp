    "text": "Molly Loe @TechHQ molly@hybrid.co Can Nvidia stock prices continue to rise in 2024?. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang will hope so \u2013 Nvidia. Last year, Nvidia stock prices saw a sharp rise, a rise that\u2019s expected to spill over into 2024, according to a note on Thursday 4th from Bank of America. The company is continuing to capitalize on its successful development and sales of AI chips. Nvidia\u2019s fast growing revenue and profit profile should allow it to generate $100 billion in free cash flow over the next two years \u2013 even more impressive considering that over the previous two years, the company generated free cash flow of less than $30 billion. On Friday, Bank of America\u2019s Vivek Arya told CNBC the expected free cash flow generation is \u201cjust the cherry on top of what is a very delicious cake.\u201d \u201cThese cycles don\u2019t just start and end in one year. These can be decade-long cycles and there is at least three to four years of upfront hardware deployment \u2013 and we are just in year two,\u201d Arya said. The cycles he\u2019s referring to are Nvidia\u2019s strong competitive position, the early days of generative AI and the company\u2019s upcoming pipeline of new chips. Naturally, more cash means more funding for Nvidia to use on new growth initiatives. Those in turn will boost the company\u2019s valuation, and round we go again. The key to continued growth and high valuation will be Nvidia\u2019s ability to build a recurring revenue profile, said Arya. In the Bank of America note on Thursday, he also said that \u201cof the ~$100 billion [of] free cash flow, we estimate only ~$30 to $35 billion could be deployed for buybacks.\u201d That leaves $65 to $70 billion of \u201cammunition for new organic and inorganic growth initiatives.\u201d At the moment, Nvidia\u2019s dependency on hardware sales means it\u2019s trading at a price-to-earnings valuation of 20x, based on projected 2025 earnings. That\u2019s not good: Nvidia\u2019s tech peers trade considerably higher, and its own historical median price-to-earnings multiple was 35x to 40x. \u201cWhile Nvidia gets clubbed in the \u2018Magnificent 7,\u2019 we note Nvidia trades at a 20% to 30% discount on price-to-earnings and enterprise value-to-free cash flow basis, despite 2x the free cash flow margins and 3x the sales CAGR versus the six other \u2018magnificent\u2019 peers,\u201d Arya highlighted. The fast-growing pile of cash that Nvidia has will give it the opportunity to continue its speedy growth and boost its valuation multiple. We can take what happened in 2020 as an example of Nvidia\u2019s high ambitions. The company tried to buy chip design giant ARM from Softbank for $40 billion. Regulatory challenges meant that in 2022 the termination of the transaction was announced. For investors, though, this is a sign that Nvidia is prepared to spend big to build out its software and intellectual property assets. Nvidia stock prices seem like they\u2019ll only go up, so get in while you can. \u201cWe expect Nvidia to consider assets that help it create a more meaningful recurring revenue profile. While Nvidia has a solid lead in AI, hardware-oriented businesses are not valued as highly as visibility tends to be limited,\u201d said Arya. He went on to explain that only about 2% of Nvidia\u2019s sales in annualized revenue are from software or subscriptions. Bank of America is skeptical that could ever generate more than $5 billion without inorganic additions to the core AI enterprise suite. \u201cWe envision Nvidia considering more enhanced partnerships/M&A of software companies that are helping traditional enterprise customers deploy, monitor and analyze genAI apps.\u201d What might help Nvidia stock break from its $400 to $500 trading range are the upcoming CES tradeshow and GTC tradeshow where the company could unveil important product updates. Arya reiterated his \u201cBuy\u201d rating on Nvidia and $700 price target, representing potential upside of 42% from current levels.
