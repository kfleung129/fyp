The relative weighting of semiconductors, which indicates how much they are in portfolios relative to their weight in the S&P 500 index, has declined month-over-month from July 2023\u2019s 1.18x to 1.09x, marking a 4% quarter-over-quarter reduction. This level remains below its peak of 1.36x in March 2017. Nvidia Corp\u00a0NVDA maintains the broadest ownership among fund managers, with 67% holding the stock, continuing its growth in ownership since June 2023. However, its relative weighting 1.01x is still below the average of the top 16 owned information technology and communication services peers despite Nvidia having significantly faster sales growth prospects. The quarter saw notable ownership expansions in\u00a0Broadcom Inc\u00a0AVGO,\u00a0Micron Technology, Inc\u00a0MU,\u00a0Applied Materials, Inc\u00a0AMAT,\u00a0Intel Corp\u00a0INTC, Nvidia, and\u00a0Cadence Design Systems Inc\u00a0CDNS. Conversely,\u00a0Microchip Technology Inc\u00a0MCHP,\u00a0First Solar Inc\u00a0FSLR,\u00a0Enphase Energy Inc\u00a0ENPH,\u00a0NXP Semiconductors NV\u00a0NXPI,\u00a0Advanced Micro Devices, Inc\u00a0AMD,\u00a0Qualcomm Inc\u00a0QCOM, and\u00a0KLA Corp\u00a0KLAC experienced the most significant ownership declines. The most significant increases in depth or overweighting were seen in Intel,\u00a0ON Semiconductor Corp\u00a0ON, and AMD, while First Solar,\u00a0Qorvo Inc\u00a0QRVO,\u00a0Teradyne Inc\u00a0TER,\u00a0Applied Materials Inc\u00a0AMAT, and Qualcomm observed the most substantial decreases in weighting. Long-only investors were most overweight in Microchip Technology, ON Semiconductor,\u00a0Enphase Energy Inc\u00a0ENPH,\u00a0Monolithic Power Systems Inc\u00a0MPWR, Broadcom,\u00a0Texas Instruments Inc\u00a0TXN, and NXP Semiconductors. In contrast, hedge funds favored AMD, Teradyne,\u00a0Skyworks Solutions Inc\u00a0SWKS, Micron, Cadence, and Qorvo the most. Despite high ownership, the top six widely owned semiconductor stocks in the S&P 500, including Nvidia, Broadcom, AMD, Applied Materials,\u00a0Lam Research Corp\u00a0LRCX, and Texas Instruments, remain relatively underweighted when compared to their potential growth and market impact. Price Action:\u00a0NVDA shares closed higher by 3.18% at $887.00 on Wednesday.
