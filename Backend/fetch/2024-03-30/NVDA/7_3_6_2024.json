    "text": "Published on By The Nvidia CUDA platform is one of the good reasons for the popularity of the company's 3D cards in the professional segment.  There have been various developments for running CUDA applications on other GPUs for a long time, but now Nvidia has decided to start counteracting this.  The company has reportedly banned CUDA-based software from running on other hardware platforms using translation layers. A new clause has appeared in Nvidia\u2019s license agreement, although so far only on the website, but not in the software itself.\n\nYou may not reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble any part of the output generated using elements of the SDK for the purpose of translating such output artifacts to a non-Nvidia platform. \n\nThe initiative appears to be aimed at combating projects like ZLUDA, which allow CUDA applications to run on Intel and AMD GPUs.  In addition, which may be more important for Nvidia, such an initiative should interfere with Chinese developments in this direction.  For example, earlier the Chinese Denglin Technology stated that it was already developing processors with \u201ccomputing architecture compatible with programming models such as CUDA/OpenCL.\u201d A new clause has appeared in Nvidia\u2019s license agreement, although so far only on the website, but not in the software itself.

The company has revealed new details about Blackwell Nvidia doesn\u2019t want price cuts for RTX 40 graphics cards. The company will reduce GPU production ahead of the RTX 50 launch and free up capacity for the H100 Nvidia will upgrade the GeForce RTX 4060, GeForce RTX 4060 Ti and GeForce RTX 4070.

Published on By Microsoft has made a major update to the Windows 11 operating system, also known as Moment 5, available to all users as an optional update KB5035942. Users can optionally install KB5035942 through Windows Update.  Previously, the company allowed enthusiasts to manually activate new features from an update.  Moment 5 is now available to everyone directly from Windows Update. \nWindows 11 Moment 5 brings quite a lot of innovations.  Among them are an improved Copilot AI assistant function with new plugins and skills, improved \u201cPhotos\u201d with a smart \u201ceraser\u201d, an improved Clipchamp video editor (possibly removing \u201cawkward pauses\u201d), closer integration with Android smartphones (can now be used in as a webcam), and much more.

Published on By Space meteorologists have issued a forecast for this week warning of a possible geomagnetic storm caused by the release of plasma from a solar flare.  This could affect radio transmissions on Earth and contribute to the observation of the \u201cnorthern lights.\u201d According to an alert issued March 23 by NOAA\u2019s Space Weather Prediction Center in Boulder, Colorado, the public has no reason to be concerned.

Jonathan Lash, a forecaster at the center, noted that many commercial aircraft can use satellite communications as a backup option.\nSatellite operators may also have problems tracking their spacecraft, and the power grid may detect induced current in its lines.\n\u201cFor the general public in high latitudes, with clear skies, this will be a great opportunity to see the \u2018northern lights,'\u201d Lash said.\nEvery 11 years, the Sun\u2019s magnetic field changes and its north and south poles switch places.  During this cycle, solar activity also changes and is now approaching its peak, which is called solar maximum.\nDuring solar maximum, geomagnetic storms like the one observed last Sunday can occur on Earth several times a year, according to Lash.  During periods of solar minimum, several years may pass between storms.\nLast December, the largest solar flare in recent years disrupted radio communications.

Published on By BYD is going to beat Toyota and Volkswagen by offering modern cars at very low prices.  According to Bloomberg, the Chinese automaker has reduced prices on more than 100 of its electric and hybrid models. For example, BYD\u2019s new generation-changing Seagull hatchback now costs less than $10,000, while the manufacturer\u2019s best-selling electric sedan, the Qin Plus, costs less than $11,000. BYD announced the beginning of an era called \u201celectricity is cheaper than oil\u201d, when hybrid and pure electric models become as affordable as traditional models with internal combustion engines, or even cheaper. In total, BYD has already relaunched more than 70 models with lower prices.  According to Bloomberg, only the newest Yangwang supercar worth 233 thousand dollars has not fallen in price so far.\nBy lowering prices, BYD wants to convince drivers to ditch gasoline cars and switch to electric vehicles and hybrids.  This aggressive pricing policy poses a real threat to Toyota, Volkswagen, Nissan and other manufacturers.\nPreviously, BYD Auto officially announced the production of its 7 millionth new energy vehicle, which turned out to be the Denza N7.
