    "text": " The long-term NVDA stock forecast remains very promising for patient investors Advertisement Source: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) was the top-performing S&P 500 stock in 2023, up 239%, 45 percentage points higher than Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). The NVDA stock forecast for 2024 looks equally impressive. Nvidia\u2019s share price was up 41.55% through Feb. 7, making it the top-performing S&P 500 stock in 2024, 888 basis points ahead of Meta. The chip maker continues to get a lot of love from analysts. It doesn\u2019t hurt that the Semiconductor Industry Association predicts 13% sales growth for semiconductors in 2024, which absultely factors into any comprehensive NVDA stock forecast. Other than valuation, there doesn\u2019t appear to be anything that could deliver a body blow to Nvidia\u2019s share price in the months ahead. What\u2019s an investor to do? If you bought NVDA stock five years ago, you\u2019re up 1,784%, more than 11x the index\u2019s performance. If you bought five years ago and are still holding, I\u2019d advise you to do something\u2014options, futures, etc.\u2014to ensure you protect these unrealized gains. Long-term, I\u2019m a big fan of CEO Jensen Huang and the management team he\u2019s assembled. But, as they say, \u201cWhat goes up must come down, Spinning Wheel got to go round.\u201d Here\u2019s what I might do and why I\u2019d do it. The first significant correction for Nvidia came between September 2018, when it hit a high of $73.19, and December 2018, when it hit a low of $31.11, a 57% correction over three months. Its second big correction came in late 2021 after it had been on a nearly three-year run, moving from $31.11 in December 2018 to $346.47 in October 2021, a 1,014% gain. It fell to a low of $108.13 in October 2022, a 68% correction over 12 months. Since mid-October 2022, its shares have risen by 544% over 15 months. With AI creating massive free cash flow, it\u2019s not surprising that analysts like Bernstein Managing Director and Senior Analyst Stacy Rasgon believe Nvidia is one of the cheaper AI plays.\u00a0The NVDA stock forecast calls for the company to generate $100 billion over the next two years, more than 3x what it generated in the preceeding two. She points out that although semiconductor sales are expected to grow by 13% this year, not all semiconductor companies will benefit from this growth. Those most exposed to AI will see the greatest benefits. \u201cBut one of the areas that I think should be growing a lot is AI. And they are clearly, like, the most exposed to that space. They\u2019re one of the few that are actually making real money in that space,\u201d Rasgon stated while appearing on Yahoo Finance on Feb. 5. So, while significant corrections can even happen to the Nvidia\u2019s of the world, nothing I can think of on the near-term horizon points to black clouds for the company. As the Bernstein analyst said in her Yahoo Finance appearance, things like PCs, networking, and data center server CPUs should all experience growth in 2024. Nvidia\u2019s Q3 2024 revenue was $18.12 billion. Of that, 80% was from its data center division, including its AI-accelerating chips. The company doesn\u2019t break out the numbers for the various parts of data center revenue, AI, and non-AI. On pg. 28 of its Q3 2024 10-Q, it said networking revenue was up 155% year-over-year and 52% sequentially. That\u2019s something. However, it also noted that most of the increase was due to its InfiniBand infrastructure to support its HGX platform, which is AI-related. I read an article earlier this year that estimated Nvidia\u2019s external networking products generated 30% of data center revenue in the past year. If we use the same number for Q3 2024, the networking revenue would be approximately $4.35 billion [$14.51 billion x 30%], up 155% from $2.81 billion a year earlier [$4.35 billion / 155%]. So, if we annualize the $4.35 billion estimated networking revenue, we get $17.4 billion. Multiply that by a similar increase for 2025, and we get $27.0 billion. That\u2019s 28.5% of the analysts\u2019 2025 revenue estimate of $94.41 billion. The percentage seems a tad high, but it\u2019s only meant to suggest there is revenue growth potential outside AI. The remaining non-AI growth should come from its Gaming business, which grew revenue by nearly 15% in the third quarter to $2.86 billion. I do like Nvidia\u2019s stock for a long-term hold of forever. However, we know that Nvidia\u2019s stock has been prone to decent-sized corrections, so that\u2019s always a possibility in the months ahead. If you want to buy Nvidia stock, consider using options to reduce the capital required to gain a potential entry point. Perhaps in a future article, I\u2019ll get into the specifics of what options to buy to get the job done.
