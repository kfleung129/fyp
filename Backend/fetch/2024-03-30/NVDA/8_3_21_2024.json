    "text": "Source: SmartCompany Welcome back to Neural Notes: A weekly column where I condense some of the most interesting and important AI news of the week. In the latest edition, we have Microsoft which acquires an AI startup and Nvidia announces even more AI chips. Microsoft has entered into a hefty US$650 million agreement with Inflection AI, less than a year after being a part of the startup\u2019s US$1.3 billion raise. The deal isn\u2019t being positioned as an acquisition, but it does involve licensing Inflection\u2019s AI technologies and bringing the company\u2019s co-founders \u2014 Mustafa Suleyman and Kar\u00e9n Simonyan \u2014 along with a significant portion of their team, in-house. They are joining to create what Microsoft is calling a new consumer-focused organisation \u2014 Microsoft AI \u2014 with Suleyman as EVP and CEO. \u201cAs part of this transition, Mikhail Parakhin and his entire team, including Copilot, Bing, and Edge; and Misha Bilenko and the GenAI team will move to report to Mustafa,\u201d Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in a blog post. \u201cThese teams are at the vanguard of innovation at Microsoft, bringing a new entrant energy and ethos, to a changing consumer product landscape driven by the AI platform shift. These organisational changes will help us double down on this innovation.\u201d By licensing Inflection\u2019s AI models and integrating key personnel into its operations, Microsoft aims to bolster its AI capabilities, especially around consumer products like Copilot, Bing, and Edge. The financial breakdown includes US$620 million for technology licensing and approximately US$30 million in relation to the employee transition. While the move has been lauded for its potential to enhance Microsoft\u2019s AI offerings, it also raises questions about the future direction of Inflection AI, now significantly scaled down in terms of its workforce. The deal reflects the continuing trend of major tech companies fortifying their AI arsenals through strategic partnerships, investments, and talent acquisition. Speaking of Inflection AI investors, Nvidia has been front and centre of the AI stage again this week. Nvidia introduced its new Blackwell series of chipsets at its GTC developer conference this week. \u201cI hope you realise this is not a concert,\u201d Nvidia president Jensen Huang said on the stage. \u201cYou have arrived at a developers\u2019 conference. There will be a lot of science describing algorithms, computer architecture, mathematics. I sense a very heavy weight in the room \u2014 all of a sudden, you\u2019re in the wrong place.\u201d Nvidia has been at the forefront of AI hardware over the last 18 months. While it has been in the chipset games for decades, it was a tech company that wasn\u2019t in the mainstream limelight. It was mostly known by tech and gamer nerds such as myself until its GPUs began being bought up in the crypto mining boom, and now the AI renaissance. Now it seems like Nvidia is everywhere and has the stock price to prove it. In Nvidia\u2019s latest earnings report in February, the company saw its revenue hit US$22.1 billion \u2014 a 265% year-on-year increase \u2014 as well as its share price jump by 16% to US$785.38. That has seen a further jump in the wake of the conference this week. At the time of writing it, was sitting at around US$914 a share. Its market value is now US$273 billion. So it\u2019s unsurprising that GTC felt more like a concert. Or perhaps a passionate rally. \u201cThere\u2019s a new Industrial Revolution happening in these [server] rooms: I call them AI factories,\u201d Huang said. The Blackwell series represents Nvidia\u2019s most advanced AI chips to date, boasting substantial improvements in speed and efficiency over their predecessors. According to Huang, Blackwell offers the power of two chips in one and is \u201cpushing the limits of physics of how big a chip could be\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m holding around $10 billion worth of equipment here. The next one will cost $5 billion. Luckily for you all, it gets cheaper from there,\u201d Huang said. Blackwell is between two and 30 times faster than Nvidia\u2019s previous generation. According to Huang, it took 8,000 GPUs, 15 megawatts and 90 days to create the GPT-MoE-1.8T model. With the new system, you could use just 2,000 GPUs and 25% of the power. This leap in performance is expected to have far-reaching implications, from accelerating the pace of AI research and development to enabling more sophisticated AI applications in areas like autonomous vehicles, natural language processing and more. Alongside the Blackwell series, Nvidia unveiled a slew of AI-focused innovations and partnerships aimed at bolstering its ecosystem. This includes enhancements to its software platforms and tools designed to streamline the deployment of AI models across different computing environments. Nvidia\u2019s announcements reflect a strategic push to make AI more accessible and efficient, addressing some of the key challenges in AI development, such as the escalating costs of computing power and energy consumption.
