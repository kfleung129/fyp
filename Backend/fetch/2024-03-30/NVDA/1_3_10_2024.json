Why It Matters: This outage comes on the heels of a lawsuit filed against Nvidia for allegedly using copyrighted works without permission to train its AI platform. The lawsuit, filed by three authors, claims that their works were part of a dataset of approximately 196,640 books used to train Nvidia's NeMo AI platform to simulate ordinary written language. The dataset was reportedly taken down in October due to reported copyright infringement. In February, Nvidia reported fourth-quarter results and forward guidance that exceeded optimistic forecasts. The company reported fourth-quarter non-GAAP earnings per share of $5.16, which came in ahead of a Street consensus estimate of $4.64. Moreover, the company\u2019s fourth-quarter revenue of $22.10 billion beat a Street estimate of $20.62 billion.
