During several recent sessions, Nvidia surpassed Tesla as the option market\u2019s most heavily traded name for the day. Nvidia briefly hit $2 trillion in market value for the first time on Friday \u2013 two days after it released quarterly earnings \u2013  riding on insatiable demand for its chips which feature prominently in the generative AI craze. \n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\tShow Full Article Nvidia briefly hit $2 trillion in market value for the first time on Friday \u2013 two days after it released quarterly earnings \u2013  riding on insatiable demand for its chips which feature prominently in the generative AI craze. Nvidia recently became the third-largest U.S.-listed company as measured in market capitalization. Its shares command a weighting of 4.5% in the S&P 500, giving them an outsized  influence on the broader index\u2019s moves. \nNvidia\u2019s options should remain popular with traders, \u201cboth from a hype and mechanical index perspective,\u201d said Garrett DeSimone, head of quantitative research at OptionMetrics. \u201cIt represents such a large portion of S&P 500 weighting.\u201d \nThe stock\u2019s options have drawn a range of bets, including ones guarding against a drop in the stock toward $350 by March and others that would bear fruit if the stock extended its meteoric rise toward $900 and higher in coming months. \nNvidia shares were up 1.4% at $798.90 on Monday afternoon. \nA host of other AI names has also drawn heavy options volume, including Super Micro Computer and Arm Holdings. Nvidia\u2019s shares are up about 60% year-to-date, while those of Super Micro Computer have risen 200% and Arm\u2019s have gained 77%.     Nvidia is not the first company to captivate options players. Derivatives bets on electric-vehicle manufacturer Tesla accounted for around half of all equity, index and ETF options premium in October 2021, as the company\u2019s shares soared. Tesla\u2019s options remain a crowd-puller that still often feature on the list of any given day\u2019s most actively traded options.\nThough the frantic pace of trading in Nvidia\u2019s options could ease now that its earnings report is in the rearview mirror, market participants said the AI theme was likely to remain popular among investors.\nSome of the future demand for Nvidia\u2019s options is likely to come from investors who may have missed the wild rally in the stock.    \u201cThere are undoubtedly institutions that may not want to chase an already highly appreciated stock but don\u2019t want to miss out on the rally,\u201d said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers.    Buying options would \u201callow them to get leveraged exposure to Nvidia\u2019s upside but with a defined cash outlay,\u201d he said.\n\n (Reporting by Saqib Iqbal Ahmed in New York; Editing by Ira Iosebashvili and Matthew Lewis)\nDisclaimer: This report is auto generated from the Reuters news service.
