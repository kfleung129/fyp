    "text": " The future of AI hardware is bright, so you don't have to take profits on NVDA stock yet Advertisement Source: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com Nvidia\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) is well-known as the dominant U.S. manufacturer of chips, and especially graphics processing units, for\u00a0artificial intelligence applications. Today, our Nvidia stock analysis will conclude that investors have valid reasons to maintain their share positions in Nvidia this year. In other words, the rally isn\u2019t finished yet and NVDA stock still fully deserves an \u201cA\u201d grade. But don\u2019t just take our word for it. Conduct your own due diligence, and you\u2019ll surely see the signs that Nvidia is still a tech-market titan in 2024. Nvidia is the go-to source of AI-ready hardware components for a multitude of companies, including some famous ones. In fact, we\u2019ve just learned that another \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d company plans to deploy a huge number of Nvidia GPUs this year. Here are the details. Reportedly,\u00a0Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META)\u00a0will have hundreds of thousands of Nvidia-made graphics processing units by the end of this year. This information comes straight from the mouth of Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg (via a Barron\u2019s report). According to Zuckerberg, Meta Platforms will have 350,000\u00a0of Nvidia\u2019s\u00a0H100 GPUs and nearly 600,000 H100 compute-equivalent GPUs by the end of 2024. This is part of Zuckerberg\u2019s plan to build \u201cmassive compute infrastructure to support\u201d Meta Platforms\u2019 \u201cfuture roadmap\u201d for AI. We\u2019re not talking about cheap chips here. The H100 data-center GPU reportedly costs around $25,000 per unit. Per Barron\u2019s, if Meta Platforms buys 350,000 of these GPUs, it will cost nearly $9 billion. Thus, Meta Platforms\u2019 GPU purchases will provide a sizable revenue source for Nvidia. Why should Nvidia\u2019s shareholders be confident? We already mentioned that Meta Platforms is a major buyer of Nvidia\u2019s products. Plus, analysts are overwhelmingly bullish about NVDA stock. Nvidia\u2019s chief executive is extremely confident about the global demand for AI-enabled hardware components. This is significant because Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang certainly has an insider\u2019s perspective on the AI-processor industry\u2019s future. Not long ago, Huang observed that the global demand for AI-compatible chips is booming. Calling AI a \u201crebirth of the industry,\u201d\u00a0the Nvidia\u00a0CEO assured investors, \u201cLast year was the beginning. This year is going to be a huge year.\u201d The implication here, we can assume, is that it would be premature for Nvidia\u2019s investors to take profits now. Clearly, the demand for AI-enabled components isn\u2019t an issue for Nvidia. Huang stated that Nvidia is \u201cworking very hard\u201d to \u201ckeep up with the demand\u201d for these components, and he described the demand as \u201cvery strong.\u201d We\u2019ve made Huang\u2019s confident outlook part of our Nvidia stock analysis today. The CEO\u2019s optimism adds to the already compelling bull case, and might convince Nvidia\u2019s investors not to take profits yet. And if you don\u2019t currently own any Nvidia shares, it\u2019s not too late to consider a long position. At the end of the day, we\u2019re assigning an \u201cA\u201d grade to NVDA stock and encourage investors to take a fresh look at this market-dominating juggernaut.
