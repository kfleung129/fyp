Nvidia share price rose 2.46% with its market capitalization surging to $1.825 trillion, while Alphabet stock price rose 0.55%, leaving it with a value of $1.821 trillion. A day before, Nvidia\u2019s market capitalization rose above Amazon\u2019s for the first time in two decades. Amazon\u2019s market capitalization was $1.776 trillion after its stock rose 1.39% on Wednesday. Nvidia stock price has surged 47% this year after it more than tripled in 2023 led by strong demand for its chips as the company controls about 80% of the high-end AI chip market.
