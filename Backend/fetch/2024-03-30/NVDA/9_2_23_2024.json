    "text": "NEW YORK - Nvidia co-founder and chief executive officer Jensen Huang said artificial intelligence (AI) has hit a \u201ctipping point\u201d, sending the stock to new dizzying heights. The renewed rally has Mr Huang on the verge of his own breakthrough: becoming one of the 20 richest people in the world. Mr Huang\u2019s wealth jumped US$9.6 billion (S$12.9 billion) to US$69.2 billion on Feb 22, a gain that leapfrogged him ahead of Mr Charles Koch of Koch Industries and Chinese bottled-water tycoon Zhong Shanshan to 21st place on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. It is a remarkable rise for the co-founder of the semiconductor company, who was ranked 128th with a net worth of US$13.5 billion as recently as early 2023. Nvidia surged 16 per cent on Feb 22 to a record high, adding about US$277 billion in market value. That was the biggest single-session increase in market history, beating Meta Platforms\u2019 US$197 billion gain earlier in February. The company was able to exceed sky-high investor expectations with a revenue forecast that was more than US$2 billion ahead of analyst expectations. Nvidia\u2019s rally boosted the fortunes of the 30 billionaires on Bloomberg\u2019s wealth list who attribute at least some of their wealth to AI by a combined US$42.8 billion. Mr Charles Liang, CEO of Supermicro Computer, was the biggest winner on a percentage basis with a 33 per cent jump. Mr Huang is now just behind Mrs Julia Flesher Koch and members of the Walmart founder family Alice, Rob and Jim Walton on the wealth index.
