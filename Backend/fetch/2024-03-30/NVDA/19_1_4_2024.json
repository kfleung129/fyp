    "text": " Sell NVDA now, profits may not show up in the coming years Advertisement Source: Evolf / Shutterstock.com Nvidia\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) has been the darling of the\u00a0S&P 500\u00a0in the past year, and NVDA stock is up over 230% since the beginning of 2023 with the expansion of AI. However, investors must understand that a high-quality business doesn\u2019t always mean a good stock. Even if we disregard the regulatory challenges and competitive pressures that Nvidia faces, its stock offers minimal growth at best and ridiculously overvalued at worst. Bulls often tout Nvidia\u2019s forward P/E ratio of 24.39 times, which is not much higher than the S&P 500\u2019s ratio of 21x. However, projections are likely to be revised as growth slows down and the temporary boost from China wears out. First, the company projects $20 billion in revenue in Q4. It\u2019s impressive, but growth is slowing down, from 88% QoQ to 34% QoQ to 10% QoQ. In addition, the company estimates gross margins to remain similar while operating expenses increase. Second, Nvidia\u2019s revenue has been artificially inflated since the U.S. banned Nvidia GPU exports to China this year. As a result, Chinese companies began to stockpile Nvidia\u2019s older models, which are likely to be banned soon. Together, they\u2019ve spent over\u00a0$5 billion\u00a0in a couple of months. Traditionally, China accounted for almost 20% of Nvidia\u2019s revenue. Though we\u2019re not sure if that will go to 0%, it\u2019s a huge blow to Nvidia\u2019s revenue growth. Nvidia is launching\u00a0slower\u00a0chips in China to comply with restrictions. However, this allows Huawei to take market share and build its own GPU business. Since GPUs have become a centerpiece of competition between the U.S. and China, there is no doubt that the Chinese government will do all that it can to ensure Huawei succeeds. Currently, Nvidia trades at a trailing P/E ratio of 63.58, showing that investors are paying a hefty premium at best and massively overvaluing it at worst. Its forward p/e ratio of 24.39 and PEG ratio of 0.48 is a dangerous trap because it looks like the stock is fairly valued, but it means that any negative EPS revisions could send the stock down massively. So far, analysts have continuously pushed EPS estimates higher. That trend is bound to reverse since predictions never fully materialize. In addition, it has a 26.74x price-to-sales ratio, many times greater than the S&P 500\u2019s average of 2.57x, and a 60% premium compared to its ratio at the end of last year. Finally, it\u2019s still essential to address competitive risks. Your business has a problem when your biggest customers are trying to replicate what you\u2019re selling. Most big tech companies are all spending billions of dollars to become the AI leader and invest in developing their GPUs in-house. Analysts are projecting that Nvidia\u2019s revenue will grow by 20% yearly for the next five years. They assume that Nvidia\u2019s market share will be virtually unchallenged with this estimate, making their sequential valuations very likely inaccurate. It\u2019s tough to tell if Nvidia will maintain market share, and its current valuation gives too little room for error to make that estimate. Despite what you might think of Nvidia\u2019s fundamental business, its stock is undoubtedly costly, and betting on it means you have less room for error. Despite near-term headwinds and slowing growth, the stock\u2019s valuation has only been propped up by analyst estimates of the future. Therefore, approach Nvidia with extreme caution.
