Longtime Nvidia board member Tench Coxe \u2014 the former managing director at California-based venture capital investment firm Sutter Hill Ventures \u2014 sold 200,000 shares on March 5 at $850.03 to $852.50, according to\u00a0a regulatory filing. The transaction marks a windfall as high as $170.5 million for Coxe, who has been on Nvidia\u2019s board since 1993. Under the terms of his agreement as a director, Coxe earns restricted stock valued at $255,000 annually as well as $85,000 in cash, Fortune reported. He acquired shares for just $0.82 in the chipmaker in 1997 \u2014 two years before the firm went public. The figure means Coxe made a more than 100,000% profit on his investment nearly three decades ago. For reference, the AI-chip developer\u2019s CEO, Jensen Huang, holds about 86 million shares in the company, a 3.5% stake. Huang\u2019s holdings in the company have minted him a $78 billion fortune, rocketing him to the No. 20 spot on the Bloomberg Billionaire\u2019s List. The day before Coxe\u2019s selloff, Nvidia director Mark Stevens \u2014 who joined the board in 2008 \u2014 sold 12,000 shares at $852.06 to $855.02, earning him roughly $10.2 million, per Fortune, citing a separate Securities and Exchange Commission filing. Stevens \u2014 the billionaire managing partner at private family office investment firm S-Cubed Capital and former partner of high-profile VC firm Sequoia Capital \u2014 shed another 15,000 shares last month, worth about $12 million. And in January, Stevens \u2014 a director since 2008 \u2014 shed 36,000 Nvidia shares, when they were trading at roughly $546 each, for an approximately $19.7 million payday, according to Fortune. Yet another board member, biopharmaceutical veteran Mark Perry \u2014 who also serves as an independent consultant to Nvidia \u2014 15,000 shares for about $11.9 million on Feb. 23, per Fortune. Perry\u2019s transaction took place two days after Nvidia reported that its fourth-quarter revenue beat estimates by an impressive 7% margin. A week later, longtime Nvidia board member and managing partner of private investment firm Square Wave Venture Harvey Jones sold 65,000 of his shares in the company for a total value of $53 million. The six transactions year to date have made four of Nvidia\u2019s 13 board members a collective $276.8 million. Despite their sales, all board members still have a significant stake in Nvidia. Coxe holds around 4.1 million shares, while Stevens\u2019 stake consists of about 4.4 million shares, according to Fortune. Perry still boasts 152,000, shares, and Jones holds roughly 1 million, Fortune reported. The selloffs come as Nvidia has seen historic gains on the Nasdaq, jockeying with Microsoft and Apple \u2014 who have $3 trillion and $2.6 trillion valuations, respectively \u2014 for a spot among the most valuable companies. At the time of writing, Nvidia was trading at $917.10 \u2014 up more than 30% over the past month alone, and a whopping 90.51% year-to-date increase. The company currently boasts a market cap of $2.3 trillion. Representatives for Nvidia declined to comment.
