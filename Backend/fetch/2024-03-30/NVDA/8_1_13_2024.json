    "text": "Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 180 Jim Cramer was jubilant during his program on January 9 as he celebrated the comeback of tech stocks after a decline earlier in January. \u201cStop selling Nvidia, please,\u201d Cramer told his viewers during the program. He was referring to the broader rotation going on in the market where investors are taking profits from technology stocks and investing in other sectors like healthcare and banking. Cramer has long been a fan of NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0and in 2023 he kept praising NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0due to its AI chips demand. In its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter, ClearBridge Large Cap Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA): \u201cMuch of that differential can be attributed to the performance of the Magnificent Seven (Alphabet, Amazon.com, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla), a basket of mega cap growth stocks that accounted for 47.8% of the benchmark return for the quarter and 65.4% for 2023. The ClearBridge Large Cap Growth Strategy maintains exposure to six of the seven stocks, with overweights in Amazon.com, Meta and\u00a0NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA). Those three stocks, as well as Microsoft, were among the leading contributors to Strategy performance for the quarter. Microsoft and Nvidia continued to be supported by strong execution and leadership positions in the implementation of generative artificial intelligence (AI). These are high-quality, cash flow generative businesses that we will continue to own, actively adjusting our positioning sizes based on risk/reward and portfolio construction priorities. With Nvidia shares more than tripling in 2023, we opportunistically took profits throughout the year, an approach that continued in the fourth quarter with additional trims that brought the position down to 6% of overall assets. Active management of our mega cap exposure contributed to the Strategy outperforming the benchmark both in the fourth quarter and through the narrow leadership market of 2023. We also attribute these improved results to solid stock picking, being opportunistic in adding to or initiating new positions in growth companies at or near the bottom of their earnings cycle, and maintaining a commitment to diversification across our three buckets of growth: select, stable and cyclical.\u201d NYSE:NUNYSE:JPMNASDAQ:METANASDAQ:MSFTNASDAQ:NVDANvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)Nu Holdings Ltd.
