    "text": "Even among AI stocks, Super Micro Computer SMCI stock has knocked it out of the park, up 280% year to date. Such a surge makes Nvidia\u2019s NVDA year-to-date gains of 73.2% seem modest. Over the past twelve months, SMCI is up nearly 1,110%. Yet while this outsized performance relative to other AI hardware or \u201cpicks and shovels\u201d plays means an even greater concern of \u201cbubble trouble\u201d ahead, don\u2019t assume that Super Micro\u2019s surge is about to be followed up by a sell-off. Here\u2019s why. SMCI Stock: Justification for its \u2018to the Moon\u2019 Moves Comparing Super Micro Computer to Nvidia and AMD is misleading. Super Micro Computer is not another AI chip designer/manufacturer. Rather, the company builds servers and other AI computer system products that use Nvidia and AMD\u2019s processors. However, even though not in the same industry, Super Micro Computer benefits from the same trend. Strong demand for the company\u2019s products has resulted in a major re-acceleration in growth. For instance, last quarter, the company reported revenue of $3.66 billion, or up 100% compared to the prior year\u2019s quarter. Non-GAAP earnings per share came in at $5.59. This represented around a 71.% year-over-year increase. These strong results played a big role in sparking the SMCI stock rally, but it\u2019s been future forecasts that have really kicked it into overdrive. Based on sell-side forecasts, the analyst community expects more-than 100% revenue growth for the full fiscal year (ending June 2024), with EPS rising by around 90.6%, from $11.43 to $21.78 per share. Analyst forecasts for next fiscal year vary, but the high end of these estimates call for further high revenue (73.2%) and EPS (73.7%) growth. The Show Could Go On (Just Not Indefinitely) Admittedly, even as Super Micro Computer could continue to post impressive levels of growth, one can look at the aforementioned big gains so far for SMCI stock, and argue that this upside is already priced into shares. But while the market may treat possibilities as near-certainties, not only may this be sustainable in the near-term. There may even be room for future potential to be baked into SMCI\u2019s share price. If Super Micro once again reports \u2018beat and raise\u2019 results (like it did for last quarter) when it next releases fiscal results in April, this may fuel another spike for the stock. The \u201cAI boom\u201d has yet to turn into an \u201cAI bust.\u201d With this, the market is likely to stay in a \u201cbuy on the rumor, buy more on the news\u201d type of mood. That said, while there may be an opportunity to stay bullish on SMCI for now, be careful. It\u2019s too early to bet on a crash. It\u2019s not too late to hop in to ride the next wave. However, Super Micro could take a tumble down the road, when (not if) a slowdown, downturn, or full-on bust hits the AI space. Stay Long for Now, But Pay Attention While many factors stand to keep SMCI trending higher, make no mistake. There are two risks that, if they emerge, could mean big trouble for the stock. First, if the tech sector\u2019s build-out of its AI infrastructure shows signs of slowing down, demand for Super Micro\u2019s products will undoubtedly slow down as well. The market loathes a growth slowdown; such an event would likely cause a sharp price decline for shares. Second, even if the \u2018AI revolution\u2019 is still in the early stages, something else could have a negative impact on Super Micro\u2019s growth, and on the price performance of shares: rising competition. Other tech hardware forms could challenge the company\u2019s dominance in the AI computer systems space, affecting both revenue and margins. Hence, while you should keep an eye out for these two red flags, feel free going long or staying long SMCI stock for now.
