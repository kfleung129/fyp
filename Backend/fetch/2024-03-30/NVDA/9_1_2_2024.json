I\u2019m afraid to say I missed the Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) bull run in 2023. The company\u2019s graphics processing units (GPUs) \u2014 notably the H100 \u2014 have powered a revolution in artificial intelligence (AI), allowing for much more complex computational processes, such as deep learning. Nvidia isn\u2019t short on momentum. The stock is up 249.5% over the past 12 months and this was driven by surging demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs). The company has beaten earnings time after time over the past 18 months. Momentum is an often overlooked component on an investment strategy. In fact, it can be one of the best indicators of forward performance \u2014 although this isn\u2019t always the case. While not a perfect indicator of momentum, I\u2019ve attached a relative strength index (RSI) chart below. It shows the stock has rarely encountered low levels of investor interest over the past 12 months. At the time of writing, Nvidia shares are changing hands of $494. However, the average share price target is $658, which is 33.3% higher than the current price. This is normally a good sign as it infers that analysts \u2014 notably those that hold a lot of sway over market narratives \u2014 have a positive position on the stock. This isn\u2019t something I always look at first, but it can be useful if I\u2019m looking to see how my research matches up with that  big brokerages or banks. As such, I may want to view this 33% discount versus the consensus share price target as a buying signal. By contrast, I may see the fact that Tesla trades at a 7% premium to its consensus share price target as sell signal. I believe the most appropriate valuation metric when assessing Nvidia is the price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio. This is an earnings metrics that is adjusted for growth and is calculated by dividing the forward price-to-earnings ratio with the expected annualised earnings growth rate for the next three to five years. Normally, a ratio of one suggests that a company is trading at fair value. And anything under this may suggest the stock is undervalued. Nvidia has a PEG ratio of 0.95, which suggest it\u2019s undervalued based on projected earnings over the next five years. So while it may look expensive using the price-to-earnings ratio, an annualised EPS growth rate of 42.3% over five years means its PEG ratio is attractive. Nvidia\u2019s GPUs were once primarily used for gaming. But in the last quarter, the company\u2019s data centre unit saw $14.51bn in sales, reflecting a remarkable 279% on the quarter a year previous. Of course, other companies are after its crown and there\u2019s no guarantee the firm will remain dominant for long. However, Nvidia\u2019s chips are by far the best option for efficiently processing the huge quantities of data needed to train and operate generative AI language models \u2014 and this means it\u2019ll take a while for other companies to catch up. In November, Nvidia introduced a new top-of-the-line chip for AI work, the\u00a0HGX H200. The new GPU upgrades the wildly-in-demand H100 with 1.4x more memory bandwidth and 1.8x more memory capacity. Personally, I\u2019m still interested in Nvidia, and I\u2019m looking to add the stock to my portfolio. I\u2019m expecting more growth in 2024.
