We\u2019ve asked a lot of questions: Is it overvalued after a 1,634% rise over the past four years? Can the promise of AI deliver the earnings growth expected of the company? Is its position among the mega-cap stocks truly deserved? The first two questions above will only be answered in hindsight, and the third can only be tackled by comparing Nvidia with a similar-sized company. Apple Inc. AAPL for instance. Apple has the larger market cap \u2014 $2.61 trillion. Nvidia is not far behind, sitting on a valuation of $2.29 trillion.

When it launched the iPhone in 2007, its market cap was around $62 billion. A decade later it was $556 billion. Nvidia, by comparison, stayed flat throughout this period with a market cap just above $2 billion The following data were compiled by Charlie Bilello, chief market strategist at Creative Planning, which he posted on X on Thursday. Here are Bilello\u2019s findings: Take a look at Bilello\u2019s chart here: The chart shows in stark detail \u2014 something that percentage moves don\u2019t often convey in words \u2014 just how much growth Nvidia\u2019s valuation has gained in just the two months or so of 2024. At the close on Dec. 29, 2023, Nvidia\u2019s market cap was $1.22 trillion. The means now, at $2.29 trillion, it\u2019s added nearly $1.1 trillion in just 67 days. Apple took four years to add its most recent trillion. Isn\u2019t this bubble territory? Analysts don\u2019t think so. Many believe Nvidia warrants this valuation because of its earnings creation and its earnings potential. Two days ago, investor and financial TV host featured the stock on his CNBC program saying that given the company\u2019s ability to consistently beat market earnings expectations, its valuation was not excessive. Meanwhile, it\u2019s become a favored stock of retail investors according to a recent note from Vanda Research with purchases exceeding $1 billion over a 10-day period, compared to just $500 million of Tesla Inc. TSLA shares. \"Trading is about mood and momentum, and when you think mood and momentum, I don't think I have ever seen a company celebrated as much as Nvidia,\" said Aswath Damodaran, professor of finance at Stern School of Business, New York University, in an interview on CNBC last week. Damodaran did, however, caution that the pricing may have got a little out of control. We will know with hindsight.
