Here is what the market says. 1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Nvidia\u2019s massive AI opportunity A PwC report estimates that by 2030, AI could contribute around $15.7 trillion to the global economy and boost the world GDP by 26 percent. Nvidia, along with other AI firms, is at the forefront of this growth, due to the widespread use of its products in the development of AI. During its early days, Nvidia was well known for its use in gaming. In the Q4 earnings call, Nvidia CFO Colette Kress mentioned an increasing demand for AI across the world and new companies using language models: Adept, AI21, Character.ai, Cohere, Mistral, Perplexity, and Runway. She also cited new startups creating language learning models to serve the specific languages, cultures, and customs of many regions of the world. Other learning models are being used by biotech companies such as Recursion Pharmaceuticals and Generate Biomedicines. \"These companies are driving demand for Nvidia AI infrastructure through hyperscale or GPU-specialised cloud providers,\" she added. 2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Nvidia\u2019s first-mover advantage Nvidia\u2019s chips play a very important role in development of AI systems and building the infrastructure. This is of advantage to Nvidia and other such companies, which have a growing market share in the field. The demand is expected to continue to rise. But building expertise in the segment takes time, and first movers such as Nvidia, which has grown into a market leader, have an edge. Fisdom\u2019s Nirav Karkera says that in sunrise sectors such as this, there are no clear winners, but early movers have the advantage of a larger market space due to this need for building capabilities and market share. While other players are also growing -- from Qualcomm to even Alphabet, Nvidia is expected to see continued growth. 3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As Nvidia\u2019s earnings grow, valuations look reasonable As of December 2023, big tech companies Microsoft, Apple, Meta, Nivida, Google and Amazon had a total market cap of around $11 trillion. At that time, Nvidia\u2019s market cap was around $1.2 trillion, making it the fifth largest among the six companies. According to a CB Insights report, among big tech players, as of December 2023, Nvidia has seen earnings growth at a faster pace than others. In Q4, Nvidia's EPS grew 486 percent year-on-year, excluding certain items. The $5.16 figure handily beat analyst estimates of $4.60. Nvidia's current P/E as per CNBC data is 66.07 against Amazon's 60.56, Alphabet (Google) 's 24.82, Meta's 32.56 and Microsoft's 37.11. Talking to Bloomberg, David Wagner, Portfolio Manager at Aptus Capital Advisors LLC, said that despite the recent run-up, Nvidia continues to be the cheapest AI-oriented stock. 4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Analysts bullish on Nvidia stock despite huge jump; target prices hiked Analysts continue to remain positive on Nvidia stock. Prior to the earnings, five large brokerages raised their target price on the stock. In a February 5 report, analysts at Morgan Stanley said that they believe Nvidia will remain \"the industry gold standard for the foreseeable future, given its robust hardware and software offerings and, importantly, the pace at which it continues to innovate.\" Goldman Sachs has a \u2018buy\u2019 call on the stock and has raised the target price to $800 from its previous $625. Other brokerages like UBS and Mizuho have also raised targets. Nvidia\u2019s stock ended the last trading session at $788.2. According to a Bloomberg report, UBS lifted its target to $850 from $580, while Mizuho raised its target to $825 from $625, calling it the \"best AI play.\" Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on\u00a0Moneycontrol.com\u00a0are their own and not those of the website or its management.\u00a0Moneycontrol.com\u00a0advises users to check with certified experts before taking any investment decisions.
