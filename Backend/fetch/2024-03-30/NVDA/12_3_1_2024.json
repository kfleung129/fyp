Help Center Mar 1, 2024 at 7:25 pm GMT By Noel Randewich March 1 (Reuters) -Nvidia's NVDA.O stock market value was on track to close above $2 trillion for the first time on Friday after an upbeat report from Dell Technologies DELL.N reignited Wall Street's AI-fueled rally. Nvidia's stock added 3.5% after Dell, which sells high-end servers made with Nvidia's processors, gave an upbeat forecast late on Thursday, pointing to a surge in orders for its AI-optimized servers. Dell's shares soared as much as 38% to a record high. They were last up 30%. Friday's gains put Nvidia's market capitalization at $2.05 trillion, making it Wall Street's third most valuable company behind Microsoft and Apple at $3.07 trillion and $2.75 trillion, respectively.  Super Micro Computer SMCI.O, another company that sells servers made with Nvidia's chips, jumped 6%. Other chipmakers exposed to AI rallied to record highs, with Broadcom AVGO.O and Marvell Technology MRVL.O each up about 8%, while Advanced Micro Devices AMD.O climbed nearly 5%. The PHLX chip index .SOX rallied 4.5% to its own record high, lifting its 2024 gain to 18%. Nvidia controls about 80% of the high-end AI chip market, with customers including ChatGPT creator OpenAI, Microsoft MSFT.O, Alphabet GOOGL.O and Meta Platforms META.O snapping up tight supplies of its components to compete in the fast-emerging generative AI sector.  The company has recently become Wall Street's most traded stock by value, day to day, replacing Tesla TSLA.O. Investors exchanged $36 billion worth of Nvidia's stock on average over the past 30 sessions, compared to $21 billion a day for Tesla. Trading in Nvidia on Friday afternoon reached $28 billion worth of shares. On Feb. 23, the Santa Clara, California-based company added $277 billion in stock market value in just one session, a Wall Street record, after it forecast a roughly threefold surge in quarterly revenue. Nvidia's stock has now risen 65% in 2024 after more than tripling last year. Last month, its stock market value overtook Amazon AMZN.O and Alphabet. A week ago, Nvidia's stock market value edged above $2 trillion for the first time before receding by the end of the session. Saudi Aramco 2223.SE has a $2.045 trillion market capitalization, although over 90% of it is closely held by the government of Saudi Arabia and less than 2% of its shares are available for trading by investors, according to LSEG data.

When you visit a website, the website sends the cookie to your computer. Your computer stores it in a file located inside your web browser. Cookies do not transfer viruses or malware to your computer. Because the data in a cookie does not change when it travels back and forth, it has no way to affect how your computer runs, but they act more like logs (i.e. they record user activity and remember stateful information) and they get updated every time you visit a website. We may obtain information about you by accessing cookies, sent by our website. Different types of cookies keep track of different activities. For example, session cookies are used only when a person is actively navigating a website. Once you leave the website, the session cookie disappears. Why are cookies useful? We use functional cookies to analyse how visitors use our website, as well as track and improve our website\u2019s performance and function. This allows us to provide a high-quality customer experience by quickly identifying and fixing any issues that may arise. For example, we might use cookies to keep track of which website pages are most popular and which method of linking between website pages is most effective. The latter also helps us to track if you were referred to us by another website and improve our future advertising campaigns. Another use of cookies is to store your log in sessions, meaning that when you log in to the Members Area to deposit funds, a \"session cookie\" is set so that the website remembers that you have already logged in. If the website did not set this cookie, you will be asked for your login and password on each new page as you progress through the funding process. In addition, functional cookies, for example, are used to allow us to remember your preferences and identify you as a user, ensure your information is secure and operate more reliably and efficiently. For example, cookies save you the trouble of typing in your username every time you access our trading platform, and recall your preferences, such as which language you wish to see when you log in.
