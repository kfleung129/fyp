    "text": " Competition exists, but Nvidia has shown its core business remains well-insulated Advertisement Source: Sergio Photone / Shutterstock.com Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has proved to be a standout holding for long-term investors. Indeed, one look at Nvidia\u2019s stock chart over essentially any time frame shows what investors hope to see. That is, a line moving up and to the right, rather consistently. This will have big implications for NVDA stock holders in the future. Of course, Nvidia\u2019s recent performance has been remarkable. This stock has more than tripled over the past year and grown roughly 1,3000% over the past five years. Now trading near an all-time high, NVDA stock remains a top choice on Wall Street, given its strong year-to-date gains. In 2023, Wedbush\u2019s Dan Ives predicted a new tech bull market would be fueled by AI hardware growth. In this space, Nvidia dominates generative AI chips, making the investment thesis around this giant easy to understand. As the company continues to generate solid revenue and profit growth from its 85% market share in accelerator chips, I expect this stock\u2019s strong performance is likely to continue over the long term. While risks are prevalent in the coming 12-24 months, there\u2019s good reason why NVDA stock is trading near all-time highs at the time of writing. Let\u2019s dive into why so many investors remain bullish on this name. NVDA stock has what only can be described as a dominant AI sector presence. The company\u2019s significant market share in high-performance GPUs has led to incredible growth, and investors have certainly profited from this improved trajectory. The company\u2019s recently released advanced H200 AI chips emphasize the company\u2019s commitment to technological innovation. Data center growth is expected to continue at a brisk pace in the years to come, and these chips should be a central part of the Nvidia story through 2025 and beyond. Additionally, the company has seen strong growth in its gaming segment, which currently constitutes around one-third of the company\u2019s revenues. Nvidia also holds a dominating share of workstation graphics, and its software ecosystem with 100+ RTX-supported applications and AI integration ensures future growth. Additionally, Nvidia\u2019s DRIVE platform has bolstered its position in the automotive market. Last year\u2019s impressive rally was driven by incredible demand for Nvidia\u2019s core chips. However, there are other factors investors are increasingly focusing on, such as the company\u2019s accelerated computing platform. Nvidia\u2019s HGX platform, which is based on the Hopper Tensor Core GPU architecture and InfiniBand networking, has seen significant growth. As more AI supercomputing companies come to market and data center infrastructure companies focus on growth, Nvidia\u2019s hardware and software services will continue to come into focus. Nvidia\u2019s data center segment is perhaps the most important driver of long-term growth and has been seen acceleration of late. The company\u2019s compute revenue quadrupled year-over-year, and Q3 networking revenue nearly tripled. I think there are a number of drivers that could see this growth rate remain very robust for many quarters to come. In 2023, Nvidia\u2019s impressive stock growth has certainly raised valuation concerns. With NVDA stock now trading at around 31 times sales, it\u2019s hard to build a thesis around this company on the basis of multiple expansions. Additionally, if data center revenue peaks this year, it\u2019s possible the company\u2019s multiple could come down to reflect a more benign environment in the years to come. That said, consumers\u2019 appetite for data is endless, and I think there\u2019s a good reason why the bull thesis around Nvidia drowns out the noise. Despite uncertainties, the company\u2019s robust investments in infrastructure support large language models and generative AI applications which should see sustained demand for years to come. Nvidia\u2019s recent strong results, its myriad of growth factors, and its $10 billion share buyback program all point to improving fundamentals over time. So long as NVDA stock continues to grow into its valuation, there\u2019s room for upside. Accordingly, for those bullish on sectors tied to data usage and AI computing needs, Nvidia will remain a top option to consider for the long term.
