    "text": "Justin Sullivan/Getty Images News Amidst the tightening U.S. export restrictions, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) reportedly plans to begin mass production of an artificial intelligence chip it designed for China in the second quarter of 2024. Citing people familiar with the matter, Reuters reported that initial production volume of the H20 chip will be limited, with the company looking at primarily fulfilling orders for major customers. Originally scheduled for launch last November, H20 is the most powerful of the three China-focused chips Nvidia (NVDA) developed to comply with U.S. export restrictions. The chipmaker is yet to announce the sale of any of the three chips. Nvidia (NVDA) and many other tech giants are scheduled to unveil their latest developments at the Consumer Electronics Show happening in Las Vegas this week. The firm is expected to showcase several new GPUs at the event, including the RTX 4080 Super, the 4070 Ti Super, and the 4070 Super, as it looks to maintain its lead in the space. "
