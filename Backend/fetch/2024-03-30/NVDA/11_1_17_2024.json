The company's CEO, Sunil Gupta, told Reuters that its latest AI purchase will be worth $500 million, and consist of 16,000 H100 and GH200 GPUs by March 2025.

Yotta is part of the Nvidia Partner Network and offers its own GPU-based Shakti Cloud platform. It operates three data center campuses in India, with sites in Mumbai, Gujarat, and New Delhi. It plans to launch a facility at the Gujarat International Finance Tec-City, as well as Dhaka in Bangladesh. The company also has Edge locations in operation or development in Lucknow, Guwahati, Bhubaneshwar, Coimbatore, Indore, Nagpur, Jaipur, and Chandigarh. \"India's AI ambition is just not possible unless this infra comes to India,\" Gupta told Reuters.
