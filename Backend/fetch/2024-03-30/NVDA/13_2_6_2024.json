Ripple has overcome a critical resistance level and flipped into a support floor on the weekly time frame. This development happened\u00a0while XRP tightly consolidated\u00a0for roughly 250 days. Investors can expect XRP to kickstart a massive rally. Optimism\u00a0volatility\u00a0has shrunk in the ours leading to the network\u2019s cliff unlock. It joins the likes of dYdX\u00a0and Sui, which have similar events on their calendars. As token unlocks are often considered bearish catalysts, investors should\u00a0brace for a reaction after the event. Bitcoin could clear $73,777 peak as BTC bulls resurface. Ethereum might fall 10% before next leg up as ETH RSI teases with sell signal. XRP could lose $0.6000 threshold as Ripple bulls fail to show up. Jito price action shows a potential cup and handle formation. Based on theoretical measurement rules, a successful breakout could yield a 56% rally to $6.0.\u00a0A breakdown of the $3.86 support level would create a lower low for JTO and invalidate the bullish thesis. Bitcoin (BTC) price action remains unchanged as it trades below the 2021 ATH for the fourth consecutive week. With Grayscale\u2019s ETF outflows slowing down, investors expect a positive outlook for the crypto markets, but the short-term directional bias, at least from a technical perspective, remains bearish for BTC.
