Here's a look at the trade and how much the position has risen in value. What Happened: Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has generated numerous headlines for her disclosures of trading of Nvidia stock and options thanks to her venture capitalist husband Paul Pelosi. Other Congress members bought shares of AI leader Nvidia as well. A new trade disclosed by a member of Congress won't raise as many red flags as million-dollar questionable trades made by the Pelosi\u2019s. U.S. Representative Michael Guest (R-Miss.) disclosed buying $1,000 to $15,000 worth of shares of Nvidia. The disclosure, shared by Congresstrading on Twitter, shows the trade took place on Feb. 20. This means the trade happened the day before the fourth quarter earnings from Nvidia. The technology giant reported earnings per share and revenue that beat estimates from analysts. Revenue of $22.1 billion was up 265% year-over-year. Nvidia shares are up over 275% in the last year, and the strong fourth-quarter financial results have helped Nvidia shoot past a market capitalization of $2 trillion as one of the most valuable companies worldwide. Here's a look at how Guest's trade is working out.
