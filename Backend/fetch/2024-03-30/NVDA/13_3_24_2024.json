One important goal is to speed up the delivery of new treatments that can save lives and make the research process more productive. The American global company Cognizant provides business process outsourcing (BPO) services. It is also an IT services and consulting firm. Kumar Mahadeva and Francisco D\u2019Souza started the business in 1994 as a technology unit inside Dun & Bradstreet. In 1996, it started working with outside clients. About 70% of Cognizant\u2019s workers live in India, but the company\u2019s main office is in Teaneck, New Jersey. Check Out:\u00a0Is Gen AI Set to Dominate SEO? Report Suggests a Potential Takeover by 2027 As part of the normal process of finding new drugs, a lot of scientific research and clinical data needs to be looked over to find useful information. Traditional methods are also expensive and take a long time to build, which means they fail a lot of the time. Gen AI tools help clinical researchers quickly sort through huge datasets, guess how different drug compounds will interact with each other, and create new, workable ways to develop drugs. Anna Elango, EVP of Cognizant, said that generative AI has the potential to change the way new drugs are studied, developed, and brought to market more than any other technological progress in the last few decades. This could make lifesaving discoveries easier to get, faster, and smarter. Cognizant can help our life sciences clients reach this goal in a safe, responsible, and cost-effective way by working with NVIDIA. With BioNeMo, Cognizant wants to give its clients access to a set of model-making services, such as pre-trained models, cutting-edge frameworks, and APIs that let them train and customize enterprise models using their own data and NVIDIA\u2019s pre-trained, industry-specific generative AI models. These services will include NVIDIA\u2019s deep life sciences and AI domain expertise. With this service, you can analyze data with less manual work and without having to write complicated code or set up and manage infrastructure. A VP at NVIDIA called Alvin DaCosta said, \u201cGenerative AI will drive the next wave of enterprise productivity gains across industries.\u201d This will be made possible by the NVIDIA AI business software platform. \u201cUsing NVIDIA BioNeMo, Cognizant will help provide its life sciences clients with advanced, secure and reliable AI services to drive improved outcomes with custom drug discovery applications.\u201d Cognitive works with top global companies in pharmaceuticals, biotech, and medical products on everything from research and development to digital health. This work helps the healthcare industry improve science, patient outcomes, and business value by promoting a patient-centered approach and better interactions with healthcare workers. More than 18 million people around the world use the products made by a medical device company because of Cognizant\u2019s life sciences services. Cognizant and NVIDIA are going to work together in areas like manufacturing and car engineering, where generation AI can boost output, cut costs, and speed up new ideas. Cognizant is going to open an NVIDIA AI Center of Excellence in 2019 to help them come up with new ideas using NVIDIA technologies like the NVIDIA Metropolis, NVIDIA Omniverse, and NVIDIA AI Enterprise systems.
