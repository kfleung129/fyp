    "text": "Justin Sullivan Justin Sullivan Nvidia's (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares have rocketed higher in recent weeks, rightly or wrongly. The stock has been the biggest contributor to the S&P 500 and the broader market success in 2024. Now, Nvidia's stock appears to be showing signs of extreme stress and fatigue. Whether real long-term or not, the AI hype has certainly shown up in Nvidia's stock price, with analysts' earnings and revenue estimates rocketing higher since May, when the company first issued very strong guidance on its new AI products. Bloomberg Bloomberg However, some of its valuation and metrics are starting to look like the Nvidia of old, with a price-to-sales ratio for the next twelve months now at 35, back to those old 2021 levels, and a PE ratio of 33.5. It is quite possible that the valuation makes sense if Nvidia is actually able to put up the growth rates that analysts expect over the next couple of years. Bloomberg Bloomberg However, much of the stock price movement appears to be options-related rather than fundamentally driven, at least that part of the rally that has allowed the company's market cap to climb by almost $650 billion in the last 120 trading days, or more than the size of Tesla (TSLA). Bloomberg Bloomberg But what is clear is that since November 1, the put/call ratio has taken a noticeable turn lower, indicating that call volumes have been higher than put volumes regularly. The ratio averaged 0.8 from July to October and then dropped to an average of 0.66 from November until now. This tells us that there are more calls trading relative to puts since the big run higher in the stock at the start of November. Bloomberg Bloomberg But more recently, what has also become clear is that as the stock has been ripping higher, we have seen the implied volatility of the 95% and 105% moneyness 1-month options implied volatility rip higher. Bloomberg Bloomberg The story's underlying message comes from these implied volatility levels that have ripped higher, not from the number of puts and calls. The rising implied volatility levels show that the skew has been towards the calls. As the stock has been rising, the implied volatility of the calls has been rising faster than the puts, which is determined by taking the implied volatility of the 95% 1-month options and subtracting it from the 105% 1-month options. Bloomberg Bloomberg This suggests that instead of the rising stock price bringing in people betting on the stock price to fall or to hedge their profits, the rising stock has instead brought in more investors looking for the stock price to continue to rise. However, these events tend to create self-inflected wounds over time because the higher the implied volatility rises, the more costly it becomes to continue trading the calls, and the more likely the trade will run out of steam. For the bullish betting to pay off, the stock needs to continue to rise, and when implied volatility is low, the options are cheap. Still, as the implied volatility rises, options become more expensive, so fewer options trade. But for the trade to work, there needs to be a continued flow of call options trading because when an investor buys a call option, in most cases, the seller of the options is the market maker. Because the market maker sold the call options, the market maker is now effectively short Nvidia, and so to hedge their position, the market maker is likely to go out and buy the stock in order to remain neutral. The process of the market maker buying shares can end up pushing the shares higher. But as the implied volume of the calls rises and the cost becomes more expensive, fewer calls trade. With fewer calls, market makers don't have to keep adding to their hedges as much, which leads to the trade's momentum fading. Or worse, if the stock declines, the market maker may start to unwind some of their long hedges. While it may be early in the process, the early signs suggest that Nvidia's rising implied volatility levels are starting to result in daily call volumes falling, indicating that calls are no longer cheap enough to make a profit. Bloomberg Bloomberg Additionally, there is a lot of call gamma at $700 which could be acting a resistance level for the stock, for the expiration date on February 16. This is likely a level that brings out sellers of calls that have gone in the money, and investors are looking to monetize. Bloomberg Bloomberg So, at this point of the game, it is quite possible that the stock's higher run is nearing a point of exhaustion and that a big higher run may be closer to its end at this point in the game.
