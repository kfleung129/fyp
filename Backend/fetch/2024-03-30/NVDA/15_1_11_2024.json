    "text": "The semiconductor market is staging a solid rebound after a not-so-impressive first half of 2023. Semiconductor sales rose a solid 5.3% year over year in November 2023, the first time since August 2022, as demand rebounded on easing inflation, the Semiconductor Industry Association said on Jan 9. Sales totaled $48 billion in November compared to $45.6 billion a year ago. Also, sales jumped a solid 2.9% month over month in November from October\u2019s total of $46.6 billion. The year-over-year jump in sales in November was driven primarily by robust demand from China, where sales were up 7.6%. Besides, sales rose 7.1% in Asia Pacific and 5.6% in Europe, while it witnessed a 3.5% rise in the Americas. The semiconductor market, which reached unprecedented heights during the peak of the pandemic, suffered from a supply-chain crisis in 2021, which saw sales slowing at a fast pace. Although demand was high in 2022 and the supply-chain crisis eased, rising prices and inflationary pressures started taking a toll on sales. The Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary tightening campaign that saw rates being hiked by 525 basis points further slowed sales. However, semiconductor demand was always high from multiple industries, which saw the industry making a steady rebound from the second quarter of 2023 and sales have since been on the rise. Demand for semiconductors is expected to rise through 2024, which bodes well for the industry. The semiconductor market is expected to experience positive outcomes due to the global integration and extensive utilization of consumer electronics. Moreover, the growing influence and broad implementation of advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, and machine learning are foreseen to be significant factors in sustaining the ongoing demand for semiconductors. According to the World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (WSTS), global semiconductor sales are projected to jump 13.1% in 2024. WSTS estimates global sales to reach $588.4 billion.
