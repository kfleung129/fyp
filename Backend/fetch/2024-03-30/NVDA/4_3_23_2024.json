    "text": " The S&P500 The index has soared higher over the past 16 months, recovering from bear market lows to reach record levels \u2013 and cement a new bull market.  And the movement was led by one group of stocks in particular.  Dubbed the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d in reference to the 1960 Western, these players are technology stocks, and each is a leader in his specialty. Some investors may worry that after these gains it will be too late to get in on these stock market stars.  The concern is that they may have become too expensive and are about to stagnate or decline.  But a stock with spectacular momentum could still have plenty of room if the company has strong long-term prospects.  And that\u2019s the case for some of today\u2019s best-performing stocks.  Let\u2019s take a look at two Magnificent Seven companies we can buy right now hand over fist. Image source: Getty Images. Table of Contents Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) sells the world\u2019s highest-performing artificial intelligence (AI) chip, the H100 graphics processing unit (GPU) that powers critical operations such as the training and inference of AI models.  This has helped Nvidia\u2019s revenue and net income grow by triple digits recently and reach record levels.  And it\u2019s also caused the stock to rise more than 240% in the past year. Of course, rivals like Advanced micro devices And Intel exist in this market, but so far Nvidia has shown it has what it takes to stay ahead.  And at the company\u2019s GTC AI conference this week, CEO Jensen Huang announced product launches and updates that give us reason to be optimistic. One particular piece of news was especially notable, and that is the upcoming release of Nvidia\u2019s Blackwell architecture and chips.  The platform, available later this year, will help customers run generative AI on large language models (LLMs) at a cost and energy consumption level 25 times lower than its predecessor. CEOs of the largest technology companies of Meta Platforms Unpleasant Tesla has responded to the Blackwell announcement, showing their willingness to use the platform.  \u201cThere\u2019s nothing better than NVIDIA hardware for AI right now,\u201d Tesla\u2019s Elon Musk said in Nvidia Blackwell\u2019s launch statement.  And the largest cloud companies said they are ready to make the technology available to customers. The story continues All of this points to a new era of growth for this chip giant, which means Nvidia, trading at 36x times forward earnings estimates, still looks like a buy today. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is a great technology stock to buy now because it is already benefiting and will benefit from three growth areas: e-commerce, cloud computing and AI.  The company is a leader in both e-commerce and cloud computing services, and is investing heavily in AI to grow revenues in both businesses. First, AI aside, Amazon has become an e-commerce giant and continues to build its position thanks to its Prime subscription service, which offers members many benefits that keep them coming back.  AI has the potential to reduce Amazon\u2019s costs and improve the shopping experience for customers \u2013 and that could translate into profit growth.  Amazon uses AI to streamline e-commerce operations, find the best delivery routes to shorten delivery times, and uses AI to help customers find the products they need.  And these are just a few examples. Through Amazon Web Services (AWS), the cloud company, Amazon offers a wide range of services to its customers, and these services include virtually every aspect of AI: from chips to enable the training of LLMs to a fully managed service that allows customers to adapt the best existing LLMs.  Because AWS is already a leader in the cloud, chances are that when customers are interested in launching an AI project, they will do so right there on AWS. So Amazon uses AI to improve its operations and save time and money \u2013 and sells AI services to customers.  And this means it could achieve a double victory in the field of AI. Given all this and Amazon\u2019s long track record of earnings growth, it seems like the stock, which is trading at 42 times forward earnings estimates, can be bought hand over fist today.
