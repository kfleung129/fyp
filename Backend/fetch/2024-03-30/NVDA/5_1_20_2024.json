Update: We\u2019ve heard from Nvidia and the company makes the point that the rumors aired by the YouTube leaker do not represent the full picture of RTX 4070 Super sales. Scan Computers in the UK is one retailer that offers up a different view to MLID\u2019s sources, with CEO Elan Raja noting that: \u201cThe RTX 4070 Super has been a great launch at Scan. We\u2019re pleased to have been able to get it in the hands of so many gamers.\u201d Original story follows below... Nvidia\u2019s RTX 4070 Super just came out yesterday, but day one sales might not have been what Team Green wanted to see, we\u2019re told. Moore\u2019s Law is Dead (MLID) on YouTube chewed over the subject of the initial response to the first new Super revamp (two more are inbound), and the feedback from the leaker\u2019s sources is pretty negative. MLID quotes no fewer than six sources (at retailers and distributors) to give us a flavor for interest and sales levels with the RTX 4070 Super (along with others who didn\u2019t want to be quoted). The consensus? That the sales of this graphics card were relatively lackluster on the initial day of release, with stock remaining strong, even with the MSRP models that can often sell out pretty sharpish on launch day. So, that very much wasn\u2019t the case with the RTX 4070 Super, and even on the Nvidia site, the Founders Edition model didn\u2019t sell out. At the time of writing, looking at Newegg for example, RTX 4070 Super stock still appears to be plentiful, with no models out of stock \u2013 and both the variants at the MSRP are still available to buy, too.

On top of that, RTX 4070 Super stock is rumored to be a bit lighter than expected \u2013 and only \u2018decent\u2019 inventory levels were anticipated by MLID\u2019s various insiders in the first place. Meaning that not only is stock still on shelves \u2013 at MSRP \u2013 but this is with thinner on the ground shipments than expected. Some of the quotes from MLID\u2019s sources include that the RTX 4070 Super launch inventory is about half of what the RTX 4070 witnessed upon its release, and that sales of the new Super are \u201cvery low\u201d and only MSRP models are really selling. Other sources commenting on sales go even stronger on the negative side, with one person claiming sales are a \u201cdisaster\u201d for day one, and another observing RTX 4070 Super figures were actually worse than the RTX 4080 sales for launch day (yes \u2013 ouch). The source who made the disaster comment was from a graphics card maker, and also expressed some frustration at being told by Nvidia to push custom models which are priced over the MSRP, while Team Green sells its Founders Edition for the recommended price direct from its own website. So, what\u2019s going on with the RTX 4070 Super? Well, firstly we need to bear in mind that this is just chatter from the grapevine. It is, however, some pretty consistent chatter that\u2019s largely in agreement, so these are very definitely worrying rumblings. And as noted, stock is visibly staying strong (certainly in the US) for now, so there clearly isn\u2019t any huge rush of demand, that\u2019s for sure. The second thing to bear in mind is that these are just day one sales we\u2019re talking about. Let\u2019s give this graphics card a chance, shall we? Plus, January is traditionally a time when people are maybe struggling a bit more than usual financially (until that first pay packet rolls in). It\u2019s entirely possible that momentum will pick up for the RTX 4070 Super. As indeed MLID points out, the vanilla RTX 4070 was a bit slow out of the gate, but it went on to sell very well (and rank nicely on our list of the best graphics card, where it has now been succeeded by the 4070 Super, we should add). That could happen again here, but there are concerns with the apparent sluggishness of the RTX 4070 Super even at this early stage. Exploring the reasons why PC gamers might not be so keen on Nvidia\u2019s new graphics card, there\u2019s a recurring theme around complaints online, which is that in 2024, 12GB seems like an even shakier loadout than it did with the RTX 4070 last year. What many gamers wanted was an upgrade to 16GB, and the pricing of the RTX 4070 Super, which is upper-mid-range, is really leaving a bad taste in the mouth of some folks given that 12GB of video memory. It\u2019s lacking in future-proofing, and as we point out in our review of the Founders Edition, the VRAM hampers this graphics card\u2019s potential when it comes to 4K gaming. What compounds all this on the value front is that AMD\u2019s RX 7800 XT can now be had at around $500 in the US (again on Newegg), so it\u2019s a clear hundred bucks cheaper than the RTX 4070 Super. Quite simply, that AMD graphics card makes more sense as a value proposition right now (assuming you don\u2019t care about ray tracing, that is, where Nvidia reigns as the undisputed champ, of course). We\u2019ll just have to watch Nvidia\u2019s RTX 4070 Super sales going forward, of course, but we\u2019re already wondering whether pricing will need to be adjusted down the line. Is that something Team Green will be willing to look at if things pan out that way? Well, we can only guess, but MLID also airs a worrying suggestion that future shipments of the RTX 4070 Super may be more skewed to custom models that are pitched above the MSRP \u2013 just another niggling doubt to add to the pile here for this revamped GPU. Another option might be to push the RTX 4070 Ti Super harder instead, with its 16GB of VRAM. (That GPU will supposedly have much lesser stock levels to begin with when it comes out, as per previous MLID rumors \u2013 allowing for the existing RTX 4070 Ti stock to be cleared).
