    "text": "Even after the breathtaking rally last year, our Nvidia\u00a0NVDA stock outlook calls for higher prices in 2024. How is this possible? We\u2019ve said it before, and we\u2019ll say it again until it sinks in. You don\u2019t need to sit on the sidelines because you think you \u201cmissed out.\u201d As long as there\u2019s an intense demand for Nvidia\u2019s artificial intelligence compatible chips, the short sellers will continue to lose their shirts. Nevertheless, the doubters will dig in their heels. For instance, we caught wind of a university professor reportedly blogging about selling Nvidia stock. People can choose to buy or sell whatever they want, but we\u2019re confident that Nvidia\u2019s growth story is far from over in 2024. NVDA Stock Catalyst: A New Business Unit Is Coming Sorry to disappoint the short sellers, but the good news just keeps on rolling in for Nvidia and the company\u2019s investors. For example, Reuters just broke the news story that Nvidia is creating a new business unit to design customized chips. This news, according to Reuters, comes courtesy of \u201cnine sources familiar with\u201d Nvidia\u2019s plans. Furthermore, Nvidia reportedly plans to sell these \u201cbespoke\u201d (i.e., customized) chips to \u201ccloud computing firms and others,\u201d including advanced AI processors. Nvidia already has a near-monopoly with roughly 80% of the high-end AI-chip market. However, there\u2019s always room to expand and try out new ventures. Nvidia\u2019s H100 and A100 chips are the company\u2019s go-to, all-purpose, AI-compatible processors. If the market for customized AI chips grows in 2024, however, then Nvidia\u00a0will want to meet the demand. That\u2019s why it\u2019s a brilliant and forward-thinking move for Nvidia to invest in this new business unit today, in order to capture a potentially explosive opportunity in the coming quarters. Nvidia\u2019s Graphics Cards Are Selling Like Hotcakes To put it mildly, there\u2019s an imbalance between the supply of and the demand for Nvidia\u2019s RTX 4090 graphics cards. In certain regions of Asia, the imbalance has reached the level of an outright supply crisis. A report from Benzinga, supported by information from Nikkei Asia, cites the U.S. government\u2019s restrictions on exports of advanced, AI-capable chips to China. The demand for RTX 4090 graphics cards is intense in Southeast Asia and Taiwan. Thus, it might be a cliche to say this, but these graphics cards\u00a0are selling like hotcakes. The Benzinga report pointed to price hikes of as much as 60% for Nvidia\u2019s RTX 4090 graphics cards. There\u2019s also strong, ongoing demand for the company\u2019s H100 chips. Maybe this isn\u2019t the intended effect of the U.S. government\u2019s chip-export restrictions. Still, it\u2019s a sign that Nvidia\u2019s best-in-class, AI-enabled products\u00a0are extremely popular, not only in America but internationally. NVDA Stock Outlook: The Sellers Keep Getting It Wrong In 2024, just like in 2023, Nvidia\u00a0remains an innovator and a boundary-breaker. The company\u2019s chips are in demand, sometimes even to the point of causing a supply crisis. Hence, our NVDA stock outlook is positive and we\u2019re assigning it an \u201cA\u201d grade. Let the bears, doubters and short sellers continue to lose money and opportunities if they want to. Nvidia will keep on providing value to its shareholders, even if some people stubbornly refuse to acknowledge it. On the date of publication, Louis Navellier had a long position in NVDA.
