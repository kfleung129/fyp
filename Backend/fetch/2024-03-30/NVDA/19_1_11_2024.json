    "text": "David Becker/Getty Images News One of India's largest data center operators continues to ramp up its orders for Nvidia's (NASDAQ:NVDA) artificial intelligence chips with total orders now reaching $1B. Mumbai-based Yotta Data Services is expected to order 16,000 of Nvidia's H100 and GH200 chips \u2014 worth some $500M \u2014 by March 2025, Yotta's Chief Executive Officer Sunil Gupta Reuters. This is in addition to the order for 16,000 of Nvidia's H100 chips last year, Gupta said. India's demand for AI chips is exploding as the country adopts generative AI and builds the appropriate infrastructure that puts Nvidia in the pole position as a key supplier. And with geopolitical issues curbing demand from China, India has become an important market for Nvidia's AI offerings. With the potential to become a manufacturing partner, Nvidia's Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang met with India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi in September with talks likely centered on India's potential to replace Taiwan as a manufacturing site. Other tech giants like Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOG) and Samsung (OTCPK:SSNLF) have all established manufacturing facilities in India. Nvidia shares set another all-time high on Thursday of $553.46, before turning negative during the session. "
