    "text": "NVIDIA is \"reigning\" the AI markets going into 2024, as the firm is projected to earn a \"whopping\" $46 billion from the data center segment this year, establishing new records. Team Green's performance in the AI segment does not need an introduction since the firm has made the headlines when it comes to showing a tremendous financial performance in FY23. However, it seems like the same trends will continue going into 2024, as estimates from the Wells Fargo Equity Research reveal that NVIDIA's revenue from the data center segment is on track to stay consistent, along with their market share as well. Team Green has reportedly managed to captivate most of the AI markets into its hands since the firm has acquired a market share of more than 90% globally. The company's H100 AI GPUs, along with several other offerings, have been a huge hit in the markets, and they still are the top priority for firms involved in the business, with the likes of Meta and others reportedly acquiring huge sums of GPUs. NVIDIA has managed to create an \"AI monopoly\" over the markets where the firm's products are being utilized in every mainstream data center out there, and with the next-gen shift to the firm's Hopper H200 and Blackwell B100 AI accelerators, the growth will indeed skyrocket. However, another interesting fact to note is that AMD is seemingly gaining some ground in the AI markets since it is reported that the firm could see a \"slight\" rise in market share moving into 2024. While the YoY difference is marginal, it is indeed a sign of optimism for AMD's future in the data center segment since they have sort of made a \"comeback\" recently, especially with the release of flagship AMD Instinct MI300X AI accelerators, which have caused \"headaches\" for competitors due to the attraction they have gained from potential clients. The new data shows that NVIDIA is seemingly well-prepared to disclose yet again exceptional results moving into 2024; however, Team Red could slide in and dynamically change the markets, but we have to wait and see.
