The target... Weekly 9 coming on a 2 week time span. It has been a good indicator for pullbacks / consolidation. NVDA could see some chop as it did in the last 9 or more off a pullback to the uptrend. Just something to keep in mind. After finding this channel to my liking, I also noticed that today it closed at exactly the price needed to complete a measured move. \n\nTwo range expansions will put it at $822\n\nI have no clue what it will do, just observations. I don't trade NVDA. \n\nI just know that parabolic moves are not sustainable and no matter how far it goes up in a straight line, it must... We can spot a perfect bullish impulse starting the month of October 2022.\nNVIDIA Corporation's valuation grew by an astonishing 590%.\n\nAfter the fifth wave we get a correction.\nWe have a rounded top and a very strong bearish divergence with the RSI.\n\nToday's session is full red pushing price action below EMA10.\nAs the action moves below EMA10 the bias turns from... this looks like a good technical scenario\nall indicators are good\nMarket is good\nyes let's do it \u201cAccelerated computing and generative AI have hit the tipping point.

Simple EW/Fibonacci analysis shows that a possible top for NVIDIA could be in.\nOR this could be my imagination and we go to the magic 1000 number.\n\nTrading is risky, and this is no financial advice :)\nAlso look at my other posts which delves into the general concept that the entire market has topped. The drop in Palo Alto Networks Inc (PANW) shares by 21.09% from February 20 to February 21, 2024, following the company's reduction of its annual forecast, could mark the end of the growth phase for the technology sector.\n\n\n\n NASDAQ:NVDA   NASDAQ:PANW  #NVDA #Nvidia #Stock #StockMarket #Shares\n\nBoth stocks have met all their targets and are likely to have... After a good rally the stock is looking weak on weekly timeframe \nThe key supports are mentioned in chart \nA daily candle closing below 666 would be strong confirmation for  downtrend NVDA Short (2024.02.20) Current price :  727.10\nIt shows that technical indicators are very overheated\nAlthough there has been some adjustment, it is very likely that it will go down further.\nSince there will be an earnings announcement soon, we need to be cautious of volatility and respond accordingly.

They believed it has gone overboard with its buy and decided to short against it. Some did the intrinsic value calculations and felt it is also way over valued by a double digit percentage and short it. Both groups suffered losses !\n\nDrawing a simple trend line tells you the bullish trend is still...
