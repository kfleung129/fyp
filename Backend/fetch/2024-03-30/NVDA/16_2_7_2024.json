    "text": "On Feb. 7, Nvidia and SoftBank announced the termination of Nvidia's acquisition of ARM from SoftBank due to significant regulatory hurdles. Regulators in the U.S., U.K., and E.U. have been concerned the combination would be anticompetitive. Specifically, due to the importance of ARM technology in nearly every smartphone and increasingly other compute applications, Nvidia's ownership of ARM could have led to higher prices or curbed innovation for future technologies. We suspect major ARM customers such as Qualcomm, Microsoft, Apple, and others were also opposed to the deal, as it threatened ARM's status as a relatively independent and vital cog in the broader semiconductor ecosystem. SoftBank will receive a break-up fee of $1.25 billion, and the technology conglomerate will re-IPO ARM. We are lowering our fair value estimate for wide-moat Nvidia to our standalone fair value of $187 per share (from $194 per share on a probability-adjusted basis).
