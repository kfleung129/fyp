The NASDAQ slipped more than 3% lower in the first trading week of the New Year, with many of 2023\u2019s market leaders (i.e., AI stocks) leading the way down. The Global X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence ETF (BOTZ), which tracks AI stocks, plunged more than 5% in the first trading week of 2024 but is now up slightly for the year. You can see how much the ETF swung around in the chart below\u2026  Although AI stocks are bouncing back, there is one company in particular that has really outperformed\u2026 I\u2019m talking about NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA). The reality is NVDA has rebounded with a vengeance \u2013 hitting record high after record high in the past two weeks. (This includes a new record intraday high of $595 yesterday!) Given NVDA\u2019s incredible run so far, folks have asked me if the stock is a buy, or if it\u2019s all downhill from here. So, in today\u2019s Market 360, I\u2019ll answer that question. I\u2019ll show you what my Portfolio Grader also says about the stock\u2026 as well as share where you can find the AI stocks I like right now. Let\u2019s jump right in. The simple answer: Yes! I\u2019ve said it before, and I\u2019ll say it 100 times more: NVIDIA is the best AI stock on the market right now. The reality is NVIDIA\u00a0is a major player in the computer hardware arena. It is a leading computer graphics company, making graphic processing units (GPUs) for consumers and businesses. It has over 7,000 patents relating to computer graphics, the largest portfolio of its kind. The company has been in the computer graphics business for more than two decades \u2013 it invented the GPU in 1999 \u2013 so it is a well-established player. Since 2014, the company has shifted its focus to five major markets \u2013 gaming, professional visualization, data centers, auto and artificial intelligence. NVIDIA\u00a0was hurt by the White House\u2019s stricter regulations on AI chips shipped to China, as NVIDIA is a leading supplier to the Chinese market. However, as I expected, NVIDIA recently announced that it still plans to introduce AI chips in China in the near term. The company plans to launch new AI chips that are compliant with the U.S.\u2019s new restrictions in the second quarter of 2024. NVIDIA shares rallied about 10% in response to the announcement last week. But what was more impressive to me was the analyst community\u2019s response: They revised estimates significantly higher in the past three months. For its fourth quarter in fiscal year 2024, analysts now forecast earnings to surge 367% year-over-year to $4.11 per share, compared to previous estimates of $3.70 per share three months ago. For its first quarter in fiscal year 2025, NVIDIA\u2019s earnings are also expected to soar 339.8% year-over-year to $4.31 per share. That\u2019s up from estimates for $3.89 per share three weeks ago. I should also add that full-year 2024 and 2025 earnings estimates were also revised higher. The stock continued its rally this week, surging another 8.7%. But that shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise to those who follow my Portfolio Grader. Not only does it hold an A-rating in my Portfolio Grader, but it\u2019s been rated a \u201cbuy\u201d since February of last year. Those who had bought NVIDIA when my Portfolio Grader first upgraded NVIDIA to a \u201cbuy\u201d would have doubled their money on NVIDIA during that time.  That\u2019s a great return, but it doesn\u2019t come close to the return NVIDIA holds in Growth Investor.\u00a0 It\u2019s up an incredible 1,300% since I added it to my Growth Investor Buy List in May 2019.  The bottom line: I think we\u2019ve only seen the beginning of NVIDIA has to offer. Yes, a lot of AI stocks have soared, but let\u2019s be clear\u2026 NVDA is still only trading for about 29 times earnings estimates for the next quarter. That\u2019s extremely reasonable for such a high-growth company, folks. And, as we discussed, it also boasts phenomenal fundamentals. Now, while NVIDIA is my favorite AI stock, it\u2019s not the only AI stock I like right now. There are several others \u2013 all of which I recommend in Growth Investor. Each one boasts fantastic fundamentals and is poised to act like rocket fuel for your portfolio. In fact, one of my AI stocks surged more than 30% today after upping its guidance for its second quarter in fiscal year 2024 on Monday afternoon. I recommended this stock in Growth Investor in May 2023 and it\u2019s already up 92% in eight months!
