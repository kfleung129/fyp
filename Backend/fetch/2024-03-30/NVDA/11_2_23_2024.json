    "text": "Nvidia\u2019s spectacular growth is hard to quantify sometimes. But this chart, from Sonu Varghese, global macro strategist at the Carson Group, helps put things in perspective. It\u2019s shows how Nvidia\u2019s \n        NVDA,\n        +0.12%\n       earnings \u2014 or, to be more precise, analyst expectations of its earnings in 12 months\u2019 time \u2014 have soared well beyond its stock price, leading actually to a 102-point multiple contraction over the last two-plus years. That\u2019s not to say Nvidia is necessarily cheap, Varghese said in a message on the social media service X. \u201cThere\u2019s a runway here. Of course, how long can they can keep printing profits like this \u2026 that\u2019s the question,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s operating leverage too, with profits rising while sales growing. So margins increasing.\u201d As MarketWatch\u2019s Therese Poletti points out, Nvidia\u2019s margins in the chip space are only surpassed by ARM Holdings \n        ARM,\n        -0.50%,\n       the microchip designer. Nvidia stock surged 16% to $785.38 on Thursday after the microchip maker beat revenue expectations for the fourth quarter by about $2 billion, and also projected first-quarter sales that at the midpoint are nearly $2 billion higher. Nvidia is now ahead of both Amazon.com \n        AMZN,\n        +0.31%\n       and Alphabet  \n        GOOGL,\n        +0.04%\n       by market cap. Over the last 52 weeks, Nvidia\u2019s stock has climbed \u00a0237.2%. The deal could expand Home Depot\u2019s market by $50 billion.
