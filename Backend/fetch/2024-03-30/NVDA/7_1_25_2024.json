    "text": " A rival chipmaker's optimism only adds to the bull case for NVDA stock Advertisement Source: Shutterstock Did you miss out on the magnificent rally in Nvidia\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) stock? Or maybe you\u2019re worried that a crash could be right around the corner? I understand these concerns, but I invite you to set your fears aside and consider taking at least a small share position in Nvidia. The main reason to own Nvidia stock in 2024 is to get some portfolio exposure to the market for\u00a0artificial intelligence (AI)\u00a0hardware. At this point, it\u2019s more of a necessity than a luxury. Just consider the potential rewards of investing in Nvidia, versus the opportunity costs of missing out on the next big AI-fueled rally. There are plenty of reasons for NVDA stock to move higher, but here\u2019s one you probably didn\u2019t expect. A different chipmaker, Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM), reportedly anticipates that its revenue growth will be at least 20% this year, or more precisely, in the low- to mid-20s percentage-wise. That\u2019s double the expected revenue-growth expectation of 10% for the global chip market. Why would this be bullish for Nvidia, though? First of all, if Taiwan Semiconductor anticipates robust demand for microchips in 2024, this should bode well for Nvidia. Furthermore, Taiwan Semiconductor isn\u2019t necessarily a rival to Nvidia. Remember, Taiwan Semiconductor is a third-party chip manufacturer that produces AI chips for U.S. chipmakers, including Nvidia. Hence, optimism surrounding Taiwan Semiconductor should, to a certain extent, reflect positively on Nvidia. It\u2019s yet another reason \u2014 in case you needed one \u2014 to buy Nvidia stock with confidence. As NVDA stock rallies and sends the short-sellers into hibernation, experts on Wall Street can\u2019t help but to notice Nvidia\u2019s dominance in the AI-hardware arena. For example, Barclays analysts observed, \u201cWith supply constraints, customers are often using the entire NVDA platform in order to get priority shipments of accelerators.\u201d Meanwhile, Oppenheimer analyst Rick Schafer found that Nvidia leverages a \u201cdominant hardware/software installed base.\u201d Consequently, Schafer identified NVDA stock as his \u201ctop AI play.\u201d Moreover, Nvidia has a sizable order backlog that Schafer estimates will extend for more than six months. With that in mind, Schafer reiterated his \u201coutperform\u201d rating on Nvidia stock along with a $650 price target. That\u2019s not unreasonable, considering the stock touched $570 not long ago. One catalyst to get NVDA stock to $650 will be Nvidia\u2019s B100 AI chip. Be on the lookout, as Schafer expects Nvidia to launch the B100 chip in 2024\u2019s third quarter. If you got hung up about valuations in 2023, you may have left a lot of money on the table with Nvidia stock. Are you going to make the same mistake again in 2024? The year is still young, and so is Nvidia\u2019s growth story. Like Schafer, you can make NVDA stock your top AI play. Even after last year\u2019s amazing share-price rally, it\u2019s not too get on the bus for a long, profitable ride.
