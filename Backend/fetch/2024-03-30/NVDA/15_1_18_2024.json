    "text": "Suphanat Khumsap DigitalOcean (NYSE:DOCN) announced that its Paperspace platform will now virtually have Nvidia's (NASDAQ:NVDA) H100 GPUs to give small businesses and startups the tools necessary to develop artificial intelligence applications. Customers will now be able to gain access to Nvidia's H100 GPU as individual machines or as clusters for a specific term limit or on-demand through the Paperspace cloud platform. \"While many vendors are optimizing their offerings to serve large enterprises, DigitalOcean is proud to offer [small and medium-sized businesses] and startups with reliable and flexible access to H100s,\" said DigitalOcean GM Kanishka Roychoudhury. Nvidia's H100 GPU is designed for the most demanding computing workloads such as large-scale model training and AI inference at speeds up to 30x faster than previous generations. Nvidia's H100 GPUs can reduce the training interaction periods and model inference response times. By offering this platform virtually, DigitalOcean has lowered the cost to access this state-of-the-art technology for developing, deploying, and scaling AI models. \"DigitalOcean remains committed to providing solutions that offer superior performance and keep costs in check, lowering the barriers of entry for smaller businesses looking to leverage AI to improve profitability and efficiency,\" Roychoudhury added.
