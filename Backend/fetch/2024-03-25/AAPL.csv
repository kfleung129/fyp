Small caps have had a rough run in January The Russell 2000 index is down about 5% in the month of January and is back around levels last seen before the December Federal Reserve meeting sent the markets into soft-landing euphoria But while investors have been more tepid on the interest rate sensitive sector as skepticism builds on when the first interest rate cut will come Goldman Sachs still sees 15% upside in the index over the next 12 months Goldman Sachs equity strategist Ben Snider told Yahoo Finance his team sees opportunity with the index about 20% off its 2021 highs and a trajectory for strong economic growth to power small-cap companies From a macro economic perspective generally speaking the US economy is the most important driver of equity performance broadly and especially with small-cap equity performance Snider said And while Snider believes much of the positive economic news expected could have been priced in during the November and December rally for the index the recent pullback in small caps reflects further potential upside There is substantial lingering risk premium embedded in parts of the market including small caps because investors are still unsure that were moving away from this higher-for-longer interest rate environment Snider said As the Fed begins to cut we expect that to start at the March meeting but whenever it is as the Fed begins to cut we should see that risk premium decline We should see valuations normalize to average levels if not above-average levels And that is the reason why investors should be pretty optimistic

number of industry trends as well as a glut of users who are using older iPhones and will need to upgrade to newer models in the coming years Specifically Mohan says that he expects a ‚Äústronger multi-year iPhone upgrade cycle driven by need for the latest hardware to enable Generative AI features to be introduced in 2024/2025‚Äù He also expects to see better growth in the company‚Äôs

10% after the US health insurer said an increase in older patients seeking care would hurt its fourth quarter results Plug Power (PLUG) shares tumbled about 15% on Thursday after the hydrogen fuel cell developer announced a potential $1 billion stock offering plan The vast training sets that gobble up troves of data from the open web to inspire AI models may become smaller and more curated bypassing copyright issues at the center of the legal debate over tools like ChatGPT OpenAI CEO Sam Altman says he believes future AI models will use less training data but of higher quality One thing that I expect to start changing is these models will be able to take small amounts of higher-quality data during their training process and think harder about it and learn more Altman said on a panel interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Thursday Current generative AI models rely on huge datasets to train their tools And since the data comes from the internet the material includes copyrighted works from creators who never consented for their content to be part of the training set Some major publishers have agreed to license their content to AI companies But others including the New York Times have sued AI companies for copyright infringement How courts will apply legacy copyright law to new AI technologies is perhaps the biggest challenge facing businesses like OpenAI Altman said during the interview that any one particular training source doesnt move the needle for us that much For OpenAI and others a model where publishers opt out of the training process excluding their content from the development process is one way for creators to protect themselves But Altman also envisions a new paradigm of smaller pools of data and one in which creators are compensated for helping to inspire AI tools We wont need the same massive amounts of training data he said But what we want in any case is to find new economic models that work for the whole world including content owners He added: If you teach our models if you help provide the human feedback Id love to find new models for you to get paid based off the success of that Mortgage rates recent decline continued in data released on Thursday Yahoo Finances Rebecca Chen reports: The average rate for a 30-year loan dropped to 660% from 666% a week prior according to Freddie Mac on Thursday The latest average is the

development for the housing market and in particular first-time homebuyers who are sensitive to changes in housing affordability However as purchase demand continues to thaw it will put more pressure

capital raise comes about two months after the Latham NY-based company issued a going concern notice regarding its potential inability to fund operations over the next year On Thursday Morningstar analysts noted This hints that the company may be experiencing difficulty in arranging other financing solutions at reasonable terms During the companys third quarter earnings call last November Plug Power CEO Andy Marsh said This was a difficult quarter He added Over the past several months there have been enormous challenges associated with the availability of hydrogen primarily due to downed

housing market New residential construction including single family and multifamily homes fell 43% in December from the month prior to an annualized rate of 1460 million units according to data from

activity ‚Äî rose 19% to a rate of 1495 million units in December up from Novembers revised rate of 1467 million units This beat forecasts for a rate of 1477 million units according to data from Bloomberg Most of the drop in housing starts reflects the partial reversal of the spike in November single-family starts but the less-volatile permits numbers suggest that the steady uptrend in single-family construction will continue Kieran Clancy senior US economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics wrote following the release Starts on multifamily structures with five or more units landed at 417000 for December slightly higher than the previous months 404000 units Permits to start construction on multiple properties with five or more units reached 449000 units in December a 32% increase from the previous month The fall on the month [for housing starts] was something of a surprise to us given that November‚Äôs strength was caused by it being an unseasonably warm and dry month and last month was the warmest December on record wrote Thomas Ryan property economist at Capital Economics Looking ahead to this year we don‚Äôt think mortgage rates will fall enough to unwind mortgage rate

lead role on Thursday as the chipmaker which supplies to the likes of Apple (APPL) and Nvidia (NVDA) reported quarterly results before the opening bell that beat estimates The companys adjusted earnings per share of $148 came in higher than Wall Streets expectations for $138 And perhaps more importantly the chipmaker said artificial intelligence is fueling its success Taiwan Semiconductor said it expects revenue to grow 20% in 2024 due in part to AI demand The news sent the semiconductor index (^SOX) nearly 3% higher while market bellwether Nvidia shot up over 2% This came as an upgrade on Apple (AAPL) stock from Bank of America sent shares of the iPhone maker nearly 3% higher To Keith Lerner the co-chief investment officer at Truist news like Thursdays is still key to driving the market higher given techs outsized weight in the major averages With the concentration that you still have I think tech showing the earnings and the ability to grow earnings at a good pace

10,"Apple: Accept The Gift Move On (NASDAQ:AAPL)","1/1/2024","https://seekingalpha.com/article/4660598-apple-accept-the-gift-move-on","Petra Sch√ºller/iStock via Getty Images Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) investors dont appear to fully understand how the stock had a remarkable year disconnected from how bad the business actually performed during 2023 The tech giant went all year without growing yet the stock ended the year trading right off all-time highs My investment thesis remains ultra Bearish on Apple with the hope current shareholders use this gift to unload shares at a premium valuation Source: Finviz Apple shares were up nearly 50% for the year starting 2023 just below $130 The company failed to report a single quarter of growth during the year and the tech giant has limited prospects for excessive growth in 2024 due to missing out on the generative AI demand surge Source: Seeking Alpha The problem is that most investors think Apple rallied due to the successful ability of the tech giant to generate growing profits Too many investors just judge the company based on the performance of the stock and appear to have completely missed the lessons from the 2000 Internet bubble and the 2021 Covid bubble Stocks become detached from logical valuations all the time and alert investors to take advantage of these dislocations by selling the stock otherwise the gifts are given back Everyone should be well aware of how Zoom (ZM) surged to over $500 on Covid demand and now trades for only $72 The market convinced a lot of people Zoom was worth over $120 billion yet the 100%+ growth rates were clearly not sustainable and the company was hardly generating $4 billion in annual revenues In a similar manner Apple has seen the stock rally due to Magnificent 7 hype The big tech stocks surged during 2023 due to AI hype for NVIDIA (NVDA) and Microsoft (MSFT) and to a lesser extent Google (GOOG) At the same time Meta Platforms (META) completed a year of efficiency but investors need to step back and ask what has Apple delivered to warrant a massive rally in the stock The company has now reported 4 consecutive quarters of declining sales The forecast is for Apple to squeak out less than 1% growth in the important holiday quarter just ended followed by barely 2% sales growth in the March quarter Apple has the promising Vision Pro headset launching possibly in February soon but the company is nowhere to be found in generative AI technology The latest estimate has Apple delivering only 500000 mixed-reality units for 2024 with sales in the $175 billion range based on a $3500 cost Source: Ming-Chi Kuo medium All while Apple is running into patent issues with the Apple Watch The International Trade Commission has banned sales of the Watch due to a patent from Masimo (MASI) but the Federal Circuit court has paused the ban for now At best Apple appears set for a long-term software fix to avoid the dispute on most Watch models Apple enters 2024 trading at nearly 30x FY24 EPS targets Yet the base case is for the tech giant to grow EPS in the 7% to 8% range in the next couple of fiscal years Even under the best scenario the stock should trade at ~15x forward EPS targets or ~$99 in order for investors to generate solid total returns The odd part of this scenario is investors have other examples when investor brand loyalty trips up investing decisions Coca-Cola (KO) has been one of the most popular stocks to own in the last 50 years yet the stock massively underperformed the market in the last decade per the below chart Source: Seeking Alpha A similar theme with Apple is a stock still trading at an excessive forward PE multiple compared to the growth The market usually isnt willing to pay more than 2x the growth rate yet Coca-Cola currently trades at 21x 2024 EPS targets with a forecast for minimal 4% growth An investor can probably stretch a long-term growth target in the 6% to 7% range with 2024 subdued due to potentially deflationary pressure in the sector The key here is Coca-Cola still trading at 3x the normalized EPS growth rate and Apple falls right into that same category Investors need to realize the growth story for Apple is now all centered on Services which is constantly under pressure from regulators now The tech giant doesnt have a software solution to where enterprise customers will potentially pay double the price for new AI technology like Microsoft with CoPilot Apple Services grew 9% in FY23 to reach $85 billion and analysts are generally forecasting a rebound towards growth in the 15% range Services are still only ~22% of the business limiting the impact on overall growth Source: Six Colors After a period of weak growth for Services due to Covid pull forwards with people locked at home Apple has forecasted maintaining double-digit growth The Services sector would provide about $12 billion in additional revenues this year to reach the 15% growth rate Apple reported $383 billion in FY23 revenues so Services would contribute only 3% to total growth in FY24 despite the solid 15% growth rate Investors have long not seemed to understand that Services growth is impressive but the amount is hardly material to the overall business due to the massive $300+ billion annual revenues from the products division led by the iPhone In essence Apple has to produce revenue growth from other categories in order to really move the needle to warrant the current stock valuation The company forecasts iPhone growth in the December quarter but the Apple Watch patent issues and tough comps in iPad and Wearables including the Watch will lead to revenue challenges in these categories Our dead money research going on 2 years now correctly forecasts how Apple would run into problems growing due to issues with new product development Neither the Apple Car nor the AR/VR device has reached the market yet and the company just reported an FY with sales declining 3% Investors were also informed the stock could make an irrational run to $200 or more One cant always predict how influential analysts and other external factors will impact a stock Source: Seeking Alpha/SFC With Dan Ives from Wedbush Securities gaining in popularity and pushing $250 price target on the stock despite Apple literally reporting horrible quarterly results the stock has flown to $200 to end 2023 The stock would reach an incredible market cap of $4 trillion and the stock would trade at 35x FY25 EPS targets due to a rally based purely on multiple expansion What ultimately matters is that Apple is only forecast to earn $656 per share in FY23 and a 15x P/E multiple just gets the stock to $100 Even if one goes out to the $712 EPS targets for FY25 and applies a 20x P/E multiple Apple would only be worth $142 or ~$24 below where we predicted the stock would be dead money for 4 years The key investor takeaway is that investors need to understand the gift from the stock rally in 2023 Apple could definitely rally more in 2024 but investors need to understand the current disconnect between the stock here and the results being reported by the company At some point in the next couple of years investors are likely to face a scenario where Apple trades below $150 and the fear is the stock falling even further One of the worst scenarios in investing is giving up gains due to being greedy and

No Apple says because this is not the safest system for our users Translation: If you want us to do this anywhere else youll need a new law That could come in the future In the meantime Thursdays news is a milestone for Apple and regulators: Proof that if pushed hard enough one of the worlds most powerful companies can change things it said it never wanted to change Read next Jump to"

16,"Just How Safe Is Apple Stocks Dividend?","1/27/2024","https://247wallst.com/investing/2024/01/27/just-how-safe-is-apple-stocks-dividend/","A key component of income investing is a portfolio that includes safe dividends those that are unlikely to shrink or disappear Recognizing when a dividend is stable and safe can be a challenge Yet certain metrics can offer clear signs for the investor looking to establish or shore up such a portfolio What do these metrics tell us about the quarterly dividend at Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL)? The most recent payout from Apple was $024 a share and the yield is now about 05% The next ex-dividend date is expected in early February The current yield is less than that of such competitors as Dell Technologies Inc (NYSE: DELL) HP Inc (NYSE: HPQ) International Business Machines Corp (NYSE: IBM) and Samsung Electronics It is also lower than the tech sector average of about 16% One clear sign of whether a dividend is stable and safe is if the company is a Dividend Aristocrat Those are companies in the S&P 500 that have not only paid a dividend consistently for 25 years but have increased their payouts every year as well Apple is not among the aristocrats as its payout has varied over the past decade from about $020 to $305 a share The company has increased the dividend by a penny per share for the past couple of years but it has a long way to go to become a Dividend Aristocrat (See the seven highest-yielding 2024 Dividend Kings to buy and hold forever) While being a Dividend Aristocrat would have been a good sign other financial metrics provide additional insight as well The dividend payout ratio indicates how much of a company‚Äôs earnings it pays out as a dividend It is a sign of how safe a company‚Äôs dividend is and how much room it has for future growth The higher the ratio the greater the risk Income investors often look for a dividend payout ratio of less than 60% Apple‚Äôs current dividend payout ratio is just 15% That is well below the industry average and the company‚Äôs mean dividend payout ratio was 24% over the past decade A look at free cash flow reveals whether the company has the funds required for its payout as well as for share repurchases or even paying down debt or making acquisitions Income investors prefer growing free cash flows In 2010 Apple had free cash flow of nearly $166 billion The figure should come in well above $100 billion for 2023 In between the figure has declined in some years but the overall trend is upward Return on invested capital is a measure of how well a company allocates its capital to profitable projects or investments Again the thing to look for is stability specifically a double-digit ROIC over many years At Apple the current ROIC is around 33% which is well above those of tech giants Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Amazoncom Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) Apple‚Äôs ROIC has been in the double digits for at least a decade Operating margin is a measure of the percentage of revenue a company keeps as operating profit Here too the preference is for a stable double-digit percentage increase The current figure is about 30% The margin has mostly been above 25% since 2010 Note that the current operating margin at Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: MSFT) is higher than Apple‚Äôs A look at sales growth offers a clue to the volatility or cyclical nature of the business Steady moderate growth say 3% to 7% is often considered ideal Revenue at Apple was about $652 billion in 2010 growing to $3832 billion last year Sales increased in most quarters in that interval The growth has not been as steady smartphone rival Samsung nor at Dell HP or IBM A company‚Äôs net debt-to-capital ratio also can signal whether a dividend may be at risk Because too much debt can put dividends at risk in hard times a lower ratio is considered better A debt-to-capital ratio above 06 usually means that a business has significantly more debt than equity The ratio at Apple has been less than that for most of the past few years Probably the most popular valuation metric is the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio This indicates whether a stock is expensive or cheap at its current market price compared to the broader market or to competitors Apple has a trailing PE ratio of nearly 32 which is above the industry average of 225 Note that the forward PE is less than 30 That also compares with a broad historical benchmark of 15 as well as the broader market‚Äôs current 24 or so Note that among the rest of the so-called Magnificent Seven tech stocks only Alphabet has a PE ratio lower than Apple (See which five blue chip dividend stocks make up 75% of Warren Buffett‚Äôs portfolio) And finally the number of shares outstanding is worth a look When companies buy back their shares that number shrinks But secondary offerings of stock and stock compensation increase that total Investors tend to prefer a declining total as that increases their stake over time At Apple the number of shares was 262 billion in 2012 and has declined every year to 158 billion last year The company bought back $776 billion worth of stock last year though that was down from $894 billion the year before Given these metrics it seems clear that Apple‚Äôs dividend is safe for now if not generous While the PE ratio is not a match for the broad benchmarks it is not out of line for a Magnificent Seven stock Some income investors no doubt wish for Apple‚Äôs dividend to be more generous which the tech giant clearly could afford At least Apple has a pattern of annually increasing the payout going back to before its stock split in 2020 The company could be a Dividend Aristocrat in time Sponsored: Want to Retire Early?

17,"This Is How Much Apples Top Executives Were Paid in 2023","1/28/2024","https://247wallst.com/jobs/2024/01/28/this-is-how-much-apples-top-executives-were-paid-in-2023/","Apple is one of the most successful powerful and wealthy companies in the history of the world It‚Äôs hard to fully grasp just how much money flows through Apple and how much control they have over the computer and smartphone industry Just a fraction of that money is spent on top executives but even that amount is still incredibly large compared to the regular earnings of the average American But how much are they paid and how does it compare? This is how much Apple‚Äôs top executives were paid in 2023 For this list we use the data filed by Apple in their annual proxy statement to the SEC We will include basic facts about their compensation and background on the executives Apple is the largest company in the world by market capitalization the largest by revenue (totaling $3943 billion in 2022 alone) the fourth-largest personal computer seller the largest manufacturing company and the second-biggest phone manufacturer Despite criticism of Apple‚Äôs poor labor practices environmental damage business ethics anti-competitive business decisions and unethical mining people continue to flock to Apple‚Äôs products proving the power that cool flashy branding has over the moral fabric of our society Apple‚Äôs CEO pay ratio is 1177:1 which means that Tim Cook earns over a thousand times more per hour than Apple‚Äôs median worker wage The median worker wage at Apple is $84493 most of whom live in California so their wage might not last as long as a similar wage in other states The lowest-paid employees are paid much less than that Of course this doesn‚Äôt include those people in other countries who are working in mines factories and manufacturing sites as contractors for Apple who are paid less than a few Dollars a day The median pay for CEOs in America is around $145 million while the average annual salary is $59428 and the average hourly rate is around $2834 As with most high-level executives at large companies much of the compensation paid comes in the form of equity instead of a normal paycheck If the company does well the value of this equity can increase rapidly above its value when it is given These executives don‚Äôt need regular paychecks to buy groceries or save up to buy their kids something special; they already have enough to cover all their needs and more so equity payments are a perfect way to gain an asset that increases in value and motivate the executives to run the company in a profitable way Just a couple of decades ago the gap between executive pay and the lowest earner was still ridiculous but much smaller at just a few hundred times more than the median At more than a thousand times the median the pay gap has expanded beyond greed to actual human rights abuse and corruption Advocates of addressing the growing wage gap face a significant uphill battle with much opposition coming from those who misunderstand the issue The issue with a massive wage gap isn‚Äôt that those on the bottom are jealous of the rich it‚Äôs that it creates financial obstacles for those who are already struggling As corporate profits increase the rich take a larger percentage of those profits If those at the bottom of the corporate ladder go just one year without a raise or increase in compensation they will be earning less money than before due to price increases and inflation The view of those who support reducing the wage gap through legislation is that if someone creates a product they should be compensated a fair portion of the value that product generates If they work a full day contributing to society then they should be able to afford to live in and enjoy that society instead of starving and living in dangerous homes Tim Cook was Apple‚Äôs COO under Steve Jobs and assumed the position of CEO after the resignation and passing of Jobs in 2011 He joined Apple in 1998 after Jobs asked him personally to join his company Under Cook‚Äôs leadership Apple‚Äôs revenue and profit have more than doubled and the value of the company has increased from $348 billion to over $3 trillion becoming the first trillion-dollar company in history in 2018 Tim Cook is Apple‚Äôs highest-paid CEO and the fourth-highest-paid CEO in the United States Cook is an extremely active and public executive He is open about his political and charitable donations (which have increased under his leadership) and is vocal about his support or opposition to social problems and political issues He regularly begins his workday around 4:30 every morning In 2015 Cook pledged to donate his fortune to charity Yet as the CEO of one of the most powerful companies in the world all the work done by Apple ultimately is his responsibility to justify This includes censoring online content in China removing apps that protestors in Hong Kong used to organize exploiting poor workers in third-world countries and more Cook was the first CEO of a Fortune 500 company to come out as gay Luca Maestri is an Italian businessman with experience as an executive at General Motors (NYSE:GM) Nokia Networks and Xerox Maestri was appointed as CFO in 2014 Like the other executives on this list Maestri‚Äôs actual salary is much lower than his final compensation All high-level executives are eligible for Apple‚Äôs performance-based cash bonus program and receive significant stock and equity as compensation Jeff Williams joined Apple in 1998 the same year as Tim Cook and became the vice president of operations in 2004 He became the COO of Apple in 2015 following the shakeup of the executive team by Cook In 2019 leadership changes in Apple meant that Williams now leads the Industrial Design and Human Interface Design departments Williams played a significant part in the launch of the iPhone and has led global iPod and iPhone operations ever since Kate Adams is an experienced attorney with experience at Sidley Austin LLP in New York general counsel at Honeywell a trial attorney for the United States Department of Justice a law clerk for Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O‚ÄôConnor and much more For whatever reason Adams is the only Apple executive who receives media scrutiny for her compensation Dozens of articles reacting to her high pay were published in January of 2024 alone while other members of the team have no articles about their compensation Deirdre O‚ÄôBrien oversees everything having to do with Apple‚Äôs employees from recruiting and employee development to partnerships benefits and diversity along with her retail responsibilities She is the longest-serving employee of Apple joining the company in 1988 straight out of college She was appointed to her current position in 2019 She has helped Apple grow during her thirty years with the company and grew along with it She‚Äôs worked with five Apple CEOs and has been integral in many of the changes the company has made along the way Tim Cook calls O‚ÄôBrien the ‚ÄúVeep of People‚Äù since she runs the HR division She was one of the first people to join Cook‚Äôs operations team when he

In todays Market Clubhouse Morning Memo we will discuss SPY QQQ AAPL MSFT NVDA GOOGL META and TSLA Our proprietary formula exclusive to Market Clubhouse dictates these price levels This dynamic equation takes into account price volume and options flow These levels are updated every day and shared with all Clubhouse Members prior to the opening of the market We recommend closely monitoring these stocks and be prepared to leverage potential breakouts or reversals As always stay alert and ready to adjust your tactics based on the markets pulse to optimize your trading gains Now lets dive into the stock analysis: The SPY SPY is currently trading around our reference point of 50017 For those looking at bullish scenarios the initial target is a rise to 50091 Maintaining strength above 49693 is crucial as it sets the stage for an upward move towards our support level at 50174 Should this level prove resilient during the trading day an upward trajectory towards 50285 is anticipated The ultimate bullish goal for SPY today is reaching 50395 Conversely should the SPY fail to sustain above 50017 the bearish outlook becomes more probable The first test for bears would be at 49893 assessing the markets willingness to sell A further decline to 49817 would confirm the bearish momentum A significant breach below this point could lead to our next substantial support at 49755 In the event of a pronounced sell-off the bearish target for the day is set at 49693 The QQQ ETF QQQ is navigating around the pivotal level of 43476 Optimistic investors are eyeing stability above this mark with an aim to establish 43588 as a solid foothold Sustained buying interest could elevate the ETF to 43658 setting the stage for a potential ascent to 43747 The highest bullish expectation for today is a surge to 43889 Should the ETF struggle to maintain its ground above 43476 the bears may gain the upper hand driving the price down to 43364 A display of weakness at this juncture could see a further descent to 43284 Persistent selling pressure might challenge the support at 43182 with a breach potentially leading to the days bearish extreme of 43118 Apples AAPL stock is hovering around the 18227 mark Bullish investors are keen on defending this level aiming for a rally towards 18338 With continued positive momentum the next targets are 18409 and ultimately 18496 which represents the highest bullish aspiration for today On the flip side if Apple fails to sustain above 18227 a downward adjustment to 18125 may ensue Escalating selling activity could push the stock further down to 18060 and then to 18010 Should the bears overpower the lowest expected level for the day is 17936 Microsoft MSFT is presently trading near 41064 Bulls are hopeful for the stock to remain robust above this level with aspirations to climb to 41314 and secure it as a support A successful hold could lead to a rally towards 41456 with the zenith for todays bullish scenario at 41725 If Microsoft cannot maintain support at 41064 a bearish perspective takes shape with the first target at 40969 A breach here could lead to further exploration of lower levels at 40711 and 40601 culminating in a bearish endpoint for the day at 40492 NVIDIA NVDA is making moves around the critical level of 73783 Bulls are aiming to propel the stock towards 74285 and establish it as a strong support An upward momentum could further push the price to 74979 with the days bullish pinnacle at 75232 Conversely if NVIDIA cannot uphold the support at 73783 a bearish trajectory might be initiated towards 73472 A continuation of selling pressure could lead to a test of 73221 and potentially 72972 The bearish target for the day is set at 72635 Alphabet GOOGL is trading around 14377 The bullish perspective entails maintaining this as a support base with an aim to ascend to 14472 A sustained bullish trend could push the stock towards the days high target of 14594 Should Alphabet fail to hold 14377 a downward movement to 14317 is anticipated Further bearish pressure could lead to tests at 14253 and in a significant sell-off reach the bearish extreme for the day at 14171 Meta Platforms META is positioned around 47393 Bulls are looking to keep the stock above this level with sights set on advancing to 47750 A strong buying presence could elevate the stock to 48096 with the days bullish climax at 48311 If Meta cannot secure support at 47393 a bearish outlook suggests a move to 47219 Continuous selling could lower the stock to 47028 and if the downtrend persists to the days bearish low of 46838 Teslas TSLA stock is centered around 19152 Bulls are pushing for an uptick to 19381 with further gains potentially leading to 19591 A robust bullish market today could extend the rally to 20043 with the ultimate bull target at 20433 If Tesla fails to maintain 19152 as support a bearish scenario unfolds towards 18922 Increased selling could drag the stock down to 18610 and in a pronounced downturn to the bearish floor for the day at 18253 Final Word: Todays trading session is poised for action with traders keeping a watchful eye on the premarket employment data set for

The answer resides in the ‚Äúsubsidized economy of mobile carriers‚Äù Before Steve Jobs with the iPhone changed the rules of the game the mobile phone industry represented a multi-billion dollar industry where the mobile carriers saw the handsets business as a commodity they could use While that strategy had paid back in the past to bring in new subscribers the whole industry needed a shake And Apple was ready to give that One of the first players that understood that the iPhone could be a potential hit ‚Äì or at least could revitalize their brand was Cingular (later AT&T) In an attempt to be branded as an ‚Äúinnovative company‚Äù and steal subscribers from ita rivals the time seemed right for Apple‚Äòs deal Before we get to that point there is another step of the story to understand here As the story goes Steve Jobs had understood he had to bet on the mobile market by producing its handset which would be something in the middle between a phone and an iPod That phone was Rokr and it was in partnership with Motorola When the Rokr came out ‚Äì noted cultofmac ‚Äì ‚ÄúIn the end the Rokr E1 proved disastrous With its cheap plastic design poor camera and a 100-song limit it fell far short of the iPod‚Äôs promise of 1000 songs in your pocket Designed to make listening to your music easy and pitched as the ‚ÄúiTunes phone‚Äù it also failed on that front The Rokr E1 required that users buy songs via iTunes then transfer them to the device using a cable‚Äú The demo of Steve Jobs on the ‚ÄúiTunes phone‚Äù might well be considered the least successful one Yet those mistakes would set the stage for the iPhone Steve Jobs didn‚Äôt wait too long before losing all his enthusiasm for the Motorola-Apple partnership That‚Äôs why in September 2006 Apple discontinued support for the Rokr Time to change strategy and this time with a bold move The Cingular team was the first to understand a change in the carriers‚Äô business model Where before handsets providers were a mere commodity used to lock as many new subscribers with cheap phones There was a chance now to be perceived as an innovator in the space And what partner would best fit this role than the company that had first disrupted the computer industry and then moved to the music industry? Steve Jobs made a deal with AT&T as reported by Wired ‚Äúin return for five years of exclusivity roughly 10 percent of iPhone sales in AT&T stores and a thin slice of Apple‚Äôs iTunes revenue AT&T had granted Jobs unprecedented power‚Äú However Apple in return got a revenue-share model where it received $10 for every iPhone customer subscribing to an AT&T plan plus total control over the design manufacturing and marketing of the iPhone That was an unprecedented deal! That was the beginning of the end for the mobile carrier‚Äôs dominance over the smartphone companies ‚Äì or at least Apple As of December 31 2009 AT&T served 851 million wireless customers compared to 770 million at December 31 2008 Part of this staggering growth was also due to iPhone success A companion read with this article ‚ÄúThe Untold Story: How the iPhone Blew Up the Wireless Industry ‚Äì from Wired‚Äù Who Owns Apple Apple Business Model Apple Business Growth Apple Distribution Apple Value Proposition How Much Is Apple Worth?

This system does it facilitate the ability to dynamically adapt to what the market throws at you? Will it provide context in the near term and even tell you where you likely find yourself in the big picture? That‚Äôs what we‚Äôre going to discuss using Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) as our study subject The answer for AAPL is that we are able to see a short-term setup for a long trade To do this we don‚Äôt even need the Apple Vision Pro As a quick aside yes this new tech is interesting to be sure Some say that it‚Äôs the best-looking scuba mask ever - obviously in jest Others are put off by the fact that the picture on the Apple website does not demonstrate the true color of the glass in front of the user Well we‚Äôre not here to pick apart the tech So let‚Äôs discuss the trade setup for the AAPL chart instead ‚ÄúApple looks rather neutral from a fundamental perspective Its not appealing in my view from a risk/reward perspective but its certainly a tradeable stock based on technicals The stock is quite expensively-priced relative to its current and expected earnings growth which makes it rather unattractive from both a value investor and growth investor standpoint Lyn Alden - FAST Graphs But the stock continues to have a lot of good quality metrics apart from valuation and theres no clear catalyst for further declines so Im not necessarily viewing it as a short opportunity either‚Äù - Lyn Alden Latin provides several words to the English language From the original Contextus we get a joining together or to weave together‚Äù For us today colloquially speaking context suggests the entire picture It would be similar to being able to see the entire woven garment and not just a pocket or the seam Why is this so paramount for the investor? You may be an enthusiastic user of all products Apple As well perhaps you think that the stock is a long-term buy for your portfolio and you have a 5 10 or even 20-year time frame for the hold How can the context help you? If anything it will help provide the setting for proper expectations Look at this long-term AAPL chart from Zac Mannes: Chart by Zac Mannes - Elliott Wave Trader - StockWaves Chart by Zac Mannes - Elliott Wave Trader - StockWaves To be sure a continual uptrend But there are also some significant moments where the stock has taken a breather From all that we can surmise the next rest is nearly upon us Likely not tomorrow or next week but soon This tells us to be cautious and on alert for a prolonged corrective period More on this in just a bit Let‚Äôs take a look at Zac‚Äôs more near-term view here: Chart by Zac Mannes - Elliott Wave Trader - StockWaves Chart by Zac Mannes - Elliott Wave Trader - StockWaves You can see by zooming in that there are still higher targets yet likely in this current rally structure The Red [III] is there as a potential warning that a major top could have already been struck if support levels below us begin to give way before those higher targets are met However that is an alternative path So for as long as above support we will look higher in the near term Here‚Äôs the more detailed view from Zac: Chart by Zac Mannes - Elliott Wave Trader - StockWaves Chart by Zac Mannes - Elliott Wave Trader - StockWaves The major topping zone overhead is in the $216 - $236 region From current levels we see a plausible +15% or more This near-term setup would use the recent low at $179 as our tolerance for risk in the trade Looking at the entire garment woven by the AAPL chart we can see that the Cycle [III] target looms large just overhead relatively speaking The resulting corrective move likely will give the stock a decent haircut to its valuation Just as a ballpark projection at this time should the stock find a major high at the $225 level then a pullback to the January 2023 lows would be well within the standards we have observed in similar structures For the long-term investor conceivably this is a much better entry point Others will employ a dollar cost average method and buy on the way down And yet others can hedge their forever-hold ideology There are a myriad of manners to use the information provided on the charts Each individual will decide which best fits their own unique situation Avi Gilburt recently wrote a series of articles entitled ‚ÄúSentiment Speaks: How To Know If We Are Heading For A Depression‚Äù The link is to Part 1 of the 3-part series Here is a brief quote from that article: ‚ÄúEven if you have thought me to be eccentric or a complete crackpot (which I my 8000 subscribers and almost 1000 money manager clients can assure you I am not) please consider the items I am discussing in these missives with an open mind Those that have done so have seen their ability to navigate our financial markets much improve But you must keep an open mind to consider these matters seriously Ultimately my goal is to help those willing to open their minds protect themselves from what I believe can be a very difficult financial environment over the coming decade or two‚Äù - Avi Gilburt Suppose we are indeed close to the cusp of a major top in the overall markets In all likelihood AAPL would face stiff headwinds in such a scenario This jives with what we are seeing on the long-term AAPL chart as well Our methodology is pointing to a high-probability buy setup for AAPL in the near term We are certainly wary of the longer-term top likely looming though Not all paths will play out as illustrated We view the markets from a probabilistic standpoint But at the same time we have specific levels to indicate when its time to step aside or even change our stance and shift our weight There are many ways to analyze and track stocks and the market they form Some are more consistent than others For us this method has proved the most reliable and keeps us on the right side of the trade much more often than not Nothing is perfect in this world but for those looking to open their eyes to a new universe of trading and investing why not consider studying this further?

so much so that it‚Äôs ushered in the colloquial term of ‚ÄúCrackgate‚Äù It‚Äôs disappointing to see a $3500 headset experiencing such issues so soon after its US-only launch window especially for early adopters who bought the Apple Vision Pro; it‚Äôs looking like a far more widespread issue than originally theorized Momentum behind Crackgate started to build just three days after the Apple Vision Pro‚Äôs release date with one Reddit post stating ‚Äúwe have a crack on the outer glass already‚Äù The photo shows a small vertical line directly on the bottom middle of the headset The user writes: ‚ÄúI have never used my Vision Pro outside of my bed and whenever I am not using it I always have the soft outer cover on‚Äù continuing with: ‚ÄúI wonder what caused the crack and whether it‚Äôs a manufacturing defect or not‚Äù Soon after this post went live on on the subreddit which now boasts over 60000 users more stories of the same vertical crack on the outer glass began appearing with the severity appearing to get worse One user posted about a ‚Äúrandom crack in the front glass‚Äù with the line considerably thicker and longer than the original sighting They explain: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been sitting neatly in the Apple travel-case and it‚Äôs been subject to very light use of a couple of hours a day‚Äù Ending with: ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt dropped it or similar‚Äù The shocking state of the photo was enough to ignite heavy discussion in the comments The top-rated response asked if the battery was connected to the unit and charging on the wall outlet while inside of the protective cover with some users explaining that the Apple Vision Pro cracks could be appearing due to a ‚Äúheat expansion problem cracking the glass‚Äù The Apple Vision Pro cracks appear to be getting some level of recognition from Apple itself according to threads on more posts where the headset has this issue A user posted about another cracked front glass but followed up with Apple support They shared their iPhone screen and ‚Äúother posts on this sub of people with the same issue‚Äù to where the representative ‚Äúdocumented everything‚Äù and set up a repair process It‚Äôs not just users on Reddit documenting issues either That‚Äôs because people are also posting on Apple‚Äôs community forums as well A user writes about the Apple Vision Pro crack: ‚ÄúI noticed a very small indent on the bridge of the nose of Vision Pro when I first got it‚Äù they explain ‚Äúit is very tiny something like a fingernail size I was concerned but assumed it just a production technique‚Äù and that ‚Äúit is in line with the photos I have seen online‚Äù The top response tells the user to bring it into Apple so that it can inspect the headset to see whether it‚Äôs a manufacturing defect Interestingly they raise the idea of Apple charging a significant sum to repair the item: ‚ÄúIf they think you damaged it without Apple Care it‚Äôs about $800 to repair it‚Äù but with Apple Care it‚Äôs ‚Äústill a few hundred to repair‚Äù This appears to line up with estimates from Apple Support which now includes a service of ‚ÄúCracked cover glass‚Äù which is $799 without or $299 with an AppleCare+ plan It appears as though leaving the Apple Vision Pro in direct sunlight for hours on end could be a factor in why the headsets are cracking at an alarming rate One user writes: ‚ÄúPSA: never set your Vision Pro down in a way that lets sunlight into the lenses‚Äù because ‚Äúit will burn the screen and require an expensive repair‚Äù According to the comments there‚Äôs no warning in the box about using the headset in direct sunlight Something to be aware of if you‚Äôre considering buying Apple Vision Pro It doesn‚Äôt look as though the cracked Apple Vision Pro headset photos are slowing down any time soon Earlier this week one user posted ‚Äúcrack is wack!‚Äù stating that: ‚Äúso apparently the cracking is real In its case (Apple‚Äôs official case) not charging cover on the front [The] crack wasn‚Äôt there last time I opened it a couple of days ago Unbelievable‚Äù The top rated comment explains: ‚ÄúCrackgate has caused me to perform a new ritual of closely inspecting my device for cracks every time I take it out or put it away‚Äù and that this eventuality isn‚Äôt ‚Äúwhat Apple was hoping would be in the forefront of users‚Äô minds‚Äù The original poster responded: ‚ÄúLast time I took it out was after seeing the posts about cracks and checking for one‚Äù They explain: ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt expect it to actually happen to me‚Äù and how they‚Äôre ‚Äúworried it may happen to a lot of them‚Äù Another thread response writes: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs definitely a more widespread issue than what what we see here‚Äù and that they been ‚Äúdisconnecting the battery after each use and also when charging the battery‚Äù Crackgate looks to have inspired justified paranoia in the early adopters which isn‚Äôt a good sign given its exorbitant pricing and current limited availability ‚ÄúI also started waiting for the device to warm up to room temp before using it now‚Äù and ‚Äú[it] really sucks this is happening and that we have to baby this thing‚Äù Apple has yet to officially comment on this situation We‚Äôll be updating you with the latest news and comment as more information becomes available The best advice we can offer is to follow the directives of users in terms of care for the headset; keep it unplugged when not in use away from the sun or any kind of heat and be incredibly gentle Hopefully this is just the result of an early adopters‚Äô first batch and something that could be amended in due time We‚Äôll keep you posted Aleksha McLoughlin is Hardware and News Editor for PC Guide and she oversees buying guides reviews news and features on site She was previously Hardware and Affiliates

offices in over 20 countries offering services on all continents Every year Brand Finance conducts more than 5000 brand valuations supported by original market research and publishes over 100 reports which rank brands across all sectors and countries Brand Finance also operates the Global Brand Equity Monitor conducting original market research annually on over 5000 brands surveying more than 150000 respondents across 38 countries and 31 industry sectors Combining perceptual data from the Global Brand Equity Monitor with data from its valuation database enables Brand Finance to arm brand leaders with the data and analytics they need to enhance brand and business value Brand Finance is a regulated accountancy firm leading the standardization of the brand valuation industry Brand Finance was the first to be certified by independent auditors as compliant with both ISO 10668 and ISO 20671 and has received the official endorsement of the Marketing Accountability Standards Board (MASB) in the United States Brand is defined as a marketing-related intangible asset including but not limited to names terms signs symbols logos and designs intended to identify goods services or entities creating distinctive images and associations in the minds of stakeholders thereby generating economic benefits Brand strength is the efficacy of a brand‚Äôs performance on intangible measures relative to its competitors Brand Finance evaluates brand strength in a process compliant with ISO 20671 looking at Marketing Investment Stakeholder Equity and the impact of those on Business Performance The data used is derived from Brand Finance‚Äôs proprietary market research programme and from publicly available sources Each brand is assigned a Brand Strength Index (BSI) score out of 100 which feeds into the brand value calculation Based on the score each brand is assigned a corresponding Brand Rating up to AAA+ in a format similar to a credit rating Brand Finance calculates the values of brands in its rankings using the Royalty Relief approach ‚Äì a brand valuation method compliant with the industry standards set in ISO 10668 It involves estimating the likely future revenues that are attributable to a brand by calculating a royalty rate that would be charged for its use to arrive at a ‚Äòbrand value‚Äô understood as a net economic benefit that a brand owner would achieve by licensing the brand in the open market The steps in this process are as follows: 1 Calculate brand strength using a balanced scorecard of metrics assessing Marketing Investment Stakeholder Equity and Business Performance Brand strength is expressed as a Brand Strength Index (BSI) score on a scale of 0 to 100 2 Determine royalty range for each industry reflecting the importance of brand to purchasing decisions In luxury the maximum percentage is high while in extractive industry where goods are often commoditised it is lower This is done by reviewing comparable licensing agreements sourced from Brand Finance‚Äôs extensive database 3 Calculate royalty rate The BSI score is applied to the royalty range to arrive at a royalty rate For example if the royalty range in a sector is 0-5% and a brand has a BSI score of 80 out of 100 then an appropriate royalty rate for the use of this brand in the given sector will be 4% 4 Determine brand-specific revenues by estimating a proportion of parent company revenues attributable to a brand 5 Determine forecast revenues using a function of historic revenues equity analyst forecasts and economic growth rates 6 Apply the royalty rate to the forecast revenues to derive brand revenues 7 Discount post-tax brand revenues to a net present value which equals the brand value Brand Finance has produced this study with an independent

WTF is going on in the games world? Imagine a few months from now you use Unity 6 (dumb move #1) and end up getting dinged per install TWICE Plus the Core Technology Fee What a year it‚Äôs gonna be he wrote Epic Games boss Tim Sweeney seemed to agree with that assessment responding with a resolute yes to an X post that asked whether Apple just introduced the equivalent of Unitys runtime install fee He also shared a lengthy takedown of his own that described Apples new terms as an illegal anticompetitive scheme rife with new Junk Fees Sweeney of course has a longstanding beef with Apple Epic and Apple previously took chunks out of each other in court after the latter pulled Fortnite from the App Store in 2020 for breaching guidelines by using third-party payments Apple claims the new EU guidelines will result in more than 99 percent of developers reducing or maintaining their current fees and like we explained earlier the CFT is optional for developers in the EU‚Äìbut only if they have no interest in exploring their options beyond the App Store ecosystem For those keen to scour pastures new success might come at a cost Read more about: Chris Kerr News Editor GameDevelopercom Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry His byline has appeared in notable print and digital publications including Edge Stuff Wireframe International Business Times and PocketGamerbiz Throughout his career Chris has covered major industry events including GDC PAX Australia Gamescom Paris Games Week and Develop Brighton He has featured on the judging panel at The Develop Star Awards on multiple occasions and appeared on BBC Radio 5 Live to discuss breaking news You May Also Like Mar 25 2024 Mar 25 2024 Mar 21 2024 Copyright ¬© 2024 All rights reserved Informa Tech a trading division of Informa PLC"

It costs at least $3500 making it a hard sell for many as a first-generation Apple product The Vision Pro is impressive but its not for everyone Thats why some people are already returning their orders just two weeks after the $3500 product first launched Fortunately if thats you or if you like the concept of Apples Vision Pro but arent convinced its a match for your needs there are several alternatives to consider Similar options start at $500 and climb to $3900 Some of the best VR headsets available now offer many of the same capabilities but require a VR-ready Windows gaming PC Others fall short of the Vision Pros specifications but are still great choices at a much lower price Either way its a great time to review what Vision Pro alternatives you can buy right now and whats coming in the near future Meta Quest Pro Upgrade your lifestyleDigital Trends helps readers keep tabs on the fast-paced world of tech with all the latest news fun product reviews insightful editorials and one-of-a-kind sneak peeks"

Apple‚Äôs stock is currently trading at 27 times the consensus calendar 2024 earnings-per-share estimate among analysts polled by FactSet (This article uses calendar years for all estimates because some companies including Apple have fiscal years that don‚Äôt match the calendar) Alphabet Inc‚Äôs Class A shares GOOGL +026% are trading at a P/E ratio of about 20 times the consensus calendar 2024 estimate while Meta Platforms Inc META +121% trades at about 20 times its consensus 2024 EPS estimate Here is a list of the ‚ÄúMagnificent Seven‚Äù stocks that led last year‚Äôs rally for the S&P 500 SPX sorted by marker capitalization and including expected compound annual growth rates through calendar 2025 based on consensus estimates among analysts polled by FactSet Estimates for the full S&P 500 are at the bottom of the table Apple is expected to grow its earnings at an annual pace of 82% over the next two years while increasing its annual sales at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5% Analysts expect much higher growth rates for EPS and sales for Alphabet and Meta and those stocks trade at much lower P/E valuations than Apple does Even the S&P 500 is expected to increase EPS and sales more quickly than Apple through 2025 The benchmark US index trades at 193 times weighted aggregate consensus EPS estimates for 2024 ‚Äî much lower than Apple‚Äôs P/E of 27 ‚ÄúThe P/E multiple on Apple has basically doubled over the last five years and increased by 50% in 2023‚Äù wrote Barclays analyst Tim Long in a downgrade note this week He added that Apple‚Äôs current valuation has reached a high-water mark Long was one of two Wall Street analysts who called attention to Apple‚Äôs diminished growth prospects in the first trading week of the new year He cut his rating to underweight and lowered estimates for the March quarter citing incrementally weak iPhone 15 data out of China and muted enthusiasm for the forthcoming iPhone 16 ‚ÄúWe believe the continued period of weak results coupled with multiple expansion is not sustainable‚Äù Long wrote ‚ÄúWe also believe 2024 will bring more services risk to light‚Äù Apple‚Äôs services business increased at a 9% rate in fiscal 2023 (which ended Sept 30) but Long is expecting services growth to grow 10% in fiscal 2024 and then slow to 8% in fiscal 2025 Services has been a big bright spot of consistent growth for Apple in the last few years Another analyst Gil Luria of DA Davidson picked up coverage of Apple shares last week with an neutral rating and a price target of $166 noting that he believed the ‚Äúcurrent share price

company‚Äôs $3499 Vision Pro mixed-reality headset will be available in US stores and online Feb 2 with pre-orders starting Jan 19 but it is an expensive product in a market that has yet to really take off Apple doesn‚Äôt comment on unannounced products and keeps close guard over any secret projects it may have under development So investors will be in the dark for a while until other new product plans are unveiled That is part of the mystique of the company but it is also a bane for long-term investors The company is of course dealing with the law of large numbers: As its revenue number hits greater heights Apple will have a tougher time posting the sort of double-digit growth it last did in fiscal 2018 and in the Covid-19 pandemic boom year of fiscal 2021 with an anomaly of 332% growth The low single-digit growth analysts now forecast for Apple seems hardly worthy of its stock‚Äôs current multiple Apple still has plenty of defenders Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives

in that book‚Äù Ives says that with 240 million iPhones ripe for upgrades both the iPhone and services by his estimates are poised to reaccelerate in fiscal 2024 and now is a ‚Äúgolden opportunity to

Buffett looked to correct his error by buying more Apple shares in 2022 as stock prices declined Still he missed out on significant gains by selling Apple Shares reached a new all-time high last year Buffett may have just repeated his mistake That said last quarters sale isnt nearly as big as his sale in 2020 The 10 million shares he sold represent about 1% of Berkshires total position If it does turn out to be a mistake itll be a much smaller one Whats more Buffett has an opportunity to buy back those Apple shares at a lower price after the companys stock dropped to start the year Apple shares currently offer relatively good value They trade at 278 times analysts consensus estimate for 2024 earnings and just 255 times expected earnings in 2025 While thats a premium to the overall market Apple shares arguably deserve a premium thanks to the generous capital return program and the $100 billion per year the company generates in free cash flow The important lesson for investors is that there are many reasons an investment manager might sell a stock It doesnt necessarily mean they no longer like the company or they think its not a good value And in the case of Buffetts take on Apple hes betting about $165 billion its a great investment Should you invest $1000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?

That‚Äôs quite a jarring thought but it‚Äôs a new possibility in the era of the metaverse and Apple‚Äôs first-ever spatial computing product Only time will tell if Apple Vision Pro products eat into the share of cinema darlings The pandemic represented a massive risk but Cineplex and many of its peers in the industry are still standing Further Barbenheimer weekend (the weekend that saw hit films Barbie and Oppenheimer take off) shows us that the movie-going experience is nowhere close to being dead In the meantime there just are not as many Vision Pro users out there to pose a serious threat to the movie theatre giants However in 10-15 years I suppose anything is possible as the technology gets better lighter and perhaps cheaper In the meantime I believe Cineplex shareholders need not worry about the Vision Pro or the rise of any other virtual reality (VR) or augmented reality (AR) headsets At the end of the day going out to the movies is a social experience and one that can co-exist with the rise of headsets Cineplex stock trades at just $8 and change per share making it a rather uneventful play having flatlined in the past year or so In any case I see some value to be had in the name as it looks to bounce back after many years‚Äô worth of turbulence Vision Pro or not don‚Äôt expect Cineplex to close up shop anytime soon This article represents the opinion of the writer who may disagree with the ‚Äúofficial‚Äù recommendation position of a Motley Fool premium service or advisor We‚Äôre Motley!

Advertisement Source: FP Creative / Shutterstockcom There aren‚Äôt any hotter stocks in the market right now than Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Today shares of NVDA stock hit another all-time high with the company briefly surpassing $2 trillion in market capitalization in early morning trading At the time of writing NVDA stock has once again passed the $2 trillion mark and appears to be heading higher For investors in this high-performance chip maker this rally has truly been incredible Some investors may indeed be keen on holding their position for an extended period And such a view makes sense if one believes that the artificial intelligence (AI) growth drivers propelling Nvidia‚Äôs recent earnings beat will remain strong for years Even at this current market capitalization NVDA stock trades at only 33 times forward earnings This is largely a function of how profitable its core high-performance chip business is But it also begs the question ‚Äî if revenue and earnings growth continue to accelerate could Nvidia actually be a bargain at this level? Let‚Äôs dive into whether Nvidia could be poised for even higher highs moving forward Currently there are only four companies in the world trading at market capitalizations above $2 trillion And with Saudi Aramco‚Äôs valuation only slightly higher than Nvidia‚Äôs it‚Äôs possible that Nvidia could be challenging Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) for the top spot around $3 trillion if this momentum continues Indeed such a move toward $3 trillion would imply around 50% upside from current levels And considering NVDA stock is already up more than 60% year to date such a move wouldn‚Äôt be out of the question The company‚Äôs forward multiple isn‚Äôt stretched for a company growing at this brisk of a pace In fact there are a growing number of investors who now believe Nvidia is a relatively cheap hypergrowth name on a PEG (price-to-earnings-to-growth) basis That thesis is valid and has been proven correct by Nvidia‚Äôs recent earnings beats However the bar is now set extremely high for Nvidia We‚Äôll have to see how many more quarters the company can pole-vault over expectations On the date of publication Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer subject to the InvestorPlacecom Publishing Guidelines Chris MacDonald‚Äôs love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years His experience as a financial analyst in the past coupled with his fervor for finding undervalued growth opportunities contribute to his conservative long-term investing perspective Technology Artificial Intelligence Article printed from InvestorPlace Media https://investorplacecom/2024/02/nvda-stock-alert-nvidia-surges-to-2-trillion-valuation/ ¬©2024 InvestorPlace Media LLC Stocks to Buy Stocks to Buy Todays Market Financial Market Data powered by FinancialContent Services Inc All rights reserved Nasdaq quotes delayed at least 15 minutes all others at least 20 minutes Copyright ¬© 2024 InvestorPlace Media LLC All rights reserved 1125 N Charles St Baltimore MD 21201 Not Yet a Premium Subscriber?

Related stories Jobs said that the people who are really great at their jobs make the best managers Theyre the great individual contributors who never ever want to be a manager but decide they have to be a manager because no one else is going to be able to do as good a job as them he said Jobs said that leadership is about having a vision that you can articulate to others and get a consensus on that idea We wanted people that were insanely great at what they did but were not necessarily those seasoned professionals but who had at the tips of their fingers and in their passion the latest understanding of where technology was and what we could do with that technology Jobs cofounded Apple alongside Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne in 1976 He died from pancreatic cancer in 2011 The visionary leader would have turned 69 on February 24 Although Apples massive success can be attributed to Jobs vision and leadership style this recruitment strategy is contested The practice of promoting high-performing employees into managerial positions that they might not be properly equipped for ‚Äî and subsequently fail at ‚Äî is referred to as the Peter principle Laurence J Peter a Canadian sociologist observed that as high-performing employees get promoted and progress through organizations theyre often considered top talent for managerial positions However without proper training and guidance those employees may not actually have the skills to be good managers and become incompetent in their roles Read next Jump to"

Fully subsidized? With a plan? I said that‚Äôs the most expensive phone in the world and it doesn‚Äôt appeal to business customers because it doesn‚Äôt have a keyboard which makes it not a very good e-mail machine‚Äù What about RIM/Blackberry the at-the-time king of mobile devices? When asked to address Apple‚Äôs smartphone in 2007 RIM/Blackberry CEO Jim Balsilie calmly responded that ‚ÄúThe recent launch of Apple‚Äôs iPhone does not pose a threat to Research In Motion Ltd‚Äôs consumer-geared BlackBerry Pearl and simply marks the entry of yet another competitor into the smartphone market‚Äù Hopefully readers see where this is going in the way that Barr seemingly does not The very idea of ‚Äúanticompetitive abuses‚Äù that Barr writes about is rooted in the impossible notion that Barr can see into the future in the way that businesses plainly cannot Which brings us to a close It was on July 3 2016 that the US Senate finally switched from buying RIM/Blackberry devices to iPhone and Android models Stop and think about that but please don‚Äôt be surprised that it took government years and years to catch up to the marketplace Which is why Barr‚Äôs fear of Apple shouldn‚Äôt surprise us while at the same time reminding us just how detached his analysis is from market realities No Apple does not violate antitrust law"

GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with MA As of 2024-02-05 Apple Incs intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $15547 Its currently trading at a price of $18584 Therefore the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -1953% The company is fair valued The GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage In the growth stage the company is experiencing faster growth while in the terminal stage a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run Apple Incs intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps Term Value Explanation EPS without NRI $642 GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow Discount Rate 11% An appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 409% rounded up to the nearest whole number which is 5% A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate Growth Stage Growth rate (g1) = 1620% Years of Growth Stage = 10 We choose the growth rate based on the availability prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10 5 or 3 years in that order and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate The default growth period is set to 10 years Terminal Stage Growth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10 For the terminal stage the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation Growth Stage = EPS without NRI * [ (1 + g1) / (1 + d) * (1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2 + + (1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ] = 833 Terminal Stage = EPS without NRI * (1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 * [ (1 + g2) / (1 + d) + (1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2 + + (1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ] = 7217 Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based) = Growth Stage + Terminal Stage = 15547 GuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $14319 This valuation indicates that the Apple Inc is fair valued accompanied by a margin of safety of -2979% You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page Please note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model: Future Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings Embracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role All else being equal a company with rapid growth will have a higher value Predictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance For companies with unpredictable performance such as cyclical companies the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized Discount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate Using the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based) To identify undervalued predictable companies focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based) This article generated by GuruFocus is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice Our commentary is rooted in historical data and analyst projections utilizing an impartial methodology and is not intended to serve as specific investment guidance It does not formulate a recommendation to purchase or divest any stock and does not consider individual investment objectives or financial circumstances Our objective is to deliver long-term fundamental data-driven analysis Be aware that our analysis might not incorporate the most recent price-sensitive company announcements or qualitative information GuruFocus holds no position in the stocks mentioned herein This article first appeared on GuruFocus Related Quotes"

drive from iPhone Sales here‚Äôs what we think of Apple‚Äôs stock Apple AAPL released its fiscal first-quarter earnings report on Feb 1 Here‚Äôs Morningstar‚Äôs take on Apple‚Äôs earnings and stock Apple‚Äôs results showed better iPhone revenue in the December quarter than we expected as well as better profitability iPhone revenue was driven by the launch of the iPhone 15 lineup and the improved profitability stems from a higher mix of services and higher-end products like the iPhone Pro models However revenue guidance for the March quarter fell below our expectations In the short term we see demand headwinds for Apple relating to elongating personal device replacement cycles and more aggressive domestic alternatives in China In the long term we maintain our view that Apple can drive growth from its unique combination of hardware software and services which also elicits steep customer switching costs and underpins our wide moat rating We believe guidance for weaker iPhone revenue in the March quarter portends weaker iPhone revenue for fiscal 2024 (ending in September) In our view Apple‚Äôs current share price reflects overly rosy expectations for iPhone sales over the next five years and our more modest forecast leads us to see the stock as overvalued With its 2-star rating we believe Apple‚Äôs stock is overvalued compared with our long-term fair value estimate of $160 per share Our valuation implies a fiscal 2024 adjusted price/earnings multiple of 25 times a fiscal 2024 enterprise value/sales multiple of 7 times and a fiscal 2024 free cash flow yield of 4% We project 6% compound annual revenue growth for Apple through fiscal 2028 The iPhone will be the greatest contributor to revenue over our forecast and we project 3% growth for iPhone revenue over the next five years We expect this to be driven primarily by unit sales growth with modest pricing increases We think pricing increases will be driven primarily by higher features and a mix shift toward the more premium Pro models Services are Apple‚Äôs next biggest revenue contributor over our forecast and we predict 8% revenue growth in this segment Services are driven in large part by revenue from Google thanks to its status as the default search engine on the Safari browser as well as Apple‚Äôs cut of App Store sales We expect solid growth in Google revenue but we see a more mixed outlook for App Store results There we forecast growth in overall app revenue but progressively lower cuts going toward Apple as the result of regulatory pressures Elsewhere we see roughly high-single-digit growth across revenue from Apple Music Apple TV+ Apple Pay AppleCare and Apple‚Äôs other services We see the highest growth opportunity in Apple‚Äôs wearables revenue to the tune of 18% through fiscal 2028 primarily driven by our expectations for the ramp of the new Vision Pro headset We project a rapid ramp for Vision Pro approaching 10 million unit sales and $30 billion in revenue in fiscal 2028 We see high-single-digit growth for Apple Watch and AirPods sales with both products continuing to gain share Read more about Apple‚Äôs fair value estimate We assign Apple a wide moat stemming from customer switching costs intangible assets and a network effect In our view Apple‚Äôs iOS ecosystem extends far-reaching sticky tendrils into customers‚Äô wallets entrenching them with its software capabilities and integration across disparate devices like the iPhone Mac iPad Apple Watch and more We also see immense design prowess at Apple most impressively from its deep integration of hardware software and semiconductors to create best-of-breed products Finally we see a virtuous cycle between Apple‚Äôs affluent customer base and its vast ecosystem of developer partners These moat sources elicit great profitability and returns on invested capital In our view Apple can likely leverage these moat sources into continued economic profits over the next 20 years To us Apple‚Äôs most important moat source arises from the switching costs for its ecosystem of software driven by iOS on the iPhone The firm enjoys terrific customer retention and satisfaction even despite pricing its products at a significant premium to its competition First Apple offers software capabilities that are only available to iPhone users‚ÄîiMessage messaging FaceTime calling AirDrop sharing the Apple Pay digital wallet and location sharing are among the most used Apple‚Äôs products become even more entrenched when a customer adopts two or more Users who combine the iPhone with a Mac an iPad and/or a Watch are offered more features which in turn creates a higher switching cost In our view Apple‚Äôs ability to widen its portfolio of user devices helps augment its existing switching costs The Apple Watch and AirPods are good recent examples of new products that we see raising the stickiness of customers A Watch user can answer calls read and respond to messages and keep track of notifications but must have an iPhone to use these capabilities AirPods connect with marked ease to Apple devices but have to be manually repaired if joined to a non-Apple device As customers use more point devices we believe they are less likely to leave Apple‚Äôs ecosystem We view Apple‚Äôs nascent push into augmented and virtual reality as the next step in this strategy The firm‚Äôs Vision Pro headset offers yet another auxiliary form factor that relies on the iPhone as the focal computing point Read more about Apple‚Äôs moat rating We assign Apple a Medium Uncertainty Rating We think the firm‚Äôs greatest risk is its reliance on consumer spending for which there is great competition and cyclicality Apple is at constant risk of disruption just as the iPhone disrupted BlackBerry in the budding smartphone market The iPhone could be unseated by a new device or ‚Äúsuper app‚Äù We believe the firm defends against this risk by introducing new form factors (like a watch and an augmented reality headset) and selling an ecosystem of software and services on top of hardware We also see geopolitical risk arising from Apple‚Äôs supply chain It is heavily dependent on Foxconn and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing TSM for its assembly and chip production respectively The majority of iPhones are produced at a factory in China by Foxconn and the majority of Apple chips are produced in Taiwan by TSMC If there were a souring of relations between the United States and China or if China threatened Taiwan the firm could see a severe hit to its supply Additionally the Chinese government has recommended that government officials not conduct business on iPhones which presents a current and potential future risk to sales in China We see a low level of environmental social and governance risk for Apple The firm has committed to full carbon neutrality by 2030 and we believe it will achieve this goal The potential future loss of talented human capital could be another risk on this front

Given the immense responsibility he has it‚Äôs a fair question Cook has been instrumental in shaping the company‚Äôs business since Steve Jobs passed away putting him in a rare league of CEOs Tim Cook took home a hefty $632 million (about Rs 523 crore) in compensation for the fiscal year 2023 That‚Äôs a lot of money but it‚Äôs actually less than what he made in 2022 Why?

give rivals the ability to access and interoperate with its contactless payment tech in an effort to appease antitrust regulators in Europe Apple Pay the companys mobile wallet feature allows users to make purchases by simply tapping their iPhones which run on Apples operating system called iOS Since Apple controls this operating system exclusively third-party mobile wallet developers access to its payment technology has previously been restricted In 2022 the European Commission the executive body of the EU found that since Apple Pay is the only option available to iPhone users such exclusionary conduct may restrict competition in the market for mobile wallets on iOS devices As a result Apple proposed a series of commitments to address the commissions concerns Apple said it will allow third-party developers to gain access to the mobile payment technology provide new features for users like defaulting to preferred payment apps and apply non-discriminatory eligibility criteria for rival developers Through our ongoing discussions with the European Commission we have offered commitments to provide third-party developers in the European Economic Area with an option that will enable their users to make NFC contactless payments from within their iOS apps separate from Apple Pay and Apple Wallet an Apple spokesperson told CNBC in a statement The commission said Friday that the changes would remain in place for 10 years It is looking for feedback on the solutions Apple has proposed If Apples commitments assuage European regulators competition concerns the commission will adopt them and legally require Apple to implement the changes If the company fails to comply it could face a fine of up to 10% of its total revenue Apple is also facing pressure from antitrust regulators in the US as the Department of Justice is reportedly shoring up a case against the company according to a report from Bloomberg The DOJs case reportedly centers around software and hardware limitations on iPads and iPhones that restrict competition The DOJ could reportedly file the suit against Apple within first quarter the report said Shares of Apple closed up more than 1% Friday Dont

Lango‚Äôs ‚Äú2nd Trillion-Dollar AI Trade‚Äù The US govt just unlocked an $8 trillion market to move in a new direction See how it could unleash 6000% potential upside In 2024 the rally could end for these three stocks Advertisement Source: shutterstockcom/eamesBot The ‚ÄúMagnificent 7‚Äù stocks experienced a great rally in 2023 These tech giants were also the key reason why the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite rose 43% and 24% last year respectively While many of the magnificent 7 stocks were largely safer bets amidst much of the macro-induced market volatility chances are 2024 will not be the same Below are the stocks of three major tech giants that investors should consider dumping at least for the short run Not surprisingly the iPhone maker‚Äôs stock had a good run in 2023 increasing nearly 50% However recent challenges related to its revenue growth in its key product lines have largely cast doubt on the company‚Äôs future growth prospects Despite new iPhone and iPad releases Apple‚Äôs (NASDAQ:AAPL) revenue growth remained unchanged disappointing investors The mobile handset market is at capacity Consumer demand for smartphones is decreasing as they lose novelty with each iteration Another reason investors should be wary of AAPL stock is the uncertainty of the China market which accounted for about 19% of Apple‚Äôs revenue at the end of its fiscal year 2023 Huawei‚Äôs launch of the Mate 60 Pro led many Chinese consumers to favor it over the new iPhone amidst geopolitical tensions According to a report by Bloomberg in late October Apple‚Äôs iPhone 15 sales were still behind the predecessor largely due to the resurgence of Huawei‚Äôs flagship device Unless Apple pursues a broad and competent diversification strategy investors should not hope for strong share price appreciation All in all it‚Äôs one of those stocks to sell When OpenAI released ChatGPT earlier this year a lot of market spectators investors and ordinary people marveled at the technology Meanwhile others wondered if Microsoft‚Äôs (NASDAQ:MSFT) billion-dollar investment in the startup was finally paying off The computer software giant had initially invested $1 billion in OpenAI back in 2019 but its cumulative investment has swelled beyond $13 billion There was also a lot of hope that ChatGPT would change the growth prospects for Microsoft‚Äôs Bing browser but current numbers leave more to be desired Last year when Satya Nadella went to testify against Google‚Äôs anti-competitive web browser practices he noted that even the AI-powered ChatGPT has not been able to help Microsoft meaningfully break into the search browser market He also denied artificial intelligence was leading to dramatic shifts in Microsoft‚Äôs market share Microsoft‚Äôs stock last year rose 58% and its market cap now is encroaching upon $3 trillion higher than even that of Apple‚Äôs If much of that share appreciation was related to the AI craze feeding into the market Investors should be vigilant about when this hype will fizzle out Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is one of the dominant players in the global electric vehicle market The automaker managed to beat estimates throughout 2023 In particular Tesla‚Äôs quarterly earnings have come in above analysts‚Äô estimates and the price-cut strategy the automaker began to pursue in the beginning year has increased quarterly deliveries while also placing pressure on gross margins However even though Tesla may be a decent long-term bet if one is betting on the overall EV market the stock may face some headwinds and seriously underperform throughout 2024 Delivery numbers for Q4 2023 were released in early January Despite beating Wall Street‚Äôs estimates again the automaker‚Äôs deliveries trailed behind Chinese competitor BYD (OTCMKTS:BYDDY) The question of whether Tesla will continue to be second place to BYD internationally will likely be on the minds of investors this year If Tesla continues to underperform in that regard the stock could lose much of its luster in 2024 On the date of publication Tyrik Torres did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article

Tough comparisons foreign-exchange headwinds and an uneven macroeconomic environment weighed on Apples fiscal 2023 performance Total revenue for the year declined but those declines improved as the year progressed By the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 revenue was down just 1% year over year but was up when adjusted to exclude foreign-exchange headwinds Even more earnings per share returned to double-digit growth But with Apple stock now trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 32 the iPhone maker will need to do more than tread water when it comes to revenue Fortunately top-line growth for fiscal Q1 is likely The average analyst forecast calls for fiscal first-quarter revenue to increase 1% year over year Though this may not seem like much of an improvement investors should keep in mind that the quarter will have one fewer week than the same quarter last year Management noted in the companys fiscal fourth-quarter earnings call that this eliminates an estimated 7 percentage points of the quarters revenue If analysts are anticipating a return to growth even with these headwinds theres clearly an expectation for Apple to start getting back to a top-line growth profile deserving of its valuation That said analyst forecasts remain conservative for the full year On average they anticipate fiscal 2024 revenue growth of just 35% and earnings-per-share growth of 74% Given the stocks current valuation investors are likely hoping actual results for the period exceed these forecasts All of this means that investors will not only be watching Apples fiscal first-quarter financial momentum when the company reports earnings next week but will also be eyeing managements guidance Investors are likely hoping management guides for even faster revenue growth in fiscal Q2 than it reports in fiscal Q1 The consensus analyst forecast currently calls for fiscal Q2 revenue growth of 16% year over year Investors should look for management to guide for around 2% year-over-year revenue growth or better in fiscal Q2 Going beyond managements financial guidance investors will be looking for commentary from management regarding demand for its new products Hopefully Apple will report encouraging demand trends for its iPhone and its new product Apple Vision Among other things investors are likely hoping for a rebound in Mac sales momentum after a lackluster year for personal computers overall and limited major new product refreshes in Apples Mac segment last year Recently overhauled MacBook Pro devices could be a boon for the segment The company is scheduled to report fiscal first-quarter results after market close on Thursday Feb 1 Should you invest $1000 in Apple right now?

My answer: Unless Apple‚Äôs board replaces CEO Tim Cook with an executive who can revive the company‚Äôs growth I think the stock is heading down To be fair for years Apple stock ‚Äî which gained 49% in 2023 ‚Äî rose as its revenues slowed and shifted into reverse Between 2010 and 2020 Apple revenue grew at a 155% average annual rate During the pandemic Apple enjoyed a surge in revenue ‚Äî growing at a nearly 20% annual rate in 2021 and 2022 Sadly since the end of 2022 Apple‚Äôs revenue has declined every quarter While the bulk of Apple‚Äôs revenue came from iPhone sales in China ‚Äî where its revenue fell 25% in the latest quarter to $151 billion noted the Wall Street Journal ‚Äî the company‚Äôs services business grew and generated profits To wit Apple‚Äôs services gross margin is ‚Äúdouble the margin Apple makes on all its hardware products‚Äù according to CNBC That could come to an end Barclays analyst Tim Long cited two concerns for downgrading Apple‚Äôs stock: Nothing clear on Apple‚Äôs new product horizon is likely to accelerate its revenue growth enough to justify its high valuation China is delivering Apple a one-two punch ‚Äî limits on government employee use of iPhones and the success of local rivals According to Bloomberg the International Data Corp cut its 2024 forecast for Apple‚Äôs China sales ‚ÄúHuawei‚Äôs success most significantly impacts Apple‚Äôs growth in China‚Äù said IDC Research Director Nabila Popal Huawei is rapidly gaining share against the iPhone The Chinese company‚Äôs high-end phone segment market share soared from 11% in 2022 to 24% during the third quarter of 2023 according to IDC In 2020 then-President Donald Trump imposed export controls on TSMC ‚Äî provider of the most advanced chips for smartphones ‚Äî blocking Huawei from keeping up with Apple Huawei ran out of TSMC chips and its market share plummeted in 2021 and 2022 noted Bloomberg That has changed because SMIC a Chinese chip maker has begun to catch up with TSMC Huawei can now buy chips from SMIC through a near-state-of-the-art 7 nm process technology that ‚Äúputs it a bit closer to parity with processes used by Apple‚Äù according to Bloomberg Thanks to the SMIC chip Huawei announced the Mate 60 Pro a smartphone that‚Äôs ‚Äúroughly comparable to a top-of-the-line iPhone 15 Pro Max‚Äù noted Bloomberg This could put more downward pressure on iPhone revenue Moreover since October China has continued to restrict its government officials from purchasing iPhones By December 2023 ‚Äúmultiple state-backed companies and government departments in at least eight provinces had instructed employees to use devices made by local brands‚Äù Bloomberg News reported With 80 million potential customers working for government-owned companies Apple‚Äôs pain could become Huawei‚Äôs gain Regulation could cut billions of dollars out of Apple‚Äôs $85 billion services business ‚ÄúApple‚Äôs services business is a friggin‚Äô money tree‚Äù Vijay Marolia managing partner and chief investment officer of Regal Point Capital told TechNewsWorld He added ‚ÄúLawyers regulators and lobbyists are trying to shake that tree while it keeps getting bigger and the rest of Apple‚Äôs revenues are stagnating‚Äù Google pays Apple pulls an estimated $15 billion to $20 billion in revenue to make its search engine the default choice on the iPhone iPad and Mac However those payments could end if the US government prevails in its antitrust lawsuit against Google noted TechNewsWorld Another lawsuit threatens Apple‚Äôs App Store revenues That‚Äôs because the US Department of Justice has filed an antitrust suit against Apple ‚Äî which charges a 15% to 30% commission on most App Store in-app purchases and paid downloads TechNewsWorld reported In Europe Apple has already lost a similar battle ‚Äî requiring Apple to permit customers to download apps from outside the App Store ‚ÄúThe company fought hard against and lost to the EU‚Äôs new Digital Marketing Act which requires vendors to allow customers to download apps from other companies‚Äù Charles King the principal analyst at Pund-IT told TechNewsWorld He added ‚ÄúIf similar regulations were adopted in the US it could substantially reduce Apple‚Äôs App Store commissions over time‚Äù If Apple suffers a further decline in iPhone sales and loses huge chunks of its services revenue does the company have anything to pick up the slack?

analyst recommendations in-depth research investing resources and more Learn More Last year the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) share price went from $125 at the start of January to $192 by the end of December That‚Äôs an outstanding performance but the stock has started to fall this year In general 2023 was a year of two major themes ‚Äì pandemic trends unwinding and the rise of AI as an investing focus But neither of these really accounts for Apple‚Äôs strong results Its financial performance was somewhat mixed ‚Äì both sales and net income were down by 28% But a 314% reduction in the company‚Äôs share count meant earnings per share increased Beneath the surface though things have been more interesting Apple divides its revenues into those that come from selling products and those that involve providing services In the second half of the year revenues from the company‚Äôs services division grew to a record $21bn This is significant ‚Äì margins in this part of the business are much higher To some extent this helped offset declines in iPhone sales (which are the reason the stock is falling now) But it‚Äôs still hard to see how growth in the low-single-digits justifies a 54% share price increase For Apple 2023 was a year of two halves (the usual number of halves for a year to have but you know what I mean) The stock surged during the first six months of the year but has largely traded sidewise since This indicates to me that stock market participants viewed Apple as a defensive position Its strong balance sheet and competitive position attracted investor capital when the pressure was on It‚Äôs also significant ‚Äì in my view ‚Äì that it underperformed other big tech stocks including Alphabet Microsoft Meta Platforms and Nvidia I suspect the reason is AI Apple is a little futher removed from the cutting edge of AI than other big tech companies As a result it didn‚Äôt get quite the same boost A third issue for Apple has been US-China relations This was noteworthy in 2023 and looks like an ongoing risk in the future Apple relies on China in two main ways The first is that it‚Äôs a big market and the second is that it‚Äôs where a lot of the company‚Äôs manufacturing base is The stock slipped 5% in September as the Chinese government instructed officials not to bring their iPhones to work And restrictions continued to spread through the rest of the year In October an investigation into Foxconn ‚Äì a key iPhone supplier ‚Äì caused the stock to falter further Despite Apple‚Äôs attempts to diversify its manufacturing investors should take note Apple spent 2023 as a shelter for investors hiding from a potential storm I think that‚Äôs a reasonable move but it means the stock doesn‚Äôt really look like a bargain at today‚Äôs prices I expect the ongoing share buyback programme to keep driving shareholder value And the significance of the company‚Äôs intangible assets shouldn‚Äôt be underestimated Even after a retreat in January I have this as a stock to watch rather than to buy at today‚Äôs prices I‚Äôm an Apple shareholder but I think there are better opportunities for me at the moment Should you invest the value of your

started picking stocks in high school during the capitalism-frenzied decade of the 1980s His parents constantly talked about equities and he read The Wall Street Journal religiously even though prices were at times days out of date Among his first buys were GE (GE) and US Air (AAL) the latter of which didnt do so well I learned at an early age you can pick winners and you can also lose money Ives said in an interview with Seeking Alpha But even when I lost money it was exciting The Long Island native was also passionate about technology and just as the internet was exploding in the late 1990s he got into equity research Today Ives is one of Wall Streets most prominent tech analysts and a major bull on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Google (GOOG) (GOOGL) among others The managing director of equity research at Wedbush Securities is ubiquitous throughout Seeking Alpha CNBC and Bloomberg among other venues While he doesnt always make the right call he has conviction and a preternatural ability to translate analyst gobbledygook into plain English which helps drive his popularity even if naysayers sometimes gang up on him For Ives though its more than just a job We feel a responsibility to handhold investors through the ups and downs of the tech market Ives aged 49 said in a phone interview We‚Äôre needed most when things are falling apart When I go to the depths of Covid in March [and] April 2020 that‚Äôs where we handheld clients and tech investors through an unprecedented time‚Ä¶ Our view back then was to basically buy techs stocks and it‚Äôs gonna be short lived and these were golden opportunities It proved to be a good call Since March 2020 Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) are up more than 200% while Google (GOOG) (GOOGL) has gained more than 150% This is not to say Ives and his team are perfect The analyst significantly underestimated hurdles in FireEyes acquisition of Mandiant about 10 years ago FireEye shares sold off sharply something he hadnt anticipated We vowed we were going to learn from that experience and that was going to make us better Ives said You have to use your failures as opportunities to get better Ives is a public figure and he owns it when hes wrong Mark Freed a venture capitalist and friend of Ives for more than two decades when the pair attended Penn State together said They share a love of Penn State athletics season tickets for football games and talk frequently Given he is in the business of looking forward he accepts and owns being wrong and is always guiding the recipient of his conviction towards looking ahead versus looking backward Freed said in an interview If you think about it theres nothing that can be done about what happened yesterday so what people want to hear from him is whats going to happen next Its his ability to relate to anyone that is part of his success Freed said People may disagree with his views but you wont find a person that will have a negative or disparaging thing to say about Dan Hes prepared hes passionate he has conviction and he connects well with everyone To Wedbush colleague Taz Koujalgi part of Ivess success comes from how broad his view is While most Wall Street analysts hone in on their own sectors Ives looks at the bigger picture Though he officially covers software names he also pays attention to Teslas (TSLA) automotive business and Apples hardware business He can tie in a lot of those things and his perspective is a lot broader and more holistic Koujalgi said in a phone interview this week I am amazed by how much he can cover the way he can combine what he is seeing in the Apple supply chain ecosystem and how that impacts the world of software‚Ä¶ We all make a mistake just looking at whats happening in our own sector and ignoring whats happening outside Koujalgi ‚Äî who speaks with Ives some 10 times a day or more ‚Äî now looks beyond the software industry that he also covers and into semiconductors and hardware among others to incorporate different data points He also admires Ivess collaborative nature and lack of back-stabbing behavior which can be prevalent on Wall Street Ives who often paints a distinctly non-Wall Street vibe with his pastel pink and turquoise jackets and plaids has naysayers of course like the following Seeking Alpha subscribers who commented last month on stories featuring the analyst WealthWisedca in response to Ives saying Apple will go to $4T: Dan is so bullish it makes me wanna go bearish Nate311 on Ivess wish list for 2024: [Ives] understands apple as few analysts do (munster is another) but $4T seems unrealistic Jamiemcdaniel on Microsofts AI bet not being priced in: With any analysis by Dan super-mega-tech-bull Ives all risks are always priced in and the market is ignoring the many incredible practically guaranteed positives that only he and the company CEO so clearly sees To which combatcorpsmanVN responded: @jamiemcdaniel You can criticize all you want but Ives has been spot on regarding Microsoft and Apple and other tech stocks Instead of criticizing him you should listen to him you‚Äôd make some money Among what Ives thinks are his biggest successes include calling the Microsoft has undergone under Satya Nadella The stock is up 10 times since Nadella became Chief Executive in February 2014 Ives said On Apple which he thinks will hit $4T this year Ives understands the criticism that the company has been lacking in innovation since Steve Jobs died What investors have underestimated is the pure breadth of Apples installed base which is 2 billion iOS devices and their ability to monetize Ives said Investors who are so focused on valuation can‚Äôt see forest through the trees Ives is excited to keep covering tech as artificial intelligence is causing the industry to go at 90 miles per hour in a Ferrari ‚Äî while the regulatory environment goes at 25 miles per hour The new tech bull market has begun and is being led by AI Ives said This is just the start of a decade-long trend"

140,"Apple: Buy Sell Or Hold? (NASDAQ:AAPL)","1/9/2024","https://seekingalpha.com/article/4661975-apple-buy-sell-or-hold","yalcinsonat1 Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) the worlds most valuable company has recently become the subject of intense scrutiny There are concerns regarding iPhone sales especially in China There have also been downgrades by Piper Sandler Barclays and others Analysts cite hardware concerns including iPhone 15 weakness and other factors Perhaps most troubling is Apples jacked-up valuation Apple trades at 26 times forward EPS estimates (consensus) and could have an EPS growth of only about 8% next year At a 325 PEG ratio Apple is relatively expensive Therefore Apple will likely go through another stagnant period making its stock a hold now However despite Apples transitory setbacks its stock becomes increasingly attractive around the $150 zone as its forward P/E ratio should remain above 20 Also there are plenty of positive angles to the Apple story There is still considerable growth in its services and wearable businesses iPhone sales should rebound and China sales will likely return to growth Also Apples non-iPhone hardware segment can improve in future quarters Therefore while Apple may be a hold here it becomes a strong buy around the $150 range I will look for an opportunity to enter Apple on weakness as we advance through 2024 Apples stock has gone through transitory periods of stagnant growth weakness and sideways price action several times We saw its stock stagnate around the 2014-2016 time frame We saw another low growth period around 2017-2019 Then we witnessed a sideways phase around the 2021-2022 time frame and Apple may continue consolidating before moving higher again iPhone sales still account for approximately 50% of Apples total revenues Therefore Apple is heavily dependent on the growth of its iPhone sales Last quarter iPhone sales increased by only 3% YoY after posting a 3% YoY decline in the previous quarter illustrating some softness in the iPhone segment iPhone sales (businessofappscom ) However weve seen this dynamic with prior iPhone cycles The market has become highly saturated by Apples iPhone 12-15 Models and its expected to see a slowdown Also the design is relatively old and has become stale Additionally Apples iPhone 15 looks very much like the 12 13 and 14 models and consumers need more incentive to upgrade aside from incremental performance increases that may be unnoticeable to many users For example I still use my iPhone 12 Pro Max that I purchased in late 2020 It works perfectly fine to this day My wife keeps saying I should upgrade but I dont see a reason to upgrade because there is very little difference between my phone and the new line I will likely upgrade to the iPhone 16 in the fall but four years is a long upgrade cycle I am not alone and there isnt a comprehensive catalyst to compel consumers to upgrade to a new iPhone sooner (every 2-3 years) Of course when the redesign comes with more advanced features it will catalyze increased sales There are rumors for minor redesign features for the iPhone 16 but the iPhone 17 model may get major adjustments similar to what we witnessed in the iPhone X jump from the iPhone 8 line-up As the iPhone 12-15 models are so similar its normal to see a slowdown in sales growth Other newer phones are likely taking incremental market share away from Apple in the smartphone market also However iPhone sales should rebound and could surge as Apple introduces its iPhone 16 and 17 line-ups with possible price increases in the future Services revenues (businessofappscom) Services revenues continue expanding at a healthy clip with 77% sales growth last quarter Also services are becoming an increasingly significant portion of total revenues with annual revenues likely to hit $100 billion soon (2025) While we may not see a return to substantial double-digit growth in the services segment it should continue contributing to the increase for many years as we advance Analysts say China iPhone sales dropped by 30% in the first week of 2024 Also 2023 sales likely declined by about 3% from the previous year Apples most recent quarter saw China revenues come in at $151 billion below the $1542 billion in the same quarter one year ago The declines are attributed to new flagship model phones from Huawei Xiaomi and others China is Apples third most significant market behind the Americas and Europe Despite Apples slip in China the sales and market share declines are likely transitory Again this dynamic boils down to Apples stale and still expensive iPhone line-up The new models arent exactly new anymore because aside from color changes the designs are about the same Yet Apple remains at the pinnacle of the electronic hardware pyramid and its products should continue garnering high demand in China and globally Also this is not a China-isolated story Sales in almost all significant regions declined in 2023 compared to a year ago Nonetheless the tide should turn for Apple in China and globally as the iPhone remains a top smartphone Its also a status symbol in many countries and even if some users switch away from the iPhone to try new Huawei or Xiaomi phones they may return to Apple for their future iPhone products In the meantime Apple can improve sales and regain market share by decreasing prices before introducing new and updated iPhones Wearables (businessofappscom) Wearables sales also declined YoY in the previous quarter However were dealing with a relatively slow economy high-interest rates and other challenging factors Still this segment should rebound as the economy strengthens and the Fed introduces a more accessible monetary policy in future years Apples AirPods business alone is estimated to be around a $10B annual revenue business Its Apple Watch segment contributes about $14-$18B in annual sales We should see growth improve in these and other product segments and Apples Vision Pro headset will likely achieve increasing growth in sales as well Apple EPS (SeekingAlphacom ) Of course Apple is not cheap here at 26 times forward EPS estimates However if Apple continues consolidating and dips into my $150-$160 buy-in range it will be priced much more attractively especially with increased future growth prospects Apple should earn around $700-$750 next year implying that its P/E ratio is about 20-22 in the $150-$160 range Due to Apples dominant global positioning high level of profitability future growth prospects and other advantages its stock deserves a 20-22 P/E multiple or higher Therefore we may not see a sustainable move below the $150-$160 range limiting the downside in Apples shares Moreover a significant dip will likely attract substantial dip buyers to Apples stock making it a strong buy if it goes lower on multiple contraction and growth fears Where Apples stock could be in the future Source: The Financial Prophet The most significant risk to Apple may be its valuation/growth dynamic If Apple cant deliver growth its stock may experience multiple expansion beyond my anticipated 20-22 forward P/E contraction If Apples P/E ratio drops back down into the teens its stock price could experience a considerable repricing While this scenario is unlikely it is possible and investors should consider it and other risks before investing in Apples stock Other risks include increased competition geopolitical tensions and macroeconomic factors Are You Getting The Returns You Want?

stock pickers is which of these seven giants are worth buying Here‚Äôs my top three picks Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a company that‚Äôs thrived across numerous market conditions While some believe the company‚Äôs consumer discretionary business model may have a difficult time if a recession is on the horizon others preach patience Analysts at Evercore ISI are among those who are advising a patient long-term approach with iPhone growth likely to drive near-term upside and the highly-profitable services segment set to take over in the long-term The iPhone revolutionized the tech sector merging many devices into one Accordingly Apple soared to global dominance Even now the iPhone drives 58% of the company‚Äôs overall revenue and remains a core focal point of investors However services like iCloud and Apple Music are gaining in importance contributing 19% to sales Despite a lackluster recent quarter the Vision Pro shows promise in Apple‚Äôs revenue stream While not expected to outpace

increasing the stock price AI stands as a transformative technology of our era Large language models with vast parameters usher in new generative AI applications enhancing customer experiences and productivity Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) prioritizes responsible AI use collaborating with stakeholders for safety and fairness With the company now advocating for effective regulatory frameworks promoting innovation I think Amazon could be a leader in this space (though one that‚Äôs relatively overlooked) Amazon recently joined the US Artificial Intelligence Safety Institute Consortium led by NIST fostering collaboration between government and industry for safe AI advancement Collaborating with NIST Amazon aims to establish measurement standards for trustworthy AI development Owning AMZN stock provides investors with exposure to two major global growth sectors: e-commerce and cloud services The company‚Äôs retail segment recently set a holiday sales record with ongoing improvements and rising Prime membership fees promising continued growth CEO Andy Jassy highlighted the company‚Äôs focus on customer experience enhancements particularly evident in the rapidly expanding cloud services division Expectations for double-digit growth continue driven by sustained innovation and increased adoption of cloud services Over time I think Amazon will continue to outperform and its

than 150% in 2023 the company has shown robust revenue and consistent profit growth Meta‚Äôs recent earnings report also shows how impactful the stock is given the fact META stock rose 20%

Who knows It‚Äôs a catch-up play and the impact is yet to be seen I urge caution though Apple‚Äôs recent moves have been all but reassuring for future health (have you seen the videos of people using the Vision Pro in public?? Its rumored flip phone??) Don‚Äôt get me wrong AI needs data as we all know and Apple has a ton that we don‚Äôt even think about Location services health information and search queries through Siri But can it utilize this to make more money?

which has us wondering Should Apple and Tesla be on the chopping block? baiajaku/iStock via Getty Images Two of the Magnificent Seven have rapidly slowing growth which has us wondering Should Apple and Tesla be on the chopping block? baiajaku/iStock via Getty Images Brian Dress CFA -- Director of Research Investment Advisor With the recent action and developments over the past few months there is one conclusion that we can definitively state ‚Äì US stocks are in a bull market There are any number of technical definitions of the term ‚Äúbull market‚Äù and we will leave a link here if you are interested in the Wall Street definition of the term But for our part here at Left Brain we look at a bull market as a time when stocks generally move higher and when stocks predictably move higher in reaction to positive news whether it be company-specific or more macroeconomically-oriented This current earnings season which is quickly reaching its conclusion has given us a great deal of evidence that markets have reached a bullish condition Between 2021-2023 many businesses delivered strong earnings but it was never easily predictable how their stock prices would react to positive earnings releases That is more indicative of a bear market Though things did improve later in 2023 in this regard the stock price reactions we have seen coming out of the most recent earnings season have been more predictable In fact we have seen a great number of very large stock moves higher in response to companies report earnings that beat expectations Examples of this phenomenon this quarter include many of the market‚Äôs leading growth stocks: Meta Platforms (META) Netflix (NFLX) Uber Technologies (UBER) Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) just to name a few of the many companies that have delivered What‚Äôs interesting is seeing stock price moves of 10%+ in very large cap companies suggesting fresh buyers coming in and stock price analyst estimates that had been far too low in comparison to the fundamental improvements taking place at the individual company level This week we saw similar moves out of other giants including Block (SQ) and Walmart (WMT) but most notable was the more than 15% 1-day gain from the world leader in Artificial Intelligence (AI) Nvidia (NVDA) NVDA is a company that we have praised profusely in this space over the last few years particularly due to the grand vision of CEO Jensen Huang the highest rated CEO in our 2019 CEO profiles series NVDA‚Äôs Wednesday earnings report after market close was one of the mostly hotly anticipated releases in recent memory and the company delivered well beyond most analysts‚Äô projections For the 4th quarter of fiscal year 2024 (last year for NVDA) the company reported $221 billion in revenue well in excess of the $205 billion predicted by Wall Street analysts and representing a 265% (!) year-over-year growth number Nvidia‚Äôs data center business had revenues of $184 billion last quarter which was a more than 400% increase from the prior-year quarter Analysts‚Äô lofty expectations over the last year have been unable to keep up with the realities of the AI explosion spearheaded by Nvidia‚Äôs Hopper GPU computing platform Said CFO Colette Kress: ‚ÄúThe world has reached the tipping point of new computing era The $1 trillion installed base of data center infrastructure is rapidly transitioning from general purpose to accelerated computing‚Äù In response to this better-than-expected earnings release NVDA stock increased in value by more than 16% in Thursday‚Äôs trading session This is the type of remarkable price action that we think is the hallmark of an emerging bull market Though the NASDAQ Composite index has gained nearly 30% in value since its most recent low in late October we think there is still plenty of space for stocks to gain in value Companies involved in AI cybersecurity digital transformation software and a number of other key sectors continue to grow revenues and profits at a rapid pace We would note also that the market‚Äôs upside performance has accelerated over the past month despite the fact that interest rates have started creeping back higher What we are witnessing in this market rally is a fundamental phenomenon rather than driven by hopes and expectations that the Federal Reserve is likely to announce numerous interest rate cuts in the coming year Not every large company has fared quite as well as META NFLX NVDA and the like We have seen two of the ‚ÄúMagnificent Seven‚Äù struggle coming out of their earnings releases this quarter Apple Inc (AAPL) and Tesla Inc (TSLA) The death knell for growth stocks is deceleration in revenue growth and that is in evidence for these two behemoths based on their most recent results and in their business trends over the last two years In today‚Äôs letter we are putting the spotlight on these two businesses and bringing you into our thought process on why they may deserve to be on the chopping block for investors‚Äô portfolios In doing so we will use these two examples to show you why we are such devotees to active management in our investment approach (in contrast to passive index investing) We will devote our entire letter this month to this topic so no ‚ÄúIncome Security of the Month‚Äù for February but we did want to point out that interest rates have been creeping higher in recent weeks so investors still holding cash that needs a home with a higher yield are in luck Bankratecom Yahoo! Finance NerdWalletcom AnnuityAdvantagecom Bankratecom Yahoo! Finance NerdWalletcom AnnuityAdvantagecom As we put together the chart of various fixed-income security yields in the box here we noticed that most of the listed interest rates ticked up anywhere between 005-03% over the last month We still think now is the right time for investors to move cash into higher-yielding instruments and that interest rates will eventually begin falling in earnest We think if you have cash still sitting in a no or low-yield checking account you really ought to consider moving to one of these instruments or possibly into a stock market vehicle if you are more tolerant of volatility Of course everyone‚Äôs circumstances are different so speak with a financial professional before making a move With that all being said let‚Äôs get into it! Those who follow us here at Left Brain will know that we are staunch evangelists for active investing: in other words active and deliberative stock and bond selection We think that active management done right has a wonderful opportunity to deliver value to an investor over time The major caveat to that statement of course is ‚Äúdone right‚Äù Selecting individual stocks is relatively costly requiring an idea generation method built on a diligent research process Put simply it‚Äôs not for everybody I‚Äôm sure there are many investors that have tried picking stocks on their own over the years in just a couple hours of work per week and have struggled to achieve strong performance That is not an argument against active management it‚Äôs an argument against hobbyist active management The more pertinent and topical argument for passive management in recent years is that it works (well enough)! Over the last 15 years (since February 2009) the S&P 500 (SP500) has generated an average annual total return of just over 16% And we understand ‚Äì who can argue with success? A well-selected basket of stocks has the potential for eclipsing the returns of the broader market but yes also carries the risk of underperforming For busy professionals with families and lives outside the business world we can forgive investors for taking what appears to be the easy and cheapest route However we want to introduce you to what we think is a major vulnerability to index investing ‚Äì concentration risk Over the past decade we have seen a self-fulfilling cycle take place: more investors are allocating money on a monthly basis to index funds who in turn continue buying the largest cap stocks in ever-bigger proportions leading to increased concentration over time Take a look at the comparison of the largest 10 stocks in the S&P 500 compared from September 2020 to August 2023: Coinspeakercom Investopedia Coinspeakercom Investopedia (Please pardon me for less than stellar Microsoft Word skills in building this table!) What we can see here is that the index is becoming ever more top-heavy over time with the top two stocks now comprising just under 14% of an investors‚Äô portfolio if she owns just the S&P 500 in her portfolio This is up from less than 12% in no more than 3 years! You can also see as you move down the chart that most of the corresponding rows (#3 #4 etc) are larger than they were three years ago Well Brian you may ask ‚ÄúThese are the strongest companies in the world why should I worry?‚Äù That stance is understandable as we look back to past results from Apple Microsoft Amazon and the like they continue to grow There are two problems with this First the top 10 companies list changes dramatically over time One only has to look back to 2012 to see when Exxon Mobil (XOM) was the world‚Äôs largest company and now is nowhere to be found in the top 10 But second and more importantly what happens to your portfolio when some of your largest positions start to be a drag? That second question we will now cover in more depth Even if you are an active investor odds are you own one or both of the following stocks so stay tuned We all know Apple (AAPL) and most of us are using one or more of their devices right now I‚Äôm writing this week‚Äôs letter on an iMac Apple shares have made so many millionaires worldwide that it is literally dizzying to consider the impact of this stock over the last two decades on portfolios around the world But something is amiss at Apple and that is very worrying considering the huge AAPL positions that many investors carry on their books We love growth stocks but there is one thing that can be kryptonite for growth stocks ‚Äì slowing growth Take a look at the annual revenue growth numbers out of Apple over the past 8 years: Apple Annual Sales Growth by Fiscal Year ((Source: FactSet financial data and analytics)) Apple Annual Sales Growth by Fiscal Year ((Source: FactSet financial data and analytics)) On a raw sales basis you can see that Apple‚Äôs yearly revenues haven‚Äôt even doubled in that 8-year time frame: Apple Annual Sales by Fiscal Year ( (Source: FactSet financial data and analytics)) Apple Annual Sales by Fiscal Year ( (Source: FactSet financial data and analytics)) This stands in stark contrast to the growth in Apple‚Äôs stock price which has risen by more than 600% in the corresponding period Granted Apple once traded at a low price/earnings multiple (1356 in September 2016) and a relatively low price/sales multiple (289 in September 2016) compared to now (2996 and 778 respectively at the end of December 2023) What has happened to Apple‚Äôs stock price over the last 8 years has been in large part due to multiple expansion rather than due to sales or earnings growth We find it curious that the stock would trade at a dramatically higher multiple just as its growth rate has stalled over the same period The contrast is even more stark when we look at 2023 performance As the company had negative sales growth the stock price increased by more than 40%! Something isn‚Äôt adding up here or as the kids say these days the ‚Äúmath isn‚Äôt mathing‚Äù We think that the ever more intense move toward passive investing has something to do with this phenomenon but we can only hazard a guess With stalling sales growth in evidence we find ourselves asking a simple question ‚ÄúGiven current business conditions how does Apple double its market cap from its current level of $28 trillion to an eventual capitalization of $56 trillion?‚Äù We know that Apple is working in the Virtual Reality space recently releasing the Vision Pro early in 2024 But what else is on the horizon? Granted Apple likely trades on a higher multiple than before due to more predictable revenue in the form of recurring services sales However iPhone sales constitute more than half of the company‚Äôs revenues and showed a negative growth rate of -24% in fiscal year 2023 The Services business was the only avenue of growth in the most recent year showing an increase of 91% year-over-year All of this is to say that as holders of Apple shares we are starting to question whether this belongs in portfolios specifically for growth investors We know that many investors sit on huge capital gains in this stock complicating the decision in taxable brokerage accounts especially With so many compelling growth stories in evidence from AI to cybersecurity to FinTech to weight loss drugs (and many more) we think it may be time to consider other uses of investment capital Herein lies the advantage of active portfolio management If you are a passive indexer you have no choice but to hold a large proportion of your investment capital in a stock like this On the other hand if you (or your investment professional) manage your portfolio actively you at least have a chance to consider a new path There is one more stock in the ‚ÄúMagnificent Seven‚Äù that has us worried ‚Äì Tesla (TSLA) Since this is a smaller proportion of the S&P 500 this is less of a concern for passive investors than is AAPL in our view but this is another stock we know that is heavily owned Tesla is interesting for many reasons not the least of which is its CEO Elon Musk who can‚Äôt help but make news (good and bad) on almost a daily basis When we speak to investors about our thoughts on Tesla we are often asked if our concern comes from his behavior on X (formerly Twitter) and the answer surprisingly is no in this case Rather the problem in evidence here is rapidly slowing growth (and lower profitability) This case is slightly different than that of Apple which is in chronic growth deceleration Rather growth has deteriorated quickly at Tesla as we can see in the quarterly growth rates over the past two years: Tesla Sales Growth by Quarter ((Source: FactSet financial data and analytics)) Tesla Sales Growth by Quarter ((Source: FactSet financial data and analytics)) As we can see Tesla sales were well over 20% for most of the last two years and often in excess of 40% The fact that the last two quarters have seen single digit growth is quite troubling for investors And that is reflected in the stock price which fell more than 15% in the week following the earnings report on January 24 Higher interest rates are impacting Tesla‚Äôs sales negatively according to the most recent earnings report In conjunction with that issue the average selling price of vehicles in the most recent quarter was significantly lower than in previous periods reflecting a slowing demand environment In fact one anecdotal story is quite concerning for Tesla: citing the high cost of maintenance for its electric vehicle fleet (including Teslas) rental car giant Hertz just sold 20000 of its electric vehicles opting to replace them with gas-powered models Said Musk on the earnings call ‚ÄúTesla is currently between two major growth waves Were focused on making sure that our next growth wave driven by the next-gen vehicle energy storage full self-driving other projects is executed as well as possible‚Äù This is exactly the type of tone that chases growth investors from a hypergrowth stock like Tesla Now we see a situation where the company will have to prove to investors that it is able to reaccelerate growth either through a new product line or an increase in demand for its products Given that there is already a certain level of saturation of the marketplace (ie many of the consumers who have interest in EVs already have bought them and those who haven‚Äôt are reluctant to do so) Tesla faces an uphill battle in the near to medium-term to turn things around Further profitability is under threat at Tesla Gross margins (on a trailing 12-month basis) have fallen six straight quarters from 271% in June 2022 to 1825% in December of 2023 In many ways Tesla is facing a similar problem that META did in 2022: they have been devoting a lot of capital to AI projects and next generation vehicles to the detriment of the company‚Äôs overall profitability Whether those capital expenditures will ultimately bear fruit is uncertain What is certain again is that there are many areas of the market where there is less uncertainty and we would rather focus there rather than on a broken growth story like Tesla I will close this section by saying we wouldn‚Äôt bet against Elon Musk and his ability to eventually right the ship: he‚Äôs done it before We see things clearly now in the beginning of 2024: it appears that the US stock market has turned bullish driven specifically by the AI revolution Early indications suggest that this explosion of innovation still in its infancy could be more dramatic even than the beginning of the Internet in the mid-1990s What‚Äôs really exciting is that the companies driving things like Nvidia have strong revenues cash flows and even net profits which stands in stark contrast to the boom nearly 30 years ago At the same time we think now is the right moment to take full stock of portfolios Specifically we think that as active portfolio managers there are two major stocks that are in many portfolios that deserve consideration as slowing growth is the kryptonite for growth stocks As we see deceleration in those two stocks ‚Äì AAPL and TSLA ‚Äì we think holders of these shares would be smart to take a closer look at what they hold Again the advantage of active management is the ability to make moves like this Passive indexers don‚Äôt have the same flexibility Editors Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major US exchange Please be aware of the risks associated with these stocks This article was

Just wrap your minds around that One segment of Apples business could be worth $100 billion over the next year two years perhaps and its just services But what also makes that ecosystem sticky is the range of products And so as of right now its not like the Vision Pro is going to make people just fly out of their couches out the door into the car to go pick up a VR headset Thats probably not it not at 3500 bucks But what are they probably going to do? Theyre probably going to be updating some of those wearables that they might have They might also have to eventually get into one of the new iPhones I mean every time I get an iOS update I feel like my phone works just a little bit worse So at the end of the day that cyclical life cycle or the life cycle that we see and the turnover and churn of some of the previous models is something that we perhaps should be watching and what in the next super cycle will emerge Related Quotes"

virtual reality headset could be difficult to buy at launch TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said Thursday Apple will only produce between 60000 units and 80000 units of the $3499 headset for the release Feb 2 Kuo wrote on social media and he predicts units could quickly sell out For comparison analysts say Apple usually ships about 225 million iPhones per year The prediction from one of the top Apple supply chain analysts underscores how unusual and limited the launch of Apples first major product since the Apple Watch could be Apple announced the headset last summer and earlier this month said preorders would start this month ahead of a US-only release in February suggesting a controlled and limited rollout Apple didnt hold a second launch event to discuss the product Update: Apple Vision Pro review: This is the future of computing and entertainment Wall Street analysts dont believe the Vision Pro will be material to Apples sales in the near term but theyll watch the consumer reaction so they can project sales for future versions of the headset Technologists are wondering what people will use the Vision Pro for Last summer Apple demoed functions such as replacing a laptop watching 3D movies and viewing panoramic environments Apple fans are likely to covet the headset regardless leading to a quick sell-out Kuo wrote Although Apple has not clearly defined the product positioning and key applications of Vision Pro and there are doubts [because] the price is not cheap the user experience (eg giving users the illusion that they can control the user interface with their minds) created by the groundbreaking technology innovations along with the base of core fans and heavy users should make it easy to sell out after the release Kuo wrote on social media The Vision Pro is Apples first major new product since the release of the Apple Watch back in 2014 It uses a battery of cameras and sensors to display the real world integrated with Apple software on the headsets advanced internal displays The device requires some fitting and customization for each user including custom lenses for people who wear glasses Apple is gearing up for the products launch emailing customers telling them they can book demos with the device inviting developers to upload software for the headset and even running a national advertisement for the headset

letting retailers restart sales However the move was temporary and sales have again been halted A Masimo spokesperson told DailyMailcom last month: Masimo is willing to settle As Joe Kiani indicated we believe the path forward is to have honest good-faith discussions with Apple to explore the various ways the parties could resolve their dispute The Irvine-based company pioneered a sensor technology that consistently emits light through the skin to monitor blood oxygen saturation Apples technology shines red and near-infrared (IR) light into blood-perfused tissue According to the company website Masimo founded by Joe Kiani in 1989 holds thousands of healthcare and consumer-focused patents Data shows that Masimo is valued at $669 billion and Kianis net worth is $13 billion Apple has also claimed that Masimo applied for a patent after Apple launched its smartwatches Apple has included a pulse oximeter feature in smartwatches since its Series 6 Apple Watch in 2020 The Cupertino-based company filed two patent infringement lawsuits against Masimo in October 2022 claiming Kianis company copied patented features of the Apple Watch to use in its medical tech Divers and sonar crews race against the tide as they desperately search for survivors of Baltimore bridge collapse amid fears TWENTY victims plunged into freezing 47F waters: Two are saved with one in a critical condition Published by Associated Newspapers Ltd Part of the Daily Mail The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media Group"

Since the value of money is tied to the trend in interest rates the dollar index could lower if or when the FED cuts rates A lower dollar drives oil prices higher (good for Chevron) and makes domestic consumption decline (alarming for Apple); so Warren is timing the market as futile as it seems? Even analysts at The Goldman Sachs Group NYSE: GS have expressed their view toward the manufacturing sector maybe betting on the lower dollar sparking new export demand from the US They are pointing toward a breakout of the sector which of course includes Chevron as a prime member for rising profits One word of caution: this does not mean you should dump all of your Apple stock in case you own any; guys like Buffett can sell a stock only to rebalance their portfolio or to book some profits to be reinvested in other more attractive deals So here are the reasons why ‚Äì beyond the macro ‚Äì Chevron can be more attractive than Apple If there‚Äôs anything your portfolio should be after in this coming cycle it is growth and above-average growth When it comes to Apple and its peers growth is a lacking factor considering today‚Äôs analyst projections and just the opposite is the case for Chevron Taking the energy stocks as a group they are expected to grow their earnings per share by an average rate of 71% over the next twelve months Analysts believe that Chevron stock can jump 146% to be above the industry average and superior to its close competitor Exxon Mobil NYSE: XOM which expects only 83% growth On the opposite end of the spectrum you have the mega-cap technology stocks which are expected to grow their EPS by a respective 112% over the next year; Apple sits well below this average at only 84%; it also happens to be below its closest competitor Microsoft NASDAQ: MSFT who expects to see 131% Knowing what you know now it should come as no surprise to learn that Chevron ‚Äì in its $1809 price target ‚Äì brings you a 170% potential upside while Apple only comes at 126% along its $2053 targets The reason behind this divergence? Well you should be able to answer that by now So now you see Buffett gave you the initial hint but it is the actual marketplace and analyst expectations that are literally confirming the thesis as to where the new growth can be found in the new upcoming cycle Before you consider Berkshire Hathaway youll want to hear this MarketBeat keeps track of Wall Streets top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis MarketBeat has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on and Berkshire Hathaway wasnt on the list While Berkshire Hathaway currently has a Hold rating among analysts top-rated analysts believe these five stocks are better buys View The Five Stocks Here Which stocks are likely to thrive in todays challenging market?

211,"Navigating PayPals Decline","2/23/2024","https://finance.yahoo.com/news/navigating-paypals-decline-130003440.html","Financial services conglomerate PayPal Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:PYPL) remains in the shadow of its former glory After peaking at record highs of $310 a share at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2021 the stock has come tumbling down The company has seen its market value fall by 80% over the past three years compared to a 16% gain for the S&P 500 The payment technology companys stock fell 22% last year underperforming the overall financial services sector which benefited from an uptick in interest rates Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with PYPL The underperformance can be attributed among other things to investors reacting to underwhelming margins in recent quarters Eroding market share in the high-value core branded checkout business has also significantly dragged margins and stock sentiments into the market PayPal was one of the beneficiaries as millions of people locked down at the height of the pandemic rushed online to do shopping The coronavirus-driven shift to online shopping and digital transactions drove record payment volumes adding about 50 million active users in 2021 Likewise the company registered its strongest-ever annual performance in 2020 as it processed over 900 billion in payments That is no longer the case as an end to pandemic restrictions has seen a significant shift in consumer shopping patterns Traffic to brick-and-mortar stores has rebounded translating to reduced payments that people make on e-commerce platforms through the companys offerings Additionally the companys unbranded businesses led by payment processing have remained resilient However the same cannot be said about branded businesses led by Venmo that face intense competition from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) among others A shift in the companys payment volume into lower-margin channels is also a serious concern While PayPal remains a leader in digital payments its long-term outlook remains threatened as tech juggernauts look to encroach on its niche market Apple and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) are the two tech heavyweights that threaten to disrupt the companys fortunes on mobile payments which continues to send jitters throughout the investment community Following the past years underperformance CEO Alex Chriss has set outlined a strategic plan to make the company leaner as one of the ways to fuel profitable growth Nevertheless he has warned that it could take some time before some of the initiatives bear fruit and move the needle as depicted by the companys flat growth forecast on adjusted profit for the current year Even though the company delivered solid fourth-quarter results the stock fell by almost 10% as the market reacted to 2024 guidance The full-year outlook further underlined the problems the fintech giant faces even as it strives to chart a new path Revenue increased 9% to $8 billion for the quarter beating consensus estimates of $733 billion The increase came as the company recorded a 15% increase in total payment volume which peaked at $40980 billion Source: PayPal The bottom line came in better than expected at $148 a share representing a 19% year-over-year increase and was better than consensus estimates of $127 Even though the company delivered earnings growth in the fourth quarter it is no longer growing at the high rates it did at the height of the pandemic Nevertheless a 2% decline in active accounts to 426 million underlines weakness in the underlying business as PayPal faces stiff competition on digital payments It marked the fourth consecutive quarter of account losses for the company signaling the impact of other digital payment services Growth is mainly fueled by the unbranded business units that handle transactions with merchants that come with low profit margins While the total payment volume in unbranded business units grew by 30% year over year the company generated less earnings The branded segment is the bread and butter of the entire business as fees range between 249% and 349% The low payment costs at stake also translate to high margins The higher rates generated by the branded business units are reasonable as they generate additional revenue for the same business According to Craig Maurer of Financial Technology Partners PayPal needs to generate about $10 of unbranded checkout volume to generate the same margin dollar as $1 volume with branded payments Source: PayPal Additionally Venmo boasts a robust network of more than 35 million merchants The platform which allows people to send and receive money through peer-to-peer technology has started allowing users to hold money in their accounts The decision is expected to positively impact the total payment volume that the service handles which has been increasing since 2017 The increase can be attributed to Venmo allowing people to send money online for free The service has since become a hit with people who do not carry cash like students and teens The service makes money through a 290% transaction fee for businesses and a 1% fee for users who want to withdraw money installed into a linked card Source: Statista Nevertheless a shift in growth drivers to less lucrative operations could put more pressure on the companys operating margin During the earnings call PayPal told analysts it expects flat transaction margin dollars in 2024 relative to last year If profit margins are to improve PayPal will have to earn more whenever customers click on its branded services such as the Venmo button to make payments The branded checkout payment volume was up by 650% in the fourth quarter Compared to the unbranded business unit the much-subdued growth can be attributed to stiff competition from offerings by Apple Pay Google Pay Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Further indication that a decline in business accounts is a concern is the companys disappointing full-year guidance The guidance has overshadowed the market-beating earnings signaling the company might have to tweak its operations to bounce to high growth levels Like any innovative fintech company PayPal is already looking to address the issues that have triggered a significant contraction in its operating margins It is also trying to address its competitive threat as tech giants push for market share in the lucrative digital payments landscape The new management seeks to turn the company into a leaner entity pursuing profitable growth The plan is already underway with the company announcing plans to cut about 2500 jobs or 9% of its global workforce as part of a plan that targets up to $900 million in cost savings that should significantly impact its operating margin The results of the restructuring are already visible with the operating income margin in the fourth quarter improving to 2330% If inflation continues to drop consumer spending is expected to improve increasing the total payment volume it handles and boosting income margins The layoffs come as the company seeks to focus more on efficiency and deploy automation The digital technology company is also consolidating its technology as it looks to reduce complexity and duplication which should reduce its labor force costs and strengthen profit margins Amidst the cut the company will continue to invest in areas likely to create and accelerate growth Consequently the digital payment company has affirmed its push into artificial intelligence as it looks to unveil new products and solutions capable of enhancing efficiency and competitive edge One of the new AI-powered features the company is launching will help ensure a faster checkout experience It is also making it possible for customers to enjoy AI-powered merchant recommendations In addition to the AI push regulatory winds are blowing in favor of PayPal Amid regulatory pressure Apple has agreed to open the tap-to-pay functionality to third parties The move opens the door for PayPal to be one of the tap-to-pay applications on iOS devices Consequently the company is working on a new consumer app to exploit the new EU regulation Integrating PayPal services into Apple Wallet should translate into big business for the company in terms of payments and transactions through iOS devices PayPal is also aggressively offloading its credit risk as it looks to free up more cash that can be used to return cash to shareholders The signing of a deal with private equity firm KKR (NYSE:KKR) to purchase up to $43 billion of the buy-now-pay-later loans (BNPL) in Europe is part of the strategic plan to bolster cash reserves BNPL was a hit at the height of the pandemic as it allowed the payment giant to attract millennial and gen Z consumers to its platform Nevertheless their fortunes have turned sour in recent years especially with rising interest rates and runaway inflation dampening customers purchasing power The closing of the BNPL deal with KKR is expected to free up close to $1 billion which PayPal will redirect to share buybacks In addition given the uncertainty about whether customers will clear the loans the KKR deal removes an element of risk from its books While PayPal has underperformed over the past year going by the 22% slide it is not necessarily on the wrong track Total payment volume a key metric in the payment sector is growing at an impressive double-digit rate which underlines the companys core business that is growing at a solid pace In addition the company continues to deliver operating income margin improvements signaling its cost-cutting initiatives are bearing fruit This article first appeared on GuruFocus Related Quotes"

announced its first-ever dividend while Amazon posted strong earnings However Apple reported a sales slowdown in its key China market These three tech companies are part of the so-called Magnificent Seven and have been driving a market resurgence However layoffs in the sector have recently caused optimism to cool down Coming to the results Apple announced its first revenue gain in over a year though the company continues to grapple with a decline in global smartphone demand The California-based company posted $11958 billion in revenue and $218 in earnings per share (EPS) beating Wall Street expectations of $11791 billion in full-year revenue and $210 in EPS This 2 percent growth in sales is a positive sign for the tech giant as it breaks the companys four-quarter streak of declining revenue However the companys shares dropped in after-hours trading Despite the revenue growth Apples sales in China its third-largest market dropped from $239 billion to $208 billion The company also saw a decline in global iPad sales which dropped to $7 billion in the most recent quarter from $9 billion in the same quarter last year On a more positive note Apples iPhone sales increased to $697 billion in the three months ending in December 2023 up from $658 billion year-over-year However this news was dampened by the recent prediction by prominent analyst Ming-Chi Kuo who forecasted that Apples iPhone shipments would decrease by 15 percent year-over-year due in part to a sizable drop in iPhone sales in China Despite the challenges Apples services business maintained its growth with the company posting $231 billion in revenue up from $208 billion in services revenue the previous year However Microsoft overtook Apple as the worlds most valuable company in January hitting a $3 trillion valuation while Apples market capitalisation slipped Meta exceeded expectations with its fourth-quarter earnings report released on Thursday revealing an impressive 25 percent increase in revenue from $322 billion to $403 billion This marks the fastest rate of growth in any period since mid-2021 and is largely attributed to the rebounding online ad market according to a CNBC report Additionally the companys cost-cutting measures led to an 8 percent decrease in expenses year over year and an operating margin that more than doubled to 41 percent indicating increased profitability Compared to the previous year Metas net income increased more than threefold from $465 billion to $14 billion with earnings per share growing from $176 to $533 In a first for the company

expected to grow between 8 percent and 13 percent reaching between $138 billion and $1435 billion This is higher than analysts estimates of $1421 billion CNBC states Amazon Web Services the companys cloud computing division saw sales climb 13 percent in the fourth quarter to $242 billion in line with Wall Streets forecast However it was a deceleration from the year-ago period when sales grew 20 percent On the other hand Amazons advertising unit saw impressive growth with sales increasing by 27 percent year over year to $147 billion The company has started showing ads on Prime Video content which analysts predict will generate significant new revenue for the business Wall Street Reaction Meta Platforms and Amazoncom saw a combined increase of $280 billion in their stock market value on Thursday after reporting their quarterly results Apples market value decreased by $70 billion following its results Amazons stock rose by 8 percent as the company exceeded expectations for December-quarter revenue growth due to strong online spending during the holiday shopping season This brought the online shopping and cloud-computing giants market capitalization to $178 trillion Metas shares rose by over 14 percent to a record high of $451 increasing its market capitalisation by $148 billion to $116 trillion This came after the social media giant announced its first-ever dividend Despite dividends being typically associated with mature slow-growth companies Meta delivered a 25 percent increase in revenue reaching $401 billion in the December quarter thanks to strong advertising and device sales Apples quarterly results were better than expected but the companys sales in China fell short of estimates which caused its stock to fall by 33 percent Apple faces tough

While many entertainment companies are taking a wait-and-see approach to Apple‚Äôs new Vision Pro spatial computing headset The Walt Disney Company has been on board from day one When Apple first unveiled the $3500 vr/ar/mr headset last June Disney was introduced as a key launch partner that would have an app ready for the device‚Äôs launch ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre constantly in search of new ways to entertain inform and inspire our fans by combining extraordinary creativity with groundbreaking technology to create truly remarkable experiences‚Äù Disney CEO Bob Iger said at the time ‚ÄúWe believe Apple Vision Pro is a revolutionary platform that can make our vision a reality‚Äù An article in Fast Company offers new insights into the Disney Company‚Äôs firm commitment to Apple‚Äôs tech which officially launched this past Friday It quotes Disney Entertainment & ESPN president and chief technology officer Aaron LaBerge who describes Disney‚Äôs interest in the following way: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre a storytelling company and this is a platform that allows us to tell stories in a different way That‚Äôs why we were so excited about it‚Äù At this early juncture Disney hasn‚Äôt yet begun to tell any stories that are native to the Vision Pro Rather it has ported a version of its Disney+ streaming service to the headset The Vision Pro version of Disney+ offers a series of 3d environmental skins allowing users of the service to view films while for example on the scare floor of Monsters Inc or in the Avengers Tower It‚Äôs a slick gimmick that is perhaps best explained by watching a video of someone exploring the interface: More ambitious projects are in the works Disney is tight-lipped about what specifically it has planned for the Vision Pro with the exception of a single project that the company announced last year: an app based on Marvel‚Äôs animated What If‚Ä¶? series According to Disney exec LaBerge though this is only the beginning: This product has touched every part of our company from the studios to the teams that manage our streaming services to our mobile developers Even our teams at the parks have been involved in the things that we‚Äôre doing Even more boldly LaBerge claims that the Apple Vision Pro is ‚Äúgoing to change our entire production and post-production pipeline It‚Äôs going to change how we make content how we operate our environments It‚Äôs a big deal‚Äù Time will tell whether Disney‚Äôs foray into ar/vr/mr is successful or it flops like the company‚Äôs now-shuttered metaverse division And a lot of Disney‚Äôs future in this space is actually out of the company‚Äôs hands; rather it will be determined by Apple‚Äôs ability to turn the Vision Pro from a piece of novelty tech into an affordable and functional mass-consumer product Should that happen there could be plenty of success stories from Disney and others Amid Amidi is Cartoon Brews Publisher and Editor-at-large By Cartoon Brew Connect 4 months ago By Cartoon Brew Connect 3 months ago By Cartoon Brew Connect 4 months ago By Jamie Lang 14 mins ago By Jamie Lang 22 hours ago By Jamie Lang 1 day ago By Jamie Lang 4 days ago By Jamie Lang 4 days ago By Jamie Lang 5 days ago By Joe Fordham 5 days ago By Jamie Lang 5 days ago By Jamie Lang 6 days ago By Jamie Lang 6 days ago By Jamie Lang 7 days ago By Jamie Lang 1 week ago"
221,"Apples Earnings Show Its Steady State Weakness (NASDAQ:AAPL)","2/5/2024","https://seekingalpha.com/article/4667506-apples-earnings-show-its-steady-state-weakness","ozgurdonmaz Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) announced its earnings with a small dip after hours Given the much larger volatility seen with the earnings of other technology stocks one might assume that the earnings were middle of the road However as well see throughout this article the companys earnings indicate some fundamental weakness that will hurt shareholder returns The company saw net sales in the most recent quarter increase by roughly 15% That was less than YoY inflation Apple Investor Relations The companys revenue growth also came almost completely from services which has double-digit revenue increase Product sales remained roughly flat Thats concerning because of some risks in the services business that well discuss before Overall its clear above that the companys product growth has mostly flatlined While people are excited about the Vision Pro and initial indications are positive that is an independent growth sector Whether or not it grows remains to be seen However as we can see from the graph below even if it becomes as big as the Mac or the iPad it will give the company ~6% revenue growth Apple Investor Relations The above shows the companys segment performance Europe especially was a bright spot in the companys portfolio along with Japan however the companys Greater China impact was clear With the iPhone being restricted in China and revenue declining there the company needs to make it up elsewhere The companys latest iPhone also improved YoY The companys iPad revenue declined substantially but thats not surprising given that the company launched no additional iPads in 2023 That means that the companys true environment iPad revenue once new ones come out could be more like ~$121 billion in annual revenue with 34% inflation in 2023 that means the company still barely lined up with inflation The companys cash flow shows what well discuss as its longer term conundrum Apple Investor Relations The companys operating expenditures increased very modestly but the company maintained strong operating income as it increased its margins The companys net income was just a hair under $34 billion representing double-digit YoY increase A big part of this is the company cut cost of sales by $2 billion which went straight into its bottom line That cash flow $34 billion in net income for the quarter is the companys traditionally strongest quarter of the year Given the companys $29 trillion market cap the companys annualized net income is just under $100 billion Thats an earnings yield of ~35% At the end of this the question is how can the company continue to provide shareholder returns The company effectively uses the entirety of its cash flow to pay its dividend and repurchase shares The company has a dividend yield of just over 05% which costs the company almost $15 billion on the annualized basis Effectively the remaining $85 billion goes entirely to share buybacks The companys outstanding share count decreased by 380 million YoY The companys total share buybacks for the year were roughly $78 billion Thats more than 90% of the companys remaining FCF The companys average price per share was ~$205 but thats because of continued dilution from employee compensation (>$10 billion annually) That means ~13% of the companys annualized share price repurchases goes to employee compensation Those share repurchases help the company over time but they are slow Long-term with minimal profit growth we dont see the company as having a path to go past 3-4% in annualized share returns Thats lower than the 30-year treasury yield That higher yield with lower risk is worth paying close attention to The company has a number of major risks given its current valuation The first is the pressure to open up the app store Services has continued to be a bright spot in the companys portfolio and the company has resisted pressure to cut margins Thats led to a variety of different lawsuits Being forced to open the app store could lead to a dramatic reduction in margins in whats the companys growth sector Google also pays Apple 36% of Safari search engine revenue That paid revenue is also facing lawsuits over arguments the payment in the $10s of billions annually has incentivized Apple not to develop its own search engine Legal pressures to not continue that payment depending on the outcome of the lawsuit could cost Apple a large % of its profits The second is the US - China trade war The US has been increasing the pressure on China and its been working However unfortunately while the iPhone is a cool piece of technology its not an essential piece of replaceable technology Apple remains a major company and employer in China but the Chinese government is already looking to pressure iPhone sales Given the YoY performance in Chinese sales above one of the companys biggest growth areas is clearly in trouble Weak Chinese economic performance is also worth paying close attention to These risks are worth paying close attention to given the companys lofty valuation which could significantly impact returns Apple is a great company and one of the most profitable companies in the world The company runs a streamlined operation where the profits of its massive brand go to the pockets of shareholders directly Its adept at continuously repurchasing shares and paying out its modest dividend but growth in both of those is minimal With minimal growth and substantial risks we dont see Apples shareholder returns increasing past its 3-4% yield anytime soon That makes the company a poor investment that will lag the S&P 500 Overall that makes Apple stock a poor long-term investment Let us know your thoughts in the comments below The Retirement Forum provides actionable ideals a high-yield safe retirement portfolio and macroeconomic outlooks all to help you maximize your capital and your income We search the entire market to help you maximize returns Recommendations from a top 02% TipRanks author!

According to a new report by the information Apple has at least two active prototypes of foldable phones Yahoo Finances Dan Howley joins us now with more So active prototypes what does that mean? DAN HOWLEY: It means a few things It means that they are interested in this kind of technology Its something that other competitors have out there We have Samsung and Google with flip phones right now Theres a bunch in China And I think thats really where the kind of interest lies especially for Apple Youre seeing more consumers in China pick up foldable phones Theyre advanced They have better capabilities Theyre also pretty darn cool right? I mean Ive used them a couple of times and theyre fun So I think what Apple is trying to do here is kind of what Apple does keep up with the Joneses as far as whats popular and then add its own spin on it provide its own capabilities The big thing here though is its a prototype it does not mean that one is coming Apple like every other company develops prototypes and then shelves them forever They go in that little box from-- was it Raiders of the Lost Ark I think and just sits in a warehouse somewhere forever So it doesnt necessarily mean were going to get one but the prospect its looking a little more promising Though according to this report it wouldnt happen anytime in the next year or so JOSH LIPTON: And some people they might be asking what could they do with a flip phone that they couldnt do with this? DAN HOWLEY: Right so thats a good idea-- a good question The idea is that this is a large phone right? Wheres my iPhone? I have the 15 Pro Max so its a big boy-- JOSH LIPTON: Yeah DAN HOWLEY: --kind of chunky The idea would be OK well I dont want this big screen or I want a bigger screen than this I can just fold it in half and then just drop it in my pocket and there you go With Samsung they have the Z Flip and the Z Fold The Z Flip-- this right here is the Z Fold where it kind of opens like a book The Z Flip is one that opens like a clam-shell And so the clam-shell design Im going to be honest is awesome I love it You can like unfold it halfway and then let it sit on its own and prop itself up and then take selfies Its also incredible to slap that thing shut when youre ending a phone call even if youre not mad at someone just to be feel like youre like-- JULIE HYMAN: Satisfying finality of ending the call DAN HOWLEY: Bam! JULIE HYMAN: So Dan obviously you have had experience with it For viewers who are not familiar Dan went to South Korea got to see how the flip phone was made got to test it out How is that thing selling for Samsung? DAN HOWLEY: For Samsung theyre selling surprisingly well They are more expensive than most phones right? So the Z Fold is the most expensive Thats the Fold right there The Flip is less expensive around $1000 I believe the Fold is $1800 around there So its a spicy meatball as I guess someone would say JULIE HYMAN: Yes you just did DAN HOWLEY: Yeah JULIE HYMAN: I have to say I was on the train yesterday and I was watching a show on my regular sized iPhone And the guy next to me pulled out like an iPad or something and I thought huh that would be nice to watch something on a bigger screen but I dont want to carry around the iPad JOSH LIPTON: Yeah there you go DAN HOWLEY: And thats the exact point there JOSH LIPTON: Thats it DAN HOWLEY: So I mean you get the bigger screen you get the better styling because it does look really nice And theres more functionality to it So I think if Apple can do it they will I just dont think theyre going to release something thats frankly kind of bulky when its folded up like Samsungs devices JOSH LIPTON: Yeah you can see it though higher price medium margins China DAN HOWLEY: I mean thats the big thing I think is for them is for China JOSH LIPTON: Yeah makes sense Dan thank you as always for joining us Related Quotes"

help with equipment safety checks while reducing the time workers need to spend on training he said claiming Rokid already has more than 60% market share in industries such as energy in China Zhu said

an affiliate commission Learn more New iPad models arent given simple numbers like the iPhone which makes things a lot more confusing when talking about new and old iPads You might be wondering what the latest option is between the iPad Pro Air and Mini models and how to distinguish between different generations Were here to break it down for you Currently Apple officially sells six different iPads listed here from newest to oldest: It can be difficult to determine which iPad makes the most sense for your needs as many features and specs can overlap But its important to understand the differences especially if you want to make sure youre choosing the proper model when considering the best iPad Pro cases best iPad Air cases or best iPad cases Read on for a full breakdown of every model or check out our guide to the best iPads for more details Apples most premium tablet got a minor update in October 2022 with the sixth-generation 129-inch iPad Pro and fourth-generation 11-inch iPad Pro The 129-inch Pro is the largest tablet in Apples lineup and the only iPad to use Apples mini-LED display that boasts improved brightness and contrast Among the updates from 2022 was Apples computer-grade M2 processor also in the 2022 MacBook Air and support for the new Hover feature with the second-generation Apple Pencil which offers better accuracy and new interactions Both tablets include optional 5G connectivity with support for mmWave 5G networks Thunderbolt 4 USB-C ports Face ID high-refresh-rate 120Hz ProMotion displays dual-lens cameras and a Center Stage feature that keeps the selfie camera centered on the subject despite movement Taken together these changes make Apples iPad Pro tablets more powerful and tailored for productivity than ever before But theyre still best suited for professional creatives and multimedia editors since multitasking for most other work is still easier on a desktop operating system like macOS or Windows Read our full iPad Pro (2022) review Apple released the 10th-generation iPad in October 2022 It starts at $449 a significantly higher price than the ninth-generation iPad thats still available for $329 The 10th-gen iPad adopts Apples modern design language with slim bezels around a larger 109-inch screen and it can be easily mistaken for the fifth-gen iPad Air at a glance It has a USB-C port instead of Lightning The Touch ID sensor is now integrated into the power button and the rear camera sees an upgrade from 8 megapixels to 12 megapixels But the best upgrade is that the ultra-wide FaceTime camera has been repositioned in the landscape position for a better angle of yourself during video calls In terms of power the 10th-gen iPad uses Apples A14 Bionic chip the same processor as the iPhone 12 Its worth noting that this new version of Apples basic iPad only supports the first-generation Apple Pencil which requires an adapter to charge The 10th-gen iPad also supports mouse input and a Magic Keyboard Folio designed exclusively for it Despite its positives and the fact that its an exceptional tablet the 10th-gen iPads $449 price tag makes it a hard tablet to recommend when the $329 ninth-gen iPad is still in the lineup Read our full 10th-generation iPad review While the 2022 basic iPad is powerful the 2022 iPad Air released in March 2022 steps it up a notch with Apples computer-grade M1 processor that also powers the 2020 13-inch MacBook Air Mac Mini and 24-inch iMac Thats a significant bump in power compared to the A14 Bionic processor in the fourth-gen iPad Air In terms of design the fifth-gen iPad Air shares many similarities with its predecessor with the same 109-inch screen USB-C port and Touch ID integrated into the power button The front camera was upgraded to 12 megapixels with support for Center Stage which automatically focuses the camera on you while you move around during a video call Other upgrades include 5G connectivity in the WiFi + Cellular models and an enhanced USB-C port for faster transfer of big files between the iPad Air and storage devices Starting at $599 Apples iPad Air sits in the current lineup as a step up from the basic iPad and iPad Mini and a worthy alternative to the iPad Pro Read our full fifth-generation iPad Air review While a new entry-level iPad is available we think the 2021 ninth-generation iPad is still a great tablet for most people At its $329 starting price its currently the most affordable iPad you can buy With a 102-inch touchscreen and A13 Bionic chip the ninth-gen iPad offers enough power to get you through your basic needs However you may want to upgrade to the 256GB model for a bit more storage space if youre planning on using the iPad to download many videos store many pictures or play many games Like the 10th-gen iPad the ninth-gen iPad supports the first-gen Apple Pencil but it doesnt require an adapter as it can plug right into the iPads Lightning port to recharge The ultra-wide FaceTime camera supports the Center Stage feature that follows you as you move around on video calls or when recording a video but its in portrait position The display also has Apples True Tone feature that automatically adjusts the screen to the color temperature of the room youre in Read our full ninth-generation iPad review The most recent iPad Mini model is the sixth-generation iPad Mini which Apple released in September 2021 Starting at $499 the 2021 iPad Mini sits among more premium models like the iPad Air If youre looking for the perfect balance between portability and performance the iPad Air could be calling your name The 2021 iPad Mini marks a total redesign over previous generations making for a look thats closer to the iPad Air with narrower borders The 2021 iPad Mini features a larger 83-inch Liquid Retina touch display with True Tone color technology versus the 79-inch screens of previous generations Apples A15 Bionic processor thats running the iPhone 13 series is also present and storage is available in 64GB or 256GB The latest iPad Mini supports the second-generation Apple Pencil a USB-C port for charging and connecting accessories an ultra-wide FaceTime

GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with MSFT As of 2024-01-22 Apple Incs intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $14820 Its currently trading at a price of $19157 Therefore the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -2926% The company is fair valued The GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage In the growth stage the company is experiencing faster growth while in the terminal stage a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run Apple Incs intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps Term Value Explanation EPS without NRI $612 GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow Discount Rate 11% An appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 411% rounded up to the nearest whole number which is 5% A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate Growth Stage Growth rate (g1) = 1620% Years of Growth Stage = 10 We choose the growth rate based on the availability prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10 5 or 3 years in that order and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate The default growth period is set to 10 years Terminal Stage Growth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10 For the terminal stage the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation Growth Stage = EPS without NRI * [ (1 + g1) / (1 + d) * (1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2 + + (1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ] = 7941 Terminal Stage = EPS without NRI * (1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 * [ (1 + g2) / (1 + d) + (1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2 + + (1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ] = 688 Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based) = Growth Stage + Terminal Stage = 14820 GuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $13238 This valuation indicates that the Apple Inc is modestly overvalued accompanied by a margin of safety of -4471% You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page Please note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model: Future Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings Embracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role All else being equal a company with rapid growth will have a higher value Predictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance For companies with unpredictable performance such as cyclical companies the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized Discount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate Using the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based) To identify undervalued predictable companies focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based) This article generated by GuruFocus is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice Our commentary is rooted in historical data and analyst projections utilizing an impartial methodology and is not intended to serve as specific investment guidance It does not formulate a recommendation to purchase or divest any stock and does not consider individual investment objectives or financial circumstances Our objective is to deliver long-term fundamental data-driven analysis Be aware that our analysis might not incorporate the most recent price-sensitive company announcements or qualitative information GuruFocus holds no position in the stocks mentioned herein This article first appeared on GuruFocus Related Quotes"

Value Income Strategy made the following comment about AT&T Inc (NYSE:T) in its Q3 2023 investor letter: ‚ÄúOur third-largest holding at quarter end was AT&T Inc (NYSE:T) a leading provider of communications and connectivity services in the US At $15/share the stock trades at the same price it did almost thirty years ago The share price is much less interesting to us in relation to where it has traded in the past than in relation to how much cash the company generates and what management is doing with it At just over 6x earnings the stock trades near its lowest price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple ever also representing close to its largest-ever P/E discount to the stock market The business converts most of its earnings to free cash flow implying a forward free cash flow yield north of 15% Just under half of free cash flow is going toward the dividend (75% yield) while much of the balance is going to debt paydown In other words if the stock does not fall below its lowest-ever valuation investors clip a rock-solid 75% in cash while owning a growing portion of a very steady business as management reduces debt outstanding A discounted cash flow model will suggest that intrinsic value for shares begins with a ‚Äú2‚Äù suggesting the stock is undervalued on an absolute basis The lack of volatility in the underlying fundamentals also makes it unique when compared to many other things we own which reduces the probability of permanent capital impairment and argues for a significant weight in the portfolio AT&T looks particularly attractive when compared to some of the larger names dominating the S&P 500 Compare the stock to Apple for instance whose revenues and profits are likely to shrink this year even as it trades at 29x this year‚Äôs earnings estimate The ongoing return to rationality and capital accountability along with extreme valuations in the megacap tech stocks have us more excited about our portfolio‚Äôs prospects than we can remember for quite

(NASDAQ:INTC) ‚Äì New Long: This is not a traditional long for Upslope in any sense Intel is outside of the box in terms of typical sector and market cap focus and the position is really a portfolio

253,"Apple Stock: Poised To Continue Disrupting Our Lifestyles (NASDAQ:AAPL)","2/10/2024","https://seekingalpha.com/article/4669245-apple-poised-to-continue-disrupting-our-lifestyles","Nikada/iStock Unreleased via Getty Images Nikada/iStock Unreleased via Getty Images In 2024 Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) lost its number one position as the worlds most valuable public company to Microsoft (MSFT) Apple has maintained its status as the worlds largest public company for an extended period and my fundamental analysis indicates that this accolade is well-deserved Reclaiming the top spot may simply be a matter of time My optimism regarding Apple stems from its expansive ecosystem boasting over 15 billion users and unparalleled brand loyalty which provides a solid strategic foundation for growth While it is highly likely that iPhone sales growth will naturally decelerate due to market saturation Services emerge as a standout performer with exceptional growth prospects Moreover the recent release of the groundbreaking Vision Pro device has the potential to revolutionize both professional and entertainment domains reminiscent of the impact the iPhone had in 2007-2008 Valuation also plays a pivotal role in my investment decisions and my analysis suggests that AAPL is attractively valued With these strengths in mind I firmly believe that AAPL merits a Strong Buy rating Apple is one of the worlds largest companies that manufactures and sells smartphones tablets PCs software and peripherals across the world According to Apples latest quarterly earnings the iPhone represented 58% of the companys total sales Apples 10-Q report Apples 10-Q report The latest quarterly report was released on February 1 The December quarter was robust for Apple as the company topped consensus estimates and delivered a 21% YoY revenue growth and profitability improvement despite the soft microenvironment which is evidenced by a disappointing recent Q4 report from Samsung Electronics (OTCPK:SSNLF) one of Apples biggest rivals From the products perspective the iPad and wearables/accessories were in line with the soft environment but the strength demonstrated by the iPhone mitigated the dip in other products After several weak quarters the smartphone market demonstrated a solid 8% rebound in Q4 which was a notable tailwind for Apple Given the extensive coverage of the iPhone across the internet I wont delve into exhaustive details here However its important to highlight the significant rebound in the smartphone market which marks a notable shift from the negative trend observed in previous quarters With penetration levels already relatively high I anticipate steady growth to persist for this product Moreover considering the substantial portion of revenue derived from the iPhone I foresee it maintaining Apples exceptional profitability well into the foreseeable future SA SA It is important to remember that Apple is not only about selling physical products but its second-largest revenue stream is services which includes revenues from payment services subscriptions and advertising income There are around 15 billion active iPhones in the world at the moment so there is a vast target audience for Apples Services revenue stream I think this line of business will likely become the primary growth catalyst in the foreseeable future The massive growth dynamics back my confidence in this stream in recent years statistacom statistacom The enormous customer base for Services is not the only factor that will highly likely help the line of business rapid expansion in the next few years Apples brands strength is intact which we see from data suggesting that Apples ecosystem has a staggering 79% customer loyalty and a customer retention rate of 90% Such high brand loyalty allows Apple to introduce sharp service fee increases which seem not to affect its brands power at all Apart from existing services the rapidly expanding adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities provides more room for Apple to introduce new offerings to customers based on the subscription model I am optimistic about Apples potential for significant growth in service revenue driven by several solid factors Firstly the company boasts a massive cash cow in the form of the iPhone Secondly Apple has a strong track record of innovation and substantial financial resources enabling heavy investment in internal R&D and strategic acquisitions of innovative startups-reportedly acquiring 32 AI startups in 2023 alone These investments in AI suggest a high likelihood of Apple introducing new groundbreaking AI-powered features potentially offered through a subscription model Furthermore with approximately 15 billion active iPhones globally Apple possesses vast volumes of data a valuable asset for training its machine learning (ML) algorithms This data can ultimately enhance the quality of AI and ML services offered by the company Yahoo Finance Yahoo Finance I like to look at the companys future prospects through the prism of the BCG matrix As I mentioned the iPhone itself is an apparent cash cow because of its high market share high profitability and highly likely decelerating growth rates in next years as smartphone penetration levels increase The vast opportunity to drive service growth due to the iPhones extensive adoption brings a massive synergetic effect which will highly likely make Service the major star of Apple in the next couple of years BCG BCG With all due respect the Mac iPad or wearables are unlikely to become the new stars as these products did not demonstrate resilience to cyclicality like the iPhones and Services did But the companys brand new Vision Pro device which was officially released just recently has a chance to become a star over the long term A few days after its official release the Vision Pro is an apparent question mark with all the initial hype caused primarily by the power of Apples brand The future success after the hype cools down will depend on the true value for customers from this product I am not a virtual reality expert nor did I have an opportunity to test the device by myself but some reviews look very impressive and give the firm feeling that Vision Pro indeed provides an unmatched experience and can be a true technological disruptor both for entertainment and professional settings Naturally skepticism surrounds the devices hefty $3500 price tag and concerns about comfort while wearing it However its worth recalling how iconic figures like Steve Ballmer scoffed at the iPhones $500 starting price and lack of a physical keyboard back in 2007 The subsequent success of the iPhone speaks volumes demonstrating the potential for groundbreaking innovations to overcome initial doubts and reshape entire industries Therefore I believe that there is a significant probability that Vision Pro might become a true game changer and supercharge Apples long-term growth prospects like the iPhone did more than 15 years ago Apple has been the worlds most valuable company with a market cap of around $3 trillion for a long time and just recently lost its leadership to Microsoft The controversy around the Magnificent 7 overvaluation seems like a hot topic any time; try to type into your search engine Magnificent seven bubble and you will find dozens of fresh articles explaining why the US bit tech companies valuations are about to burst I want to emphasize that there was an article from Clem Chambers calling Apple stock a bubble in April 2012 almost twelve years ago At that time Apples market cap was around $500 billion ie the market cap nearly sextupled despite black swans like the one-in-a-century pandemic or the biggest war in the middle of Europe since WWII macrotrendsnet macrotrendsnet Therefore to determine the attractiveness of Apples valuation I prefer to rely on the discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation model instead of hot headlines I use a 9% WACC for discounting and a 6% constant growth rate for the terminal value (TV) calculation The constant growth rate is always a controversial metric and some readers might call me too optimistic when I give AAPL a 6% constant growth rate On the other hand over the last 20 years Apples revenue grew from $8 billion to $383 billion which equals a 21% CAGR In this context a 6% constant growth rate looks conservative and fair I use a TTM 224% levered free cash flow (FCF) margin and forecast a 50 basis points annual expansion As usual I rely on consensus revenue estimates only for the two upcoming fiscal years and forecast a 6% revenue growth rate for years beyond which aligns with my constant growth rate assumption There are currently around 156 billion AAPL shares outstanding Calculated by the author Calculated by the author Based on my DCF calculations AAPLs fair price is $218 which is 15% higher than the current market price Therefore the stock is very attractively valued especially given the companys unparalleled brand and customer ecosystem loyalty As we have seen in the fundamental analysis having most of the revenue generated from the iPhone is a highly profitable business That said this industry is very attractive to other advanced consumer electronics companies and highly competitive Apart from Apple the global smartphone industry is crowded with several large Asian manufacturers Samsung has been consistently leading in terms of market share but on the chart below we can also see that players like Xiaomi (OTCPK:XIACF) and Oppo also hold market shares that are not so far below Apple The competition is intense and Apple must consistently be at the forefront of innovation to protect its market share Counterpoint Counterpoint Samsungs flagship Galaxy S-series smartphone has been the major direct competitor of the iPhone for a long time and consistently rolls out new innovative features For example the company recently introduced its Galaxy S24 model which features generative AI capabilities the iPhone does not have yet With that in mind its crucial to recognize that the iPhone is engaged in a continuous technological race with its competitors leaving no margin for error in such a fiercely competitive landscape Hence I would identify competition risk as the most significant concern for Apple particularly given the companys heavy reliance on profits from the smartphone segment While the recent release of Apples Vision Pro holds promise and in my view has the potential to revolutionize an entire industry I perceive a significant risk associated with it I believe this groundbreaking device could render tablets and laptops obsolete thereby cannibalizing Apples revenues from the iPad and Mac Essentially while the company may unlock a notable new revenue stream it could come at the expense of two existing ones potentially offsetting the overall impact Upon reviewing the official description of the new product it appears that its capabilities overlap with those offered by tablets and laptops While the spatial computing experience will certainly offer a fresh and innovative experience for consumers its difficult to imagine the necessity for a laptop or tablet when one already owns a device capable of performing similar tasks but with features emblematic of an entirely new digital era To me Apple appears to be an obvious Strong Buy due to its promising future growth and innovation prospects expected to be driven by its considerable accumulated financial resources the ongoing success of its cash cow the iPhone and the vast potential of its services business Additionally the stock is currently trading at a notable discount which further bolsters my optimism as an investor offering the potential for greater capital appreciation This article was written by Analyst‚Äôs Disclosure: I/we have a beneficial long position in the shares of AAPL either through stock ownership options or other derivatives I wrote this

257,"None","2/14/2024","https://www.pocket-lint.com/apple-watch-series-9-us-ban-explained/","What Apples ITC ban means for current Apple Watch owners and how we got here The once unthinkable has occurred: Apple is banned from selling not one but two different products over a patent dispute that dates back more than a decade Since Jan 17 2024 the company has sold modified versions of the Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 in the US that do not feature the blood oxygen monitoring functionality those wearables previously included How did we get here what happens next and what does it all mean if you own a Watch Series 9 or Watch Ultra 2? This guide will attempt to answer those questions This particular legal saga dates back to 2013 with the release of the Apple Watch Series 6 in 2020 representing a flashpoint Two years before it announced the original Apple Watch in 2015 Masimo a medical device maker based out of Irvine Calif alleges Apple asked for a meeting the company said would help it to understand more about Masimos technology to potentially integrate that technology into Apple‚Äôs products At the time Masimo was known for its pulse oximetry tech which many wearables use to measure SpO2 or blood oxygen saturation When Apple takes an interest in a company its the kiss of death First you get all excited Then you realize that the long-term plan is to do it themselves and take it all According to Masimo it left those discussions feeling they were productive However later that same year Apple began hiring some of the companys key talent offering them sizable salaries to bring their expertise to Cupertino Among the employees Masimo lost to Apple was its chief medical officer When Apple takes an interest in a company it‚Äôs the kiss of death Joe Kiani the founder and CEO of Masimo told The Wall Street Journal in 2023 First you get all excited Then you realize that the long-term plan is to do it themselves and take it all In fall 2020 Apple released the Watch Series 6 the first Apple Watch to feature a blood oxygen monitor Earlier in the year Masimo filed a complaint with the US District Court in Central California accusing the company of stealing trade secrets and infringing upon its pulse oximetry patents Apple subsequently counter-sued Masimo alleging the company had infringed on several Apple Watch patents with its W1 Medical Watch Patent litigation is a slow process and the original lawsuit from Masimo dragged on until May 2023 ending in a mistrial In search of more immediate relief tech companies will often turn to the US International Trade Commission (ITC) while they continue to litigate their patent disputes in court Thats what Sonos did when it accused Google in 2020 of infringing on its smart speaker patents and its also exactly what Masimo did In 2021 the company filed a complaint with the ITC urging the federal agency to block imports of the Apple Watch Series 6 At the start of 2023 a judge ruled in favor of Masimo finding that Apple had infringed on two of the companys pulse oximeter patents On Oct 26 2023 the ITC upheld the judges ruling and granted Masimos request for a complete ban on imports of Apple Watch Series 6 Series 7 Series 8 and Series 9 models The commission also ordered a stop to sales of Apple Watch units that were already in the country At the same time it sent the decision to the Biden administration for presidential review starting a 60-day process that ended on Dec 26 There was the possibility of President Joe Biden or the US Trade Representative vetoing the ITC decision thereby allowing Apple to avoid the import and sales ban but that did not happen After careful consultations Ambassador Katherine Tai decided not to reverse the ITC‚Äôs determination the ITC said on Dec 26 After the decision Apple stated: At Apple we work tirelessly to create products and services that meaningfully impact users lives It‚Äôs what drives our teams -- Clinical Design and Engineering -- to dedicate years to developing scientifically validated health fitness and wellness features for Apple Watch and we are inspired that millions of people around the world have benefited greatly from this product We strongly disagree with the USITC decision and resulting exclusion order and are taking all measures to return Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 to customers in the US as soon as possible On Dec 18 2023 Apple announced it was preparing to comply with the ITC order On Dec 21 the company stopped selling the Watch Series 9 and Watch Ultra 2 through its online store Before Apple won a temporary stay the companys website said those models were currently unavailable On Dec 24 both wearables were not available for purchase from the more than 270 retail locations the company operates across the US As expected Apple moved quickly to file an appeal with the ITC after the import ban went into effect on Dec 26 On the same day the company requested an emergency stay of the ban until at least Jan 13 2024 or the day US Customs and Border Protection was expected to decide if redesigned versions of the Watch Series 9 and Watch Ultra 2 no longer infringe on Masimos patents In court documents Apple claimed it would suffer irreparable harm if it could not sell those models during legal proceedings At a minimum the Court should grant a stay long enough for Customs to make this decision the company said One day later a US appeals court granted Apples request for a temporary stay of the ban The company then resumed selling the Watch Series 9 and Watch Ultra 2 until Jan 18 at 5pm ET Since then Apple has been able to skirt the ban after it submitted modified versions of the watches without the contested pulse oximetry technology to US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) The agency decided those variants fall outside the scope of the ITCs ruling If you bought an Apple Watch Series 9 or Watch Ultra 2 before the ban you can continue to use the blood oxygen monitoring features found on your wearable In a statement Apple shared with 9to5Mac the company said that the ongoing dispute would have no impact to Apple Watch units previously purchased that include the Blood Oxygen feature If you bought your Series 9 or Watch Ultra 2 before Jan 17 2024 you will want to do your best to avoid damaging it -- Apple Watch units replaced through the warranty service might not include blood oxygen monitoring On new units the blood monitoring app still comes pre-installed but launching the software displays a message that states that Sp02 tracking is no longer available The notification directs users to the iPhone Health app to learn more with a link to a support page on Apples website If you bought your Series 9 or Watch Ultra 2 before Jan 17 2024 you will want to do your best to avoid damaging it In one of his recent Power On newsletters Bloombergs Mark Gurman wrote that Apple told AppleCare reps Apple Watch units replaced through the warranty service might not include blood oxygen monitoring In a statement the company shared with The Verge Apple said it was pursuing a range of legal and technical options to ensure that Apple Watch is available to customers On Dec 18 Bloomberg reported the company was racing to make changes to algorithms on the device that measure a users blood oxygen level believing it could avoid a complicated hardware overhaul Before the CBP ruled Apple could resume selling modified versions of the Watch Series 9 and Watch Ultra 2 there were doubts a simple software update would be enough to bypass the ban If Apple cant find a long-term solution to the dispute it will limit the company‚Äôs ability to offer certain wellness and sleep-tracking features in the future Apple could license the infringed patents but the company does not appear interested in striking a deal with Kiani recently telling The New York Times Apple had not engaged in licensing negotiations Asked about the ban during a recent CNBC interview Apple CEO Tim Cook said the company was focused on appeal and that customers have lots of reasons to buy the watch even without the blood oxygen sensor Like the legal case that started all of this Apples

Hathaway (BRKB) trimmed its Apple (AAPL) stake in the fourth quarter added to positions in Chevron (CVX) and Occidental Petroleum (OXY) slashed holdings in HP (HPQ) and Paramount Global (PARA) and completely exited small bets on four other stocks Although the Apple move grabbed the most headlines the sales look more like an attempt to keep the iPhone makers weight in the Berkshire portfolio from getting too out of whack AAPL stock rallied more than 12% in the final three months of last year Berkshire responded by reducing its position by 1% or 10 million shares And yet even after lightening up Apple still accounts for 502% of Berkshires total portfolio value up from 50% three months ago Be a smarter better informed investor Profit and prosper with the best of expert advice on investing taxes retirement personal finance and more - straight to your e-mail Profit and prosper with the best of expert advice - straight to your e-mail Chairman and CEO Buffett is thought to manage about 90% of Berkshire Hathaways equity portfolio with co-portfolio managers Ted Weschler and Todd Combs handling the remainder Buffett who has called Apple Berkshires third business and its best business is thought to handle most of the firms Apple investments but its possible Weschler or Combs made the sales from their own smaller holdings Before we get into Berkshires other trades its important to note that Buffett has always run a highly concentrated portfolio Apple as noted above accounts for more than half the portfolio while Berkshires top five holdings comprise more than 80% The top 10 holdings account for 93% As for Buffetts latest moves on the buy side of the ledger he took advantage of weakness in the energy sector to add to two of his favorite oil stocks Shares in Chevron the only energy name among Dow Jones stocks spent much of Q4 trading below $150 a share Occidental Petroleum meanwhile spent a good chunk of December below $60 a share Buffett has tended in the past to pick up CVX and OXY when they slip below those respective levels so it shouldnt come as too much of a surprise that he added to both holdings in Q4 Berkshire upped its CVX stake by 144% or almost 16 million shares With 126 million shares worth $188 billion the energy major is BRKBs fifth largest holding at 54% of the portfolio (down from almost 6% three months ago) As for OXY Berkshire raised its stake by 87% or 196 million shares At 42% of the portfolio ‚Äì down from 46% three months ago ‚Äì OXY is Berkshires sixth largest position Lastly Berkshire quadrupled its ownership of Sirius XM Holdings (SIRI) However at 06% of the BRKB portfolio SIRI remains an immaterial position Berkshire initiated a small stake in John Malone-backed SIRI in the third quarter of 2023 (BRKB has owned SIRI before exiting a small stake back in 2021) On the sell side of Berkshires ledger things were a bit busier In addition to trimming Apple Buffett slashed BRKBs stake in HP by 78% Buffett initiated a commanding position in the PC and printer maker back in 2022 At the time HP looked like a classic Buffett value play but that didnt quite work out HPQ now comprises 02% of the BRKB portfolio Thats a sharp drop from 084% last quarter Elsewhere BRKB cut its stake in Paramount Global by a third PARA now accounts for just 027% of the portfolio down from 039% a quarter ago And finally in a series of exits BRKB completely sold out its positions in DR Horton (DHI) StoneCo (STNE) Markel (MKL) and Globe Life (GL) DHI had comprised just 02% of the BRKB portfolio while the other three stocks accounted for less than 01% For a look at all of Warren Buffetts stocks and exchange-traded funds be sure to check out the complete holdings of the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio Dan

For one thing he mentioned that each of them operates in a highly diversified manner somewhat similar to the way Berkshire itself is run He likes the Japanese companies policies that are beneficial to shareholders including smart stock buybacks Buffett also stated that the investments could open the door for Berkshire to partner with the companies down the road Apple remains Berkshires largest holding by far Buffett didnt list the tech giant in his list of stocks that Berkshire would hold forever In the fourth quarter of 2023 Berkshire even trimmed its position in Apple Does this mean that Buffett doesnt view Apple as a forever kind of stock? I dont think so For one thing its important to remember that Buffett only focuses on a small number of specific Berkshire holdings in each shareholder letter He didnt discuss Occidental (except for one brief mention) Itochu Marubeni Mitsui Mitsubishi or Sumitomo in last years letter even though Berkshire owned all of these stocks then In May 2023 at Berkshires shareholder meeting Buffett stated that Apple is a better business than any we own Again all eight of the stocks that he indicated he thinks Berkshire will own indefinitely were in Berkshires portfolio when he made that statement The bottom line is that we shouldnt assume that there arent other stocks in addition to American Express Coca-Cola Occidental and the five Japanese trading-house stocks that Berkshire will hold for decades to come Id bet that if Buffett were asked to name the full list Apple would be on it -- and probably several other stocks too Should you invest $1000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?

of the matter told Forbes Just two years earlier former President Donald Trump had announced plans to ban TikTok arguing the app which is owned by Chinese company ByteDance posed a threat to US national security And TikTok remained the subject of an ongoing national security review inspired by fears that American user data could be accessed by the Chinese Communist Party (a claim TikTok has denied) Some executives worried that a deal with TikTok might jeopardize future government business the sources said But the then 25-year-old Wang who has said publicly that beating China in the AI race is a matter of national security and has loudly positioned himself as a leader in defense tech wasn‚Äôt swayed: The commercial opportunity was too good to turn down He pushed it through over their objections But when Forbes broke the news that TikTok parent company ByteDance had planned to surveil American citizens using the app‚Äôs geo-location data Scale reconsidered the deal The

Hollywood Reporter Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter The Hollywood Reporter tagged along on Vision Pro release day as Cook met with Silver and toured the NBA league office By Alex Weprin Media & Business Writer Tim Cook wanted to know more about the stats The Apple CEO was huddled over an iMac in the NBA‚Äôs league headquarters in New York alongside NBA commissioner Adam Silver flanked by a wall of regulation basketballs On the white table in front of them was the computer and a piece of hardware that Cook says ‚Äúreally changes everything‚Äù Apple Vision Pro The NBA had been hard at work on a dedicated app for the device and two of its developers senior software engineers Lauren Marshall and Matthew Parrott were walking Cook and Silver through its features like the ability to watch up to five games at once the possibilities of immersive video and as Cook inquired about real-time stats that can be displayed next to the live games Related Stories Lifestyle CONCACAF Nations League Final 2024 Livestream: How to Watch USA vs Mexico Online General News NBCs Paris Olympics Opening Ceremony Coming to Imax Cook and Silver in a joint interview shortly after the demo were effusive about the potential of the device to transform not just how people watch sports but all entertainment content ‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen several demos of the output of different games and it‚Äôs just mind blowing it‚Äôs so much different‚Äù Cook said when quizzed by The Hollywood Reporter about the potential of the device ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard to go back to the 2-D world after you‚Äôve been in the 3-D world you just don‚Äôt want to do it‚Äù ‚ÄúI think what the marketplace is going to do now is cause other content creator organizations ‚Äî not just the NBA ‚Äî to look at the transformative nature of this and start investing‚Äù Silver added recalling a meeting with Cook years earlier in his office where the tech executive urged the league to invest in its own direct-to-consumer operations ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a strong incentive now for us to take this global content and find ways to distribute it around the world and create an even more engaging and immersive experience So I think you‚Äôre going to see a lot of content creators saying we need our own developers we need our own engineers We can‚Äôt just leave it to others and that‚Äôll raise the bar for everybody‚Äù Cook‚Äôs tour of the NBA league office took place the morning of Vision Pro‚Äôs release day Friday Feb 2 Just a couple of hours earlier Cook was on hand to open the doors of Apple‚Äôs flagship Fifth Ave Store with employees counting down from 10 to signal Cook to swing open the oversize glass doors and a line of die-hard Apple enthusiasts waiting outside to pick up their Vision Pro devices Cook shook their hands as they walked in and stuck around for selfies and to chat with buyers A few blocks south and a few hours later in the NBA office Cook says that many of the first customers he spoke to that morning were developers looking to get their hands on the Vision Pro so that they could experience it for themselves He adds that similarly Apple is also deeply invested in getting the Vision Pro in the hands of creators who will create original content for the device partners like the NBA and Disney yes but also people like filmmaker James Cameron or Jon Favreau (who helped create an immersive dinosaur experience for the device that has to be seen to be believed) ‚ÄúWe started talking to a lot of creators and everybody is blown away by the storytelling that can take place in this versus the tools of the past‚Äù Cook says ‚ÄúAnd so my gut is there‚Äôs going to be a lot of people running towards this but we‚Äôll see‚Äù In the NBA‚Äôs office of course live sports is always top of mind The league‚Äôs app had been in development since shortly after the Vision Pro was announced at last year‚Äôs WWDC ‚ÄúWe had a lot of discussions about immersive environments versus the shared space where you can have apps living side by side‚Äù says Chad Evans the NBA senior VP head of product and platform The Vision Pro allows for both the ability to envelope yourself in an environment like a theater or an environment where you can simultaneously access other apps ‚ÄúWhen we think about the fan experience they want to be able to talk to their friends about the game They want to be able to access their social media apps And so we really thought about this multi app environment where you can surround yourself with NBA content and how can our app live in that ecosystem‚Äù Evans adds that actually trying the device was ‚Äúsort of this aha moment‚Äù allowing his team to understand what they wanted to do And then there‚Äôs the potential for immersive video which can put users at the center of the action ‚ÄúI think the fan wants to be a part of the game and a part of the action and there‚Äôs nothing like being in Vision Pro and feeling like you‚Äôre on the court‚Äù Cook says ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not that you have a courtside seat It‚Äôs so much better than that‚Äù ‚ÄúAs Tim said it this is in many ways better than sitting courtside‚Äù Silver added ‚ÄúIt can take you anywhere on the floor It can give you the perspective of a player it can bring you places that you could never otherwise go and absorb it‚Äù And even Silver waxed poetic about its potential to change how consumers watch sports ‚ÄúWe saw it for soccer we saw it for baseball [in the Vision Pro demo] and I think as Tim said this is of course early days but this is transformative‚Äù Silver added ‚ÄúThis to me will be how people over time experience sports through the media‚Äù Of course there will be an adjustment period required ‚ÄúIt will take a lot you know it will take rethinking about production and camera locations on the courts and so forth You will have to re-engineer everything but it‚Äôs so worth it‚Äù Cook says After completing the demo Silver and Cook walked down a set of wooden bleachers into what is normally the NBA employee cafe The tables and chairs had been cleared out however Instead waiting for them was the NBA development team responsible for the Vision Pro app Cook and Silver shook hands and posed for photos including a group shot On the wall is an almost floor to ceiling screen showing NBA footage Evans speaking with THR on bench seating overlooking a foggy Fifth Avenue and Central Park expresses enthusiasm for the potential of immersive spatial video recording of games Silver says the NBA is already planning to take advantage of the tech and will utilize some of Apple‚Äôs specialized equipment to film All Star week events in Indianapolis later this month but ultimately he expects any network or streaming service with live sports to experiment it ‚ÄúI‚Äôd say in terms of a rights category one thing that Apple has been so great at is looking out into the future‚Äù Silver says ‚ÄúI see sort of a double meaning of Vision Pro it is literally a vision of the future And as we look out I‚Äôd have to imagine that anyone who‚Äôs licensing content for us is going to want to have these rights themselves whether it‚Äôs actually Apple or someone who‚Äôs producing content: Disney ESPN in order to use Apple hardware ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs my job to incentivize our partners to be able to look out into the future‚Äù he

afternoon sun Thursday Jan 11 2024 in Washington (AP Photo/Mariam Zuhaib) WASHINGTON (AP) ‚Äî The Supreme Court on Tuesday allowed a court order to take effect that could loosen Apple‚Äôs grip on its lucrative iPhone app store threatening to siphon billions of dollars away from one of the world‚Äôs most profitable companies The justices rejected Apple‚Äôs appeal of lower-court rulings that found some of Apple‚Äôs app store rules for apps purchased on more than 1 billion iPhones constitute unfair competition under California law Apple outlined in court documents filed late Tuesday how it plans to change in-app payments while indicating it will preserve most of the fees it collects from developers who make money from their services provided on iPhones and iPads The proposal provoked claims that Apple is acting in bad faith and set the stage for more legal sparring The rejected appeal to the Supreme Court stemmed from an antitrust lawsuit filed in 2020 by Epic Games maker of the popular Fortnite video game Epic lost its broader claim that Cupertino California-based Apple was violating federal antitrust law and the justices also rejected Epic‚Äôs appeal Tuesday But in turning away Apple‚Äôs effort to maintain exclusive control over in-app payments the court lifted a hold on an order to allow app developers throughout the US to insert links to other payment options besides its own within iPhone apps That change would make it easier for developers to avoid paying Apple‚Äôs commissions ranging from 15% to 30% In its Tuesday court filing Apple said it will now allow app developers to provide payment links to external websites but would still seek to collect commissions ranging from 12% to 27% from them to prevent ‚Äúfree-riding‚Äù on the software system that powers its iPhones and iPads Apple also plans to impose a potentially cumbersome approval process before the external links or buttons can be placed within iPhone and iPad apps in an effort ‚Äúto minimize fraud scams and confusion‚Äù The protections also will include a so-called ‚Äúscare screen‚Äù warning to consumers who click on a link for an alternate payment system saying that Apple is ‚Äúnot responsible for the privacy or security of purchases made on the web‚Äù In a series of social media posts Epic CEO Tim Sweeney attacked Apple‚Äôs plan with as ‚Äúbad-faith compliance‚Äù and maintained the revised commissions remain anti-competitive He vowed to oppose Apple‚Äôs proposal in federal court Apple has strong incentive to maintain as much of its commissions on in-app transaction as possible Those fees have turned into a significant part of Apple‚Äôs service‚Äôs division which generated $85 billion in revenue during the company‚Äôs last fiscal year ending in September The specter of consumers being able to defect to other payment channels for in-app transactions is one of several factors that has been weighing on Apple‚Äôs stock which has declined 5% so far this year The drop has enabled Apple‚Äôs long-time rival Microsoft to eclipse it as the world‚Äôs most valuable company Apple‚Äôs shares dipped 1% Tuesday leaving the company with a market value of slightly more than $28 trillion Microsoft whose stock has edged up 4% so far this year is valued at $29 trillion Besides the possibility of the Supreme Court refusing to consider the payment issue in the Epic case investors also have been fretting about new European regulations scheduled to take effect in March that also could force Apple to allow alternate payment methods inside iPhone apps Epic based in Cary North Carolina had claimed that Apple‚Äôs app store ‚Äî which was launched in 2008 a year after the first iPhone went on sale ‚Äî had turned into an illegal monopoly that stifles innovation and competition while generating billions of dollars in profit for Apple Although a federal judge rejected the assertion that Apple had a monopoly on mobile apps she concluded consumers should have more discretion in how to pay inside apps Back in August 2020 Epic tried to offer an alternative way to get its mobile app attempting to evade Apple‚Äôs commissions charged when digital goods were purchased by players on Fortnite and other games Apple ousted Epic from its app store after it tried to get around Apple‚Äôs restrictions Although it lost most of its claims in the Apple case Epic last month won a jury trial against Google and its Play Store for apps on Android phones in a lawsuit mirroring its action against Apple A federal judge still must determine what changes Google will have to make to its Play Store Liedtke reported from San Ramon California Copyright 2024 The Associated Press All Rights Reserved"

292,"Should Apple investors worry about a Justice Department antitrust lawsuit?","1/22/2024","https://www.marketwatch.com/story/should-apple-investors-worry-about-a-justice-department-antitrust-lawsuit-a9a8cc98","As the Justice Department marches inexorably toward an antitrust lawsuit against Apple Inc that could come as soon as March some investors are bracing for collateral damage to the company‚Äôs fortunes Most however aren‚Äôt sweating this They have deeper concerns Since a report Wednesday that confirmed months of rumors about an imminent lawsuit over how software and hardware limitations on iPhones and iPads hinder competitive services analysts investors and legal experts have engaged in a Silicon Valley parlor game of what the impact on Apple AAPL -046% could be In assessing both short- and long-term risks viewpoints differ wildly ‚Äî from outright fear to indifferent shrugs ‚ÄúApple should be worried My understanding is that [the impending lawsuit] relates to software including Apple iMessage and alleged monopolies over their software as a service‚Äù Chris Mattmann an expert in artificial intelligence and adjunct research professor at the University of Southern California said in an interview ‚ÄúAntitrust against Apple in the past has focused on hardware limitations that Apple imposes on vendors and also their specific lock-ins including developing their own new AI/M2 chips‚Äù Mattmann expects a potential hit to Apple‚Äôs stock price especially over government scrutiny of iMessage as part of a Justice Department suit ‚ÄúThere have been some issues with [iMessage]‚Äù he said and with how Apple customers who use apps from developer Beeper are unable to use iMessage on their Macs But Mattmann could be in the minority Analysts and investors well-versed in government crackdowns against Apple and the rest of Big Tech over the past few years are focused on the general economic picture and Apple‚Äôs performance in particular ‚ÄúA lot of these issues have been around a long time as evident by the Epic Games lawsuit actions in the EU and rumors of a Justice investigation This is not particularly news to Wall Street‚Äù Yuri Khodjamirian chief investment officer at Tema ETFs said in an interview He argued that the bigger immediate issue for investors is Apple‚Äôs less-than-scintillating results in the past few quarters along with projections of 3% growth this year Khodjamirian isn‚Äôt worried though: He anticipates a healthy bump in iPhone sales based on his estimates for the replacement cycle of the existing installed base of 2 billion Apple hardware devices worldwide Apple does not break out iPhone numbers Two analysts downgraded Apple shares earlier this month but at least one believes the company‚Äôs stock could soar nearly 25%: BofA analyst Wamsi Mohan is betting on long-term optimism about iPhone sales foreign-exchange trends and strength in pockets throughout the world Read more: Apple‚Äôs stock could soar nearly 25% BofA says going against tide of skepticism Speculation about Apple‚Äôs near future comes against the backdrop of the US Supreme Court‚Äôs decision on Jan 16 not to hear appeals of an antitrust ruling on Epic Games Inc‚Äôs lawsuit over App Store policies along with a torrent of other legal scrums involving Apple Apple won on nine of 10 counts in a federal court case in 2021 but Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers ruled Apple violated California‚Äôs unfair-competition law in limiting developers‚Äô ability to communicate with users outside the app or to use alternative payment systems Last year the Ninth US Circuit Court of Appeals upheld her overall decision prompting both Apple and Epic to appeal to the Supreme Court Read more: Appeals of Apple-Epic antitrust ruling are denied The legal machinations prompted Apple to issue new policies that require developers to pay it a 27% commission if they use an alternative payment method ‚Äî much like the company did in South Korea and the Netherlands following similar legal rulings in those countries Epic Chief Executive Tim Sweeney said on X formerly Twitter that his company will contest Apple‚Äôs new policies in the US District Court for the Northern District of California Sweeney described the tech giant‚Äôs approach to complying with the judge‚Äôs ruling to allow developers to steer customers to payment options within their own apps as an act of ‚Äúbad faith‚Äù ‚ÄúOnce again Apple has demonstrated that they will stop at nothing to protect the profits they exact on the backs of developers and consumers under their App Store monopoly‚Äù Spotify Technology SPOT +515% said in a statement Spotify filed an antitrust complaint against Apple in Europe in 2019 Other companies such as Beeper and Life360‚Äôs Tile which makes a competitor to [Apple‚Äôs tracking device] AirTag have made similar complaints The Justice case may be an attempt to finish off what Epic started in its lawsuit say legal experts ‚ÄúIt sounds like it may be an effort to bat in some runs that Epic left on base when it lost its antitrust claims over Apple‚Äôs app store/walled garden model‚Äù antitrust attorney Paul Swanson said in an email message Worldwide legal headaches are piling up for Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook and the company‚Äôs army of attorneys The company was recently listed among six that are considered ‚Äúgatekeepers‚Äù by Europe‚Äôs Digital Markets Act a law that sets strict requirements to reduce anticompetitive behavior and that goes into effect March 7 Besides Apple those companies are Alphabet Inc GOOGL +031% GOOG +028% Amazoncom Inc AMZN +014% TikTok parent ByteDance Meta Platforms Inc META +136% and Microsoft Corp MSFT +043% If companies do not comply with the rules laid down by the DMA they can be fined up to 10% of global annual turnover and up to 20% for repeated violations The EC could also force gatekeepers to sell a business or parts of it as well as ban them from acquiring services On Friday the European Commission said Apple will let third-party mobile-wallet and payment providers access the company‚Äôs near-field communication or NFC capabilities in concessions following an antitrust investigation Meanwhile a US ban on the sale of Apple Watch Series 9 models equipped with blood-oxygen sensors continues to bedevil the company in its patent dispute with Masimo Corp MASI -120% Read more: Apple Watch ban put back in place by federal appeals court amid patent fight The Justice Department‚Äôs case against Apple is expected to start as the department awaits a federal court‚Äôs decision on its antitrust lawsuit against Google and that company‚Äôs search business The latter case was the government‚Äôs first major monopoly case to make it to trial in decades In 1998 the Justice Department successfully sued Microsoft That trial strikingly similar to the current Google case centered on claims that Microsoft illegally grouped its products in a way that stifled competition and compelled people to use its products In an era when Apple has bundled its hardware and software into easy-to-use products for billions of customers it will be difficult for the government to beat the company in court Khodjamirian argues ‚ÄúApple‚Äôs approach has created value initially with better security and ease of use for consumers‚Äù he said ‚ÄúThat presents a harder case for antitrust lawyers and the traditional definition of anticompetitive behavior‚Äù Trump Media which operates Donald Trump‚Äôs social-media platform Truth Social will begin trading Tuesday while Krispy Kreme surges on an announcement that McDonald‚Äôs

In todays Market Clubhouse Morning Memo we will discuss SPY QQQ AAPL MSFT TSLA GOOGL META and NVDA Our proprietary formula exclusive to Market Clubhouse dictates these price levels This dynamic equation takes into account price volume and options flow These levels are updated every day and shared with all Clubhouse Members prior to the opening of the market We recommend closely monitoring these stocks and be prepared to leverage potential breakouts or reversals As always stay alert and ready to adjust your tactics based on the markets pulse to optimize your trading gains Now lets dive into the stock analysis: For those optimistic about SPYs SPY prospects the goal is to see an upward movement beginning at 47140 aiming for a modest rise to 47268 Should the market conditions favor the buyers and sustain above 47268 the aim is to elevate the price to a supportive stance at 47340 A solid hold at this level during regular market hours might propel the price further to 47404 with an ambitious target set at 47502 for the day Conversely if 47140 fails to act as a reliable support the scenario might pivot in favor of the pessimists aiming to pull the value down to 47063 Observing a downward trend the next focus will be at 46917 A breach here might lead to a more pronounced drop to a substantial support at 46816 with a critical bearish threshold for the day marked at 46680 if the selling pressure escalates In the context of $QQQ QQQ if the price hovers around 40095 the bullish outlook involves surpassing 40231 and consolidating it as a support base Success here leads to an aspiration for 40308 and potentially rallying further to 40359 A robust buying environment might push the price to challenge 40476 aiming for an ambitious daily peak at 40566 On the flip side should the price struggle to maintain above 40095 it might signal a bearish takeover aiming to push the price down to 39967 A continued weakness in the market might further depress the price to 39857 and possibly 39681 Should the bearish momentum persist a final descent to the days pessimistic target of 39504 might be in sight Apples AAPL current positioning near 18496 sets the stage for bulls to hold this as a support and eye an ascent to 18586 Should the bullish trend persist we might see a rally towards 18635 with a final bullish aspiration for the day reaching 18699 Conversely if 18496 fails to provide the needed support a bearish trajectory might lead to testing lower grounds at 18338 Further selling pressure could drop the price to 18296 and then to a more significant level at 18125 If the bearish momentum intensifies a final target for the bears is set at 18060 For Microsoft MSFT holding firm at 36879 is crucial for bulls with an immediate target set at 37010 A sustained position above this level might encourage a rally towards 37203 with an ambitious end-of-day goal at 37348 If the bears take over and 36879 fails as support the price might be pushed to 36698 A further downtrend could lead to 36535 with a significant bearish sentiment possibly pulling the value down to 36381 as the days low Tesla TSLA enthusiasts aim for an upward trajectory from 24616 to 24837 with subsequent targets at 25025 and 25238 A particularly bullish day might see Teslas price soaring to an impressive 25428 However if Teslas price cannot sustain 24616 as a strong support a bearish pattern might emerge driving the price to 24398 and possibly further to 24249 A continued sell-off could push the days low to 23992 For Alphabet GOOGL maintaining 13779 as a support level is vital for a bullish scenario eyeing an initial rise to 13839 and possibly extending the rally to a high of 13946 Should the price fail to hold above 13694 bears might drive it down to 13629 and with increased selling pressure further to 13566 A significant bearish sentiment could end the day at a low of 13496 Metas META trading strategy includes maintaining strength above 34289 and aiming for 34504 A strong buying environment could further elevate the price to 34767 with the highest bullish target for the day at 35018 However if 34289 doesnt hold up bears might lead the price down to 34185 with further potential downtrends to 34066 and if the selling continues to a bearish end-of-day target of 33717 For NVIDIA NVDA the bullish path involves a rally from 47381 to 47694 securing it as a firm support before aiming for 47867 The ultimate bullish goal for the day is set at 48127 If 47381 doesnt serve as a solid foundation bears might attempt to lower the price to 47017 A sustained sell-off could lead to a further descent to 46734 with a potential days low marked at 46149 Final Word: Keep an eye on the premarket activities including remarks from Richmond Feds Thomas Barkin and the release of critical economic data during regular trading hours The FOMC Minutes in the afternoon are also pivotal Stay alert and disciplined in your trading approach Best of luck!

Share it with your friends or copy link Having not personally tested both devices I am not fully qualified to judge whether Mark Zuckerbergs video review accurately compares Apples Vision Pro to the Meta Quest 3 But having read and watched a gazillion reviews of both I can confirm that he makes some good points Hes not wrong that the Vision Pro is heavy and uncomfortable (Some people are returning theirs over this) And he gives it credit for having a brighter sharper screen Sure his conclusion that Metas Quest 3 is better is convenient but lets not overlook something incredible: Hes a decent gadget reviewer Weve been exposed to Zuckerbergs awkward posts for years now from meat smoking to surfing where he strives for human But theres a new chaotic element here ‚Äî hes doing something as pedestrian and relatable as shit-talking a rival The impulse in the face of extreme adversity to Post Through It ‚Äî I recognize that specific tendency all too well In an interview on the Morning Brew Daily podcast Zuckerberg explained why he posted the video painting a picture that might be disturbingly familiar to some of us: In my household its basically like my wife Priscilla screaming at me Mark come to sleep and Im like No! Theres someone wrong on the internet Ive got to do something about it! Its happened Mark Zuckerberg has entered his Posting Era (Andrew Boz Bosworth Metas CTO and a notorious poster on Metas internal message boards also gave his own review of the Vision Pro in his Instagram Stories Shockingly he also declared the Quest 3 to be superior) Zuckerbergs latest video isnt necessarily a homerun; some are comparing his rant to a famously wrong-sighted comment by Steve Ballmer when the ex-Microsoft chief poopooed the debut of the iPhone Apples Vision Pro might be the first time the two companies are directly competing but their bad blood goes way back Apple and Facebook have been beefing since Ping Ping! Remember Ping the social element added to iTunes back in 2010? Over the years Apple CEO Cook has taken some shots in the press about Metas handling of user privacy (fair) which reportedly made Zuckerberg so mad he ordered executives to use Android phones (lol but also fair) Then there was Apples Ask App Not to Track feature which was a significant blow to Metas ad business costing the company as much as $10 billion in 2022 (Meta has since recovered its composure: It just posted bonanza quarterly results and has a soaring stock price) And for a long time Meta has grumbled about the App Stores onerous cut of in-app purchases and anti-competitive policies Some of this back-and-forth is playing out on Metas own Threads where Meta executives and employees are highly active and a handful of rank-and-file employees have grown large audiences Not infrequently those employees are complaining about Apple It is reasonable that Meta employees have a unique vantage point to form opinions about other tech companies and tend to come to the same conclusion It happens in lots of workplaces ‚Äî probably yours too The result is a sort of humid hothouse on Meta-owned Threads a soupy thick air full of just the level of friendly moisture to grow the fungus of Posters Brain Its tempting to compare Zuckerbergs new zest for posting with that other keyboard-happy tech CEO But Elon Musks X habit is more like the impulsive spewing of whats inside his mind ‚Äî often coming with significant negative costs to him and his companies I dont attempt to think too hard about Mark Zuckerbergs inner life but I dont get the sense that what were seeing is a window into his soul This is a business strategy Instead what I see an inkling of in Zuckerbergs latest video is the belief that posting more can fix the problem or make things better (A core belief of a True Poster) Apple came out with a product that ‚Äî whether or not its actually far superior ‚Äî people were way way more hyped about Its nearly impossible to imagine Tim Cook making a video like this; he simply doesnt have that dog in him Meta faces big challenges ‚Äî not just competition to its VR headset business but the ongoing existential problems that have long plagued it: shifting consumer habits away from public posting competition from TikTok lawsuits from states and cities over its products potentially addictive and harmful effects on teens lingering distrust by the public as a result of a decade of mistakes and bad decisions about the safety and integrity of the product The CEO posting a few Threads or videos where he comes across as a silly goofy guy wont fix that overnight But I can see the allure of trying I too know the vertiginous feeling of riding the high of a well-received tweet or post; how it temporarily emboldens you to want to post more and more Ive spent more of my waking hours than I should admit chasing that dopamine high For a long time Meta has been the No 1 dealer in these cheap thrills but the boss has largely avoided it What I see now is something I never thought might happen: Mark Zuckerberg is getting high on his own supply Advertisement"
317,"EU set to hit Apple with a 500 million Euro fine over music streaming","2/18/2024","https://www.gizchina.com/2024/02/18/apple-fine-music-streaming/","According to a report by the Financial Times Apple is about to be fined by the European Commission for the first time The European Union is set to impose a record fine of 500 million euros on Apple for alleged antitrust violations related to its music streaming business The fine is the result of an investigation into whether Apple‚Äôs App Store policies stifle competition following a complaint from Spotify The EU accuses Apple of anti-competitive behaviour and abusing its dominant market position If imposed this would be the first time the EU will be fining Apple On March 13 2019 streaming music service Spotify filed a complaint against Apple to the European Union‚Äôs antitrust regulators Spotify accuses Apple of unfairly restricting its rivals and favouring its streaming music service Apple Music Spotify said Apple‚Äôs control of the App Store deprives consumers of choice and competes with other streaming music service providers in a way that favours Apple Music Horacio Gutierrez Spotify‚Äôs general counsel said the company was forced to use Apple‚Äôs billing system in 2014 He said that when Apple launched Apple Music for 999 euros it was forced to reduce its monthly service fee Spotify subsequently stopped using Apple‚Äôs in-app purchase system The fine will be part of the conclusion of a case following a formal complaint filed by Spotify in 2019 Apple has blocked music streaming apps such as Spotify from offering users alternative ways to subscribe to its services thereby bypassing Apple‚Äôs in-app purchase commissions a move the European Union considers illegal These provisions are often referred to as App Store ‚Äúanti-diversion provisions‚Äù The upcoming EU ruling won‚Äôt force Apple to allow alternative in-app payment methods However it will insist that music streaming app developers are free to link to their sites for online subscriptions There will be no need to pay Apple a commission hence the price will be hopefully lower If the fine is imposed it would have significant implications for Apple and could potentially lead to changes in its App Store policies The company has previously faced antitrust scrutiny in Europe including a 11 billion euro fine in France which was later reduced to 372 million euros Apple has expressed its displeasure with the investigation stating that the App Store has facilitated healthy competition and helped services like Spotify thrive However the company has not yet officially responded to the reports of the impending EU fine The EU‚Äôs decision to levy a substantial fine on Apple underscores the increasing regulatory pressure on major tech companies This development is part of a broader global trend of antitrust scrutiny and regulatory action aimed at ensuring fair competition and consumer protection in the digital marketplace The outcome of this case will be closely watched It may have far-reaching implications for the practices of other tech giants operating in the EU The impending fine of 500 million euros on Apple by the European Commission is a significant development It reflects the scrutiny faced by major tech companies particularly regarding their market dominance and business practices The European Union‚Äôs decision spurred by Spotify‚Äôs complaint underscores the importance of fostering fair competition Apple‚Äôs alleged antitrust violations related to its music streaming business highlight the broader regulatory challenges faced by tech giants Big tech brands need to find a way to navigate complex competition laws and regulations Apple has defended its App Store policies as promoting healthy competition However the EU‚Äôs stance signals a commitment to ensuring that market dynamics remain conducive to innovation and consumer welfare The implications of the EU‚Äôs decision extend beyond Apple It reflects a broader trend of increased regulatory scrutiny and enforcement actions targeting big tech firms worldwide As the digital economy continues to evolve regulatory authorities are stepping up efforts to address concerns related to market concentration They are also checking monopolistic practices and consumer rights The outcome of this case will likely impact Apple‚Äôs future business strategies and App Store policies It will also set a precedent for how other tech companies operate within the EU‚Äôs regulatory framework Efe Udin a

GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Signs with NVDA As of 2024-02-19 Apple Incs intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $15547 Its currently trading at a price of $18231 Therefore the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -1726% The company is fair valued The GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage In the growth stage the company is experiencing faster growth while in the terminal stage a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run Apple Incs intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps Term Value Explanation EPS without NRI $642 GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow Discount Rate 11% An appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 428% rounded up to the nearest whole number which is 5% A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate Growth Stage Growth rate (g1) = 1620% Years of Growth Stage = 10 We choose the growth rate based on the availability prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10 5 or 3 years in that order and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate The default growth period is set to 10 years Terminal Stage Growth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10 For the terminal stage the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation Growth Stage = EPS without NRI * [ (1 + g1) / (1 + d) * (1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2 + + (1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ] = 833 Terminal Stage = EPS without NRI * (1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 * [ (1 + g2) / (1 + d) + (1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2 + + (1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ] = 7217 Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based) = Growth Stage + Terminal Stage = 15547 GuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $14319 This valuation indicates that the Apple Inc is fair valued accompanied by a margin of safety of -2732% You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page Please note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model: Future Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings Embracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role All else being equal a company with rapid growth will have a higher value Predictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance For companies with unpredictable performance such as cyclical companies the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized Discount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate Using the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based) To identify undervalued predictable companies focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based) This article generated by GuruFocus is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice Our commentary is rooted in historical data and analyst projections utilizing an impartial methodology and is not intended to serve as specific investment guidance It does not formulate a recommendation to purchase or divest any stock and does not consider individual investment objectives or financial circumstances Our objective is to deliver long-term fundamental data-driven analysis Be aware that our analysis might not incorporate the most recent price-sensitive company announcements or qualitative information GuruFocus holds no position in the stocks mentioned herein This article first appeared on GuruFocus Related Quotes"

of $211 billion doesn‚Äôt come as a surprise Apple slides in at number two the reigning king of consumer tech Apple churned out $1196 billion in revenue last quarter alone fueled by demand for its iconic hardware like iPhones iPads Macs and accessories like AirPods and Apple Watches Founded by Steve Jobs Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne way back in 1976 Apple has grown into an absolute juggernaut For instance over two million jobs across all 50 states in the US are attributable to Apple‚Äôs presence The company is credited with driving much of the hardware trends in consumer tech And as long as they keep pumping out innovative new gadgets and services like the Vision Pro mixed reality headset the company is poised to remain firmly atop the tech throne You may not be too familiar with Nvidia but this semiconductor company has skyrocketed in value thanks to the AI boom Originally bursting onto the scene in 1993 as the brainchild of three chip engineers Nvidia initially focused on enhanced computer graphics and visuals By the early 2000s they had scored a major contract to produce chips for Microsoft‚Äôs Xbox console But Nvidia‚Äôs real claim to fame arrived years later as a pioneer of powerful GPUs (graphics processing units) that turned out to be perfect for running cutting-edge AI algorithms and neural networks Today Nvidia‚Äôs high-performance chips are absolutely

for Tesla‚Äôs rocketing stock price 2024 has brought the company back to earth somewhat Production costs are rising competition is increasing and some major customers are rethinking their EV investments Next up is semiconductor and software provider Broadcom Inc With 20000 employees it‚Äôs significantly smaller than the other mega-caps on this list But Broadcom punches way above its

Updated: Feb 23 2024 5:44am Whether you‚Äôre an Apple fan or you can‚Äôt quit your Android there‚Äôs no denying Apple Inc‚Äôs (AAPL) power in the stock market According to its most recent earnings report Apple‚Äôs fourth-quarter 2023 revenue totalled TK ($895 billion) down 1% year-over-year With a market capitalization of $388 trillion ($290 trillion USD) Apple stock has gone up 389% over the

to buying and selling stocks In addition to enabling you to purchase Apple shares online brokerage accounts also provide a wealth of research educational materials and account types to help you meet your investing goals If you‚Äôre investing for long-term goals like your child‚Äôs college education or your retirement you‚Äôll probably want to buy AAPL in a tax-advantaged account like a Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) a Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) or a Registered Education Savings Plan (RESP) If you‚Äôre saving up to buy a home or build wealth a non-registered account (one in which gains are taxed as they are earned) is a better choice This is because there are no contribution or withdrawal limits on non-registered accounts and there are no age limits For example an RRSP must change into a Registered Retirement Income Fund after age 71 so you can invest as much as you want at any age Fees services and investment options can vary according to the broker you choose so compare multiple brokerages to find the right one for you If you‚Äôre not sure where to start check out our picks for the best online brokers Even CEO Tim Cook doesn‚Äôt have an unlimited amount of money to pour into Apple When deciding how much to invest in Apple ask yourself the following four questions Before purchasing stocks spend some time thinking about your investment goals Investing always has some level of risk and buying large amounts of single shares of any company can be particularly risky Apple itself notes that it has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and can be significantly impacted by external factors While past performance is no indication of the future you may face similar volatility in the future Lawrence Sprung a CFP and wealth advisor with Mitlin Financial recommended that the price fluctuations should influence how you invest in Apple ‚ÄúI think Apple as an investment is well suited for someone that has a moderate or higher risk tolerance ability to withstand volatility and a long-term time horizon‚Äù he said ‚ÄúThey are a leader in their industry and typically that will present a great case for a good long-term investment‚Äù Though it‚Äôs exciting to buy shares of an individual company especially a big name like Apple you should take a moment to do your due diligence Start your evaluation by reviewing the documents that publicly traded companies like Apple are required to file regularly: annual reports (Form 10-K) and quarterly reports (Form 10-Q) These reports disclose detailed performance and financial information and they‚Äôre usually referred to in the financial press as earnings reports or quarterly earnings You can find them on Apple‚Äôs investor relations site or by searching the SEC‚Äôs database You can also make use of expert analyses to provide some insight like you might find on Globe Investor TMX Money or Forbes You can then take all of the information and expert commentary you collect to determine if Apple seems to be a financially sound company you want to invest your money in On your brokerage platform you can put in a request to buy AAPL stock at the best current price or use a more advanced order type like limit or stop orders to only purchase shares once the stock price falls below a certain threshold You can buy any US stocks in Canada and your brokerage takes care of the paperwork Since Apple is traded on the Nasdaq exchange it can be bought or sold between 9:30 am and 4:00 pm ET Monday through Friday However the Nasdaq does have pre-hours and after-hours trading which you may be able to access through your online brokerage Nasdaq‚Äôs pre-market trading hours are 4:00 am until 9:30 am and its after-hours trading runs from 4:00 pm until 8:00 pm ET ‚Äã‚ÄãIf you place an order outside of the hours your brokerage allows you to trade during it will be processed once trading resumes If you‚Äôre buying stock in an American company like AAPL from Canada you will have to pay a currency conversion fee to convert your Canadian dollars to US dollars The conversion fee is usually 1% to 4% on top of the exchange rate and applies when both converting your money during the purchase and converting it back during the sale To avoid these fees you can keep money reserved for purchasing American stocks in a US dollar bank account You can also perform Norbert‚Äôs Gambit to save on conversion fees It is when you buy a stock or ETF that‚Äôs interlisted on American and Canadian stock exchanges You buy Canadian shares of that stock or ETF then you ask your brokerage to ‚Äújournal over‚Äù your Canadian shares and turn them into American shares of the same stock you then sell your American shares in US currency and can use the US dollars that result to purchase any American stock or ETF you want like APPL without converting from Canadian dollars In addition to currency conversion fees there are possible tax implications for buying American stocks The IRS recognizes Canadian retirement accounts so if you purchase US stocks to include in your RRSP you won‚Äôt have to pay any tax to America However any dividend payments you receive when you don‚Äôt use your RRSP will be subject to a 15% withholding tax to the IRS and you will also be subject to foreign gains taxes from the CRA Plus if you happen to make more than $5 million USD on your investments in the US you will be required to pay American estate tax when you die It‚Äôs wise to periodically review your investment portfolio and its performance To evaluate the performance of Apple or other stocks first start by looking at the annualized percent return This will give you a number you can compare to other investments as you gauge how well your investment performed You may also want to revisit the fundamental data you looked at earlier to see how it develops over time You can compare this information to other stocks or benchmarks like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite Index By looking at those benchmarks you can get an idea of how your investment is performing relative to certain industries or the market as a whole You probably won‚Äôt hold your AAPL shares forever Eventually the time will come for you to cash out and hopefully see a tidy profit on your investment To sell your Apple stock return to your online brokerage platform enter the ticker symbol the number of shares (or dollar value) you want to sell and select a sell order type These generally have the same names and work effectively identically to the order types we covered above Keep in mind if your investment has increased in value you will have made a capital gain Canadians will not generally be subject to American capital gains tax on US stocks or bonds unless they have a more than 5% interest in a US corporation and that corporation derives its principle asset value from US real estate like mining or real estate companies This means if you do receive any capital gain from an American stock such as TSLA the taxes that come from that (50% of the actual capital gain) are payable only in Canada to the CRA If you‚Äôre concerned about how selling your Apple shares may impact your taxes don‚Äôt be afraid to speak with a tax professional like a certified public accountant (CPA) Featured Partner Offer 1 Questrade On Questrades Secure Website Build your own portfolio or have

it‚Äôs not your only option You could also invest in index funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) which you can buy through your online brokerage like you can individual stocks Because these investment funds own hundreds or even thousands of different stocks they‚Äôre generally considered to be less risky than individual stocks while still offering solid long-term returns ‚ÄúIndex funds or ETFs are an inexpensive way to gain exposure to Apple and other companies in the technology industry‚Äù said Sprung ‚ÄúThis allows investors to mitigate some risk by not having exposure to simply one security in that industry or a significant overweight‚Äù What‚Äôs more Apple makes up a not-insignificant portion of many leading index funds (roughly 6% to 7% of many S&P 500 funds for instance) meaning you‚Äôll still have a hearty exposure to AAPL even while you diversify the rest of your holdings According to ETFcom there are a whopping 452 ETFs with holdings in AAPL; the top 10 have holdings

Weve got our very own Dan Howley here with more So Dan where should they put this money to work? DANIEL HOWLEY: They should give it to me and thats the end of the segment and Ill seal it BRAD SMITH: Done DANIEL HOWLEY: No So they should-- theres a few things here right? And I think you know obviously the car idea was pretty pie in the sky I think for a lot of people Apple getting into the car business would have been massive but youve seen the struggles that Tesla has obviously gone through Rivian and the like And so with EV sales kind of falling off it makes sense So the three things that I think they should start to focus more on is obviously innovating more on the iPhone This is something that theyre going to have to continue to ride as their primary device Its still the one that gets everybody in stores And then theres the add-ons that get people to stick around the Apple Watch the AirPods all of those things The other is obviously and this is something that was in the report generative AI Generative AI is not the end-all be-all panacea for all techs problems but it is a way that they can innovate for themselves perhaps provide better services a better experience on the iPhone We dont know what thats going to look like yet though Tim Cook did say that they are looking closely at generative AI and investing there And the other is growing their services business Right now services is a bright spot for them Whenever you buy AppleCare whenever you sign up for Apple TV+ Apple Music+-- Im on Spotify-- it is something that feeds into that area And so they can continue to build that out Theyre working with sports obviously with MLS Well see if they can expand their MLB partnership Maybe theyll start showing the Mets because YouTube TV canceled SNY which I have a bone to pick with Google about But I think thats really where they need to focus I mean look the iPhone is a great device but how many people are stoked every year that it comes out? Its the hype gets less and less and less BRAD SMITH: Its more begrudgingly that you have to actually update your iPhone because-- DANIEL HOWLEY: Its less Yeah its no longer like man I cant wait to get it Its like oh a new ones coming out Cool What is this one do? Ill hold off for two years BRAD SMITH: Yeah SEANA SMITH: Dan I think the question though for analysts at least is now that they are not any longer spending money on the EV business theyre reallocating those funds what does that though tell us about potential competition and Apples ability then to compete with the companies that are very much viewed as the leader within the AI space? DANIEL HOWLEY: Well I think look obviously its Microsoft its Google Meta Amazon Amazon doesnt advertise their AI as much but I mean theyve been in this space for quite a while with AWS But I think you know Apple with their huge chest of treasure otherwise known as a treasure chest theyll be able to go ahead and hire the right people and start working this out in a way that brings some form of generative AI to everybodys iPhones iPads Macs you know what have you What it looks like though I think is still up in the air Weve seen Google and Samsung roll out some features for smartphones Its largely with photos Theres some where you can change the tone of your text messages BRAD SMITH: Right DANIEL HOWLEY: Thats not a killer app to me Its also not really important So I think you know it remains to be seen where that is And I think we talk so much about generative AI but I think thats part of the problem is we dont-- ChatGPT blew everyone away BRAD SMITH: Right DANIEL HOWLEY: OK cool What are you going to do now? Whats going to be the product that gets me to want to buy a new iPhone because of generative AI? I havent seen anyone really do that yet Related Quotes"

commission Here‚Äôs how it works A (very long) story of twist and turns - Apples car project is reportedly dead - Apple was committed to implementing full self-driving technology to meet 2026 release schedule - There were apparently plans to launch the car for under $100k - Apple supposedly tried and failed to partner with several major automakers It looks like its the end of the road for the so-called Apple Car as Cupertinos self-driving car project is reportedly dead according to Bloomberg reporter and accurate Apple tipster Mark Gurman Rumored for years and likely a genuine project efforts to make the Apple Car have stalled and Apple is apparently shifting the efforts of the Apple Car team to focus on generative AI With that in mind consider the below to be more of a collection and rumors of tips around the Apple Car rather than steadfast information Gurman could be wrong but his reports are generally accurate And the idea of Apple entering a very challenging market where it would be a complete newcomer was perhaps always a bit hard to swallow Well the answer to the above is never as the Apple Car project is reportedly dead Back in 2020 Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo claimed that the Apple Car might not be launched until 2028 and then two-years later reports emerged suggesting that Apple had since re-jigged its Apple Car release date target to 2026 After a while without any Apple Car rumors analyst Daniel Ives went on record to say that he thought the arrival of the vehicle was a question of when not if ‚Äì we suspect that Ives may not stick to his guns on that one in light of Gurmans report Given the Apple Car project is reportedly over take the blow as a recap rather than latest information Get the hottest deals available in your inbox plus news reviews opinion analysis and more from the TechRadar team As far back as May 2018 Apple was reportedly in talks with German automotive giant Volkswagen to produce an autonomous employee shuttle van based on the T6 Transporter commercial vehicle ‚Äì a program which was expected to lead to the development of an Apple car for the mass market But after a series of high-profile test crashes and employee leaks the partnership between the two companies stifled and little more was disclosed on the matter At the start of 2021 we thought the tech giant was in promising talks with Hyundai regarding production of the autonomous electric vehicle Then we reported on rumors which suggested Apple had in fact signed a manufacturing deal with Hyundais subsidiary company Kia which would bring the Apple Car to market as early as 2024 Alas in typical Apple style another report then emerged which suggested Apple swiftly called off those talks with both Hyundai and Kia with the company turning its attention to several Japanese automotive manufacturers in an effort to bring its ambitious EV (electric vehicle) plans to fruition Rumors then began indicating that Apple approached Nissan as one of these potential Japanese manufacturing partners but a report from the Financial Times suggested that contact was brief and the discussions did not advance to senior management levels following divisions over branding Its no surprise though that automotive collaboration has been such a sticking point for Apple Despite being widely-considered the most successful business in the world Apples expertise lies in tech development not vehicle manufacturing Basically that means it needs ‚Äì or thought it needed ‚Äì help from another organisation to bring its Apple Car vision to life but the big car brands were seemingly unwilling to become a bit-part supplier ‚Äì in the same way that Foxconn is to Tesla ‚Äì on a vehicle that would ultimately bear the Apple name One unlikely rumored alliance was that of Apple and LG Electronics According to a Korea Times report from April 2021 Apple was ‚Äúvery near‚Äù to landing a collaborative deal with the South Korean tech giant (alongside Canadian automotive supplier Magna International) which has recently departed from the smartphone industry to focus resources on growth areas where its brand is better positioned ‚Äì like electric vehicle components LG isn‚Äôt a name traditionally associated with auto manufacturing but neither is Apple so we thought this common ground could have proven the clincher in Apples ongoing hunt for a partnership on the project Talks didnt last long though and subsequent reports then emerged suggesting Apple was also in negotiations with Chinese battery supplier CATL ‚Äì which like Foxconn already counts Tesla among its customers ‚Äì to produce the power source for the Apple Car By most accounts however a deal was dependent on the latters willingness to build manufacturing facilities in the US and enduring political tensions between Washington and Beijing proved a roadblock in this regard A Korea Times report suggested Apple bosses also sat down with Korean EV components manufacturers ‚Äì CATL and LG among them ‚Äì in August 2021 but official communications on the matter were non-existent Moving on to 2022 none of those names ‚Äì LG CATL or Magna International ‚Äì inked an official public deal with Apple Another slightly left field name that emerged as a potential collaborator was Lucid Motors an American automotive manufacturer that specialises in electric cars On top of a like-minded design philosophy which places emphasis on developing luxury disruptive products both Lucid Motors and Apple are connected in another way ‚Äì Jony Ive That question of what form those plans couldve taken was answered tentatively by Apple CEO Tim Cook in an April 2021 interview When pressed on whether the Apple Car would end up being a fully-fledged vehicle or software-based project Cook said: ‚ÄúWe love to integrate hardware software and services and find the intersection points of those because we think that‚Äôs where the magic occurs That‚Äôs what we love to do And we love to own the primary technology that‚Äôs around that‚Äù The integration of hardware software and services sounded to us like Apple was committed to producing an entire vehicle Ironically though the companys love of owning primary technology as Cook suggested spoke to the central problem it faced when searching for a manufacturing partner on the project Still flying solo would have taken Apple back to its original project roadmap which saw the company handling all research development and logistics on the Apple Car in-house As for who was leading that development within the company itself Kevin Lynch well-known for overseeing the brands Apple Watch division (as well as his role in creating Adobe Creative Cloud) was in the lead role The project was being overseen by Apples AI and machine learning chief John Giannandrea who stepped in for Bob Mansfield after the latters retirement in 2020 That appointment seemed to lead to a high turnover of Apple Car executives leaving the company in 2021 ‚Äì former software engineering manager Joe Bass was poached by Silicon Valley rival Meta for example ‚Äì but its normal that regime changes would trigger a revolving door of new and departing employees Now it looks like the Apple Car project has been shuttered completely likely marking the end of speculation around Apple and driverless cars at least for now Axel is a London-based

342,"Tim Cook rise at Apple from education to CEO","1/13/2024","https://www.businessinsider.com/tim-cook","Tim Cook has helped Apple become the most valuable company in the world with a market cap approaching $3 trillion Hes steered the tech giant through the death of Steve Jobs multiple product launches and the growth of Apples subscription business While Cook is globally recognized today as the leader of one of the most important tech companies he came from a modest beginning Cook was born in Mobile Alabama in 1960 His father Donald Cook was a shipyard worker and his mother Geraldine Cook worked at a pharmacy He graduated from Alabamas Auburn University in 1982 with a degree in industrial engineering After college Cook worked at IBM for 12 years While working at IBM he earned an MBA at Duke by taking night classes Cook was misdiagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 1996 an experience he said made him view the world in a different way Since then hes become known as a fitness buff Cook left IBM and jumped into a COO role at a company called Intelligent Electronics He eventually became vice president of corporate materials at Compaq then one of the hottest PC manufacturers around Meanwhile Steve Jobs had just come into power as Apples CEO following the ouster of Gil Amelio Jobs had the tough task of turning the company around after many years of fading relevance He went looking for fresh blood for his executive team Jobs approached Cook identifying him as a strong prospect for the new Apple Cook signed on to Apple in 1998 as SVP of worldwide operations It must have been a difficult decision for Cook In 1997 Apple was an industry laughingstock: Michael Dell one of Microsofts closest partners once said that if he were in Jobs shoes Id shut it down and give the money back to the shareholders And experiencing Jobs biggest flop first-hand just a few years later probably didnt make the transition easier either: In 2000 Apple released the Power Mac G4 Cube but the small PC which Cook called an engineering marvel never found its audience But Cook said the spectacular failure taught him an important lesson in humility and intellectual honesty This was another thing that Steve taught me actually Cook said during a visit to Oxford University in 2017 Youve got to be willing to look yourself in the mirror and say I was wrong its not right One of Cooks biggest early coups was closing Apples own factories and warehouses and replacing them with contract manufacturers meaning that devices could be made in larger quantities and get delivered faster In 2005 Cook also started making investments that would lay the groundwork for the future of the company including forming critical deals with manufacturers on flash memory the computer-storage component that would form the basis for the iPhone and iPad Cooks prescience meant that when competitors sought to build their own phones and tablets they had to compete for what little factory capacity and components those factories could spare after they had already fulfilled their commitments to Apple Thanks to Cooks management expertise his star within the company rose rapidly Apple was on the track toward growth and big profits and Cook got a lot of the credit As his influence grew Cook became known within the company for his no-mercy relentless questioning style his willingness to hold hours-long meetings and his propensity for sending emails at all hours and expecting answers In 2007 Apple introduced the iPhone ‚Äî the device that would change everything That same year Jobs brought Cook closer to the core of the business by naming him COO Related stories As COO Cook helped run Apples business and made more appearances at public events getting out in front of executives customers partners and investors In 2009 Tim Cook was named interim CEO while Steve Jobs was on leave to manage his declining health Jobs had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2003 and it was starting to take its toll Cook even offered Jobs a portion of his liver since they share a rare blood type But Jobs refused saying Ill never let you do that Ill never do that In January 2011 Cook took over as interim CEO once again while Jobs was on medical leave In August 2011 Jobs resigned his role to focus on his health ‚Äî the board then named Cook the permanent CEO of Apple When Jobs died in October 2011 Cook had the flags on the campus of Apple headquarters flown at half-staff in his memory Cook reportedly considers the time following Jobs death the loneliest time of his life Cook told Stanford Universitys graduating class of 2019 that mentors can leave you prepared but not ready Cook said that after Jobs death when the dust settled all he knew was that he was going to have to be the best version of himself that he could be Cook had some big shoes to fill The iPhone especially is an internationally beloved Apple product and Jobs is held up as one of the greatest CEOs in history His greatest gift was not a singular product but rather Apple itself Cook said of Jobs in 2017 Jobs once said that making things with a great deal of care and love is ultimately the thing that keeps Apple Apple and Cook has said that he believes Jobs vision lives on everywhere in the company In the months following Jobs resignation and then his death there was a lot of uncertainty over whether or not Apple could keep the momentum going under Cook Though Cook was now in the limelight as CEO of Apple he followed Jobs example as a public figure and has remained intensely private when it came to his personal life directing the attention as much as possible back on Apple In 2014 though Cook ended years of speculation by publicly announcing in an editorial in Bloomberg Businessweek that he was gay That made Cook the first openly gay CEO of a Fortune 500 company During his tenure as CEO Cook has kept a lot of important Apple traditions alive including appearances by rock stars like the Foo Fighters at Apples events and Jobs famous one more thing product announcements In 2015 Apple released the Apple Watch the companys first entirely new product in the post-Jobs era And in 2016 Apple introduced AirPods tiny wireless earbuds that have become a runaway hit and an important product for Apples growth The company has since released several upgraded versions of the buds ‚Äî analysts estimate theyre among Apples best-selling products Apple has also expanded its iPhone lineup under Cook adding lower-cost iPhones like the iPhone SE as well as more expensive pro models that cost more than $1000 In recent years Apple has expanded beyond hardware to focus on subscription services like Apple Music Apple TV+ and Apple News+ services that help retain existing Apple customers Apples services division ‚Äî as well as wearables ‚Äî is now a major factor in fueling the companys growth The latest product launch though under Cook was the Vision Pro In June 2023 Apple unveiled the mixed-reality headset and said it was the most advanced personal electronics device ever The headset which is priced at $3499 has 12 cameras and features a technology Apple calls Eyesight which allows someone approaching to see the face of the person wearing the headset Vision Pro sales will begin February 2 In the last few years Apple has seen some more high-profile execs depart: Apples retail chief Angela Ahrendts departed in April 2019; Jony Ive Apples design chief and another of Jobs close friends left the company that June; and marketing chief Phil Schiller announced he was stepping down in August 2020 though he remains involved at Apple as a fellow But the companys growth hasnt slowed ‚Äî in fact Apples market cap has tripled since 2018 When Apple surpassed a $2 trillion market cap in 2020 it helped Cook reach billionaire status for the first time In 2021 Cook received the 10th in a series of payouts from a deal he received when he took over as CEO Cook lives in a $23 million home in Palo Alto California but rarely takes expensive vacations and doesnt own yachts or private planes like other tech CEOs Like some of his fellow tech executives Cook has pledged to give away most of his wealth Matt Weinberger Joey Hadden and Avery Hartmans contributed to an earlier version of this report Read next Jump to"

In Apple‚Äôs case billions of dollars in annual App Store revenue that had been under threat until this week While the iPhone maker‚Äôs costly legal battle started by developer Epic Games technically isn‚Äôt quite over Apple looks mighty victorious after the US Supreme Court on Tuesday refused to hear Epic‚Äôs appeal of its losses That means up to 30 percent of app developers‚Äô sales will continue to flow into Apple‚Äôs pockets‚Äîjust as they did before Epic picked a fight in 2020 That outcome adds to a glum picture for developers like Fortnite maker Epic consumers and governments from around the world that have been trying for years to loosen the restrictions Apple and Google maintain over downloading paying for and using apps on mobile devices A handful of small victories in the US Netherlands and elsewhere have forced policy changes at Apple and Google and cost the companies some revenue But overall Apple‚Äôs App Store and Google‚Äôs Play Store function much as they always have and retain their hold over businesses that want to reach customers on mobile devices The few tweaks Apple and Google have made to their app stores in response to legal and regulatory pressure have not been overwhelmingly enticing to users or developers Anyone who wants to download or offer a mobile app is essentially stuck with the two giants‚Äô stores‚Äîand must comply with their rules A jury last month found Google‚Äôs mobile store to be unlawfully monopolistic but the company will likely make appeals and is operating it essentially unchanged After this week‚Äôs Supreme Court rejection Apple put into effect a concession to comply with Epic‚Äôs lone victory in its legal fight but added a new fee that developers say largely wipes out the potential benefits Apple did not respond to a request for comment Apple‚Äôs tweak allows developers selling apps in the US to link from their apps to purchase pages on their own websites This practice was previously banned locking developers into using Apple‚Äôs payments system and paying up to 30 percent of revenue to Apple But to link out to alternative purchase options on their websites developers must apply for permission and also offer in-app purchases through Apple‚Äôs billing system And they have to certify that they have processes for handling billing complaints and that their payment processors meet what Apple calls ‚Äúcertain industry standards‚Äù Apple then has to approve the wording used to link the alternative purchase options Finally when users click those links they will encounter a full-screen warning that they are taking a risk by going into a world where Apple‚Äôs protections don‚Äôt apply For any consumers brave enough to keep going and make a purchase Apple will collect up to 27 percent of the revenue via a newly created fee that extends the much-loathed levy that previously had been placed only on in-app purchases Developers will have to provide ‚Äúperiodic accounting of qualifying out-of-app purchases‚Äù and allow Apple to audit their records though it acknowledges that ‚Äúas a practical matter ‚Ä¶ collection and enforcement will be exceedingly difficult and in many cases impossible‚Äù Stephen Ornes Caroline Haskins Andy Greenberg Aarian Marshall The revisions provide developers ‚Äúa meaningful opportunity‚Äù to do business outside of Apple‚Äôs billing system ‚Äúwhile also enabling users to make an informed choice‚Äù about where to transact attorneys for the company say in a court filing The arrangement is similar to how Apple began allowing alternative purchase options‚Äîwith a fee‚Äîin the Netherlands and South Korea to address government pushback Google is testing a similar scheme in dozens of countries in response to developer complaints and regulators‚Äô scrutiny Epic and other developers critical of Apple including Spotify and privacy-focused email provider Proton are calling on Apple to make a stronger concession They say that the costs of using their own billing tools and handling customer service would offset the slight reduction in the revenue share paid to Apple to complete sales outside of its system Imposing a 27 percent fee for transactions made outside of an app on a developer‚Äôs website is outrageous and flies in the face of the courts efforts to enable greater competition and user choice‚Äù Spotify spokesperson Jeanne Moran says ‚ÄúOnce again Apple has demonstrated that they will stop at nothing to protect the profits they exact on the backs of developers and consumers under their app store monopoly‚Äù Epic CEO Tim Sweeney says the company plans to contest Apple‚Äôs new rule in the court whose ruling the Supreme Court declined to review this week Whether US district judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers will be receptive is uncertain She sided with Apple on nine out of 10 charges in her original ruling and said she wanted to avoid micromanaging its business Epic would have to prove Apple‚Äôs revised rules fail to increase competition transparency and consumer choice Rebecca Haw Allensworth a Vanderbilt Law School professor who‚Äôs followed Epic‚Äôs case says it would be fair to call Apple‚Äôs new linking rule ‚Äúbad faith‚Äù because it ‚Äúbasically recreates the system the courts found anticompetitive‚Äù But though the judge wouldn‚Äôt want a remedy that undermines her ruling it‚Äôs difficult to predict how she would rule on a challenge from Epic A new set of appeals all the way to the US Supreme Court is possible But the case turned on California‚Äôs unfair competition law and the Supreme Court generally tries to stay out of state issues Its taking up Epic‚Äôs appeal had been a long shot says Herbert Hovenkamp a University of Pennsylvania law professor with antitrust expertise Further litigation also could be doubly expensive for Epic Apple says in court papers that because it won 90 percent of the case Epic should pay the same proportion of its $83 million and mounting in legal bills Apple argues that‚Äôs required under the App Store developer agreement Epic signed when it began offering apps for Apple devices and then later breached by trying to circumvent Apple‚Äôs payments rules ‚ÄúEpic has no legitimate grounds to dispute the amount‚Äù attorneys for Apple write Developers including Spotify and Epic are holding out hope that Apple will have to cede more substantial ground by early March to comply with the EU‚Äôs Digital Markets Act a new law requiring online gatekeepers to open their systems such as app stores to more competition It‚Äôs unlikely any changes in response to the DMA would apply outside of the EU though After years of political public and legal pressure on Apple‚Äôs and Google‚Äôs app stores they are looking as immovable and

Inc‚Äôs Google using the features to attract and retain customers Creating sensors for continuous blood pressure tracking and glucose monitoring would be particularly valuable breakthroughs Apple has been working for years on a glucose reader that wouldn‚Äôt require users to prick their skin for blood ‚Äî a potential boon for millions of diabetics ‚ÄúIf we can do continuous blood pressure and glucose we‚Äôre in a whole different ballgame‚Äù Pak Samsung‚Äôs mobile digital health chief said during a wide-ranging interview ‚ÄúI think that‚Äôs where everyone is trying to get to We‚Äôre putting significant investment toward that‚Äù He wouldn‚Äôt comment on a timeline for either feature but said he hopes noninvasive glucose monitoring could come to the market in some form within five years ‚ÄúWe are looking at everything from miniaturization to the various different technology platforms that can do some type of glucose monitoring or anything in between‚Äù Pak said The remarks follow Samsung‚Äôs announcement last week that it‚Äôs working on a ring with health sensors The Galaxy Ring product is scheduled to be released before the end of 2024 and will come in a range of colors and sizes Pak said The company is eyeing activity and sleep tracking for the ring with more health features to come later Smart rings from companies like Oura offer an alternative for people who don‚Äôt like to wear a watch but still want to track their health metrics and sleep patterns ‚ÄúThe ring represents that community of people who want health tracking that is more comfortable and less obtrusive‚Äù Pak said ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs meeting a need of a specific population of people who want to track and measure but in a different way‚Äù Pak said Samsung hasn‚Äôt finalized pricing on the Galaxy Ring but ‚Äî like the company‚Äôs Galaxy Watches ‚Äî it probably won‚Äôt be compatible with Apple‚Äôs iPhone Developing a blood sugar monitor would be a more challenging task but one that could have major rewards Current products on the market typically require a blood draw or a prick in the skin ‚Äî an obtrusive process Apple has been working on a noninvasive approach since around 2010 and has since made major progress Bloomberg News has reported Even so a product remains years away Read More: Apple Has Plans to Eventually Maybe Revolutionize Health-Care The two companies also are working to improve blood pressure monitoring Samsung smartwatches have long offered the ability to determine a user‚Äôs blood pressure but the monitoring isn‚Äôt constant throughout the day and requires calibration against a standalone blood pressure checker Pak said Samsung is ‚Äúevaluating all options‚Äù to improve its blood pressure features The aim is to go longer without needing calibration ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been thinking long and hard about this‚Äù he said Apple meanwhile is planning to add hypertension detection to its smartwatch later this year in a way that doesn‚Äôt require calibration but also doesn‚Äôt provide exact readings Instead the watch will inform users that they may have elevated blood pressure Apple‚Äôs expansion into health technology hasn‚Äôt gone entirely smoothly It recently pulled a blood oxygen feature from the Apple Watch after a legal setback in its patent dispute with Masimo Corp Pak said traditional blood pressure readings aren‚Äôt ‚Äúreally that meaningful‚Äù other than showing a range of normal and abnormal ‚ÄúWhether it‚Äôs Apple or others I think we are trying to redefine blood pressure in a way that it was originally intended which is: How much cardiovascular risk do you have?‚Äù he said Samsung also is exploring a range of different sensors for future versions of its earbuds The company is studying new ways to measure body temperature and heart rates adding that the ear is a closer pathway to the heart than the wrist Data from the ear could be combined with wrist and ambient data to provide users with a more comprehensive picture of their health Mixed-reality headsets could be a new frontier for health as well Pak said Apple is poised to release its first product in that market next week when the Vision Pro goes on sale for $3499 Meditation and mental health could be key areas for such devices he said ‚ÄúWe are right now looking at partnerships to address that‚Äù Pak said Most Read from Bloomberg

Market News Hot Stocks Follow: Sales problems in China Patent lawsuits in the US Behind in generative AI It‚Äôs only a few weeks into 2024 and Apple‚Äôs year ahead is paved with trouble The tech giant‚Äôs barrage of challenges impact many parts of its overall business Just last week Microsoft took Apple‚Äôs spot as the most valuable publicly traded company after trailing behind the iPhone maker for the better part of the last decade Microsoft‚Äôs stock climb is due largely to its early and sweeping bets on generative artificial intelligence an area in which Apple has largely remained mum But some analysts believe the company will be able to navigate its way through the mounting minefields throughout the year ‚ÄúBeing Apple which is still the largest company in the world by market cap I‚Äôm sure it will do all it can to minimize the impact of these problem areas‚Äù said David McQueen a director at ABI Research ‚ÄúIt will still have an extremely loyal base of users so that its brand value and recognition and quality are not compromised‚Äù Here‚Äôs a closer look at what‚Äôs ahead for Apple: One of Apple‚Äôs biggest hurdles this year will be addressing the market in China the world‚Äôs second-largest economy The company has scrambled to attract iPhone customers in the country following the release of the wildly successful Huawei‚Äôs Mate 60 Pro smartphone In a surprise move Apple recently offered temporary discounts on its iPhones and other products in China dropping prices about $70 for iPhones (Macs and iPads were also heavily discounted) It‚Äôs normal for other sellers who carry Apple products to trim prices but the company itself rarely offers discounts The move raised eyebrows about how well the iPhone is performing in one of Apple‚Äôs most critical markets which drove about 20% of the company‚Äôs sales last year A recent Reuters report noted iPhone sales in China dropped 30% in the first week of the year amid pressure from rival Huawei Dan Ives an analyst with market research firm Wedbush called China both Apple‚Äôs biggest challenge and opportunity Despite growing competition he said China has about ‚Äú100 million iPhones in the window of an upgrade opportunity‚Äù One of Apple‚Äôs most popular products the Apple Watch remains currently banned in the US as one of the most momentous patent disputes in quite some time continues to unfold Last week a US federal appeals court reinstated a ban on some of the more premium versions of the Apple Watch Apple had requested a stay on the ban while it appealed a US International Trade Commission ruling that went into effect last month That ITC order prevented Apple from importing the Apple Watch Series 9 Apple Watch Ultra 2 and other more recent models to the US because it was in violation of medical company Masimo‚Äôs pulse oximeter patent Apple sold 49 million smartwatches in 2022 and about 267 million in the first 9 months of 2023 Although a ban will likely impact sales results Jitesh Ubrani ‚Äì a research manager at market research firm IDC ‚Äì said its Apple‚Äôs reputation that‚Äôs also on the line ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a good look‚Äù he said ‚ÄúThere may be an impact on sales in the first quarter of next year but at the end of the day no one wants to be caught infringing on patents‚Äù It‚Äôs unclear how long the dispute will last or if Apple will settle the lawsuit Major tech companies including Microsoft Meta Google and Samsung continue to roll out generative AI features to their services computers and smartphones However Apple has been largely quiet on the topic The company is rumored to introduce new Siri features powered by AI in the release of iOS 18 later this year Some on-device generative AI features also could become exclusive to iPhone 16 models thanks in part to its custom chips But AI innovations on flagship smartphones isn‚Äôt entirely novel Google‚Äôs latest Pixel 8 lineup which launched in October 2023 already has many AI features and Samsung‚Äôs Galaxy S24 lineup which hits shelves later this month packs AI-powered tools such as real-time translation generative AI-powered search and updated photo editing features The push around AI is part of a greater effort by smartphone makers to differentiate themselves in a crowded market and drum up excitement where innovation has largely stalled in recent years Although it‚Äôs unlikely consumers will switch to other brands specifically for AI features people will eventually come to expect Apple to deliver similar or more advanced features This isn‚Äôt the first time Apple has lagged in emerging areas such as 4G 5G and foldable screens ‚Äì none of which caused significant setbacks McQueen said although Apple‚Äôs competitors namely Samsung will have bragging rights and ‚Äúbe able to point out this AI weakness‚Äù he questioned if customers really know what they‚Äôre getting with on-device AI and why it‚Äôs worthy of an upgrade At the same time iPhone adoption remains strong Market research firm IDC recently released data that revealed Apple passed Samsung in smartphone shipments last quarter for the first time The pressure is on Apple to boost sales across its other product categories In November Apple posted year-over-year sales declines for the fourth quarter in a row struggling in particular with Mac and iPad sales iPhone revenue however grew 3% to $438 billion Still Barclays downgraded Apple stock earlier this month citing disappointing iPhone 15 sales in China and softening demand for the latest iPhone The next-generation iPhone 16 due out later this year is expected to have only incremental upgrades as well Apple also faces challenges around the upcoming rollout of the Vision Pro headset which will be its riskiest product launch in years The company will have to prove a device that blends both virtual reality and augmented reality a technology that overlays virtual images on live video of the real world is indeed the future of computing And it won‚Äôt be an easy sell: While innovative it‚Äôs still a $3499 clunky computer you wear on your face A handful of major tech companies deemed by the EU to be dominant ‚Äúgatekeepers‚Äù including Apple will have to implement new platform rules this year That means Apple may have to give up exclusive control of how iOS apps are distributed a move that could ultimately impact its revenue The new Digital Markets Act (DMA) which passed in 2022 aims to bolster online services competition Some of the most visible proposed changes for EU users involve apps such as how you can install them and what can be pre-installed on devices One change will require dominant operating systems to allow smaller third-party app stores to exist as well as the ability to install apps from anywhere outside the official app store Although Google has allowed for both on the Android platform Apple has maintained tight control over iPhone apps Apple and other industry players have argued that opening up operating systems in this way could leave users vulnerable to downloading more harmful apps Under the new rules dominant app stores won‚Äôt be able to de-list apps for refusing to use the gatekeeper‚Äôs proprietary payment systems an issue highlighted most recently by Apple‚Äôs antitrust case with Epic Games Much of Apple‚Äôs app store revenue comes from the 30% cut it receives through its payment channels from in-app sales of digital goods and services so the provisions could directly affect the company‚Äôs business model This month the US Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal by Apple and Epic in the case leaving in place a lower-court ruling finding that Apple illegally monopolized app distribution The decision not to hear the case also effectively upheld an injunction requiring Apple to modify some of its developer terms The company hasn‚Äôt shared too many other details about it plans to comply with the legislation but the early March deadline is soon

and 42 models later the iPhone is one of the worlds most popular phones Apple has sold over 23 billion units of the iPhone and has over 15 billion active users according to research from Demand Sage The original iPhone was released in June 2007 and exclusively sold with AT&T for $499 Investors were optimistic about the impact that it could have with Apple said Deepwater Assets Gene Munster The initial data that came out from AT&T was a disappointment from that first few days of sales I remember talking to investors after that first weekend and the general sense was that this product in one investors words was dead on arrival Apple sold 14 million iPhones in 2007 with 80% of the sales coming in Q4 In the same year Nokia the maker of the iconic Nokia 3310 sold 74 million mobile phones in Q4 alone Nokia was seen as unstoppable unbeatable said CNBC technology reporter Kif Leswing The investing community largely took this as something that is going to be a much more difficult market for Apple to really crack said Munster Things started to shift for Apple in 2008 when it launched the App Store This helped spur a new wave of modern tech companies like Uber and put Apple ahead of its competitors The App Store allowed your phone to become a lot more said Munster That was the piece that insight other phone manufacturers didnt see that coming Apple saw increased iPhone unit sales in the years following the App Store The company hit a major milestone ‚Äî more than 50 million units sold ‚Äî in 2011 with the help of the iPhone 4s The company sold 72 million units that year By 2015 Apple was selling over 200 million iPhone units yearly I dont think theres any question the iPhone set the standard that really almost all phones have followed since then said Computer History Museums Marc Weber The App Store was a huge thing and Android basically followed that model with the Play Store A decade after the iPhones release Apple was the first publicly traded US company to hit a $1 trillion market cap and its now one of the most profitable companies in the world Apple recently surpassed Samsung one of its biggest competitors as the worlds smartphone leader for the first time According to data from the International Data Corp Apple holds just over 20% of the global market share a spot that Samsung held since 2010 There was a period from 2008 to 2015 where Apple needed to worry about what Samsung was going to do with Android Their market share was actually declining globally said Munster But what Apple has been the master at is building the ecosystem I cant imagine a scenario where Samsung can build a suite of products that is going to disrupt the Apple ecosystem Recently Apple has been dabbling in machine learning and AI for the iPhone but companies such as Microsoft Google and Open AI have more openly embraced the technology AI is going to be critical to humanity and its going to be a critical feature inside of iPhones said Munster Apple uses AI to make the products work better with organizing photos with helping organize emails and potentially doing things around text organization But for the most part is that the iPhone doesnt capture doesnt really capture the full opportunity Far from it when it comes to AI Watch the video to learn more about how the iPhone shaped Apple Got a confidential news tip?

The software update for iPhones and iPads includes the essential new feature designed to foil thieves from wiping phones for resale or accessing Apple ID or other important accounts Stolen Device Protection is a new setting that‚Äôs included with the latest iOS release version 173 Apple says the feature buried in your iPhone‚Äôs settings adds an extra layer of security for users It addresses a vulnerability that thieves have discovered and exploited: allowing them to lock victims out of their Apple accounts delete their photos and other files from their iCloud accounts and empty their bank accounts by accessing passwords kept in the Keychain password manager Apple is introducing the feature as anecdotal evidence suggests phone thefts are surging Stories of stolen phones abound on Reddit groups and in news articles in places from Los Angeles to London where police say pickpocketing ‚Äútable surfing‚Äù and moped snatching are common tactics The Wall Street Journal reported last year how criminals watched people use their passcodes to gain access to their personal information after stealing their phones HOW DOES STOLEN DEVICE PROTECTION WORK? Stolen Device Protection keeps track of a user‚Äôs ‚Äúfamiliar locations‚Äù such as their home or workplace and adds extra biometric security hoops to jump through if someone tries to use the device to do certain things when it‚Äôs away from those places It also reduces the importance of passcodes which thieves can steal by peering over someone‚Äôs shoulder or threatening and forcing victims to hand them over in favor of ‚Äúbiometric‚Äù features such as faces or fingerprints that are a lot harder to duplicate Let‚Äôs say the bar thief that snatched your iPhone tries to erase its contents and settings to sell it With Stolen Device Protection turned on the phone will now require a Face ID or Touch ID scan to verify that person is the rightful owner And that‚Äôs the only way ‚Äî the new feature doesn‚Äôt let someone use the passcode or any other backup method Other actions that will trigger this feature if it‚Äôs not at a familiar place include using passwords saved in Keychain or payment methods saved in Safari turning off Lost Mode applying for a new Apple Card or using the iPhone to set up a new device There‚Äôs also a second layer designed to slow down thieves trying to access critical security settings If someone tries to say sign out of an Apple ID account change the passcode or reset the phone while it‚Äôs in an unfamiliar location they‚Äôll have to authenticate using Face ID or Touch ID wait an hour then do a second facial or fingerprint scan Changing an Apple ID password updating Apple ID security settings adding or removing Face or Touch ID and turning off the Find My device feature or Stolen Device Protection also will trigger this feature ‚ÄúThe security delay is designed to prevent a thief from performing critical operations so that you can mark your device as lost and make sure your Apple account is secure‚Äù the company said ‚ÄúWhen your iPhone is in a familiar location these additional steps will not be required and you can use your device passcode like normal‚Äù HOW DO I ACTIVATE STOLEN DEVICE PROTECTION? It‚Äôs simple ‚Äî if you know where to look First download and update your iPhone or iPad with the latest iOS update Then go to your settings scroll down to ‚ÄúFace ID & Passcode‚Äù or ‚ÄúTouch ID & Passcode‚Äù and enter your passcode Scroll down and you‚Äôll see Stolen Device Protection Depending on your iPhone model you‚Äôll need to tap or toggle to turn it on or off Make sure you‚Äôve first activated two-factor authentication and Find My device for your Apple ID account or it won‚Äôt show up WHAT DEVICES DOES IT APPLY TO? IPhone XS and newer models including second- and third-generation SE models"

357,"Apples Vision Pros Path To Success","1/30/2024","https://www.forbes.com/sites/timbajarin/2024/01/30/apples-vision-pros-path-to-success/","The success of the innovative Vision Pro will rely heavily on robust and creative software Looking back at Apples history its hardware successes were driven by software and the use of innovative designs and creative user interfaces to run these software programs The original Apple I and II were each viewed as a hobbyist computer rather than a serious productivity tool during the first two years on the market IBM executives panned it and never considered it to be anything but a hobbyist tool However that changed when a small Silicon Valley company Visicorp developed a software product called Visicalc Visicalc was the first personal computer spreadsheet and almost overnight it turned the Apple II into a productivity tool that got the attention of all types of business users Visicalc soon found its way into the offices of CFOs and their accounting teams and the spreadsheet changed financial planning forever Visicalc drove the Apple II into large and small businesses putting Apple on most companies computing roadmap This combo of hardware with spreadsheet software became a threat to IBMs computer business and is why IBM created the original IBM PC in 1981 They saw it as threatening their core business of creating high-powered calculating machines The Apple II driven by Visicalc and other productivity tools that followed started Apple down a path that Apple began to adopt quickly by using software to drive hardware sales A second example of software driving hardware sales came after the Mac and a new piece of software from Aldus called Pagemaker came out As I wrote in my 40th anniversary of the Mac column last week: When one looks back at how the Mac has influenced the history of computing the introduction of Pagemaker on a Mac launched the desktop publishing revolution By 1986 Macs the Apple Laser Writer and Pagemaker shook up the publishing industry and eventually changed personal computing forever This tech trio elevated desktop publishing and delivered the Macs second most significant impact on the computer market The success of Apples hardware is directly related to the role of software The combination of innovative hardware with creative software will drive Apples Vision Pro to succeed in the future There is a significant difference in that Apples success with the Apple II and Mac relied on software from third-party developers With the Vision Pro device Apple took proactive control by laying the significant groundwork for its success well in advance In 2017 Apple introduced its AR Kit developers software program AR Kit was initially designed for use on the iPhone and iPad in a 2D format However Apple had an innovative piece of hardware in the works that AR Kit would support seven years later the Vision Pro This software development kit is a big deal I have always maintained that the most creative people in tech besides the brilliant engineers of semiconductors operating systems and UIs are the software application developers Indeed software developers are at the heart of the success of most hardware and do not get the credit they deserve for the success of almost all digital products As the Vision Pro hits the market this week I am sure you will hear a lot of criticism and praise about this revolutionary XR headset Some will call it a niche product Others will disparage its $3500 price Some who have tested it point out it is heavy in its weight On the other hand they also marvel at what it delivers and its capabilities However the Vision Pro is a new canvas for software developers to paint on and make it more useful for business education gaming sports entertainment and over time for mainstream consumers When software developers have great development tools you cant underestimate their creativity and how their programs will drive the success of any hardware they support (For our companys review of the Vision Pro click here) From the start Apple has created essential software programs for the Vision Pro that highlight its capabilities And it supports AR Kit apps as well But imagine when thousands of Apple developers get their Vision Pros next week and begin a journey driven by visionary thinking of creating software that we cant even imagine today and helps drive us to the era of 3D immersive computing that lies ahead"

govt just unlocked an $8 trillion market to move in a new direction See how it could unleash 6000% potential upside The iPhone maker remains a leading technology company with the management team and resources needed to right the ship Advertisement Source: Eric Broder Van Dyke / Shutterstockcom Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is off to a difficult start in 2024 with several analysts downgrading the stock and news that the Justice Department is preparing an antitrust lawsuit against the iPhone maker However investors would be foolish to bet against AAPL stock Long-term the stock is still a safe bet As recently as Dec 13 AAPL stock closed at an all-time high of $19796 on a split-adjusted basis Throughout 2023 Apple‚Äôs share price rose 53% and added nearly $1 trillion in market value At its peak last year Apple‚Äôs market capitalization stood at $308 trillion making it the most valuable publicly traded company in the world That success now seems like a distant memory as Apple has been hit with multiple analyst downgrades to start 2024 pushing AAPL stock nearly 5% lower since Jan 2 Barclays (NYSE:BCS) came out of the gate with a negative outlook for AAPL stock The bank downgraded the stock to ‚Äúunderweight‚Äù (sell) and lowered its price target on the shares to $160 which was 17% lower than where the stock was at to start of the new trading year Barclays cited concerns about soft demand for the company‚Äôs latest iPhone when issuing its downgrade ‚ÄúOur checks remain negative on volumes and mix for iPhone 15 and we see no features or upgrades that are likely to make the iPhone 16 more compelling‚Äù wrote Barclays Several other analysts followed Barclay‚Äôs lead and also downgraded Apple‚Äôs stock News of the downgrades hurt investor sentiment surrounding Apple‚Äôs shares Just as the analyst downgrades on AAPL stock were subsiding The New York Times broke news on Jan 5 that the US Department of Justice is preparing an antitrust lawsuit against the company that is expected to be filed this year Reportedly the Justice Department lawsuit will target how the Apple Watch works exclusively with the iPhone as well as the company‚Äôs iMessage service that is available exclusively on Apple devices Apple‚Äôs payments system is also being scrutinized by the Justice Department Reports of the antitrust lawsuit come weeks after the company was forced to temporarily halt sales of its Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 over a patent dispute The US International Trade Commission found that the company violated patents held by medical technology company Masimo (NASDAQ:MASI) related to a blood oxygen feature on certain models of the smartwatch However Apple was able to resume sales of the disputed watches after it appealed the Trade Commission‚Äôs ruling For its most recent fiscal year Apple reported smartwatch sales of $196 billion comprising about 5% of the company‚Äôs total revenue Clearly Apple has entered some choppy waters to begin the year However investors shouldn‚Äôt count the company or its stock out There are still many reasons to be bullish on AAPL stock with several near-term catalysts on the horizon While sales of the company‚Äôs signature devices are slowing notably the MacBook computer which posted a 34% year-over-year sales decline in the third quarter of 2023 Apple is not taking the situation lying down and is moving to diversify its business In recent months Apple has announced new microchips for its personal computers (PCs) and cut the price of its MacBook Pro laptop The company is also shifting its manufacturing away from China and to other low-cost centers such as India Apple has also moved up the planned release of its Vision Pro mixed-reality headset to February of this year Unveiled last June and priced at $3499 the Vision Pro is Apple‚Äôs first entirely new product since the Apple Watch was introduced in 2015 Plus Apple continues to grow the revenue it is generating from the services side of its business which includes Apple TV and its payments business In Q3 of this year revenue from the company‚Äôs services came in at a stronger-than-expected $2231 billion compared to forecasts of $2135 billion Services revenue grew 16% year-over-year Apple‚Äôs gross margin for the quarter was 452% versus 445% that was expected showing that the company remains highly profitable Apple has $162 billion of cash on hand Clearly the New Year hasn‚Äôt gotten off to a great start for Apple But despite the near-term headwinds the company remains a best-in-class technology stock and its track record of returning value to shareholders is unmatched After all this is a company that buys back more of its own shares each year than any other publicly traded company With strong management ample cash and new products and services coming to market there‚Äôs every reason for investors to keep the faith AAPL stock is still a buy On the date of publication Joel Baglole held a long position in AAPL The

Albemarle recorded a net loss of $618 million or $526 per share on net sales of $24 billion That‚Äôs a significant decline from the year-ago quarter when the company reported net income of $11 billion on net sales of $26 billion Still the results were better than analysts had been expecting Albemarle‚Äôs earnings and its stock have been battered by tumbling lithium prices The cost of lithium soared in 2022 amid a shortage and surging demand for electric vehicles (Lithium is a key component in EV batteries) Miners in turn ramped up production but EV demand waned last year as high prices and interest rates shut out buyers Now lithium miners are dealing with a glut Albemarle gave a wide range of sales and earnings outlooks based on three average lithium prices‚Äî$15000 per kilogram $20000 per kilogram and $25000 per kilogram‚Äîto reflect the volatility of lithium prices The company forecast full-year net sales of between $55 billion and $76 billion Adjusted EBITDA is expected to fall

Apparently CEO Tim Cook‚Äôs company hasn‚Äôt given up on trying to make a true foldable A new report claims two foldable iPhone prototypes are in the works suggesting Apple is trying to catch up with the burgeoning foldable market However we may not see it for at least another two years and it will likely come out after we see a foldable iPad We still don‚Äôt have many or really any specifics on how a foldable phone might fit into Apple‚Äôs current device ecosystem Still a new report from The Information cites an unnamed source with direct knowledge of Apple‚Äôs efforts that the Cupertino California company has two prototypes currently going through tests They are clamshell-type devices like the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 which folds lengthwise allowing it to stand up like a bipod or at a 90-degree angle At the same time the company has been working on a foldable iPad that eliminates the worst aspects of foldables namely the fragility and the annoying crease Apple‚Äôs team is apparently very concerned about the fragility of these kinds of phones and who can blame them Otherwise the design team wants a foldable iPhone with external displays akin to the latest Galaxy Z Flip or Motorola Razr+ Still it would also need to be extremely thin so as not to take up too much pocket space when collapsed Considering how hard it is to minimize the size of battery and display components it‚Äôs a rather tough conundrum According to the report Apple has gone back and forth on whether it‚Äôs worth committing to a folding iPhone Cook had reportedly approached Apple engineers as early as 2018 about the possibility of foldables That was back when foldable screens were only born on early prototypes or expensive concept devices and it was two years before Samsung unveiled its first Galaxy Z Flip The Information made it clear these phone prototypes aren‚Äôt on the docket for this year or even 2025 though the company has reportedly made inquiries to different manufacturers about parts The company paused work on a foldable iPhone in 2020 but kicked it back into gear more recently There‚Äôs also always the chance Apple will nix work on the prototypes if it can‚Äôt find a real ‚ÄúApple‚Äù way of doing a foldable phone The company is still trying to discover more ‚Äúcompelling features‚Äù that would put an Apple foldable on the map The foldable iPads are more likely to rear their heads in the next few years than the iPhone The early versions of the foldable iPad reportedly had an 8-inch screen and Apple is apparently very focused on eliminating the crease Apple apparently wants the table to be able to lie completely flat as well If they‚Äôre looking for inspiration they might turn to the OnePlus Open a foldable phone with the most minimal crease of any foldable we‚Äôve seen We‚Äôve been seeing reports from known Apple analysts and the regular rumor mill that we might see a foldable iPad this year though there have been just as many naysayers like Bloomber‚Äôs Mark Gurman who claim otherwise The Information‚Äôs anonymous source claimed that we would likely see Apple‚Äôs squashable tablet before any phone version as Apple can test its fans‚Äô appetite for foldables before betting big on a major release like the iPhone Maybe Apple will be a little less risk-averse going forward especially since its $3500 Apple Vision Pro headset has been released to both praise and a fair bit of consternation We still have to wait and see how well that device sells but if things go better than expected the company could have reason to think Apple fans might actually want something‚Äîyou know‚Äînew for a change This article was originally published on Gizmodo Our free fast and fun briefing on the global economy delivered every weekday morning"

driven Microsofts market value up helping it to eclipse the iPhone giant (AI Video Summary) Microsoft has taken over Apple as the most valuable company in the world by market value This change can be mostly attributed to Microsoft focusing on generative artificial intelligence which has caught the attention of investors This increased interest in AI has given Microsofts stock a boost much like other tech stocks On the flip side Apple has been dealing with a decrease in demand for its famous iPhone particularly in China Looking at the bigger picture Apples stock has actually performed well in 2023 benefiting from different factors However Microsoft has also experienced significant gains and now has a larger market value than Apple This rise in Microsofts worth highlights the growing importance and potential of generative artificial intelligence This technology allows machines to learn and generate data and investors are very excited about it It is also transforming many industries Microsofts investment and focus on AI have undeniably played a major role in its rise to become the most valuable company On the other hand Apples dependence on the iPhone for its profits has created challenges as the demand for this iconic device has decreased especially in the saturated smartphone market of China This struggle with declining iPhone sales has hurt Apples stock performance and allowed Microsoft to surpass it in market value Overall this shift in the worlds most valuable company shows just how important technological advancements like AI are and how they impact the market It also reminds us that even giant companies like Apple need to constantly innovate and diversify their products to stay ahead in the ever-changing market landscape This information

408,"Apple‚Äôs EU app store changes are truly epic‚Äîbut they may not be enough","1/26/2024","https://fortune.com/2024/01/26/apple-eu-dma-digital-markets-act-ios-iphone-alternative-app-stores-epic-sweeney/","Apple on Thursday announced fundamental changes to the way it runs its mobile business in Europe to very grudgingly comply with the European Union‚Äôs new Digital Markets Act (DMA)‚Äîa massive reform of antitrust law that specifically targets Big Tech But Apple‚Äôs move is already facing strong opposition from those who are supposed to benefit from it The changes which the company revealed with stark warnings about the security and privacy implications for European iPhone and iPad users will make it possible for those users to download alternative app stores pay for in-app purchases and subscriptions without using Apple‚Äôs payment system and choose to use non-Safari browsers like Chrome or Firefox‚Äîwhich will no longer have to be built on top of Apple‚Äôs WebKit engine‚Äîfrom the first time they turn on their device However companies that have long been pushing for the ability to launch rivals to the in-house iOS App Store are deeply displeased with the way Apple has chosen to make the changes Epic Games which has spent years crusading against the massive cut Apple demands for in-app sales and which intends to launch its own iOS app store in the EU later this year is the most notable example In a blistering X post Epic CEO Tim Sweeney laid into Apple‚Äôs decision to claim a ‚Ç¨050 ($054) ‚Äúcore technology fee‚Äù per first installation from developers who choose to distribute very popular apps (ie those seeing over 1 million downloads per year) through alternative app stores Apple says this would apply to less than 1% of developers but nonetheless it would demand that fee whether the installation comes via its own App Store or a rival channel ‚ÄúThey are forcing developers to choose between App Store exclusivity and the store terms which will be illegal under [the] DMA or accept a new also-illegal anticompetitive scheme rife with new Junk Fees on downloads and new Apple taxes on payments they don‚Äôt process‚Äù Sweeney thundered (That last point is curious as Apple explicitly said that ‚Äúdevelopers can use a payment service provider within their app or link users to their website to process payments for no additional fee to Apple‚Äù) This opposition could well mean that the changes still leave Apple falling foul of the DMA‚Äîwhich comes with the threat of fines theoretically running as high as 20% of global annual revenue ‚ÄúThe DMA will open the gates of the internet to competition so that digital markets are fair and open Change is already happening As from 7 March [the deadline for DMA compliance] we will assess companies‚Äô proposals with the feedback of third parties‚Äù Thierry Breton the European Commission‚Äôs digital chief told Reuters on Friday ‚ÄúIf the proposed solutions are not good enough we will not hesitate to take strong action‚Äù Asked for comment earlier in the day a Commission spokesperson told Fortune that the EU executive body‚Äîwhich is in charge of enforcing the DMA‚Äî‚Äústrongly‚Äù encourages Big Tech companies whose platforms fall under the law to ‚Äútest their proposals with third parties‚Äù Apple told Fortune that it was sharing its changes with everyone and that it had previewed them to the Commission in more than 50 meetings Epic won‚Äôt be the only company griping to the Commission Aptoide which already has an alternative app store for iOS but currently requires users to have ‚Äújailbroken‚Äù iPhones to use it also told Reuters that it was preparing to send formal feedback on Apple‚Äôs changes ‚ÄúThis was definitely a good move but the fees are still too high‚Äù said CEO Paulo Trezentos Sweeney‚Äôs complaint went beyond the issue of fees also touching on the measures Apple said it would take to mitigate the theoretical security threats posed by alternative app stores Apple will still review all iOS apps regardless of how they‚Äôre distributed through a ‚Äúnotarization‚Äù procedure entailing both automated and human review‚Äîcrucially it will also retain the right to deny authorization to alternative app stores ‚Äúto ensure marketplace developers commit to ongoing requirements that help protect users and [app] developers‚Äù ‚ÄúApple proposes that it can choose which stores are allowed to compete with their App Store They could block Epic from launching the Epic Games Store and distributing Fortnite through it for example or block Microsoft Valve Good Old Games or new entrants‚Äù Sweeney wrote ‚ÄúEpic has always supported the notion of Apple notarization and malware scanning for apps but we strongly reject Apple‚Äôs twisting this process to undermine competition‚Äù The DMA itself states that ‚Äúgatekeepers‚Äù such as Apple will need to apply ‚Äúfair reasonable and nondiscriminatory general conditions of access‚Äù for other businesses that want to set up shop on their platforms With such strong pushback already evident there‚Äôs a chance that Apple‚Äôs changes may not reach those benchmarks ¬© 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited All Rights Reserved Use of this site

2 2024 2:11 pm UTC Apple faces a legal reckoning in 2024 with a series of regulatory decisions by US and EU authorities over the coming months set to determine the future of its $85 billion-a-year services business The biggest hit to the iPhone maker could come from a US antitrust trial against Google where it emerged that the fellow tech giant had paid more than $26 billion in 2021 to make its search engine the default on Apple devices and other smartphones and browsers Should Google lose the case it could be forced to stop making regular payments to Apple which Eric Seufert an independent analyst estimates as being worth a quarter of annual revenues earned by Apple‚Äôs services arm Meanwhile Apple and other tech giants face increasing scrutiny from the Biden administration over concerns about the dominance of its App Store which it is already being forced to change in the EU due to legislation designed to rein in the power of Big Tech Together the legal and regulatory actions spanning two of Apple‚Äôs biggest markets represent the biggest threat to the company‚Äôs business in years Its services arm which includes income from the App Store video streaming arm and Apple Music has steadily increased as a proportion of the company‚Äôs total revenues which is still dominated by sales of devices such as the iPhone The Google trial seen as the most significant antitrust monopoly trial in more than 25 years in Washington will hear closing arguments in May Should Google lose it will almost certainly file an appeal but such a decision would raise questions about how the two tech giants work with one another into the future ‚ÄúI think the judge was intrigued with that issue during the trial‚Äù said Bill Kovacic a former Federal Trade Commission chair and competition professor of law and policy at George Washington University Law School ‚ÄúThe question in the background was: ‚Äòif Apple is going to have an auction for that prime placement what should Google have done?‚Äô‚Äù The White House is at the same time intensifying its efforts to tackle what it regards as excessive corporate power Jonathan Kanter head of the Department of Justice‚Äôs antitrust unit since November 2021 has made no secret of his ambition to bring cases against the biggest US companies His department has been probing Apple‚Äôs App Store policies for years and is now according to Kanter ‚Äúfiring on all cylinders‚Äù The window for him to bring a case is closing however as the US presidential election and a potential change in administration loom The DoJ did not respond to a request for comment on the Apple probe Regulators businesses and enforcers have for years been seeking to pry apart Apple‚Äôs iOS ecosystem a move the tech giant has always insisted would undermine the mobile operating software‚Äôs security Apple however acknowledged recently in a filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission that it would have to make changes to its App Store in the EU due to the bloc‚Äôs new Digital Markets Act which has a March deadline for legal compliance from tech companies In the EU Apple is preparing to allow ‚Äúsideloading‚Äù which enables iPhone users to bypass its store and download apps from elsewhere This will breach for the first time the walled-off ecosystem that the company has protected since Steve Jobs unveiled the iPhone in 2007 Apple has dragged its feet on this issue since it maintains the practice will create security risks to its system Sideloading could have an impact on the App Store where Apple charges developers as much as a 30 percent fee on digital purchases Games account for more than half of that revenue Google‚Äôs Play Store which charges a similar fee is also in the spotlight after it lost a landmark trial against Epic Games in California in December Apple draws between $6 billion and $7 billion in commission fees from the App Store globally each quarter according to Sensor Tower estimates Competitors are pushing to earn some of that share and launch rival app stores and payment methods on Apple devices Microsoft is talking to partners about launching its own mobile store Fortnite maker Epic Games a longtime Apple foe wants its store on iOS devices and points to its lower 12 percent fee as an incentive for consumers to switch to its platform While Epic broadly lost a lower court judgment into its claims against Apple in 2021 a California judge ordered Apple to put an end to App Store rules that prevent developers from steering customers outside of the store to make purchases The appeals court upheld that injunction earlier this year The US Supreme Court will review the case next year For investors gauging the ultimate risk from the raft of regulatory and legal actions across the world is difficult ‚ÄúI think there‚Äôs just a belief that there‚Äôs all this noise in the background and ‚Äòdon‚Äôt worry about it‚Äô‚Äù said Gene Munster managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management Investors he said had been ‚Äúlulled to sleep‚Äù by Apple‚Äôs initial wins against Epic in particular ‚ÄúBut I think investors should take it seriously‚Äù Apple declined to comment ¬© 2024

420,"Forget Apple: 3 Magnificent Seven Stocks to Buy Instead","1/9/2024","https://finance.yahoo.com/news/forget-apple-3-magnificent-seven-114500809.html","The Magnificent Seven stocks led the market in 2023 and many believe they will do it again in 2024 This cohort headlined by the big tech stars includes: Apple Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) Microsoft Nvidia Tesla Apple is one of the most prominent companies within this group especially with its consumer-facing products Its also the worlds largest company valued at $287 trillion (compared to Microsofts $275 trillion) However I dont think its worth the investment right now especially when this group has three better stocks to choose from Years ago Apples stock was reasonably valued Now its not Apples stock trades for around 30 times earnings -- a level reserved for perfectly executing companies growing at an above-market pace While its hard to dispute Apples execution its revenue shrank every quarter in 2023 As a result Apple has a long way to go to earn its valuation However three stocks within the Magnificent Seven are cheaper and growing faster than Apple making them superior investments for 2024 Of the remaining six I think Alphabet Amazon and Meta Platforms make for stronger buys While Alphabet and Meta have other investments and businesses they are primarily advertising businesses In late 2022 and early 2023 this industry struggled However in Q3 they lapped those comparisons which allowed their ad divisions to grow much faster than in previous quarters (Metas ad revenue grew 24% to $336 billion and Alphabets rose 94% to $596 billion) The same tailwinds that boosted these two in Q3 will prevail throughout Q4 and 2024 setting them up for a strong year Amazon also has an ad division but it didnt experience the same weakness as the other two because its ad segment is relatively new (at least compared to Meta and Alphabet) However the rise of ads and other high-margin segments marks the transition of Amazon from solely an e-commerce business to one with vital services As a result Amazons gross margins have substantially risen over the past decade with AWS (its cloud computing division) ad services subscriptions and third-party seller services High gross margins allow for better profit margins which have also risen alongside its gross margin This paints an optimal picture for Amazon as it is finally turning the corner to become a consistently profitable business This is something investors havent experienced before making 2024 an exciting year for Amazon With these three there is a lot of excitement and buzz about what 2024 could be With Apple the consensus is: I hope the iPhone weakness doesnt get worse I prefer to invest in more optimistic companies making these three no-brainers compared to Apple Theyre also priced a lot more competitively From a forward-looking perspective Meta and Alphabet are far cheaper than Apple Historically these two have traded around the same range as Apple which means their stocks are slated for strong growth in 2024 Amazon is much harder to compare because its in an entirely different business and hasnt had a full year of optimized profits However if you consider analyst revenue estimates for Amazons 2024 fiscal year and if the company can pull off an 85% profit margin for the entire year it will produce nearly $50 billion in profits With Amazons current market cap that would price the stock at 31 times 2024 earnings which is still more expensive than Apples valuation However thats a short-term view as Amazon is just starting its optimization journey As a result I still think Amazon will outperform Apple by a wide margin over the next few years and could increase its profit margin even more Apple may have been the stock to own over the past decade but there are much better options now Should you invest $1000 in Alphabet right now?

(10:45) - Where Should You Be Investing For The Long Term? (32:10) - Episode Roundup: AAPL COST LLY HLT WSM Podcast@zackscom Every week host and Zacks stock strategist Tracey Ryniec will be joined by guests to discuss the hottest investing topics in stocks bonds and ETFs and how it impacts your life This week Tracey is going solo to discuss how you can start investing for the first time in your 50s She does not address retirement investing but this would be a side account simply for investing There‚Äôs a lot of talk about how to get started in your 20s and 30s but what about in your 50s? All investors no matter their age should have a plan What is the goal for this money? Why are you saving and investing it? It could be a 5-year plan to save for a dream vacation It could be an account to fund a boat in retirement It could be because you simply always want to buy some stocks but just never started outside of your retirement accounts A plan will keep you heading towards your goals even if things get rocky Many people think that it‚Äôs too late to buy stocks in your 50s yet nearly all of the examples of top investors that have been featured on this podcast over the last 8 years had started investing later in life Remember Boston Pops clarinetist Edward Avedisian who donated $100 million to Boston University in 2022? He didn‚Äôt start investing in stocks until his 40s He bought tech IPOs in the 1980s and 1990s and held them including companies like Microsoft When he died in 2022 at age 85 he had an investing portfolio worth $125 million Another top investor was Anne Scheiber who invested $5000 in stocks when she was 51 She bought and held brand name companies including drug companies for the next 50 years When she died in 1995 she donated $22 million to Yeshiva University Once you set up a brokerage account you need to fund it and then actually buy some stocks Investors can buy ETFs which provide a basket of stocks or individual companies Tracey discusses two ETFs in the podcast that could help you get started However many investors like buying individual stocks But how do you decide what stocks to buy? Tracey likes the Peter Lynch method of ‚Äúbuy what you know‚Äù Peter Lynch the famed Fidelity Magellan portfolio manager from the 1980s and 1990s liked to buy companies whose products he was familiar with and used He always had a caveat that investors should always research companies before buying the stock Did you just buy new living room furniture and loved the selection at West Elm? Are you a big fan of Costco and have been a member for year? Are you a loyalty member at Hilton hotels and love their resorts in Mexico? Does everyone in your family own Apple products including the new Apple Vision Pro virtual reality headset? Have you been keeping up with the news on weight-loss drugs and think the drug companies like Eli Lilly are going to make a ton of money?

sell its Bing search engine to Apple in 2018 Google said in a court filing earlier this month The document from Googles antitrust case against the US Justice Department was unsealed on Friday The legal battle over whether Alphabet has a monopoly in web search advertising touches on key agreements Google has in place with Apple and Android phone makers to ensure exclusivity of its search engine In 2021 Google spent more than $26 billion to keep its search engine the default according to a slide shown during the trial in October Google has been trying to prove in the case that it competes fairly In the filing earlier this month Google argued that Microsoft pitched Apple in 2009 2013 2015 2016 2018 and 2020 about making Bing the default in Apples Safari web browser but each time Apple said no citing quality issues with Bing In each instance Apple took a hard look at the relative quality of Bing versus Google and concluded that Google was the superior default choice for its Safari users That is competition Google wrote in the filing The Justice Department said in its own newly unsealed filing that Microsoft has spent almost $100 billion on Bing over 20 years The Windows and Office software maker launched Bing in 2009 following search efforts under the MSN and Windows Live brands Today Bing has 3% global market share according to StatCounter In the fourth quarter Microsoft generated $32 billion from search and news advertising while Google search and other revenue totaled $48 billion Google said in its filing that when Microsoft reached out to Apple in 2018 emphasizing gains in Bings quality Microsoft offered to either sell Bing to Apple or establish a Bing-related joint venture with the company Microsoft search quality their investment in search everything was not significant at all said Eddy Cue Apples senior vice president of services according to the filing And so everything was lower So the search quality itself wasnt as good They werent investing at any level comparable to Google or to what Microsoft could invest in And their advertising organization and how they monetize was not very good either Google said Apple CEO Tim Cook sent an email to Apple executives about the assessment of Bing but his remarks are redacted in the filing Representatives for Google and Microsoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment In October Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella testified in the trial that he has focused every year of my tenure as CEO to see if Apple would be open to a default arrangement for Bing Cue testified that if Apple did not receive the massive payments it sought from Google Apple would have developed its own search engine the Justice Department asserted in its filing Bloomberg reported in September citing unnamed individuals that in around 2020 Microsoft executives held exploratory talks with Eddy Cue Apples senior vice president of services about selling Bing to Apple WATCH: Its unclear if Google can

437,"Apple‚Äôs Vision Pro Discussed By Lightspeed","2/26/2024","https://www.forbes.com/sites/walterloeb/2024/02/26/apples-vision-pro-discussed-by-lightspeed/","Apple launches Vision Pro Mixed Reality Headset Photographer: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg ‚ÄúApple‚Äôs Vision Pro mixed reality headset opens doors to exciting content immersive experiences and opportunities for retailers and brands to engage consumers with their products increase sales and achieve greater efficiencies‚Äù said John Shapiro Chief Products Technology Officer of Lightspeed a leading software company We spoke about Apple Vision Pro which has been introduced by the company for $3500 There are a lot of questions than one could ask about price demand usage many of them were answered during my meeting with John He said that Apple Vision Pro allows retailers to interact in an entirely new manner that was previously unavailable in the physical space of a store on television or from a home computer It adds a whole new dimension to omnichannel retail that provides a range of benefits to consumers and retailers alike However it is a glimpse of the future rather than the arrival of these experiences today The device is too heavy bulky intrusive and expensive to achieve mass adoption at this time But like the first iPhone that was slow expensive and clunky future generations of the Vision Pro are likely to address these shortcomings and see much better consumer reception as a result John challenged Apple to engage consumers and gain more sales Apple should provide a more engaging shopping experience to build connections between consumers products and brands while also helping to reduce shoppers cause for hesitation ultimately converting more in store browsing into purchases Applications will include: 1 Trying on virtual clothing 2 Instant product information while in-store (ie a bottle of wine‚Äôs origin food pairings and reviews) 3 Access to stylists and personal shoppers In addition John felt Apple could achieve greater efficiencies from the ability to test and find the most effective floor and window displays (ie virtual assorting) In addition more effective marketing through applications that will push engagement increase in the moment product promotions and make suggestions based on each shopper‚Äôs preferences This will allow retailers to streamline operations and marketing budgets John Shapiro gave me a few key initial considerations pertaining to the use of the mixed reality devices in retail as well as in the longer term as independent retailers are able to deploy other solutions 1 Take omnichannel (ie home shopping) to the next level Since the pandemic retailers have learned that an omnichannel business model is required for success Retailers need to be everywhere the consumer is on-line (e-commerce social commerce etc) and off-line (in-store curbside etc) As mixed reality technologies like Apple‚Äôs Vision Pro apply the AI and extensive data retail business collect through their platform we will realize the ‚Äúultimate‚Äù multi-dimensional omnichannel retail business in the future‚Äù (albeit not for many years until Vision Pro and/or other mixed reality technologies are widely accessible but it is coming and is very exciting) 2 A number of retailers have already deployed 3D model shopping (take View in Room AR AR experiences) including IKEA Wayfair and others 3 We will initially see examples of Vision Pro‚Äôs potential from large brands and enterprise retailers These are the companies that can afford to invest in extensive technology teams to stay up-to-date with consumer trends and technical capabilities John has seen launches of some exciting applications‚Äô that demonstrate the potential of mixed reality technologies like J Crew Virtual Closet Lowe‚Äô Style Studio Alo Yoga and others 4 Lightspeed Commerce has a mission to enable SMB merchants to compete and win offering a technology platform that helps accelerate their business John pointed out that Macy‚Äôs offers a VR/AR furniture shopping experience which results in better economics: ‚ÄúIn pilot stores shoppers who used the virtual reality headsets to view Macy‚Äôs furniture had more than a 60% greater average order value than non-virtual reality furniture shoppers Macy‚Äôs says In addition VR shoppers had less than 2% return rate on transactions To increase operating efficiency there are numerous B2B and operational use cases A number of wholesale platforms of which NuORDER by Lightspeed is a leading offering allows brands to create virtual buying experiences Born out of necessity during Covid these ‚Äúvirtual markets‚Äù have returned to largely in-person events as the pandemic has subsided Devices such as the Vision Pro can enable a truly immersive virtual showroom experience enabling brands to offer a much more compelling digital experience to their buyers Similarly retailers can use these virtual experiences to do assortment planning and layouts window display plan outs etc How is Vision Pro use for Retail today? John Shapiro said that retailers are starting to launch VR apps for consumer engagement including: 1 Elf ‚Äì The ‚Äúyour best elf‚Äù vision OS app encourages users to unwind and explore the best version of themselves through playful inspirational environments that contextualize an assortment of 3D elf products 2 J Crew - J Crew announced the ‚ÄúJ Crew Virtual Closet‚Äù which allows users to shop J Crew products in an interactive high-definition 3-D environment The J Crew Virtual closed utilizes Share Play a powerful set of features for shares experiences while on a Face-Time call to chat with J Crew expert stylists or host group calls to get others‚Äô opinion on looks 3 Lowe‚Äôs - Lowe‚Äôs launched Lowe‚Äôs Style Studio which leverages spatial computing to provide customers with an immense 3D kitchen experience allowing them to visualize and design their dream kitchen from the comfort of their homes 4 Alo Yoga - Alo Yoga has launched ‚Äúalo Sanctuary‚Äù the first wellness-driven shopping app for Apple Vision Pro The app lets users experience mindful meditation in ultra-high fidelity outdoor environment while shopping POSTSCRIPT: There was much more to the discussion Companies like Macy‚Äôs Lowe‚Äôs and Elf have implemented some initial uses of the device and have found strong customer acceptance The interesting fact is that everything is based on fast service I am indebted to John Shapiro‚Äôs for his wise comments The key to new technology is whether retailers will undertake the high cost to develop the device Eventually we will see more frequent uses for those devices and John Shapiro agrees that this will be the case with Apple‚Äôs Vision Pro"
438,"Apple: Uninspiring Growth Outlook (NASDAQ:AAPL)","2/27/2024","https://seekingalpha.com/article/4673737-apple-uninspiring-growth-outlook","ozgurdonmaz ozgurdonmaz The absolutely epic rally in tech stocks we‚Äôve seen since October has been breathtaking in many ways The pace and magnitude of the rally has been difficult to keep up with as we‚Äôve seen stocks approach conditions or levels where they should pull back but it just hasn‚Äôt happened The thing is that ‚Äì like most rallies ‚Äì this one has left some stocks behind The very clear leader has been NVIDIA (NVDA) and other AI- focused stocks while others ‚Äì like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) ‚Äì have been left behind In this article we‚Äôll take a look at why I continue not to like Apple why I think it‚Äôs going to break support and why it is my belief your money is better invested in numerous other places Let‚Äôs dig in As we always do we‚Äôll start with a look at the price chart In Apple‚Äôs case I see a very clear descending triangle forming which is a bearish pattern that once confirmed would see shares move much lower than they are today Essentially a descending triangle has a series of lower highs that make up the downward sloping line and then a level where we see the bulls defend it over and over again to make up the flat part of the triangle This theory in technical analysis is that multiple tests of a level continue to weaken it and it should eventually break Below we can see the lower highs with the flat part of the triangle at the ~$180 level That‚Äôs the level to watch StockCharts StockCharts If that ~$180 level breaks ‚Äì and I believe it will in fairly short order ‚Äì we could quite easily see Apple lose another $15 or $20 per share Momentum has been horrible as you can see in the PPO and RSI and relative strength has been even worse Apple has underperformed the Nasdaq 100 by 18% just since last August Most of that has been since early December but irrespective of where you start the measurement from Apple has been a relative loser StockCharts StockCharts We can see Apple also has managed to grossly underperform its peer group and the peer group has managed to massively underperform the S&P 500 Forget about comparing to the Nasdaq which is much worse If I could sum up Apple‚Äôs technical picture succinctly it‚Äôs a weak stock in a weak group No thanks Apple shifted years ago from a fast-growing hardware maker with a burgeoning services business to a no-growth/slow-growth hardware maker that is a capital return and margin growth story The problem is that in my view the stock hasn‚Äôt been revalued to meet that new reality meaning I find it to be too expensive at the moment Given the fact that I don‚Äôt like anything about the price chart the fundamental picture only makes me more bearish Let‚Äôs start with the top line which I believe is the principal issue Apple is suffering with today TIKR TIKR Apple‚Äôs revenue growth exploded during the immediate aftermath of COVID but actually went negative on a TTM basis in 2023 The company hasn‚Äôt managed to post a positive TTM top-line growth rate since the end of 2022 That creates all kinds of issues from a growth perspective as top-line growth affords not only the tangible benefit of more revenue but also operating leverage that is generally afforded from rising revenue that boosts margins Flat or no growth makes those things much more challenging If we look at revisions we can see a pretty ugly picture quite frankly Seeking Alpha Seeking Alpha We saw estimates rise quite nicely into 2022 but it‚Äôs been flat-to-down since then Importantly there‚Äôs really no end in sight as the slopes of these lines remains firmly downward Apple has worked to diversify its revenue sources over the years and that is working The problem is that iPhone revenue isn‚Äôt the driver it used to be and Apple‚Äôs other businesses are just too small in comparison to overcome any weakness there Statistica Statistica Source: Statistica The Services segment share of revenue has grown over the years and the margins in that segment are terrific But like I said even though iPhone‚Äôs share of revenue has gradually drifted lower it‚Äôs still overwhelmingly the largest segment Very recent data suggests Apple is the continued leader in smartphones and that‚Äôs great The problem is that Apple has managed to see negative revenue growth while being a leader in smartphone market share Where‚Äôs the upside going to come from? With Apple already on top it would need the size of the market to grow materially to see any sort of meaningful boost to the top line Further share gains are likely to be incremental at best given its already-dominant position so I‚Äôd suggest the risk here is probably skewed to the downside From a margin perspective the push towards Services revenue is doing wonders for the company‚Äôs margins but the pace simply isn‚Äôt strong enough for me TIKR TIKR TTM gross margins have gradually drifted higher adding about 400bps since 2021 That‚Äôs good but the issue is that operating margins haven‚Äôt seen anything like that much of a gain Over the same period the gain in operating margins was just half of that at 200bps Regardless of where you start the measurement from ‚Äì 2023 saw pretty much the same margins as 2021 ‚Äì this again is just not good enough to support the valuation of the stock We‚Äôve now looked at revenue and margins which are two of the three ways a company can boost its EPS The third and final way is through share repurchases which Apple has been doing plenty of in recent years Steve Jobs was famously unwilling to return capital to shareholders but those days are long gone and Apple returns unfathomable amounts of cash to its holders TIKR TIKR Share repurchases over TTM periods (shown above) have very steadily remained in the area of $80+ billion That‚Äôs a lot of money but the issue is that we‚Äôre still only talking about maybe 3% of the market cap annually That‚Äôs a nice tailwind to EPS (reduced share counts translate directly to EPS growth) but in my view is not enough to overcome the weakness in revenue and the relative weakness of operating margin growth It is no wonder then that EPS revisions have been quite uninspiring in recent years Seeking Alpha Seeking Alpha EPS estimates peaked roughly two years ago and there‚Äôs really nothing to be excited about here If you squint you may be able to see some slight upward trajectories with some of the years in this chart but when other tech stocks are showing 20% or 30% EPS growth why would you want to own this? It‚Äôs hopefully pretty clear at this point that I think Apple‚Äôs earnings growth profile looks more like a consumer staples company than a tech company The problem for me is that while the valuation has come down I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs come down nearly enough TIKR TIKR The valuation right now is at ~24X forward earnings which is ahead of its five-year average of ~21X However I‚Äôd argue that for much of this five-year period Apple‚Äôs growth outlook was much better We had years of strong revenue and margin growth which then brought about good EPS growth rates In my view we don‚Äôt have any of that meaning I‚Äôd expect a lower forward P/E Valuations are always more art than science and are largely dependent upon each investor‚Äôs preferences for creating a ‚Äúfair value‚Äù It is my belief that unless Apple suddenly picks up the pace of revenue and margin growth ‚Äì which I simply do not see a catalyst for ‚Äì it should be trading at something more like 18X or 20X earnings We can see below that revenue growth is slated to be quite modest and EPS growth should be better This is down to some margin growth but mostly from projected share repurchases as we looked at above Seeking Alpha Seeking Alpha But do these numbers look like something you want to pay a mid-20s forward P/E for? For me this is nowhere close to good enough for that sort of valuation Apple is just too expensive and that‚Äôs the bottom line If we wrap this up I see Apple‚Äôs road to revenue growth as extremely difficult margin growth has been underwhelming and really the primary driver of EPS growth is share repurchases I quite like Seeking Alpha‚Äôs Quant Rating system which shows some of the same issues that I have highlighted above Seeking Alpha Seeking Alpha The valuation gets an F rating which I very much agree with as noted above Growth is also a C- and I think that‚Äôs a fair rating given how much stock the company is buying back which is covering up weakness elsewhere I‚Äôd suggest revisions are probably generous at a B rating but regardless the point is that the Quant Rating is a Hold and hasn‚Äôt been a Buy for a long time That‚Äôs congruent with my assessment For all of these reasons I‚Äôm short Apple I think we‚Äôre going to see the stock break the $180 level and complete the descending triangle pattern The price chart and relative strength are pretty awful and the stock is simply far too expensive Im choosing to short Apple through the Direxion Daily AAPL Bear 1X Shares ETF (AAPD) Its a -1X daily target return exchange-traded product that essentially shorts Apple for you The expense ratio is just over 1% annually so the cost to do so is pretty minimal and it tracks Apple at a -1X rate pretty well You can also use puts if you prefer that but Im sticking with AAPD rather than puts or outright shorting Apple itself From a risk management perspective Ill exit my short if the stock clears the 50-day simple moving average as that would not only negate the pattern I mentioned above but signify a potential major trend change Given that I dont want to be short something thats potentially on the move higher again Im targeting a test of the ~$165 low from a few months ago for this move down so Im looking to exit my short at somewhere between there and $170 On the upside the 50-day SMA is at about $188 but rapidly declining and as I said I dont want to be short above that If you liked this idea sign up for a no-obligation free trial of my Seeking Alpha Marketplace service Timely Trader!

In todays Market Clubhouse Morning Memo we will discuss SPY QQQ AAPL MSFT NVDA GOOGL META and TSLA Our proprietary formula exclusive to Market Clubhouse dictates these price levels This dynamic equation takes into account price volume and options flow These levels are updated every day and shared with all Clubhouse Members prior to the opening of the market We recommend closely monitoring these stocks and be prepared to leverage potential breakouts or reversals As always stay alert and ready to adjust your tactics based on the markets pulse to optimize your trading gains Now lets dive into the stock analysis: The SPY SPY is currently being traded around the level of 49239 For those looking for upward movement the initial target is 49324 A sustained move above this level would bring into focus the next target at 49427 Should this level prove to be robust during the trading day the momentum could extend towards 49493 The ultimate goal for bullish traders today is to reach the level of 49596 On the downside if the level of 49239 does not hold the market may see a move towards 49170 A breach here would signal further bearish intent potentially driving prices down to 49092 A significant downturn could break through to 49011 In the event of a marked decline the bearish target is set at 48883 The Qs QQQ are navigating around the pivotal point of 42945 Bullish participants are eyeing a climb past 43016 with the aim of solidifying support at this level Success here would lead to an attempt to secure 43118 as a new base potentially propelling the price towards 43182 A robust trading session could challenge the high of 43284 with an aspirational bull target of 43364 Conversely if the ETF struggles to maintain above 42945 it might signal a shift towards bearish dominance with an immediate lower target of 42850 A confirmation of weakness could lead to further tests at 42732 and 42664 Should these levels fail to hold the bearish trajectory could extend to a lower bound of 42577 Apples AAPL stock is being closely watched at the 18750 level Bulls are hopeful for this level to act as a springboard towards 18856 A continuation of positive momentum might see a further rise to 18944 with a stretch goal of reaching 19052 should the bullish sentiment prevail throughout the day Should Apples stock falter at 18750 it could prompt a reevaluation down to 18635 Persistent selling pressure might then push the price towards 18586 and potentially lower to 18496 In a scenario where bears dominate the focus shifts to a floor at 18459 Microsoft MSFT is currently being monitored at the 40711 mark Bulls are aiming to consolidate above this level with an eye on 40846 as the next step Holding above this threshold could lead to further gains with 40969 in sight The bullish ambition for the day is set at reaching 41064 If Microsoft cannot maintain its position above 40711 attention turns to the downside with 40601 as the first target A breach here could open the path to 40492 and under sustained pressure the price might head towards 40274 The ultimate bearish objective for the day is pegged at 40139 NVIDIA NVDA is trading around the crucial level of 70204 Bulls are looking to propel the price towards 70492 aiming to establish it as a firm support An upward trajectory could see attempts to breach 70735 with the days potential bullish high set at 71129 If NVIDIA fails to uphold the 70204 level bears might aim for 69977 as their first target A breakdown below this could lead to a descent towards 69462 and under a bearish grip the price might be tested at 69073 The bearish extreme for the day is envisioned at 68729 Alphabets GOOGL current trading position is around 14472 Bulls are encouraged to hold this as a base to venture towards 14594 Sustaining the upward momentum could see a push to the days high target of 14689 If Alphabets stock cannot secure 14472 as support a downward adjustment to 14377 might be in order Failure to hold this could lead to further downside explorations at 14317 with the bearish endpoint for the day targeted at 14253 Meta Platforms META is being observed at the 46220 level Bulls are keen to maintain above this mark aiming for an upward movement to 46581 A strong buying presence could elevate the price to 46838 with the days potential peak at 47219 Conversely if Meta cannot sustain above 46220 it may signal a bearish turn with an initial move towards 45859 Continued selling could press the price to 45587 and in a pronounced downtrend the target becomes 45345 Teslas TSLA stock is currently assessed around 17634 Bulls are optimistic about pushing the price to 17979 A further influx of buying could see the price challenge 18253 with an ultimate bull target for the day at 18610 If Tesla cannot maintain support at 17634 a shift to bearish sentiment could see the price targeting 17261 A continued sell-off might bring 16970 into focus with the days lowest bear target set at 16689 Final Word: Todays trading focus is influenced by upcoming comments from four Federal Reserve members notably including Loretta Mester who is a voting member Additionally the release of TIPP Economic Optimism figures at 10 AM and the Treasurys 3-Year Note Auction in the afternoon are expected to introduce volatility into the market Trade with discipline and good luck todays session The Morning Memo is

as soon as March some investors are bracing for collateral damage to the companys fortunes Most however arent sweating this They have deeper concerns Since a report Wednesday that confirmed months of rumors about an imminent lawsuit over how software and hardware limitations on iPhones and iPads hinder competitive services analysts investors and legal experts have engaged in a Silicon Valley parlor game of what the impact on Apple (AAPL) could be In assessing both short- and long-term risks viewpoints differ wildly - from outright fear to indifferent shrugs Apple should be worried My understanding is that [the impending lawsuit] relates to software including Apple iMessage and alleged monopolies over their software as a service Chris Mattmann an expert in artificial intelligence and adjunct research professor at the University of Southern California said in an interview Antitrust against Apple in the past has focused on hardware limitations that Apple imposes on vendors and also their specific lock-ins including developing their own new AI/M2 chips Mattmann expects a potential hit to Apples stock price especially over government scrutiny of iMessage as part of a Justice Department suit There have been some issues with [iMessage] he said and with how Apple customers who use apps from developer Beeper are unable to use iMessage on their Macs But Mattmann could be in the minority Analysts and investors well-versed in government crackdowns against Apple and the rest of Big Tech over the past few years are focused on the general economic picture and Apples performance in particular A lot of these issues have been around a long time as evident by the Epic Games lawsuit actions in the EU and rumors of a Justice investigation This is not particularly news to Wall Street Yuri Khodjamirian chief information officer at Tema ETFs said in an interview He argued that the bigger immediate issue for investors is Apples less-than-scintillating results in the past few quarters along with projections of 3% growth this year Khodjamirian isnt worried though: He anticipates a healthy bump in iPhone sales based on his estimates for the replacement cycle of the existing installed base of 2 billion Apple hardware devices worldwide Apple does not break out iPhone numbers Two analysts downgraded Apple shares earlier this month but at least one believes the companys stock could soar nearly 25%: BofA analyst Wamsi Mohan is betting on long-term optimism about iPhone sales foreign-exchange trends and strength in pockets throughout the world Read more: Apples stock could soar nearly 25% BofA says going against tide of skepticism Speculation about Apples near future comes against the backdrop of the US Supreme Courts decision on Jan 16 not to hear appeals of an antitrust ruling on Epic Games Incs lawsuit over App Store policies along with a torrent of other legal scrums involving Apple Apple won on nine of 10 counts in a federal court case in 2021 but Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers ruled Apple violated Californias unfair-competition law in limiting developers ability to communicate with users outside the app or to use alternative payment systems Last year the Ninth US Circuit Court of Appeals upheld her overall decision prompting both Apple and Epic to appeal to the Supreme Court Read more: Appeals of Apple-Epic antitrust ruling are denied The legal machinations prompted Apple to issue new policies that require developers to pay it a 27% commission if they use an alternative payment method - much like the company did in South Korea and the Netherlands following similar legal rulings in those countries Epic Chief Executive Tim Sweeney said on X formerly Twitter that his company will contest Apples new policies in the US District Court for the Northern District of California Sweeney described the tech giants approach to complying with the judges ruling to allow developers to steer customers to payment options within their own apps as an act of bad faith Once again Apple has demonstrated that they will stop at nothing to protect the profits they exact on the backs of developers and consumers under their App Store monopoly Spotify Technology (SPOT) said in a statement Spotify filed an antitrust complaint against Apple in Europe in 2019 Other companies such as Beeper and Life360s Tile which makes a competitor to AirTags have made similar complaints Legal travails globally Worldwide legal headaches are piling up for Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook and the companys army of attorneys The company was recently listed among six that are considered gatekeepers by Europes Digital Markets Act a law that sets strict requirements to reduce anticompetitive behavior and that goes into effect March 7 Besides Apple those companies are Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) (GOOG) Amazoncom Inc (AMZN) TikTok parent ByteDance Meta Platforms Inc (META) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT) If companies do not comply with the rules laid down by the DMA they can be fined up to 10% of global annual turnover and up to 20% for repeated violations The EC could also force gatekeepers to sell a business or parts of it as well as ban them from acquiring services On Friday the European Commission said Apple will let third-party mobile-wallet and payment providers access the companys near-field communication or NFC capabilities in concessions following an antitrust investigation Meanwhile a US ban on the sale of Apple Watch Series 9 models equipped with blood-oxygen sensors continues to bedevil the company in its patent dispute with Masimo Corp (MASI) Read more: Apple Watch ban put back in place by federal appeals court amid patent fight The Justice Departments case against Apple is expected to start as the department awaits a federal courts decision on its antitrust lawsuit against Google and that companys search business The latter case was the governments first major monopoly case to make it to trial in decades In 1998 the Justice Department successfully sued Microsoft That trial strikingly similar to the current Google case centered on claims that Microsoft illegally grouped its products in a way that stifled competition and compelled people to use its products In an era when Apple has bundled its hardware and software into easy-to-use products for billions of customers it will be difficult for the government to beat the company in court Khodjamirian argues Apples approach has created value initially with better security and ease of use for consumers he said That presents a harder case for

‚ÄúMagnificent Seven‚Äù report their annual earnings over the coming days Apple Microsoft Meta Amazon Alphabet Nvidia and Tesla propped up the S&P index of blue-chip US companies last year as investors grew excited about the potential of AI generating 62 per cent of its total 26 per cent return for 2023 The S&P 500 closed at a new high on Friday after a blistering rally in tech stocks Sissie Hsiao vice president and general manager of Google Assistant and Bard (left) during the Fortune Brainstorm AI conference in San Francisco last month Bloomberg Six of the seven companies ‚Äì excluding Tesla whose earnings are expected to decline ‚Äì will drive the bulk of earnings growth on the S&P 500 when they report their fourth-quarter results over the next two weeks analysts at Bank of America say They added that year-on-year fourth-quarter earnings across the index would have declined without the six companies Enthusiasm for big tech stocks has accelerated thanks to hype around generative AI ‚Äì systems that can spew out humanlike text images and code within seconds ‚Äì with the cutting-edge technology promising massive productivity gains while shaking up whole industries Their shares delivered an average gain of 105 per cent over past year Over the upcoming earnings season investors will be closely monitoring divergent fortunes among the companies to see signs of which group is moving fastest to profit from the AI boom ‚ÄúInvestors will all be focused on Microsoft earnings in the last week of January because that is a sneak preview of what‚Äôs coming for the rest of software and chips over the next 12 to 18 months‚Äù said Daniel Ives research analyst at Wedbush Securities ‚ÄúThis is a key period laying the groundwork for who is going to win in the AI arms race‚Äù Microsoft and chipmaker Nvidia have been on the front foot of the AI revolution so far Microsoft kicked off a flood of deals between big tech companies and AI start-ups when it announced a $US10 billion investment in OpenAI last year becoming the biggest backer of the makers of AI-powered chatbot ChatGPT Revenues at Microsoft‚Äôs subscription AI software Copilot and cloud computing service Azure ‚Äì both poised to grow from the group‚Äôs integration with OpenAI technology ‚Äì will be closely watched as an early barometer for cashing in on AI this year The recent tumult at OpenAI where Sam Altman was removed as chief executive before being quickly reinstalled appears to have had little effect on investor appetite in Microsoft which once again overtook Apple as the world‚Äôs biggest company by market value this month Meanwhile stock in Nvidia maker of market-leading AI chips gained 239 per cent last year within reach of surpassing Amazon‚Äôs market capitalisation of $US16 trillion ($23 trillion) While Microsoft and Nvidia have been the first to show clear revenue growth resulting from their AI products analysts will be watching closely whether other big tech groups will update their financial forecasts this year as their AI investments begin to bear fruit Competitors including Meta and Alphabet-owned Google have unleashed a wave of spending on AI start-ups and internal research and development as they rush to integrate the technology into their products Also under scrutiny will be the groups forced to reinvest to tackle bigger growth opportunities in AI such as by increasing spending on high-end chips that are in short supply Google launched its first standalone AI consumer product in May with its Bard chatbot followed by a second-generation model named Gemini in December But critics said the company had been hemmed in by its hugely profitable search business and was cautious about introducing generative AI products that could cannibalise its business model Apple and Amazon have been slower to announce big public investments in AI but are poised to roll out products that could be viewed as a bid to catch up ‚ÄúMicrosoft clearly has a lead with OpenAI integration and companies like Alphabet and Amazon are doing whatever they can to catch up‚Äù said Colin Sebastian senior research analyst at Baird The fourth-quarter results will cap a year of resilience for big tech after the post-pandemic slowdown of 2022 forced the companies into lay-offs and further cost-cutting at the start of last year Amazon Web Services Microsoft and Google have benefited from growth in global enterprise spending on cloud services while Meta and Google were buoyed by increased advertising and consumer spending as concerns about an economic recession in late 2023 failed to materialise There have been hundreds more job cuts at companies including Google and Amazon this month in some cases to reduce costs while boosting AI investment But these are far fewer than in January last year when Google Meta Microsoft and Amazon laid off between 6 and 13 per cent of workers signalling a more buoyant start to the year for the sector Earnings at Nvidia Amazon Meta Google Microsoft and Apple are expected to decelerate to year-on-year growth of 33 per cent in the first quarter of this year according to consensus analyst estimates Tesla shares have slumped this year ahead of fourth-quarter earnings after analysts revised down profit estimates The flood of investment into AI in last year is expected to be followed by the integration of the technology into more applications this year which could drastically shift the landscape of successful AI products Analysts at Jefferies predicted that Amazon would launch an ‚Äúall-out offensive to catch up in AI‚Äù this year It launched Amazon Q an AI-powered assistant for users of its cloud services in November Apple is rumoured to be accelerating its generative AI efforts this year including the possibility of an iPhone that can run large language models despite the devices‚Äô limited memory In October it discreetly launched an open-source AI model ‚ÄúFerret‚Äù that is capable of

475,"Why Apple faces its biggest crisis since it was saved by the iPod","1/9/2024","https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-apple-faces-biggest-crisis-060000886.html","Tim Cook did not hold back ‚ÄúThis is obviously a disaster‚Äù he told finance executives in a 2018 email ordering his lieutenants to improve underwhelming sales of Apple‚Äôs latest iPhones Apple‚Äôs business in China was sliding leading to the company‚Äôs first profit warning in 16 years One executive described the performance as ‚Äúan extreme problem‚Äù while another said employees needed to respond as if it was a ‚Äúfive alarm fire‚Äù according to emails recently released as part of a lawsuit against Apple The company later reported two consecutive quarters of revenue decline a rare dip for a business famous for reliably getting more cash out of its customers each year At the time blame for the poor sales was laid at the foot of Huawei the Chinese phone giant seen as a domestic rival to the iPhone maker ‚ÄúI do think upgraders consider choices [like Huawei] to be more value for money especially if they don‚Äôt see major reasons and new innovation in the iPhone‚Äù wrote Apple‚Äôs head of marketing for China Ultimately Huawei did not kill Apple‚Äôs business in China US sanctions effectively crippled Huawei‚Äôs ability to make high-end handsets handing an advantage to the iPhone maker in the process Despite fraying relations between Beijing and Washington Apple went on to post record sales in the Middle Kingdom But Cook may have simply delayed the reckoning Wall Street has recently sounded a new alarm on Apple‚Äôs business in China sending the company‚Äôs shares sliding It is just one of a number of significant issues facing the world‚Äôs biggest company In November the company revealed revenues had fallen year-on-year for four consecutive quarters the longest slump for more than two decades Some analysts believe Apple could deliver a fifth quarter of decline when it reports Christmas sales in the coming weeks This would mark its longest losing streak since 1998 the year after Steve Jobs returned to save the company from near-bankruptcy Nobody is suggesting that Apple or Cook are in similar trouble The company became the first business to hit a $3 trillion (¬£24 trillion) valuation last year and shares hit a new all-time high just last month The company has captured more than two thirds of the high-end segment of the smartphone market ‚Äì the only part that is reliably profitable ‚Äì and made profits of $97bn in its last financial year: roughly $11m in an hour Cook has also defied repeated predictions of ‚Äúpeak Apple‚Äù to continue to swell the company‚Äôs coffers even as each annual iPhone release becomes harder to distinguish from the previous year‚Äôs But investors are increasingly jittery Since its peak in December Apple‚Äôs share price has declined by 85pc ‚Äì a drop worth $260bn in market value terms The company is now facing a series of challenges that together represent perhaps the most complex in Cook‚Äôs tenure On Monday analysts at Jefferies said iPhone sales in China were likely to fall by double digits this year Supply chain sources suggest shipments are currently falling at a rate of 30pc analysts at the investment bank said It follows gloomy downgrades from both Barclays and Piper Sandler last week A darkening economic picture in China is partly to blame but Apple is once again being challenged by a resurgent Huawei which has overcome US sanctions with a homegrown smartphone processor The high specifications of its new Mate 60 phone have led to huge demand within its home market Some government officials have also been told to stop using iPhones and other foreign made devices according to local reports Huawei is slowly eating into Apple‚Äôs sales at the top of the market in China as it rebuilds its smartphone business according to analysts at Counterpoint Research The Chinese company‚Äôs market share of phones priced above $600 rose from 3pc to 5pc last year while Apple‚Äôs fell from 75pc to 71pc ‚Äì a significant shift in what is a largely calcified market Ben Wood a longtime Apple watcher at analyst firm CCS Insight says smartphones are ‚Äúapproaching washing machine territory‚Äù meaning they are generally only replaced when they are broken ‚ÄúPart of Apple‚Äôs pain is sales are slowing because people are keeping their devices for longer‚Äù he says This is a concern because the iPhone still accounts for most of Apple‚Äôs revenue Yet it is not smartphone sales in China that are Cook‚Äôs only headache In the run-up to Christmas the company was forced to suspend most sales of its Apple Watch in the US after a legal victory from a medical device company accusing it of patent infringement Apple has frozen the order as it appeals the ruling but the reprieve may only last until this Friday when US customs authorities are set to rule on whether a proposed update addresses the complaint The Apple Watch which remains the most significant device launched in Cook‚Äôs more than 12 years in charge has become a significant source of revenue if not the revolutionary product the iPhone was There are other potential legal issues Last week The New York Times reported that the US Justice Department was on the cusp of filing a major anti-monopoly case against Apple which is likely to target the tactics the company uses to safeguard the market position of the iPhone While the company is likely to challenge any case the encounter will be bruising at the very least and likely very time consuming A more immediate regulatory crackdown will be felt in Europe Later this year new competition laws mean iPhone users will be able to bypass Apple‚Äôs highly-profitable app store when installing apps With problems mounting Apple is trying to focus instead on a new product that it hopes will revitalise its business On Monday Apple announced that its augmented reality headset the ski goggle-esque Vision Pro will go on sale on February 2 Cook has talked up its credentials calling it a ‚Äúnew type of computer‚Äù Yet the launch will be a significant test of Apple‚Äôs selling power and its innovation credentials At $3499 both production and sales of the devices are likely to be limited Other companies have also failed to make high-tech headsets stick Meanwhile as Apple debuts its metaverse tech the world is shifting its attention to a shinier innovation: artificial intelligence On this topic Apple has had less to say The company rarely raves about AI itself preferring to talk about how machine learning is improving existing technology like Autocorrect or the iPhone camera This has led to perceptions that the company is losing ground an idea not helped by the constant frustrations of users with the iPhone‚Äôs AI assistant Siri Apple reportedly plans to overhaul Siri with a new system closer to ChatGPT later this year and is in talks with news publishers about licensing their content for the launch Still it faces questions about whether its pro-privacy credentials will deter it from collecting the vast amounts of data typically used to train AI systems Apple has had long sales slumps in the past yet it has always been saved by breakthrough new products: 1998‚Äôs iMac and 2001‚Äôs iPod As the clouds draw in once more Apple‚Äôs new

You might just be making the problem worse Earlier this year Apple quietly published new guidelines on what to do when water gets into your iPhone Typically when phones or any electronic devices get wet one common course of action is to put them in uncooked rice The theory is that the raw grains can absorb the moisture But Apples latest support document discourages iPhone users from doing that saying that small grains of rice could actually damage your phone if say particles get lodged into the ports Related stories According to Apple you also shouldnt try to dry your moist iPhone by inserting a foreign object like a cotton swab or paper towel into the port or use an external heat source like a blow dryer Still the updated guidelines offer a few suggestions on what users can safely do For example if you plug your iPhone into a wall outlet with a lightning accessory and a Liquid Detected alert appears immediately unplug the cable from both ends Once the cable is disconnected gently tap your iPhone against your hand with the port facing the floor to allow excess liquid to escape After that store the phone in a dry area where theres some airflow for at least 30 minutes then try charging it If the liquid detection alert appears a second time unplug and leave your phone to fully dry for up to 24 hours After waiting try charging the phone again If the phone still isnt charging momentarily unplug the cable from the adapter and the adapter from the wall then reconnect them And if all else fails you may need to bring your iPhone to a repair shop or at worst consider getting a replacement Nevertheless your wet phone may still have a likely chance of surviving A video of an iPhone 6 drop test showed that the 2014 version continued to work after being dunked underwater Years later the iPhone 11 Pro passed a similar water resistance test Apple didnt immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider before publication Read next Jump to"

Let‚Äôs take a closer look and find out Uncertainty over macro improvements like lower inflation and interest rates may be causing some minor turbulence for the broad market but that‚Äôs not the key factor behind the recent Apple stock pullback Instead factors more directly related to AAPL stock are driving the latest slide for shares In the last trading days of 2023 shares were rattled by news of a court-order import ban on Apple Watches related to a patent dispute between the tech giant and medical technology company Masimo Shares already trending lower before this news fell on the news Even though the import ban was temporarily lifted soon after AAPL experienced little in the way of a rebound Since the start of the calendar year additional negative developments have weighed on AAPL Specifically those developments were the issuance of not one not two but three sell-side downgrades Analysts from Barclays Piper Sandler and Redburn have all weighed in pointing to weak iPhone demand slowing services growth and a rich valuation as factors that could affect AAPL‚Äôs performance in 2024 Yet while what‚Äôs driving the pullback should give those saying to ‚Äúbuy the dip‚Äù some pause and gives credence to the more cautious don‚Äôt assume ‚Äústay away‚Äù is the clear takeaway here While it‚Äôs possible that the market quickly absorbs the negative news surrounding AAPL stock it‚Äôs also possible that these concerns linger leading to continued poor performance for shares in the short-term But while the near-term could remain stormy the market‚Äôs response to these downgrades could still in time prove to be an overreaction In the months ahead sentiment for shares could swing back in a big way At least that‚Äôs the view of analysts at Morgan Stanley Amid the spate of analyst downgrades discussed above Morgan Stanley has reiterated its ‚Äúoverweight‚Äù rating and $220 per share price target on AAPL Per the analysts progress with Apple‚Äôs ‚ÄúEdge AI‚Äù efforts could bode well for shares later this year That‚Äôs not to say that AAPL is going to benefit from a high level of ‚ÄúAI mania‚Äù in 2024 as seen with other major tech stocks It may be something that gives shares support before consumer spending bounces back Then if said demand rebound happens between now and December? Shares could really start to make an exit from their recent slump Later this year increased appreciation of Apple‚Äôs potential to capitalize on the generative AI trend plus an improving consumer spending picture could enable AAPL to climb back toward $200 per share Prices north of $200 per share may also be within reach That‚Äôs not all In the years ahead AI-related innovations plus other long-term catalysts (like iPhone sales growth in India and other non-China emerging markets) will drive the level of earnings growth needed to sustain (or even expand) this stock‚Äôs so-called ‚Äúrich‚Äù forward earnings multiple (around 28) With this here‚Äôs the true takeaway If you‚Äôve been holding this stock for the long haul there‚Äôs no need to change your stance If you‚Äôve yet to buy AAPL stock feel free to consider it whether at current prices or in the event shares experience a further short-term decline in price AAPL stock earns a B rating in Portfolio Grader On the date of publication neither Louis Navellier nor the InvestorPlace Research Staff member primarily responsible for this article held (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article Artificial Intelligence Consumer Discretionary Retail Technology Louis Navellier is one of Wall Street‚Äôs renowned growth investors Providing investment advice to tens of thousands of investors for more than three decades he has earned a reputation as a savvy stock picker and unrivaled portfolio manager Article printed from InvestorPlace Media https://investorplacecom/market360/2024/01/aapl-stock-buy-the-dip-or-head-for-the-hills/ ¬©2024 InvestorPlace Media LLC Stocks to Buy Stocks to Buy Market Analysis Stocks to Buy Stocks to Buy Stocks to Buy Stocks to Buy Stocks to Sell Financial Market Data powered by FinancialContent Services Inc All rights reserved Nasdaq quotes delayed at least 15 minutes all others at least 20 minutes Copyright ¬© 2024 InvestorPlace Media LLC All rights reserved 1125 N Charles St Baltimore MD 21201 Not Yet a Premium Subscriber?

Union","1/25/2024","https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/01/apple-announces-changes-to-ios-safari-and-the-app-store-in-the-european-union/","Text of this article January 25 2024 PRESS RELEASE Apple announces changes to iOS Safari and the App Store in the European Union For developers the changes include new options for app distribution and payment processing For users the changes include new controls and disclosures and expanded protections to reduce privacy and security risks the DMA creates CUPERTINO CALIFORNIA Apple today announced changes to iOS Safari and the App Store impacting developers‚Äô apps in the European Union (EU) to comply with the Digital Markets Act (DMA) The changes include more than 600 new APIs expanded app analytics functionality for alternative browser engines and options for processing app payments and distributing iOS apps Across every change Apple is introducing new safeguards that reduce ‚Äî but don‚Äôt eliminate ‚Äî new risks the DMA poses to EU users With these steps Apple will continue to deliver the best most secure experience possible for EU users The new options for processing payments and downloading apps on iOS open new avenues for malware fraud and scams illicit and harmful content and other privacy and security threats That‚Äôs why Apple is introducing protections ‚Äî including Notarization for iOS apps an authorization for marketplace developers and disclosures on alternative payments ‚Äî to reduce risks and deliver the best most secure experience possible for users in the EU Even with these safeguards in place many risks remain Developers can learn about these changes on the Apple Developer Support page and can begin testing new capabilities today in the iOS 174 beta The new capabilities will become available to users in the 27 EU countries beginning in March 2024 ‚ÄúThe changes we‚Äôre announcing today comply with the Digital Markets Act‚Äôs requirements in the European Union while helping to protect EU users from the unavoidable increased privacy and security threats this regulation brings Our priority remains creating the best most secure possible experience for our users in the EU and around the world‚Äù said Phil Schiller Apple Fellow ‚ÄúDevelopers can now learn about the new tools and terms available for alternative app distribution and alternative payment processing new capabilities for alternative browser engines and contactless payments and more Importantly developers can choose to remain on the same business terms in place today if they prefer‚Äù The changes for EU apps reflect the European Commission‚Äôs designation of iOS Safari and the App Store as ‚Äúcore platform services‚Äù under the Digital Markets Act In March Apple will share new resources to help EU users understand the changes they can expect That includes guidance to help EU users navigate complexities the DMA‚Äôs changes bring ‚Äî including a less intuitive user experience ‚Äî and best practices for approaching new risks associated with downloading apps and processing payments outside of the App Store Available for developers‚Äô apps around the world Apple also announced new options for streaming games along with more than 50 forthcoming reports in areas like engagement commerce app usage and more Changes to iOS In the EU Apple is making a number of changes to iOS to comply with the DMA For developers those changes include new options for distributing apps The coming changes to iOS in the EU include: As announced by the European Commission Apple is also sharing DMA-compliant changes impacting contactless payments That includes new APIs enabling developers to use NFC technology in their banking and wallet apps throughout the European Economic Area And in the EU Apple is introducing new controls that allow users to select a third-party contactless payment app ‚Äî or an alternative app marketplace ‚Äî as their default Inevitably the new options for developers‚Äô EU apps create new risks to Apple users and their devices Apple can‚Äôt eliminate those risks but within the DMA‚Äôs constraints the company will take steps to reduce them These safeguards will be in place when users download iOS 174 or later beginning in March and include: These protections ‚Äî including Notarization for iOS apps and authorization for marketplace developers ‚Äî help reduce some of the privacy and security risks to iOS users in the EU That includes threats like malware or malicious code and risks of installing apps that misrepresent their functionality or the responsible developer However Apple has less ability to address other risks ‚Äî including apps that contain scams fraud and abuse or that expose users to illicit objectionable or harmful content In addition apps that use alternative browser engines ‚Äî other than Apple‚Äôs WebKit ‚Äî may negatively affect the user experience including impacts to system performance and battery life Within the DMA‚Äôs constraints Apple is committed to protecting the privacy security and quality of the iOS user experience in the EU as much as possible For instance App Tracking Transparency will continue to work with apps distributed outside of the App Store ‚Äî asking a user‚Äôs permission before a developer tracks their data across apps or websites However the DMA‚Äôs requirements mean that App Store features ‚Äî including Family Purchase Sharing and Ask to Buy ‚Äî will not be compatible with apps downloaded from outside of the App Store When these changes come into effect in March Apple will share more detailed resources explaining the options available to users ‚Äî including best practices for protecting their privacy and security Changes to Safari Today iOS users already have the ability to set a third-party web browser ‚Äî other than Safari ‚Äî as their default Reflecting the DMA‚Äôs requirements Apple is also introducing a new choice screen that will surface when users first open Safari in iOS 174 or later That screen will prompt EU users to choose a default browser from a list of options This change is a result of the DMA‚Äôs requirements and means that EU users will be confronted with a list of default browsers before they have the opportunity to understand the options available to them The screen also interrupts EU users‚Äô experience the first time they open Safari intending to navigate to a webpage Changes to the App Store On the App Store Apple is sharing a number of changes for developers with apps in the EU affecting apps across Apple‚Äôs operating systems ‚Äî including iOS iPadOS macOS watchOS and tvOS The changes also include new disclosures informing EU users of the risks associated with using alternatives to the App Store‚Äôs secure payment processing The changes also include new steps to protect and inform EU users including: For apps that use alternative payment processing Apple will not be able to issue refunds and will have less ability to support customers encountering issues scams or fraud Helpful App Store features ‚Äî like Report a Problem Family Sharing and Ask to Buy ‚Äî will also not reflect these transactions Users may have to share their payment information with additional parties creating more opportunities for bad actors to steal sensitive financial information And on the App Store users‚Äô purchase history and subscription management will only reflect transactions made using the App Store‚Äôs In-App Purchase system New Business Terms for Apps in the EU Also today Apple is sharing new business terms available for developers‚Äô apps in the European Union Developers can choose to adopt these new business terms or stay on Apple‚Äôs existing terms Developers must adopt the new business terms for EU apps to use the new capabilities for alternative distribution or alternative payment processing The new business terms for apps in the EU are necessary to support the DMA‚Äôs requirements for alternative distribution and payment processing That includes a fee structure that reflects the many ways Apple creates value for developers‚Äô businesses ‚Äî including distribution and discovery on the App Store the App Store‚Äôs secure payment processing Apple‚Äôs trusted and secure mobile platform and all the tools and technology to build and share innovative apps with users around the world Developers operating under either set of business terms can continue to use the App Store‚Äôs secure payment processing and share their apps on the App Store in the EU And both sets of business terms reflect Apple‚Äôs long-standing work to make the app ecosystem the best opportunity for all developers Developers operating under the new business terms will have the option to distribute their iOS apps from the App Store and/or alternative app marketplaces These developers can also choose to use alternative payment processors in their EU apps on the App Store across Apple‚Äôs operating systems The new business terms for iOS apps in the EU have three elements: For apps on iPadOS macOS watchOS and tvOS in the EU developers who process payments using a PSP or by linking out to their website will get a 3 percent discount on the commission they owe to Apple Apple is also sharing a fee calculator tool and new reports to help developers estimate the potential impact of the new business terms on their app businesses Developers can learn more about the changes for EU apps on a new Apple Developer Support page and can begin testing these capabilities today in the iOS 174 beta Press Contacts Peter Ajemian

526,"Is Apple (AAPL) a Buy as Wall Street Analysts Look Optimistic?","1/4/2024","https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-aapl-buy-wall-street-143005821.html","When deciding whether to buy sell or hold a stock investors often rely on analyst recommendations Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stocks price but are they really important? Lets take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Apple (AAPL) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage Apple currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 173 on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell) calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy Hold Sell etc) made by 28 brokerage firms An ABR of 173 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy Of the 28 recommendations that derive the current ABR 17 are Strong Buy and three are Buy Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 607% and 107% of all recommendations Brokerage Recommendation Trends for AAPL Check price target & stock forecast for Apple here>>>While the ABR calls for buying Apple it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias According to our research brokerage firms assign five Strong Buy recommendations for every Strong Sell recommendation This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors giving little insight into the direction of a stocks future price movement It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements Zacks Rank our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record categorizes stocks into five groups ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) and is an effective indicator of a stocks price performance in the near future Therefore using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision ABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank In spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5 they are two completely different measures Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 128) The Zacks Rank on the other hand is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5 It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations Because of their employers vested interests these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support misguiding investors far more often than helping them On the other hand earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements In addition the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates In other words this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it But since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a companys changing business trends and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough it is always timely in indicating future price movements Should You Invest in AAPL? Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Apple the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $656 Analysts steady views regarding the companys earnings prospects as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate along with three other factors related to earnings estimates has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Apple You can see the complete list of todays Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>> It may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for Apple Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

CES officially kicks off today but Ive already seen some wild tech including a transparent TV (More on that below) In todays big story we have a release date for Apples next big product Whats on deck: Markets: The economy is entering its first super cycle in 40 years Tech: Carta is in hot water for secretly using client information Business: Tiger Woods and Nike are splitting ways after nearly three decades But first can you try this headset on? If this was forwarded to you sign up here Apples new reality On the eve of the biggest tech conference a company not officially in attendance had the days biggest news Apple which typically avoids a large public presence at CES announced the launch date of its Vision Pro a mixed-reality headset it hopes will eventually be its biggest product since the iPhone You can buy the Vision Pro online and in US Apple Store retail locations starting February 2 as long as youre willing to fork over at least $3499 Business Insiders Sarah Jackson has all the details on Apples big upcoming launch The release of the Vision Pro has been a long time coming We got our first look at it in June but the rumors about Apple launching a VR-type product had swirled for a while And with tech rival Meta having been in the space for a few years it seemed natural Apple would enter the fray But Apple doesnt launch a new product on a whim ‚Äî its last big product launch was over eight years ago ‚Äî so this release is a big deal There has also been a level of mystery surrounding the Vision Pro The initial reviews of the headset were good but it was all very cloak and dagger Journalists who tested it back in June could only do so in a private room couldnt take photos or videos and only had 30 minutes The launch of the Vision Pro feels like a make-or-break moment for virtual reality The concept of using some type of goggles to create a virtual reality has existed for decades Old-school gamers will remember Nintendos ill-fated Virtual Boy which was one of the companys biggest failures But in the almost 30 years since now feels as good a time as any for the tech to finally take off Add in the fact that a good chunk of employees are working partially from home and there are real use cases for it Beyond it feeling like a cultural turning point for the tech theres also the fact that the most valuable company in the world really wants it to work With a market cap nearing $3 trillion Apple isnt hurting But the company is facing its fair share of headwinds from a ban on Apple watches to underperformance in China one of its major markets Apple could use a big win and the Vision Pro could be just that As BIs Julie Bort previously wrote the headset could be at the core of creating a multi-billion dollar market for entertainment A recession could still be possible Talk of a soft landing

farmland In Sriperumbudur people call Apple ‚Äúthe customer‚Äù not daring to say the name of a company that prizes its secrets But some things are too big to hide Two gigantic dormitory complexes are springing up from the earth Once finished each will be a tight block of 13 buildings with 24 rooms per floor around an L-shaped hallway Every one of those pink-painted rooms will have beds for six workers all women The two blocks will house 18720 workers apiece It‚Äôs a ready-made scene from Shenzhen or Zhengzhou the Chinese cities famous for their iPhone production prowess And it‚Äôs no wonder

is chipping away at that dominance when many companies are looking to spread their work to countries other than China An estimated 13 per cent of the world‚Äôs iPhones were assembled in India last year and about three-quarters of those were made in Tamil Nadu By next year the volume produced in India is expected to double But despite almost 10 years of a ‚ÄúMake in India‚Äù initiative promoted by the country‚Äôs powerful prime minister Narendra Modi manufacturing as a share of the economy has stalled out At about 16 per cent it is a shade lower than when Modi took office in 2014 and far lower than that of China or of Japan Taiwan and South Korea when those Asian tigers took off India desperately needs more skilled jobs and factory work creates them like nothing else Last year India overtook China to become the world‚Äôs most populous country and its working-age population is speeding ahead But turning that demographic bulge into an actual advantage means making India‚Äôs workers more productive Half of them still depend on small farming Tamil Nadu might point the way forward The state of 72 million people is now succeeding in ways that have eluded India as a whole The national government started subsidising electronics manufacturing across the country in 2021 setting off a gold rush in places such as Noida next to New Delhi But for Tamil Nadu that incentive is not an essential lure TRB Rajaa Tamil Nadu‚Äôs minister of industries can rattle off the state‚Äôs inbuilt advantages: schools transport engineering graduates ‚ÄúWe never compare our growth with other Indian states‚Äù he said ‚ÄúWe chart ourselves to the growth of Scandinavian countries and how we can beat that‚Äù Rajaa and other boosters of Tamil Nadu are proud of the human capital their state has

cent of the national population Parts of Tamil Nadu are already working as industrial champions A long belt of car and car-part manufacturers stretches down the coast from its capital Chennai In the western Coimbatore valley factories specialise in die-casting and pump manufacturing There is a knitwear cluster in Tiruppur and the country‚Äôs biggest maker of matchsticks is in Sivakasi It is striking that India is plunging into such high-end goods as the iPhone India has never become internationally competitive making things such as T-shirts or sneakers getting its clock cleaned by smaller and formerly less developed countries such as Bangladesh and Vietnam This is not the first time this century that India was expected to move up the ranks of high-value electronics manufacturing Nor the first time that Tamil Nadu seemed like the best launch pad for it In 2006 Finland‚Äôs Nokia then a cellphone colossus built a big factory at the centre of Sriperumbudur‚Äôs government-planned industrial estate It was supposed to make millions of phones a year for India and the rest of the world The smartphone and the global financial crisis in 2009 knocked down those dreams But the roots never died Sriperumbudur was initially attractive because of its experience in auto manufacturing Hyundai had set up shop in 1996 soon after India opened up its economy to more foreign investment and Tamil Nadu formed its first state development agency Glassmaking and basic electrical goods followed After a lull the old Nokia site was built over by Salcomp a local company that makes high-end power chargers now for companies such as Apple The plants of a dozen other known and rumoured Apple suppliers have sprouted around it along with Samsung Dell and most other big

It will significantly increase the reach of RCS automatically With the addition of the iPhone the proportion of compatible devices could constitute 80% of all devices globally by 2025 RCS itself represents a disruption but until now it has not been perceived as a genuine source of innovation due to lacking sufficient reach Its adoption by Apple could make all the difference But above all the porting of RCS to the iOS environment marks an evolution in usage: ‚ÄúThe most important thing‚Äù Philippe Lucas concludes ‚Äúis the possibility of finally having an augmented and interoperable green bubble In future iPhone owners will no longer have to use a separate application to engage in enriched communication including group messaging with the Android world and vice versa‚Äù RCS Rich Communication Services A messaging protocol developed within the GSMA offering enhanced services (private chats group chats file transfers video calls etc) accessible via Wi-Fi or mobile connection Over The Top A service deployed by a publisher or a content provider via existing carrier networks without financial compensation"

542,"Apple: Vision Pro Might Be A Long-Term Catalyst (NASDAQ:AAPL)","2/21/2024","https://seekingalpha.com/article/4672083-apple-vision-pro-might-be-a-long-term-catalyst","Justin Sullivan/Getty Images News Justin Sullivan/Getty Images News I rate Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) as a buy as the company has the opportunity to build new growth avenues with the Apple Vision Pro I believe most of the reactions to the product are positive and the wide range of applications might make the Vision Pro a true game changer in the near future In this article I will make an effort to think about the possible applications of the Vision Pro in different fields to help you think about the potential growth avenues that might be built with this device Then I will make an approximation of Apples intrinsic value including the sales projections of the Vision Pro in the next few years taking into account the expectations of some analysts My focus on this article will be the Vision Pro but if you want to know more details about the strategy that should be taken with Apple stock I suggest reading an article that I wrote last year in which I explored Apples competitive advantages and discussed why this stock is the most special among the FAAMNGs My buy rating here is based on a long-term horizon for the next 5 years at least People might think that the Vision Pro headsets were developed not so long ago but that is so far from the truth In 2007 when Steve Jobs was Apples CEO one of the patents submitted by Apple for patent review was Automatically Adjusting Media Display in a Personal Display System which was accepted by the Patent Office This head-mounted display (HMD) patent was granted to Apple before any other AR/VR device Steve Jobs was aware of the concept but he was more focused on the iPhones launch for the first time in 2007 Then in 2017 Apple introduced ARkit which was a new framework to embed augmented reality technology with iOS 11 This technology enabled developers to produce experiences of augmented reality to be offered through applications on the iPhone or iPad Then ARkit 2 through 6 were introduced for iOS 12 through 16 at the 2018 and 2022 Worldwide Developers Conferences respectively In this way Apple was advancing gradually in the development of the Vision Pro which was launched in February 2024 I was watching several YouTube channels with over a million subscribers who were totally impressed by how ingenious the new Apples device was What impressed me was that most of these people are fans of technology and had already tested the latest Meta (META) headsets so that indicated to me that the Vision Pro has the power to impress even the most sophisticated fan When you use Vision Pro the screens project an image that is ahead of us but its not just a transparent glass through which we can see our surroundings It turns out to be a virtualization of reality where we are so Vision Pros cameras collect an exterior image which is processed by the M2 processor the same as iMACs and R1 which is a specific chip that collects all the information from the images then processes them in high dynamic range (HDR) while projecting them on two 4K screens each of which has micro-OLED technology with an incredible pixel density The device has five sensors to track the movements of the user six microphones and 12 cameras that reproduce the surrounding environment It is probably the most expensive component of the Vision Pro and what separates it from other competitors is its cameras and screens As such Vision Pro enables the user to be immersed not in the metaverse but in the real world where the experiences could be substantially improved not only in gaming where there is a huge world to explore but also in other areas In the last call for the Q1 2024 results CEO Tim Cook said that the Vision Pro included 5000 patents in the device which were built on several innovations developed over many years; for instance the hand tracking and the room mapping are driven by AI In addition the Vision Pro is starting with 1 million apps with 600 of them specifically developed for the device as Tim Cook pointed out: Vision Pro its -- when you look at the ton of use cases I mean were starting with a million apps and 600 plus that are -- have been designed particularly for Vision Pro When I look at what is coming out of Enterprise its some of the most innovative things Ive seen come out of Enterprise in a long time And so I think theres a like there is for the Mac and iPad and of course iPhone has been in enterprise since the early days of iPhone I think theres a nice opportunity there for Vision Pro as well When I looked at several videos on YouTube about the Vision Pro review I noticed that there were very interesting applications I saw one in which you have a Formula 1 car in front of you and then you can take each part of that car to assess it properly with so many details about that part This can work perfectly for those who are studying engineering to breakdown each part of an engine to understand it more easily and dynamically I saw another app where the competition of Formula 1 can be watched from the air giving a wider perspective of the different cars in competition in real time In this sense we might see different possibilities for the Vision Pro in the future Architecture might be a field where the Vision Pro could add value; imagine an architect using the glasses to see how a specific design of a house or infrastructure might fit in a specific place using this combination of virtual reality and reality An interior designer could use the device to portrait the insides of a house or a building while making changes in certain aspects These kinds of things are already made with software in the construction sector but its another level to do so in virtual reality Maybe companies like Autodesk (ADSK) Ansys (ANSS) or Nemetschek that offer software for the construction sector could develop apps or integrations that enable Vision Pro to connect with their construction software while improving the experience of designers Flight simulations could be another field where the Vision Pro could add value since future pilots could have an immersive experience as if they were in a real situation where they might polish their skills faster with higher effectiveness The other situation is more related to virtual travel where travel agencies could offer a wide range of experiences in certain places offering the chance for a person to have that experience himself feeling as if he were in that place There are lots of ways in which the Vision Pro could be used and I feel the Vision Pro has surprised consumers which is a very good sign to anticipate some projections about future sales and how important they will become for Apples total revenues Statista Statista The chart above shows a projection until the year 2028 but I will be even more conservative in my projections and include Vision Pro as part of my intrinsic value I think that the Vision Pro has a lot of prospects even when some think that the product is expensive and that its prospects are limited Apples strategy seems sound as its just the start; consumers are using and exploring the different apps available on the device Despite setting a high price for the Vision Pro Apple has not prevented consumers from buying the device The Apple Stores contribute enormously to introducing the experience to consumers unlike any other company that sells these devices Its expected that the new versions of the Vision Pro might be offered at lower prices while adding improvements; that might be a strong emotional trigger to convince new buyers to buy a cheaper and better device I think that setting a high price for the first version is an emotional strategy to capture more consumers in future versions to deliver faster growth On the other hand we should not forget that the integration of the Vision Pro with other Apple devices is another factor that might convince more consumers as the Vision Pro could be integrated with the iMac iPad AirPods and iPhone while performing different tasks at the same time; for instance while editing videos a user could expand the Macs screen in front of him using the Vision Pro According to different multiples we can see that Apple seems fairly valued: Seeking Alpha Seeking Alpha In the table above we can see that most of the multiples indicate that the stock is fairly valued or expensive; for instance the P/E in its different forms shows that Apple is fairly valued compared to the sector However a limitation of this ratio is that its assumed that Apple and its comparables have the same quality which is not necessarily the case On the other hand the PEG ratio is a multiple that calls the attention of growth investors and it indicates that Apple is more expensive than its comparables The main problem is that the ratio is not incorporating the growth opportunities associated with Vision Pro prospects Furthermore I do not use every multiple of valuation that takes the sales as a denominator such as EV/Sales or Price/Sales particularly if we are assessing a high-quality company like Apple; the reason is that these multiples do not consider the net income or the FCF which are way more important metrics to gauge the real performance of a high-quality company So the fact that Apple is more expensive than its comparables using these ratios does not tell me that much The ratios that I consider the most important ones are graded C or C+ such as P/E EV/EBIT and P/Cash Flow so according to these ratios Apple is mostly fairly valued; the P/Cash Flow (FWD) which is a very important ratio in my view is graded B+ which indicates even a reasonable price Considering that Apple has a very consistent generation of free cash flows each year I would have expected that this multiple would be way more expensive than its comparables In my view we need a method that incorporates Vision Pros growth prospects and the share buybacks impact on Apples valuation which is a very important factor that is mostly overlooked As such I propose a DCF model that will include both important factors to get a better approximation of Apples intrinsic value In this sense I will use Vision Pros assumptions made by BofA Securities analyst Wamsi Mohan and UBS analyst David Vogt This is a first approach without considering the Vision Pro and share buybacks effect: Author Author To find the perpetuity we used the formula: Perpetuity = FCF 2027/(discounted rate - g) where g = FCF growth in perpetuity which was assumed to be 9% annual The FCFs are calculated by multiplying the revenues projected by the FCF margins assumed at 26%; in this way I get the FCFs estimated for the next few years With perpetuity we calculate the present value of all the FCFs beyond 2026 Then we calculate the enterprise value using the following: Enterprise Value = Present Value of FCF (from 2024 to 2026) + Perpetuity + Cash - Total Debt Finally the intrinsic value is calculated by taking the enterprise value and dividing it by the outstanding number of shares In this way we could get $17519 per share as an intrinsic value under the assumptions presented To this intrinsic value I will need to include the value that will be generated by Vision Pro and the share buyback effect To include the Vision Pros impact I will include a present value of all the free cash flow that might be generated by the Vision Pros sales in the next few years So I will need the assumptions made by Wamsi Mohan and UBS analyst David Vogt about the sales forecast of the Vision Pro and other assumptions: Author Author I am assuming that Apple will reduce the price of the Vision Pro in the next few years so I could make a forecast according to all these assumptions: Author Author The different colors in my projections of the revenues indicate the different prices per unit assumed for the Vision Pro for those periods Notice that I consider the shipments of 78 million units for 2028 whereas the Statista chart shown above projects 126 million units for 2028 To find the perpetuity we used the formula: Perpetuity = FCF 2032/(discounted rate - g) where g = FCF growth in perpetuity which was assumed to be 6% annual So I follow the same process as the previous calculation of the intrinsic value calculating first the FCF generated by multiplying the revenues by the FCF margins of 20% in each year projected Taking the present value of the perpetuity which is the FCF generated beyond 2031 and the present value of all the FCF generated from 2024 to 2031 I added both groups to have a total present value of 294587 million for the Vision Pro So I added this number to the enterprise value previously calculated which boosted the previous intrinsic value from $17519 to $19438 per share: Author Author Now I will need to somehow include the share buybacks impact in the intrinsic value as its a very important policy used by Apple each year That impact will need to be included in the intrinsic value of $19438 per share I think that share buybacks are a very important policy that Apple frequently uses to deliver long-term value Most analysts do not incorporate this important policy in their assessments of the stock which I consider a big mistake as Apple uses an average of 80% of its FCF each year To do this I need to see the evolution of Apples outstanding number of shares in the last few years: Author Author Before the 4-to-1 split in 2020 the rate of reduction of the number of shares through the share buyback policy was between -4 and -7% annually After the split that rate declined to -33% average over the last 3 years so thats the rate that I will take to project the outstanding number of shares for the next few years: Author Author So I make a projection of the outstanding number of shares until 2027 in which that number of shares is declining by 33% each year Then the model assumes that the number of outstanding shares in 2027 will be the same beyond 2027 Thats a limitation since Apple will likely keep doing repurchases beyond 2027; nevertheless that restriction in our model will make our calculation more conservative As such I add the enterprise value calculated first where I got $17519 then I add Vision Pros projected present value of the FCFs getting $19438 and finally I divide all of this by the outstanding number of shares projected in the year 2027 getting $21298 per share Of course the intrinsic value could be boosted if the revenue growth of the current businesses is higher than my conservative assumptions; remember that I am assuming a revenue growth for Apple considering the iPhone iMac iPad accessories and services‚Äînot counting the Vision Pro‚Äîof 1% for 2024 2% for 2025 and 3% annual for the years beyond 2025 If Apple grows at 5% annual in the next few years in those segments the intrinsic value could reach $233 per share while keeping my conservative assumptions about the Vision Pro If I keep the very conservative revenue growth assumptions of the older Apple products and if the Vision Pro shows higher growth rates than expected for instance rather than 40% of annual sales growth Apple reaches 50% annual sales growth I could get $221 per share One risk is if the Vision Pro does not grow as expected because there are other devices that capture more market share or attract more consumers or if the device ends up not appealing with a large demand Both scenarios could impact my assumptions and the calculation of the intrinsic value in my model Nevertheless Apple has been working on this device for many years since 2007 showing advanced technology ahead of any competitor with a clear strategy of offering very innovative solutions applications and experiences It is really hard to believe that they do not catch the attention of many consumers particularly those who are fans of technology In addition its likely that in the next few years Apple will reduce the price of the Vision Pro while offering an even better product which could trigger an emotion among consumers to buy the product You should remember that Apple has 22 billion active devices worldwide which is a metric that is growing year by year so thats another hidden catalyst for the Vision Pro as it would be expected that a growing proportion of all those active devices would be this new glasses as more consumers would be keen to integrate the Vision Pro as part of Apples ecosystem Another risk is when an investor buy Apple stock now expecting a short-term return I believe the companys strategy is designed to reward long-term shareholders so thats an important factor to consider if you are considering adding Apple stock to your portfolio Tim Cook seems to believe in having a long view if any investor wants to buy Apple shares since a long horizon would enable your shares to capture that value thanks to excellent management execution and strong competitive advantages Probably another risk is the market cannibalization of the Vision Pro with other Apples products such as the Mac iPad or even the iPhone which could reduce the revenue growth of those products Nevertheless I think that Apple has anticipated that scenario to make the Vision Pro a part of Apples ecosystem in which each product can complement rather than substitute each other As such even when a certain degree of market cannibalization is possible I do not think that the Vision Pro is designed to replace any of the main Apples products Apple Vision Pro is a very good opportunity for Apple to build up new growth avenues in different fields that would enrich the immersive experience of the users to a level never reached before The strategy of setting an expensive price for the first version of the Vision Pro is a sound long-term strategy as its expected that Apple will make gradual improvements to the product with a better design lower weight more technology and more advanced chips at a lower price I trust in the managements execution to further develop the product so I can make decent projections for the next few years that enable me to calculate a very achievable intrinsic value under very conservative assumptions I would say that its a buy for investors who are already holding Apple but a more moderate buy for new investors who have never bought an Apple share before New investors would need to be aware that Apple delivers more value in the long term than in the short term so their horizon is an important factor to consider We should never forget that the lower the price the higher the long-term returns for our investment particularly if we are talking about Apple This article was written by Analyst‚Äôs Disclosure: I/we have a beneficial long position in the shares of AAPL either through stock ownership options or other derivatives I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha) I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Seeking Alphas Disclosure: Past performance is no guarantee of future results No recommendation or advice is being given as to whether any investment is suitable for a particular investor Any views or opinions expressed above may not reflect those of Seeking Alpha as a whole Seeking Alpha is not a licensed securities dealer broker or US investment adviser or investment bank Our analysts are third party authors that include both professional investors and individual investors who may not be licensed or certified by any institute or regulatory body"

And theyve also got into documentaries that involve sports Theres a Patriots documentary that recently came out So theyre sort of getting more involved in the sports space You can see the app here on your screen One of the key features of it really is just live scores It has live scores When you click on Upcoming Games you can see the standings Theres some gambling lines that go on there Honestly Pas it seems like a pretty surface-level app right now the app thats just launched but it doesnt quite have some of the features from some of my favorite sports apps Im thinking of maybe ESPN where you click and theres news that comes up with the app and other videos that come up with the app and sort of more content that it brings you I favorited my favorite team here the Boston Bruins Theyve played in the NHL And it just isnt really giving me a lot on the Bruins was sort of my service-level takeaway Again the app just launched Maybe therell be more sort of features to come with it PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Yeah I mean its like almost an alpha stage right now right? Because basically you can either add leagues which the NFL is not part of Like you notice the NFL is not part of it for some reason I guess because the seasons over Or you can add your favorite teams And then just the scores or upcoming games come up you cant click in you cant get any news Theres no video component yet But I think youre right Maybe its a way to drive users to maybe the Apple TV app where it has a pretty cool way-- I have it and it has a pretty cool way of notifying you when certain games are close or how to watch them and stuff So maybe that integration is coming later But right now I think the Yahoo Sports app is better right? I think the-- I think ESPN app is better for both scores and kind of like maybe some video too BROOKE DIPALMA: Yes I mean the old Google to see how your teams doing just isnt the thing anymore All of that JOSH SCHAFER: You get an app Theres always an app for that right Brooke? BROOKE DIPALMA: I do that But I truly do think that app this has been a long time coming as Apple really try to make their mark in the sports arena I mean we saw them do the halftime show with Usher Now theyve had the halftime show for quite a few years It formerly was PepsiCo It just goes to show that Apple is really doubling down trying to get in the space Of course Tim Cook is super excited about this tweeting that he cant wait to use it during the 2024 MLS season which kicks off tonight right? JOSH SCHAFER: Mm-hmm BROOKE DIPALMA: Or last night? JOSH SCHAFER: Sure BROOKE DIPALMA: Between Inter Miami CF and Real Salt Lake on Apple TV So it really just trying to see returns from this MLS partnership that they did Dont know if theyre quite seeing the returns that they had initially hoped for JOSH SCHAFER: Yeah it seems like at the surface right now the best use case is for the MLS right? Because thats where Apple has the content One of my favorite things about say the ESPN app is that ESPN has so many sports rights So when you click on a game youre able to watch the game inside that app and it sort of creates more content for you inside the app and with push notifications too as Pras mentioned So I think itll be interesting to see sort of where it goes for Apple as they get deeper into sports maybe even get more sports rights how theyre able to leverage the app BROOKE DIPALMA: I think sports right will be a game changer for this Apple TV In addition to that theyre also getting-- these stats are supplied by DraftKings right? JOSH SCHAFER: Mm-hmm BROOKE DIPALMA: So in that case you know where does that partnership evolve to? And how do they work together to ultimately grow this? JOSH SCHAFER: All about the betting lines always Brooke BROOKE DIPALMA: Always about the betting lines PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: And Tim Cook noted Auburn fan right? I think alum too So maybe thats-- he is a sports guy so well see JOSH SCHAFER: Go Tigers PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Go Tigers yeah JOSH SCHAFER: That applies to like half of the colleges in the country PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Yes Related Quotes"

551,"Decoding Apple Inc (AAPL): A Strategic SWOT Insight","2/3/2024","https://finance.yahoo.com/news/decoding-apple-inc-aapl-strategic-050307726.html","Apple Incs robust financial performance with a significant increase in net income Continued dominance in the smartphone market with the iPhone as a key revenue driver Expansion in services and wearables presenting new growth avenues Challenges from global economic uncertainties and competitive pressures Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) a global leader in technology released its 10-Q filing on February 2 2024 revealing the companys financial performance for the quarter ended December 30 2023 The filing indicates a solid financial position with net sales amounting to $119575 billion a slight increase from the previous years $117154 billion The companys net income saw a notable rise to $33916 billion from $29998 billion showcasing Apples ability to maintain profitability amidst a competitive landscape This SWOT analysis delves into the strengths weaknesses opportunities and threats as disclosed in the recent SEC filing providing investors with a comprehensive understanding of Apple Incs strategic positioning Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with CHTR Financial Resilience and Product Dominance: Apples financial health remains robust with an increase in net income to $33916 billion up from $29998 billion in the previous year This financial resilience is underpinned by the iPhones continued dominance in the market contributing significantly to the companys revenue Apples ability to maintain high-profit margins particularly in its services segment which saw an 11% increase in net sales further solidifies its financial strength The companys diversified product portfolio including the Mac iPad and Apple Watch complements the iPhone ecosystem creating a comprehensive suite of products that drive customer loyalty and recurring revenue Innovation and Brand Equity: Apples commitment to research and development with expenses maintained at $7696 billion underscores its focus on innovation The companys brand is synonymous with quality and innovation which is reflected in its strong gross margin of $54855 billion Apples brand equity is a competitive advantage that allows it to command premium pricing and maintain a loyal customer base The introduction of new products such as the updated MacBook Pro and iMac demonstrates Apples continuous effort to innovate and meet consumer demands Dependence on Key Products: Despite its financial success Apples heavy reliance on the iPhone which accounts for a significant portion of its revenue poses a risk Any disruption in the iPhones market appeal or supply chain could have a substantial impact on the companys overall performance Additionally the decrease in iPad sales by 25% indicates potential vulnerabilities in Apples product mix that need to be addressed to ensure sustained growth Supply Chain and Geopolitical Risks: Apples supply chain is complex and global with significant exposure to geopolitical risks and trade tensions particularly in Greater China where net sales decreased by 13% The companys reliance on outsourcing partners and individual suppliers for components and manufacturing also presents operational risks that could affect its ability to deliver products efficiently and cost-effectively Services and Wearables Expansion: The growth in Apples services and wearables segments presents significant opportunities With an 11% increase in services net sales Apple is well-positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for digital content cloud services and subscription-based models The wearables market also offers potential for expansion despite a decrease in sales as consumer interest in health and fitness technology continues to rise International Markets and New Technologies: Apples performance in international markets such as a 15% increase in Japan net sales highlights the opportunity for further geographic expansion Additionally the companys investments in new technologies such as augmented reality and artificial intelligence could open up new revenue streams and strengthen its competitive position in the long term Competitive Pressure and Market Saturation: The technology industry is highly competitive with rapid innovation and changing consumer preferences Apple faces intense competition from other smartphone and technology manufacturers which could erode its market share and pressure margins Market saturation particularly in mature markets poses a challenge to growth as most consumers already own smartphones and upgrade cycles lengthen Economic Uncertainties and Regulatory Changes: Global economic uncertainties including inflation and currency fluctuations can impact consumer spending and Apples international sales Regulatory changes such as those related to privacy and antitrust concerns could also force Apple to alter its business practices potentially affecting its profitability and strategic direction In conclusion Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) exhibits a strong financial foundation and brand equity driven by its flagship iPhone and a growing services segment However the company must navigate challenges such as product dependence supply chain complexities and competitive pressures Opportunities for expansion in services wearables and international markets are countered by threats from market saturation and regulatory changes Apples strategic focus on innovation and customer experience positions it to leverage its strengths and opportunities while addressing its weaknesses and threats in the dynamic tech landscape This article generated by GuruFocus is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored

Microsoft Nvidia & *now* Meta Leading in AI Era‚Äù Raymond James analyst Josh Beck said in a note to clients This year Microsoft is up 10 per cent to $405 - overtaking Apple as the worlds biggest company - Nvidia is up 44 percent to $693 and Meta formerly Facebook is up 33 percent to $459 Tesla is down 27 percent since January 1 while Apple is flat Amazon and Netflix are both up but are not seen as having the AI-fuelled potential of MnM DailyMailcom asked another analyst about MnM - and whether it was too late to invest Bret Kenwell from eToro said: It‚Äôs been a fantastic stretch for the so-called ‚ÄúMnM‚Äù trio ‚Äî Microsoft Nvidia and Meta Meta and Nvidia are up about 30 percent and 40 percent year to date and about 145 percent and 220 percent over the past year respectively Microsoft hasn‚Äôt been a slouch either up almost 60 percent over the past 12 months Can it continue? Some consolidation certainly would be reasonable given the recent run not just in these specific stocks but for the Nasdaq and S&P 500 in general Still secular tailwinds remain strong for the MnM trio By that he means there is still positive news for the three stocks in light of the rush to AI Before Beck came up with MnM on Friday there had been other - less creative - alternatives to the Magnificent Seven Bret Kenwell from eToro gives his thoughts on MnM - Microsoft Nvidia and Meta The Super Six for example would exclude Tesla while the Fabulous Five left out Apple too Beck focused Fridays note on Meta which saw shares rise 22 percent that day - gaining more than $200 billion in market value That is the biggest single-say increase in a company‚Äôs value ever for a US-traded company according to Dow Jones Market Data DailyMailcom also asked eToros Kentwell his thoughts on the three indiviuallly Read his thoughts below META Despite Meta‚Äôs meteoric rise to new highs the company initiated a dividend and added a whopping $50 billion to its buyback plan on top of a strong quarterly report Yet it only trades at 23 times forward earnings estimates which are forecast to grow almost 32% this year Metas share price was also boosted last week when it announced its first ever quarterly dividend of 50 cents a share and an additional $50 billion in share buybacks Buybacks and dividends help boost stock prices by rewarding investors with cash simply for holding stock in the company Metas first cash dividend of 50 cents a share will be paid out on March 26 and on a quarterly basis going forward NVIDA It‚Äôs easy to critique Nvidia simply based on the stock‚Äôs immense rally (and on the idea that AI is just a passing fad) Kentwell said But that‚Äôs not the case with AI ‚Äî a movement that Nvidia is at the forefront of It‚Äôs a clear leader in the AI revolution and a high-quality company at that With a $17 trillion market cap Nvidia is hardly flying under the radar anymore But it‚Äôs not as if the stock gains have come without a catalyst Earnings and sales have ballooned as have margins and free cash flow The rally isn‚Äôt simply due to feverish speculation it‚Äôs in anticipation of strong AI-fueled demand Nvidia‚Äôs valuation is a bit more stretched thanks in large part to its near-50% rally in the last three months However it would be shortsighted to forget that Nvidia spent the second half of 2023 consolidating below $500 The recent breakout has been powerful but shouldn‚Äôt be considered all that surprising MICROSOFT Microsoft is a bit more muted this year up about 8 per cent but its fiscal year wraps up in June Kentwell said After that consensus expectations accelerate calling for double-digit earnings and revenue growth in fiscal 2024 and 2025 respectively With its balance sheet strength immense cash flow and strong margins it remains a blue-chip name within mega-cap tech With an expected acceleration in earnings and sales along with its AI exposure via OpenAI and various business units it‚Äôs reasonable that Microsoft will be attractive to investors looking for safer ways to play AI All three in MnM stocks are seen as leaders in AI Nvidia has got a jump on rival chipmakers Intel and AMD on AI processors It not only makes AI chips for home and busiuness computers phones and other gadgets - but also mega powerful ones for data centers used by big businesses Microsoft meanwhile has invested billions of dollars into artificial intelligence - making it a leader ahead of Apple Google and Amazon It got attention for taking a stake in Chat GPT creator OpenAI the leading chatbot that is also now built into its Edge internet browser But it has started selling Copilot an AI assistant that can summarize an email inbox or craft a slide show for $30 per month Facebook and Instagram-owner Meta is moving into AI - with chatbots that businesses can use to talk to customers The company also launched AI tools for businesses that allows ad buyers to create and track campaigns - and get around strict rules from Apple that block cookies on apps and web browsers Nvdia which manufactures computer chips has enjoyed returns of nearly 250 percent this year and is the top performer in the S&P 500 CAN NVIDIA OVERTAKE AMAZON? Wall Streets enthusiasm about artificial intelligence has Nvidia on the verge of becoming more valuable than Amazon for the first time in two decades and the AI chipmaker is not far behind Google-owner Alphabet A 40 percent surge in Nvidia so far in 2024 has elevated its market capitalization to $1715 trillion as of mid-day trading on Wednesday only about 3 percent below Amazons $1767 trillion value and less than 6 percent below Alphabets $1812 trillion value according to LSEG data Nvidia reports quarterly results on February 21 Morgan Stanley raised its price target to $750 from $603 with analyst Joseph Moore writing in a client note that AI demand continues to surge After Nvidias stock more than tripled in 2023 it has already become the US stock markets fifth most valuable company Share what you think The comments below have not been moderated The views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline We are no longer accepting comments on this article Published by Associated Newspapers Ltd Part of the Daily Mail The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media Group"

Building at 535 Pacific Ave in San Francisco was purchased Friday by an entity that appears to be connected to Jony Ive‚Äôs design firm LoveFrom The Clint Reilly Organization has sold a historic Jackson Square structure for nearly $60 million to a business entity that appears linked to former Apple designer Jony Ive In a deal completed Friday an entity named 535 Pacific LLC paid $597 million for the Little Fox Theatre building at 535 Pacific Ave according to records filed with the county Assessor-Recorder‚Äôs Office That works out to about $1695 per square foot for the 35221 square-foot building according to documents from the Assessor‚Äôs Office The structure which ranges from three to five stories is around the corner from a collection of buildings Ive‚Äôs design firm LoveFrom has purchased over the last three years The San Francisco address listed for 535 Pacific LLC is the same given for entities used to make other purchases in the area Derek Giovanetti the contact person listed in the documents filed with the Assessor‚Äôs Office for 535 Pacific LLC was listed on a previous document filed by LoveFrom 535 Pacific LLC took out a $63 million loan related to the purchase from 535 Pacific Partners LLC Giovanetti and Ive did not immediately respond to requests for comment In an emailed statement Reilly ‚Äî who also owns The Examiner ‚Äî declined to confirm the name of the purchaser citing a confidentiality agreement but said he was ‚Äúpleased‚Äù with the deal Reilly said he‚Äôd grown attached to the Little Fox Theatre building which he‚Äôd owned since 1991 ‚ÄúThe transaction is great for San Francisco and augurs a comeback which is certainly coming in future years‚Äù he said The purchase price was well above the property‚Äôs assessed value and the going rate for commercial properties in the area The land and structures at 535 Pacific had an assessed value of $66 million for fiscal year 2022-23 In the last quarter two properties sold in the Jackson Square neighborhood One in the North Waterfront-Jackson Square area built in the 1980s fetched $279 per square foot while a smaller structure built in 1919 sold for $446 per square foot or $111 million ‚Äî less than double its $57 million appraised value Assuming Ive and LoveFrom purchased the Little Fox Theatre building the deal would be their biggest in the area and add to the $78 million they‚Äôve already spent since 2020 Over that time LoveFrom has purchased five properties in the Jackson Square block bordered by Columbus and Pacific avenues and Montgomery and Jackson streets according to the real-estate database Reonomy and records filed with the San Francisco Assessor-Recorder‚Äôs Office Those purchases include: A former employee of the university‚Äôs compliance office claims the college prioritized its image over adequately addressing complaints The Examiners Ben Kaplan sits down with mayoral hopeful Ahsha Safai to talk about his relationship with the mayor the race and upcoming labor negotiations The Golden Gate Bridge Highway & Transportation District said its five-year toll hikes will raise $139 million of a projected $220 million shortfall Ive the design guru behind the iPhone iPod and iMac founded LoveFrom in 2019 the same year he left Apple His design firm has since worked with Apple Airbnb and Ferrari among other companies according to published reports Last year Ive and Sam Altman and their respective companies LoveFrom and OpenAI began talking about collaborating to develop an AI-powered device that would be a kind of successor to a smartphone according to multiple reports The two companies have been in discussions to raise as much as $1 billion from SoftBank the Japanese conglomerate that runs the two mega-sized Vision Funds according to numerous reports This month Tang Tan who previously headed up iPhone and watch design at Apple is joining LoveFrom to lead hardware engineering of the new product Bloomberg reported in December By purchasing

area for the National Register of Historic Places The district contains The City‚Äôs ‚Äúearliest and sole surviving buildings‚Äù from the 1850s and ‚Äô60s and is remarkable for the ornateness and refinement of its structures according to the report Ive a British native wrote a May 2022 essay for the Financial Times about falling in love with Jackson Square North Beach and Chinatown when he first arrived in The City in 1989 He said he felt a debt of gratitude to the neighborhood and LoveFrom the creative collective he formed with Marc Newson had made Jackson Square its home ‚ÄúWe have

this article The Vision Pro the new virtual reality headset from Apple can transport you to Hawaii or the surface of the moon It displays high-resolution computer graphics a few millimeters from the users eyes all while allowing the user to control a desktop-like interface using their eyes and subtle hand gestures The Vision Pro provides a preview of what using a computer could be like in five years early adopters say The Vision Pro starts at $3499 After adding storage and accessories such as straps the whole package can cost as much as $4500 Thats a lot more expensive than competing headsets such as Metas Quest 3 which starts at $499 Its pricier than Metas high-end headset the Quest Pro which starts at $999 Its also more expensive even after controlling for inflation than the first iPad ($499) or the first iPhone ($499 with a two-year contract) The Vision Pro includes lots of pricey state-of-the-art parts One estimate from research firm Omdia puts the bill of materials for the headset at $1542 and that doesnt include the costs of research and development packaging marketing or Apples profit margin The most expensive part in the headset is the 125 inch Sony Semiconductor display that goes in front of the users eye Its a key component that helps the virtual experience feel more realistic than previous consumer headsets The displays have a lot of pixels and lifelike colors and are built with state-of-the-art manufacturing techniques Apple pays about $228 for the Micro OLED displays it uses according to the Omdia estimate Each Vision Pro needs two of them one for each eye Sony Semiconductor declined CNBCs request to comment for this story The Vision Pro displays are the latest example of Apple embracing a new kind of display technology at a larger scale and earlier than the rest of the electronics industry Apples usage of LCD touchscreens for the first iPhone in 2007 and its later transition to organic LEDs or OLED displays with the iPhone X in 2017 upended existing supply chains and after Apple shipped millions of units ultimately drove the cost of the parts for the entire industry down Apple has a massive effect on the display industry said Jacky Qiu co-founder of OTI Lumionics which makes materials for manufacturing OLED panels He said display makers fight for Apples business which can be make or break for these companies Apple is now the biggest player in terms of OLEDs in terms of displays They are the ones that are basically taking all the high-margin displays all the stuff that is the high-spec type of stuff that is allowing the panel makers today to become profitable Qiu said You look at the display business you either work for Apple and make the iPhone screens and youre profitable or you dont and you lose money Its as brutal as that Qiu said The Vision Pros displays are a defining feature Theyre packed with pixels and are sharper than any competing headset Its one of the main points that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg complimented when comparing the $499 Quest 3 headset to Apples headset Apples screen does have a higher resolution and thats really nice Zuckerberg said in a video posted on his Instagram page while saying that Quests screens are brighter Whats so revolutionary about the OLED displays that are in the Vision Pro the difference between Micro OLED and the OLED that you find on a television in your living room is that the pixels are actually a lot denser theyre smaller and theyre more compact said Wayne Rickard CEO of Terecircuits a company that makes materials and techniques for display manufacturing According to a teardown analysis from repair firm iFixit each Vision Pro display has a resolution of 3660 by 3200 pixels Thats more pixels per eye than the iPhone 15 which has a screen resolution of 2556 by 1179 pixels Metas Quest 3 comes in at a resolution of 2064 by 2208 per eye The Vision Pros screens are much smaller than the iPhones screen which makes the pixels closer together and more difficult to manufacture The Vision Pro displays have 3386 pixels per inch versus the iPhone 15 which has about 460 pixels per inch on its display In total Apple says the Vision Pros displays have more than 23 million total pixels Theyre some of the densest displays ever built According to iFixit 54 Vision Pro pixels can fit in a single iPhone pixel and each pixel is about 75 microns from the next pixel a measurement called pixel pitch according to Apples specifications With Micro LEDs in particular it can get down to about below 10 microns For comparison a red blood cell might be about 20 microns so half the size of a red blood cell Rickard said Apple opted for high-resolution displays so theyd be closer to simulating reality when using the headsets passthrough mode which uses outward-facing cameras to show video of the real world inside the headset It also helps users read text or numbers in virtual reality It helps remove the screen door effect of other headsets where you can see the pixels VR headsets need pixel-dense displays because the users eyes are so close to the screen TVs have significantly fewer pixels but it doesnt matter because viewers are feet away The production of this kind of display requires cutting-edge manufacturing For example most displays are built on a backplane made out of glass The Vision Pro displays are so pixel-dense that they use a silicon backplane much like a semiconductor The second most expensive part in the Vision Pro is the companys main processor which includes Apples M2 chip the same chip it uses in the MacBook Air and the R1 chip which is a custom processor to handle video feeds and other sensors on the device Bill of materials estimates dont take into account research and development costs packaging or shipping They also dont take into account capital expenditures that can add up-front costs to big parts orders but theyre useful for people in the manufacturing world to get an idea of how expensive the parts are in any given device Display technologies embraced by Apple typically come down in price after Apple makes them mainstream and as multiple suppliers compete for business South Korean suppliers like Samsung Display and LG Display have shown their interest in this technology Chinese suppliers like Seeya and BOE are also small-scale mass-produced [OLED on silicon] products said Jay Shao Omdia analyst for displays in an email He expects the costs for Vision Pro spec screens to come down in the coming years Apple declined to comment but Apple CEO Tim Cook is not a fan of cost estimates and teardowns Ive never seen one thats even close to accurate he said on an earnings call in 2015 Apple doesnt typically discuss its suppliers but in February Cook was asked about the devices price tag on an earnings call If you look at it from a price point of view theres an incredible amount of technology packed into the product Cook said He mentioned some of the most expensive parts in the device and emphasized the R&D costs that Apple spent developing it Theres 5000 patents in the product and its built on many innovations that Apple has spent multiple years on from silicon to displays and significant AI and machine learning All the hand tracking the room mapping all of this stuff is driven by AI and so were incredibly excited about it Cook continuedDont miss these stories from CNBC

632,"What Apples adoption of RCS for iPhones could mean for marketers","1/25/2024","https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-adoption-rcs-iphones-could-105600016.html","After years of resistance Apple will be adopting the RCS (Rich Communication Services) standard on iOS later this year according to multiple media reports The move will bring better text messaging interoperability between iPhones and Android smartphones For mobile marketers this could provide a compelling reason to graduate from tried-and-true SMS messaging as a way of reaching consumers Largely viewed as a more robust version of SMS messaging RCS for a long time has been supported by Google (Android) and a number of phone carriers including Verizon AT&T and T-Mobile The standard allows for richer communication than the decades-old SMS notably through stronger media-sharing capabilities However because Apple hasn‚Äôt adopted the standard an RCS message sent to an iPhone would default to the SMS format and be marked with a green text bubble versus the blue bubbles used within iMessage a long-debated tension between loyalists to iOS and Android Apple‚Äôs adoption of the standard could give mobile marketers more reason to utilize RCS for business messaging (known as RBM) and tap into perks like the ability to appear as a verified sender and send high-quality media and longer more interactive messages RCS is also different from SMS in that it doesn‚Äôt rely on a cellular signal connection By 2025 the number of active RCS users is expected to reach 21 billion globally according to Juniper Research ‚ÄúMarketers will be able to make communications more visually appealing with rich messaging capabilities of RCS such as images video and call to action buttons which can be added to messaging campaigns‚Äù said Molly Gatford research analyst at Juniper Research in emailed comments ‚ÄúThis is expected to increase consumer engagement with marketing messages and therefore make the use of RCS more attractive to marketers‚Äù Global operator revenue from RCS business messaging traffic is expected to grow from $13 billion in 2023 to $8 billion in 2025 due largely to Apple‚Äôs adoption of RCS per Juniper‚Äôs findings Among its perks RCS marketing can help brands boost their value exchange through added ‚Äúmoments of magic‚Äù explained Vartika Verma senior director of global marketing for Gupshup a conversational messaging platform For instance an airline using SMS to message a consumer could send basic flight information like a booking number but with RCS it could additionally help consumers easily select their seat or pre-plan meals for the flight ‚ÄúA lot more of those two-way interactions are now possible [with RCS] within the message window‚Äù Verma said ‚ÄúSMS can definitely send you a short link but its not rich You get hungry when you see a picture of food ‚Äî now airlines can do that‚Äù Among clients using RCS marketing some have seen engagement rates about 30-35% higher than for messages sent using SMS the executive said The standard could also be valuable over other channels like email with one Gupshup client a travel brand observing a 27-times increase in conversion rate and a 7% higher open rate when using RCS business messaging compared to email per data shared by the company Apple has confirmed that its adoption of RCS will arrive via a software update later this year according to 9to5Mac though many details are yet to be revealed The adoption will bring a number of iMessage-like features to messages between Android and iOS like read receipts and typing indicators though the company has stated that RCS messages will still show up with green bubbles on iPhones Since Apple‚Äôs announcement a number of Gupshup clients have expressed a desire to better understand RCS Verma said noting that cost efficiency could be one factor driving interest ‚ÄúThe excitement and the prep is there‚Äù Verma said Though Android currently commands a much larger share of the global mobile market than iOS Apple smartphone users account for significantly more mobile value in some aspects which could make the company‚Äôs adoption of RCS even more appealing to marketers Specifically iPhone users engage with apps on their smartphone for nine hours more in a given month than Android users and spend more on in-app purchases However iOS users are around 10% less likely than Android users to open a push notification The RCS standard has been in the works for over a decade having been chosen for adoption by the GSM Association (GSMA) in 2008 and intended to replace SMS which celebrated its 30th birthday in 2022 Google has been a major advocate for the standard ‚Äî even having offered back-end services to carriers looking to adopt it ‚Äî offering it through Google Messages (the default messaging app on Android) while pressuring Apple to adopt RCS through cheeky campaigns Despite the benefits of RCS Apple has in the past refused to adopt it instead putting its muscle behind iMessage which it doubled down on in its announcement as the ‚Äúbest and most secure messaging experience‚Äù In 2022 Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook even suggested to one individual asking about RCS to instead buy their mom an iPhone The company‚Äôs decision to adopt RCS which came in November follows pressures placed on it to designate iMessage as a ‚Äúcore‚Äù service under the European Union‚Äôs Digital Markets Act While Apple‚Äôs adoption of RCS is expected to help usher the standard into the mainstream SMS is expected to remain dominant with 93 billion subscribers forecasted for 2024 per Juniper Research Some brands have also been upping their bets on SMS marketing and over half of marketers last year planned to increase their spend on the channel Still while SMS isn‚Äôt expected to go away anytime soon its one-way nature could be a reason for some marketers to pull back ‚ÄúSMS overall in terms of its delivery in terms of its architecture global appeal ‚Äî it‚Äôs still winning‚Äù Verma said ‚ÄúBut I don‚Äôt see it as a channel to converse it‚Äôs more of a channel to communicate ‚Ä¶ if you‚Äôre expecting responses on SMS I think that time is gone‚Äù Compared to SMS RCS offers features that could build consumer trust like a verified sender badge to help distinguish against fraudulent activity End-to-end encryption has been a concern as conversations around consumer privacy intensify though Apple has said it will not use any proprietary end-to-end encryption on RCS messages For reference Google‚Äôs use of end-to-end encryption is through Messages not RCS itself according to 9to5Mac RCS marketing could become a solid alternative as marketers navigate the global rising cost of SMS a trend that is expected to slow the growth of SMS traffic over the next five years Gatford said Because of the higher costs RCS traffic has been expected to grow regardless of Apple‚Äôs adoption of the standard the exec added ‚ÄúSMS pricing is already a significant problem for many businesses and therefore in order to ensure the success of RCS as a go-to messaging channel it must be deployed with an attractive yet justified pricing model‚Äù said Gatford in emailed comments One challenge for brands integrating RCS into their strategy is the ability for consumers to respond to messages through quick-reply features tasking marketers to be prepared to manage the volume and scale of replies and ensure consumers receive a response in a timely manner Verma said In such cases the use of generative AI could help to alleviate tension she said However the channel shouldn‚Äôt be seen as a means for endless conversation Instead brands should ensure consumer behavior stays front of mind the exec said ‚ÄúAll things said and

Please give us a call at 520-458-9440 Copyright ¬© ‚Ä¢ Wick Communications Terms of Use Privacy Policy The Vision Pro Apple‚Äôs first major new product in nearly a decade in San Francisco on Feb 5 2024 The company is marketing the $3500 virtual reality headset as a computer for doing work a movie player and a gaming machine (Clara Mokri/The New York Times) About 17 years ago Steve Jobs took the stage at a San Francisco convention center and said he was introducing three products: an iPod a phone and an internet browser ‚ÄúThese are not three separate devices‚Äù he said ‚ÄúThis is one device and we are calling it iPhone‚Äù At $500 the first iPhone was relatively expensive but I was eager to dump my mediocre Motorola flip phone and splurge There were flaws ‚Äî including sluggish cellular internet speeds But the iPhone delivered on its promises Over the past week I‚Äôve had a very different experience with a new first-generation product from Apple: the Vision Pro a virtual reality headset that resembles a pair of ski goggles The $3500 wearable computer which was released Friday uses cameras so you can see the outside world while juggling apps and videos Apple calls it a ‚Äúspatial computer‚Äù that blends together the physical and digital worlds for people to work watch movies and play games Apple declined to provide an early review unit to The New York Times so I bought a Vision Pro on Friday (It costs much more than $3500 with the add-ons that many people will want including a $200 carrying case $180 AirPods and $100 prescription lens inserts for people who wear glasses) After using the headset for about five days I‚Äôm unconvinced that people will get much value from it The device feels less polished than past first-generation Apple products I‚Äôve used It‚Äôs not better for doing work than a computer and the games I‚Äôve tried so far aren‚Äôt fun which makes it difficult to recommend An important feature ‚Äî the ability to place video calls with a humanlike digital avatar that resembles the wearer ‚Äî terrified children during a family FaceTime call The headset is superb at delivering on one of its promises: playing video including high-definition movies and your own recordings in 3D that let you immerse yourself in past memories which is both eerie and cool The Vision Pro Apple‚Äôs first major new product in nearly a decade in San Francisco on Feb 5 2024 Apple‚Äôs Time Cook called it a ‚Äúspatial computer‚Äù that blends together the physical and digital worlds for people to work watch movies and play games (Clara Mokri/The New York Times) In the past decade companies such as Meta HTC and Sony have struggled mightily to sell headsets to mainstream consumers because their products were cumbersome to wear their apps were limited and they looked uncool The Vision Pro has a superior user interface better picture quality more apps and higher computing power than other headsets But it‚Äôs slightly heavier than Meta‚Äôs cheaper Quest headsets and it plugs into an external battery pack that lasts only two hours The ski-goggle aesthetic of the Apple product looks better than the bulky plastic headset visors of the past But the videos posted by early adopters walking around outside with the headset ‚Äî men I call Vision Bros ‚Äî confirm that people still look ridiculous wearing tech goggles even when they are designed by Apple The Vision Pro is miles ahead of other headsets I‚Äôve tested in making an immersive 3D interface simple for users to control with their eyes and hands I let four colleagues wear the headset in the office and watched all of them learn to use it in seconds That‚Äôs because it‚Äôs familiar to anyone who owns an iPhone or a similar smartphone You‚Äôll see a grid of app icons Looking at an app is equivalent to hovering over it with a mouse cursor; to click on it you tap your thumb and index finger together making a quick pinch The pinch gesture can also be used to move around and expand windows Brian Chen the personal tech columnist for The New York Times reviews the Vision Pro Apple‚Äôs first major new product in nearly a decade at the NYT San Francisco bureau‚Äôs office on Feb 5 2024 The company is marketing the $3500 virtual reality headset as a computer for doing work a movie player and a gaming machine (Clara Mokri/The New York Times) The Vision Pro includes a knob called the Digital Crown Turning it counterclockwise lets you see the real world in the background while keeping digital windows of your apps in the foreground Turning it clockwise hides the real world with an opaque background When using the headset for work you can surround yourself with multiple floating apps ‚Äî your spreadsheet can be in the center a notes app to your right and a browser to your left for example It‚Äôs the 3D version of juggling windows on a computer screen As neat as that sounds pinching floating screens doesn‚Äôt make working more efficient because you need to keep twisting your head to see them I could tolerate juggling a notes app a browser and the Microsoft Word app for no longer than 15 minutes before feeling nauseated The least joyful part of the Vision Pro is typing with its floating keyboard which requires poking one key at a time I had planned to write this review with the headset before realizing I wouldn‚Äôt make my deadline There‚Äôs an option to connect a physical keyboard but at that point I‚Äôd rather use a laptop that doesn‚Äôt add weight to my face The Vision Pro can also work with Mac computers where you can mirror the screen into the headset as a virtual window that can be expanded to look like a large display In my tests there was a consistent lag ‚Äî each keystroke took a fraction of a second to register virtually and the mouse cursor moved sluggishly I also instinctively wanted to control the Mac with pinches even though it‚Äôs not set up to work that way which was frustrating Next I tried the headset in the kitchen loading a pizza recipe in the web browser while I grabbed and measured ingredients Moving around while looking through the camera I became nauseated again and had to remove the headset The Vision Pro is most comfortable to use while seated Apple advises people to take breaks to reduce motion sickness Video calling is now an essential part of office life and here the Vision Pro is especially inferior to a laptop with a camera The headset uses its cameras to snap photos of your face that are stitched into a 3D avatar called a Persona which Apple has labeled a ‚Äúbeta‚Äù feature because it is unfinished Personas are so cringe that people will be embarrassed to use these in a work call The Vision Pro produced an unflattering portrait of me with no cheekbones and blurred ears In a FaceTime call with my in-laws they said the blur conjured 1980s studio portrait vibes One of my nieces a 3-year-old turned around and walked away at the sight of virtual Uncle Brian The other a 7-year-old hid behind her father whispering in his ear ‚ÄúHe looks fake‚Äù Video is where the Vision Pro shines When streaming movies through apps such as Disney+ and Max you can pinch the corner of a video and drag it to expand it into a jumbo high-resolution TV; some movies such as ‚ÄúAvengers: Endgame‚Äù and ‚ÄúAvatar 2‚Äù can be viewed in 3D The picture looks much brighter and clearer than the quality in Meta‚Äôs Quest products Audio quality on the Apple headset is excellent but the speakers are loud so you‚Äôll need AirPods if you want to use them in public spaces The headset‚Äôs two-hour battery life is not long enough to last through most feature-length movies but in my experience this turned out to be moot because I couldn‚Äôt watch movies for more than 20 to 30 minutes before needing to rest my neck and eyes from the heavy headset Not many games have been made for the headset yet I tried some new Vision Pro games such as Blackbox which involves moving around a 3D environment to pop bubbles and solve puzzles It looked nice but after the novelty wore off my interest fizzled out It‚Äôs tough to recommend the Vision Pro for virtual-reality gaming when Meta‚Äôs $250 Quest 2 and $500 Quest 3 headsets have a deeper library of games The Vision Pro is the start of something ‚Äî of what exactly I‚Äôm not sure But the point of a product review is to evaluate the here and now In its current state the Vision Pro is an impressive but incomplete first-generation product with problems and big trade-offs Other than being a fancy personal TV it lacks purpose Most striking to me about the Vision Pro is for such an expensive computer how difficult it is to share the headset with others There‚Äôs a guest mode but there‚Äôs no ability to create profiles for different family members to load their own apps and videos So it‚Äôs a computer for people to use alone arriving at a time when we are seeking to reconnect after years of masked solitude That may be the Vision Pro‚Äôs biggest blind spot Were always interested in hearing about news in our community Let us know whats going on!

659,"Four Tech Stocks To Consider Amid The New Bull Market","2/23/2024","https://finance.yahoo.com/news/four-tech-stocks-consider-amid-120602421.html","The stock market continues to deliver one surprise after another for investors Most major indices opened the new year with record highs setting the momentum for the year ahead and crossing over into the bull market territory A businessperson contemplating modern technology while using the BrandGraph Platform By the end of January 2024 the S&P 500 climbed towards its fourth consecutive record high with investors riding on the surge following blowout performance by consumer and technology stocks Throughout much of the month the S&P remained steady gaining around 217% The tech-heavy Nasdaq continues to leave much of Wall Street on the edge of their seats At the close of January the Nasdaq advanced 10% with large-cap stocks faring better than small-cap shares The communications sector remained the saving grace for the Nasdaq and investors with communication stocks adding 44% during the month and being the index‚Äôs best-performing sector alongside financials which gained 31% Elsewhere the Wall Street Journal reported that the Dow Jones Industrial Average started the year on somewhat rocky territory but the index quickly made up near the end of the first trading month of the year On January 22 the index advanced 04% adding 138 points and ended above 38000 for the first time Overall Wall Street continues to ride on this momentum taking leaps and bounds and hoping to keep the fire burning for longer despite economic headwinds and several sore spots that could leave the market bruised and investors out in the cold Analysts are ready to jump back into the market pulling together some of the most rewarding stock picks investors should add to their portfolios before the market begins to advance full steam ahead There‚Äôs a lot that can be said about Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) however the company remains a market leader mostly due to the popularity of its products including the iPhone and Mac computers While the company has gained a massive market share in recent years due to the advancement of technology and the widespread availability of its products there‚Äôs still a lot of steam left in the company For starters Apple has generated a lot of attention surrounding their Apple ecosystem which sees consumers using mostly Apple devices including phones computers headsets and earphones smart watches and even banking The company continues to elevate the user experience with cutting-edge software and user interface while simultaneously looking to churn out record-setting profits for most of its business segments including services which recently hit record profits The company posted its first quarterly earnings for the fiscal year 2024 at the beginning of February In total the company posted quarterly revenue of $1196 billion an increase of 2 percent year over year Elsewhere quarterly earnings per diluted share was up 16% year over year ending the quarter at $218 Apples services including iTunes AppleCare Apple Pay and licensing hit a record of $2312 billion for Q1 2024 The digital content and software segment continues to witness positive growth on the back of customer demand and advancements in software capabilities in a highly competitive market Last year AAPL shares gained nearly 25 percent throughout the 12 months and during the first few trading weeks of 2024 shares were already up by 2 percent There‚Äôs one thing if not many that Apply continues to do right and that‚Äôs retaining customers boasting customer loyalty and providing a rounded service including their product line-ups 2024 will be yet another massive year for artificial intelligence (AI) with companies such as Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) looking to spearhead the industry and gain traction in the race towards innovation Consumer demand coupled with industry competition always brings out the most competitive side of any company and this has perhaps worked mostly in AMD‚Äôs favor last year The company ended 2023 on a high note following its Q4 2023 earnings results The company posted $62 billion in revenue with a gross margin of 47% Total operating income and net income were $342 million and $667 million respectively for the reported period Earnings per share were slightly below expectations although that depends on who you might ask with EPS for Q4 2023 ending at $042 per share Now looking at the full-year performance there‚Äôs a lot to be excited about Total reported revenue for the full fiscal year of 2023 ended at $227 billion with the gross margin standing at 46% On a non-GAAP basis earnings per share was roughly $265 while gross margin was around 50% AMD is witnessing staggering support from large-scale customers something which is helping their bottom-line performance Most of their business segments including data services such as data centers clients gaming and embedded technology have reported a positive year of growth Elsewhere the company is hoping to further invest in the advancement of its artificial intelligence segment and has already gone to partner with major players such as Microsoft in recent months to deliver high-end AI-powered hardware engines The company expects to report Q1 2024 revenue of roughly $54 billion and a non-GAAP profit margin of approximately 52 percent Microsoft (MSFT) isn‚Äôt taking the backseat anytime soon and neither are they planning to back down from other major contenders such as Nvidia (NVDA); Amazon (AMZN) or Google (GOOG) The company continues to generate substantial profit from its line of consumer and commercial products however they‚Äôre seemingly far past those early days of doing business by selling computer software Like their contenders Microsoft is now in the business of AI The company has both the resources and know-how to develop some of the most advanced and highly sophisticated AI-powered tools and software - and that‚Äôs exactly what they‚Äôre doing The company continues to pursue innovations in the artificial technology front with AI-powered Bing and Microsoft 365 Copilot being their most coveted headlines last year Not only this but the partnership with ChatGPT creators OpenAI has given them another edge above their competitors Other segments such as cloud computing which falls under Microsofts dynamic products and services segment are witnessing a strong performance with the company reporting a revenue increase of 21% while Dynamics 365 revenue growth increased 27 % Yet this success hasn‚Äôt come without shedding some fat Last year the company announced layoffs for its HoloLens and GitHub teams among others This has enabled the company to rather focus its attention and resources on service and product segments that are more driven towards AI-powered capabilities On the financial side Microsoft reported Q2 2024 revenue of $62 billion an increase of roughly 18 percent and up 16 percent in constant currency Business segments such as Office commercial products and Office consumer products grew 15% and 5% respectively Investors who managed to scoop up MSFT shares during the company‚Äôs post-pandemic slump saw stocks skyrocket by roughly 55% last year On a year-to-date basis MSFT is up close to 12% with many analysts expecting shares to continue on this pace in the remainder of the year Then there‚Äôs Snowflake (SNOW) a cloud and data company that integrates third-party applications to help companies make better sense of their data Just as the case may be with AI data is perhaps the second-best powerhouse for investors this year and there are many reasons why investors can get excited about the data-driven future For starters experts suggest that roughly 90 percent of all data currently available were generated in the last two to three years This only shows that there is seemingly endless opportunity for companies such as Snowflake What‚Äôs more Snowflake currently has around 9000 commercial and corporate customers This is only a drop in the ocean considering that there are close to more than 300 million businesses worldwide The limit to which Snowflake can expand is perhaps unknown at least for now Yet investors aren‚Äôt sleeping on Snowflake Warren Buffet‚Äôs Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK) holds more than $12 billion worth of SNOW stocks as of last year Outside of Berkshires portfolio Buffet owns a staggering 612 million SNOW shares When you begin to follow the money you understand why the Oman of Omaha is dead set on holding as many SNOW shares as possible for the remaining future For the third quarter of the fiscal 2024 financial year the company reported product revenue of $698 million translating into 34 percent year-over-year growth Outside of technology the company reported a net revenue retention rate of 135% and continues to hold its performance obligations of $37 billion representing a total 23% year-over-year growth SNOW shares have close to double their value over the last 12 months with stock performance up 1539% year to date Analysts are positive that the company could be bringing a new set of eyes to the stock market in the coming months due to soaring performance and the long-term positive turnaround SNOW can provide investors Looking around there are countless new opportunities for investors to take advantage of the new bull market and getting a head start is better than holding out until stock prices come down While the market continues to remain volatile due to economic headwinds and Wall Street uncertain of when the Federal Reserve will begin loosening its monetary policy in the coming months investors are instead

668,"Apple: This Tech Giant Is Hugely Undervalued (NASDAQ:AAPL)","2/5/2024","https://seekingalpha.com/article/4667499-apple-q1-earnings-hugely-undervalued-upgrading-strong-buy","Justin Sullivan Justin Sullivan In my previous article about Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) I assessed Apple and elucidated why we should disregard the move by Chinese authorities to ban Apple devices for employees of state-owned enterprises At that time the fair value stood at $224 with a projected future price of $3089 In this article I will reassess Apple using the updated financial information available from Q1 2024 As you will observe Apple is significantly undervalued with even the most conservative model indicating a fair price of $27629 and a future price of $40314 Moreover considering my previous explanation regarding Chinas not as unfavorable as believed coupled with the increased fair price of Apple I am upgrading the rating to a strong buy Seeking Alpha Seeking Alpha After reporting earnings Apple shares declined by around 4% due to a 13% sales decline in China and weakness in the iPhone sales Nevertheless Apple beat in Revenue and EPS Apple FQ1 2024 Apple FQ1 2024 iPhone sales have increased 597% from the same quarter in the previous year while Mac sales have increased by 058% Meanwhile iPads have a huge dive of 252% The revenue of the worldwide smartphone market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 353% throughout 2028 Accessories have decreased by 1131% from the same quarter a year ago Nevertheless in FY2023 accessories displayed a decrease of 3% similar to the decrease displayed by iPhone and iPad of 2 and 3% respectively This showcases that the vast majority of Apple buyers buy their accessories directly from Apple (like covers) Therefore in the valuation section I will make this segment grow at the same pace as device sales Services are the big promise for Apples growth as they have displayed a decent 11% growth since the same quarter a year ago This segment can be categorized into apps repairs and Apple Pay The largest contributor to this segment is the App Store The revenue of the worldwide apps market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 858% Its estimated that in 2022 consumers spent $868 billion in the App Store Apple charges around 30% for apps and in-app purchases therefore we can estimate that in 2022 the App Store generated around $26 billion in revenues If we apply the CAGR of 858% to the App Store we can estimate that for 2023 it could have earned around $282 billion For other apps some sources estimate that Apple could have earned around $265 billion If we assume that this grows at the 858% CAGR of the Apps Market we can estimate that for 2023 Apple generated around $339 billion in addition to the $282 billion generated by the App Store Then there is Apples payment services Some sources estimate that in 2022 it earned around $19 billion The US fintech market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 1646% With this we can estimate that for 2023 Payment Services generated around $22 billion in revenues Finally there are the repair services that Apple offers The consumer electronics repair market is forecasted to grow at a rate of 25% AppleCare is speculated to have generated around $85 billion in 2021; therefore if we project that estimate to 2023 using the 25% CAGR of the repairs market we can estimate that for 2023 AppleCare generated $893 billion in revenues Lastly in order to predict how much Apple earned in repairs I will subtract all the results I previously obtained from the 2023 Services revenue of $852 billion This calculation yields a result of $12 billion Apples revenue has sustained an annual growth rate of 75% since 2018 Operating income has outpaced this growth expanding at a rate of 112% annually Meanwhile net income has been the fastest-growing metric achieving an 116% growth rate Since my previous article released in Q4 2023 revenue has increased by 065% while operating income has surged by 376% Net income exhibited even stronger growth at 412% surpassing the other two metrics Margins have also improved notably The operating margin rose from 2982% in Q4 2023 to 3076% while net income increased from 2531% to 2616% Authors Calculations Authors Calculations Authors Calculations Authors Calculations Apples debt load has significantly decreased since my last analysis At the time of my previous article the debt load totaled $12393 billion whereas it now stands at $10804 billion reflecting a reduction of $1589 billion In contrast cash reserves have increased by approximately $116 billion bringing the current cash reserves to $731 billion Authors Calculations Authors Calculations Furthermore free cash flow has improved compared to the previous assessment In my prior coverage FCF stood at $867 billion whereas it now stands at $9327 billion indicating a 757% improvement The FCF margin has also increased to 242% up from the previous 227% This improvement is attributed to the increase in cash from operations rising from $1105 billion to $11643 billion and the reduction in CapEx which decreased from $109 billion to the current $956 billion Authors Calculations Authors Calculations Authors Calculations Authors Calculations Authors Calculations Authors Calculations In this article I will present two valuation scenarios: the first scenario is based on analysts estimates while the second scenario reflects my own estimates The table below contains all the current data available for Apple as of the latest Q1 2024 filing CapEx D&A (Depreciation and Amortization) and interest expenses will be calculated with margins tied to revenue aligning with the logic that increased production requires additional investment While this principle is typically more applicable to industrial companies incorporating it into the model adds a layer of conservatism As previously mentioned the first model will be based on the available estimates found on Seeking Alpha As you can see EPS estimates indicate mid-high single-digit growth throughout 2026 However there is a significant spike of 2351% growth projected for 2027 followed by a more moderate growth rate of 1172% Nonetheless for my model I will only utilize the data for 2024 and 2025 Seeking Alpha Seeking Alpha Revenue estimates do not reflect such high growth rates Throughout 2028 revenue is expected to grow at mid-single digits with the only exception being 2027 where revenue is forecasted to grow by 834% For revenue I will also solely incorporate estimates for 2024 and 2025 Seeking Alpha Seeking Alpha Finally to project revenue beyond 2025 I will employ a forward revenue growth rate of 204% and for net income I will use the 3-5 year long-term EPS growth rate of 963% This growth rate will also be applied in the DCF model To determine the perpetuity growth rate one would need to divide the growth rate by the difference between the growth rate and the WACC Authors Calculations Authors Calculations This preliminary model reveals a clear undervaluation result The fair price is suggested to be $27629 representing a 486% upside from the current stock price Meanwhile the future price (assuming the metrics composing the equity continue to evolve at the same trend observed from 2018 to 2024) should be around $40114 translating into an annual return of 195% As previously stated this second model will be grounded in the available market trends for each of the segments in which Apples products could be classified As outlined in the overview section sales of devices are expected to grow at a rate of 353% apps at 858% repairs and AppleCare at 25% Apple Payment Services at 1646% and accessories at the same rate as devices 35% since nearly everyone purchasing an expensive iPhone tends to buy a case and a screen protector The totals derived from these calculations are displayed below To project net income I will utilize the net income margins derived from analysts estimates which you can find in the previous model just below the EBITDA table Authors Calculations Authors Calculations This model appears more optimistic than the previous one as it suggests a fair price of around $30073 indicating a 618% upside from the current stock price The model indicates that by 2029 the stock should reach a price of $43927 translating into annual returns of 227% The largest risk I perceive is the potential decline in iPhone Mac and iPad sales which could significantly challenge Apples position In such a scenario Apple would face two options: either innovate further or immediately reduce prices However reducing prices could potentially tarnish Apples reputation as a prestigious brand Moreover licensing iOS is not a favorable option as it would eliminate the iPhones competitive advantage in terms of interface superiority The second risk associated with my thesis involves market pessimism Prior to writing this article I noticed other analysts issuing sell and hold ratings Historically when the majority sentiment leans towards negativity it often forecasts a downturn in the stock in the short term Lastly regarding concerns about China posing a risk and potentially rendering Apple stock worthless I have already addressed this issue in my initial article about Apple I explained why Apple would likely remain relatively stable by unfavorable developments in China In conclusion the comprehensive analysis of Apples financial performance and market trends underscores a promising outlook for the tech giant Through meticulous examination two distinct valuation models shed light on Apples potential trajectory The first model rooted in analysts estimates indicates a fair price of $27629 presenting a compelling 486% upside from the current stock price Moreover the projected future price of $40114 suggests an annual return of 195% based on the observed trends from 2018 to 2024 Conversely the second model anchored in market trends offers a more optimistic view projecting a fair price of approximately $30073 translating to a remarkable 618% upside Furthermore the model anticipates a target price of $43927 by 2029 with an annual return of 227% Despite inherent risks including potential sales declines and market pessimism Apples unwavering commitment to innovation and strategic resilience positions it favorably for sustained growth and continued market leadership in the ever-evolving technology landscape Finally due to the positive result from both models I am increasing my rating on Apple from buy to strong buy This article was written by Analyst‚Äôs Disclosure: I/we have no stock option or similar derivative position in any of the companies mentioned but may initiate a beneficial Long position through a purchase of the stock or the purchase of call options or similar derivatives in AAPL over the next 72 hours I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it (other

669,"Globalstar: Stocks Apple Surge Is Fading (NYSE:GSAT)","2/6/2024","https://seekingalpha.com/article/4667974-globalstar-stocks-apple-surge-is-fading","Yuichiro Chino/Moment via Getty Images Yuichiro Chino/Moment via Getty Images Earth is a small town with many neighborhoods in a very big universe‚Äï Ron Garan Shares of telecommunications infrastructure provider Globalstar Inc (NYSE:GSAT) surged dramatically since May 2023 as the companys agreement with Apple Inc (AAPL) nudged it towards breakeven Owing to that arrangement FY23 revenue is slated to increase ~50% over FY2022 (Q4 earnings expected February 23rd) The stock has come back down off that big rally in recent trading however With rich valuation metrics but significant excess capacity on its satellites in the 5G sweet spot the recent beneficial owner buying merited a deeper dive An analysis follows below Yahoo! Finance Yahoo! Finance Globalstar Inc is a Covington Louisiana-based provider of satellite and terrestrial connectivity services (voice and communications) - through its constellation of low Earth orbit satellites - as well as asset-tracking products As of September 30 2023 the company had 773000 subscribers to its mobile satellite services including consumers businesses and government agencies Originally a 1991 joint venture between defense contractor Loral Space & Communications and QUALCOMM Incorporated (QCOM) Globalstar launched in first satellites in 1998 filed for bankruptcy in 2002 emerged from it in 2004 and went public in 2006 raising net proceeds of $1166 million at $17 per share The stock trades around $160 a share translating to an approximate market cap of $3 billion 2022 Investor Day Presentation 2022 Investor Day Presentation The company provides mobile satellite services [MSS] that can connect to ~99% of the worlds population communicating through a network of terrestrial gateways each with coverage of 700000 to 1000000 square miles Once a signal from a user has been authenticated Globalstars system establishes the voice or data channel to complete the communication via a gateway to a public switched telephone network cellular or other wireless network or the internet The companys satellite system also communicates with terrestrial tracking devices which includes the Internet of Things (IoT) November Company Presentation November Company Presentation Even though Globalstar has one reporting segment it has four business lines: Wholesale satellite capacity; Terrestrial wireless; Commercial IoT; and Legacy services Wholesale satellite capacity includes the leasing of the companys excess satellite capacity (bandwidth) which has the ability to support a 50-fold increase in its customer base It is the operator for certain satellite-enabled services offered by Apple a deal that was inked in September 2022 As part of that agreement Globalstar will launch a whole new constellation of satellites through SpaceX (SPACE) to support Apples services in 2025 with the latter picking up 95% of the tab through $252 million in pre-payments for the formers services which includes the ability of iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max owners to send emergency messages without cellular coverage Owing to that arrangement Wholesale satellite capacity generated revenue of $834 million in the first nine months of 2023 (YTD23) up 268% from $226 million in YTD22 Terrestrial wireless is a big part of Globalstars future The company acquired FCC authorization to provide broadband services over 115 MHz of its licensed 24 GHz MSS spectrum (aka Band 53) in 2016 and has now received approval in 11 countries The advantage of this authorization is that it is exclusive meaning no sharing obligations and little congestion or interference that menaces unlicensed spectrum bands for satellite communications - as well as integration into the cellular ecosystem for satellite-augmented LTE (long-term evolution) and 5G services It is already integrated into technologies from Nokia Oyj (NOK) (radio support) and Qualcomm (chipset) which will drive Band 53 towards commercialization Furthermore Globalstar onboarded privately held XCOM Labs technology while adding its founder and former Qualcomm CEO (Dr Paul Jacobs) as its new leader in August 2023 Several other XCOM engineering executives were also brought aboard Commercial IoT will leverage the companys satellite and wireless technologies to launch two-way direct-to-device modules with non-terrestrial network (NTN) standardization Put in laymens language its current best use case is the monitoring of connected cars (fleets) electrical grids and oil fields which will drive a $104 billion opportunity by 2035 according to GMSA Intelligence Between subscription services (472812 as of September 30 2023) and equipment IoT generated YTD23 revenue of $269 million representing a 29% improvement over YTD22 The final business is Globalstars Legacy services which houses its now phased-out but still supported Duplex service - the companys satellite phones - and its SPOT services and equipment sales designed to connect people and assets in remote locations around the world These legacy products and services contributed YTD23 revenue of $600 million down 2% from YTD22 Remarkably Globalstar hasnt delisted despite not trading above $5 a share since 2008 This oddity has been made possible by a share count that has risen from 749 million in 2007 to ~19 billion today thanks in large measure to various financing arrangements with Thermo Capital Partners which became the companys largest shareholder after it emerged from bankruptcy in 2004 Currently its ownership interest is just shy of 60% Shares of GSAT have not traded meaningfully above $2 since 2017 save three brief forays after news releases in February 2021 (Qualcomm including Band n53 into its new 5G modem) August-September 2021 (iPhone 13 to use satellite connectivity) and September 2022 (the aforementioned iPhone 14 emergency connectivity announcement) That said Globalstar stock has nearly doubled (even after the recent pullback in the shares) off the 2023 low of $085 set in May as the company moves towards breakeven on a GAAP basis on a 60% surge in YTD23 revenue due to the Apple collaboration Globalstars Q3 2023 metrics were somewhat consistent with its YTD23 numbers posting breakeven net income on a GAAP basis and Adj EBITDA of $320 million on revenue of $577 million versus a loss of $011 a share and Adj EBITDA of positive $122 million on revenue of $376 million in Q3 2022 representing a 53% surge at the top line As for Street consensus it was an in line quarter at the bottom line with the top line beating by $40 million Based on range midpoints the new management team stated that it expected to generate Adj EBITDA of $1224 million on revenue of $2225 million for FY23 up 113% and 50% (respectively) from FY22 The top line forecast was suggestive of a meaningful deceleration (to 40%) in the companys 4Q as the Apple agreement cycles through With the spike in its Adj EBITDA the companys net leverage is in solid stead at 22 based on managements FY23 outlook However it should be noted that $200 million of its $3393 million of obligations is at 13% interest (due 2029) where 4% must be paid in cash with the other 9% can be paid in-kind (or cash) Street analysts currently have three buy ratings and one hold rating on the stock BRiley Financial ($375 a share price target) is the only buy-rated firm with a price target proffered on the shares currently On average they expect Globalstar to lose $001 a share (GAAP) on revenue of $2261 million in FY23 followed by a loss of $001 a share [GAAP] on revenue of $2515 million in FY24 representing only an 11% increase at the top line Board member James Lynch remains steadfastly bullish purchasing 175 million shares of GSAT at an average price of $177 on behalf of Thermo Capital on December 18-29 2023 From a P/E or price-to-sales basis there is no reason to invest in Globalstar Inc The enticing aspect of Globalstar is its excess spectrum that can handle a 50-fold increase over its current customer base In 2017 Straight Path was purchased by Verizon Communications Inc (VZ) for $31 billion after a bidding war with AT&T Inc (T) simply for access to its spectrum This same dynamic may eventually seduce a concern like Apple into paying a significant premium for access to the space Globalstar is trying to rent out It

Apples stock is currently trading at 27 times the consensus calendar 2024 earnings-per-share estimate among analysts polled by FactSet (This article uses calendar years for all estimates because some companies including Apple have fiscal years that dont match the calendar) Alphabet Incs Class A shares (GOOGL) are trading at a P/E ratio of about 20 times the consensus calendar 2024 estimate while Meta Platforms Inc (META) trades at about 20 times its consensus 2024 EPS estimate Here is a list of the Magnificent Seven stocks that led last years rally for the S&P 500 SPX sorted by marker capitalization and including expected compound annual growth rates through calendar 2025 based on consensus estimates among analysts polled by FactSet Estimates for the full S&P 500 are at the bottom of the table Apple is expected to grow its earnings at an annual pace of 82% over the next two years while increasing its annual sales at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5% Analysts expect much higher growth rates for EPS and sales for Alphabet and Meta and those stocks trade at much lower P/E valuations than Apple does Even the S&P 500 is expected to increase EPS and sales more quickly than Apple through 2025 The benchmark US index trades at 193 times weighted aggregate consensus EPS estimates for 2024 - much lower than Apples P/E of 27 The P/E multiple on Apple has basically doubled over the last five years and increased by 50% in 2023 wrote Barclays analyst Tim Long in a downgrade note this week He added that Apples current valuation has reached a high-water mark Long was one of two Wall Street analysts who called attention to Apples diminished growth prospects in the first trading week of the new year He cut his rating to underweight and lowered estimates for the March quarter citing incrementally weak iPhone 15 data out of China and muted enthusiasm for the forthcoming iPhone 16 We believe the continued period of weak results coupled with multiple expansion is not sustainable Long wrote We also believe 2024 will bring more services risk to light Apples services business increased at a 9% rate in fiscal 2023 (which ended Sept 30) but Long is expecting services growth to grow 10% in fiscal 2024 and then slow to 8% in fiscal 2025 Services has been a big bright spot of consistent growth for Apple in the last few years Another analyst Gil Luria of DA Davidson picked up coverage of Apple shares last week with an neutral rating and a price target of $166 noting that he believed the current share price reflects expectations for significant resumption of growth which is less likely without an innovation breakthrough Read more here: Apples stock needs to get unstuck and its innovation rut may not be helping Apple needs a new growth engine in the form of a new product or landmark service Clearly Apple needs a new growth engine in the form of a new product or landmark service The companys $3499 Vision Pro mixed-reality headset will be available in US stores and online Feb 2 with pre-orders starting Jan 19 but it is an expensive product in a market that has yet to really take off Apple doesnt comment on unannounced products and keeps close guard over any secret projects it may have under development So investors will be in the dark for a while until other new product plans are unveiled That is part of the mystique of the company but it is also a bane for long-term investors The company is of course dealing with the law of large numbers: As its revenue number hits greater heights Apple will have a tougher time posting the sort of double-digit growth it last did in fiscal 2018 and in the Covid-19 pandemic boom year of fiscal 2021 with an anomaly of 332% growth The low single-digit growth analysts now forecast for Apple seems hardly worthy of its stocks current multiple Apple still has plenty of defenders Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives recently pounded the table for the stock saying the growth demise story of Apple being spun by bears is a dynamic we have seen constantly over the past decade and this is just another chapter in that book Ives says that with 240 million iPhones ripe for upgrades both the iPhone and services by his estimates are poised to reaccelerate in fiscal 2024 and now is a golden opportunity to own Apple for the next year This is an existential question that investors must ask right now The additional pressure of a potential US Justice Department case looking into how Apple exerts control to lock in users adds more uncertainty Investors will have to decide for themselves if Apple has dramatically better growth ahead of it If not the stocks paltry but reliable dividend and its stock buybacks may not be enough to satiate Wall Street Philip van Doorn contributed to this article

Apple has already spent a year considering that question The introduction of the answers is still months away Until then investors should expect a bumpy ride But if you‚Äôre there for it if you buy the dips I think you‚Äôll make money down the road Apple‚Äôs AI vision is based on the two areas where it made its reputation client devices and safety A recent paper by Apple scientists explains it Apple plans to install its large language model onto its devices by using flash memory and reading the data in large chunks These chunks are defined as ‚Äúneurons‚Äù taken out of memory as new questions are posed Apple thinks this technique can let it run LLMs that are twice the size of the Dynamic memory available increasing inference speed up to 500% Current LLMs also have a huge Garbage In Garbage Out problem When you ‚Äútrain‚Äù software on bad data you get bad answers Apple is working to license legitimate data to solve this problem This is in contrast to ChatGPT backed by Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) ChatGPT wants to take copyrighted data for free and run Generative AI through its Azure cloud Apple‚Äôs view is a big risk but it could result in big rewards for APPL stock Apple plans to tie its AI to the iPhone through the Siri spoken interface Contrast this with Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) which just laid off people from its speaking interface and device units Like Microsoft Google wants to run AI through its cloud Apple is also consolidating its AI work in Texas telling 121 workers in San Diego to move or leave the company This could send some talent to rivals But the move means Apple is past the point of thinking about how its AI will work Implementation is usually the work of a single unified team All will be revealed in early June when Apple holds its Worldwide Developers Conference The event will be held at its Cupertino headquarters and be fully available online It may be the most important Apple event since the 2007 launch of the iPhone A host of new tools are due to be launched While working on its next revolution Apple must maintain excitement for its current offerings Judging from the crowds I saw at an Atlanta Apple store over the holidays there‚Äôs little to fear Apple has enormous customer loyalty even for older models Apple also has more control over its supply chain and distribution than any company this side of Lululemon (NASDAQ:LULU) It‚Äôs this control that let Apple earn gross margins of 44% in its most recent quarter Those margins aren‚Äôt going down The risk is in the volume of iPhone sales That‚Äôs still half of the business But remember that higher-margin services are now one-quarter of revenue Apple is considered a dark horse in AI because it‚Äôs focused on the broad consumer market which will take time to develop For the next year the biggest gains will come from businesses Enterprises will be spending billions building their own LLM models loading them with databases built over the last two decades That‚Äôs why Microsoft is now worth slightly more than Apple having nearly doubled its stock gains in the last year The spread accelerated over the last few months But that‚Äôs also why a smart investor will buy more Apple than Microsoft stock over the next few months It‚Äôs cheaper and by this time next year your patience will be rewarded As of this writing Dana Blankenhorn had LONG positions in MSFT GOOGL and AAPL The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer subject to the InvestorPlacecom Publishing Guidelines Dana Blankenhorn has been a financial and technology journalist since 1978 He is the author of Technology‚Äôs Big Bang: Yesterday Today and Tomorrow with Moore‚Äôs Law available at the Amazon Kindle store Tweet him at @danablankenhorn connect with him on Mastodon or subscribe to his Substack Artificial Intelligence Cloud Consumer Discretionary Retail Software Technology Blue-Chip Stocks Article printed from InvestorPlace Media https://investorplacecom/2024/01/apple-stock-is-a-dark-horse-bet-on-ai/ ¬©2024 InvestorPlace Media LLC Stocks to Buy Stocks to Buy Todays Market Stocks to Buy Crypto & Blockchain Stocks to Buy Stocks to Buy Stocks to Buy Financial Market Data powered by FinancialContent Services Inc All rights reserved Nasdaq quotes delayed at least 15 minutes all others at least 20 minutes Copyright ¬© 2024 InvestorPlace Media LLC All rights reserved 1125 N Charles St Baltimore MD 21201 Not Yet a Premium Subscriber?

684,"Apple: Accept The Gift Move On (NASDAQ:AAPL)","1/1/2024","https://seekingalpha.com/article/4660598-apple-accept-the-gift-move-on","Petra Sch√ºller/iStock via Getty Images Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) investors dont appear to fully understand how the stock had a remarkable year disconnected from how bad the business actually performed during 2023 The tech giant went all year without growing yet the stock ended the year trading right off all-time highs My investment thesis remains ultra Bearish on Apple with the hope current shareholders use this gift to unload shares at a premium valuation Source: Finviz Apple shares were up nearly 50% for the year starting 2023 just below $130 The company failed to report a single quarter of growth during the year and the tech giant has limited prospects for excessive growth in 2024 due to missing out on the generative AI demand surge Source: Seeking Alpha The problem is that most investors think Apple rallied due to the successful ability of the tech giant to generate growing profits Too many investors just judge the company based on the performance of the stock and appear to have completely missed the lessons from the 2000 Internet bubble and the 2021 Covid bubble Stocks become detached from logical valuations all the time and alert investors to take advantage of these dislocations by selling the stock otherwise the gifts are given back Everyone should be well aware of how Zoom (ZM) surged to over $500 on Covid demand and now trades for only $72 The market convinced a lot of people Zoom was worth over $120 billion yet the 100%+ growth rates were clearly not sustainable and the company was hardly generating $4 billion in annual revenues In a similar manner Apple has seen the stock rally due to Magnificent 7 hype The big tech stocks surged during 2023 due to AI hype for NVIDIA (NVDA) and Microsoft (MSFT) and to a lesser extent Google (GOOG) At the same time Meta Platforms (META) completed a year of efficiency but investors need to step back and ask what has Apple delivered to warrant a massive rally in the stock The company has now reported 4 consecutive quarters of declining sales The forecast is for Apple to squeak out less than 1% growth in the important holiday quarter just ended followed by barely 2% sales growth in the March quarter Apple has the promising Vision Pro headset launching possibly in February soon but the company is nowhere to be found in generative AI technology The latest estimate has Apple delivering only 500000 mixed-reality units for 2024 with sales in the $175 billion range based on a $3500 cost Source: Ming-Chi Kuo medium All while Apple is running into patent issues with the Apple Watch The International Trade Commission has banned sales of the Watch due to a patent from Masimo (MASI) but the Federal Circuit court has paused the ban for now At best Apple appears set for a long-term software fix to avoid the dispute on most Watch models Apple enters 2024 trading at nearly 30x FY24 EPS targets Yet the base case is for the tech giant to grow EPS in the 7% to 8% range in the next couple of fiscal years Even under the best scenario the stock should trade at ~15x forward EPS targets or ~$99 in order for investors to generate solid total returns The odd part of this scenario is investors have other examples when investor brand loyalty trips up investing decisions Coca-Cola (KO) has been one of the most popular stocks to own in the last 50 years yet the stock massively underperformed the market in the last decade per the below chart Source: Seeking Alpha A similar theme with Apple is a stock still trading at an excessive forward PE multiple compared to the growth The market usually isnt willing to pay more than 2x the growth rate yet Coca-Cola currently trades at 21x 2024 EPS targets with a forecast for minimal 4% growth An investor can probably stretch a long-term growth target in the 6% to 7% range with 2024 subdued due to potentially deflationary pressure in the sector The key here is Coca-Cola still trading at 3x the normalized EPS growth rate and Apple falls right into that same category Investors need to realize the growth story for Apple is now all centered on Services which is constantly under pressure from regulators now The tech giant doesnt have a software solution to where enterprise customers will potentially pay double the price for new AI technology like Microsoft with CoPilot Apple Services grew 9% in FY23 to reach $85 billion and analysts are generally forecasting a rebound towards growth in the 15% range Services are still only ~22% of the business limiting the impact on overall growth Source: Six Colors After a period of weak growth for Services due to Covid pull forwards with people locked at home Apple has forecasted maintaining double-digit growth The Services sector would provide about $12 billion in additional revenues this year to reach the 15% growth rate Apple reported $383 billion in FY23 revenues so Services would contribute only 3% to total growth in FY24 despite the solid 15% growth rate Investors have long not seemed to understand that Services growth is impressive but the amount is hardly material to the overall business due to the massive $300+ billion annual revenues from the products division led by the iPhone In essence Apple has to produce revenue growth from other categories in order to really move the needle to warrant the current stock valuation The company forecasts iPhone growth in the December quarter but the Apple Watch patent issues and tough comps in iPad and Wearables including the Watch will lead to revenue challenges in these categories Our dead money research going on 2 years now correctly forecasts how Apple would run into problems growing due to issues with new product development Neither the Apple Car nor the AR/VR device has reached the market yet and the company just reported an FY with sales declining 3% Investors were also informed the stock could make an irrational run to $200 or more One cant always predict how influential analysts and other external factors will impact a stock Source: Seeking Alpha/SFC With Dan Ives from Wedbush Securities gaining in popularity and pushing $250 price target on the stock despite Apple literally reporting horrible quarterly results the stock has flown to $200 to end 2023 The stock would reach an incredible market cap of $4 trillion and the stock would trade at 35x FY25 EPS targets due to a rally based purely on multiple expansion What ultimately matters is that Apple is only forecast to earn $656 per share in FY23 and a 15x P/E multiple just gets the stock to $100 Even if one goes out to the $712 EPS targets for FY25 and applies a 20x P/E multiple Apple would only be worth $142 or ~$24 below where we predicted the stock would be dead money for 4 years The key investor takeaway is that investors need to understand the gift from the stock rally in 2023 Apple could definitely rally more in 2024 but investors need to understand the current disconnect between the stock here and the results being reported by the company At some point in the next couple of years investors are likely to face a scenario where Apple trades below $150 and the fear is the stock falling even further One of the worst scenarios in investing is giving up gains due to being greedy and the easy scenario is to lock in gains here and move on If youd like to learn more about how to best position yourself in under valued stocks mispriced by the market in 2023 consider joining Out Fox

it will update its iPhone app in Europe to allow users to buy in-app subscriptions and audiobooks In most regions Apples App Store rules prohibit companies such as Spotify from billing users directly within the app Apple says app makers should instead use Apples App Store billing service which takes a cut of up to 30% But a new law in Europe called the Digital Markets Act goes into effect in March and will require companies it calls gatekeepers such as Apple to open up their online services to allow smaller competitors access In Apples case it requires the company to allow third-party developers to distribute iPhone apps outside the App Store as well as bill their customers directly Apple hasnt yet revealed how it will change its software and policies to comply with the DMA although it said it would do so in SEC filings In 2021 Apple CEO Tim Cook criticized the law while it was being debated saying that it would not be in the best interest of users The changes Spotify announced Wednesday can be seen as a stake in the ground showing how it interprets the DMA before Apple reveals its implementation Spotify was heavily involved in lobbying European Union antitrust regulators in favor of this outcome It is the first major example of how a popular app plans to take advantage of the DMA For years even in our own app Apple had these rules where we couldnt tell you about offers howmuch something costs or even where or how to buy it We know pretty nuts Spotify wrote in a blog post The DMA means that well finally be able to share details about deals promotions and better-value payment options in the EU Spotify said it will use the new regulation to allow users to subscribe to Spotify Premium allow users to buy audiobooks and run promotional campaigns all within the app The company will also allow iPhone users to directly download other Spotify apps from its website such as Spotify for Artists it said The move is unlikely to immediately threaten Apples services business which includes the fees from the App Store and totaled $85 billion in sales in the 2023 fiscal year Europe is a relatively small market and Apple believes that its App Store can compete through security and convenience But it is a sign that Apples margins on software distribution continue to be under fire from regulators around the world However EU is just ~7% of App Store spend and our survey work shows Apple remains well-positioned to compete with consumers overwhelmingly preferring App Stores unmatched privacy ease of use and seamless OS integration Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring wrote in a note in December Spotify had already shifted away from using Apples billing for subscriptions years ago with less than 1% of users paying Apple instead of subscribing directly But changes from the DMA in Europe could help it expand margins and sign up new subscribers more easily Got a confidential news tip?

It‚Äôs all about motivation) Sun made workstations and crossed over with Apple in various ways As a result people talked about a merger of the two companies as far back as 1988 As Owen Linzmayer notes in his tremendous (and in great need of an update) book Apple Confidential 20 the deal almost happened by the fall of 1990 The idea was that Sun CEO Scott McNealy would become COO of both companies Apple backed out at the last minute The possibility of Apple and Sun merging arose again in December 1995 prompted by fear of a post-Windows 95 Microsoft With Microsoft still years away from hitting its zenith both Sun and Apple had good reason to be afraid for their futures Even without Microsoft Apple was doing plenty to hurt itself The company put out digital cameras and games consoles instead of focusing on core products Cupertino also made a disastrous clone Mac deal that cost the company money and watered down its brand McNealy met with Apple‚Äôs board at The St Regis hotel in New York City to begin working out details of a stock swap that would as with the previous deal put the Sun CEO in charge Ultimately negotiations fell apart as Apple announced massive losses of $69 million By the end of 1996 everything had changed Steve Jobs was back at Apple then-CEO Gil Amelio was on the rocks and Apple was primed for a comeback But things could have been very very different Daily round-ups or a weekly refresher straight from Cult of Mac to your inbox Our daily roundup of Apple news reviews and how-tos Plus the best Apple tweets fun polls and inspiring Steve Jobs bons mots Our readers say: Love what you do -- Christi Cardenas Absolutely love the content! -- Harshita Arora Genuinely one of the highlights of my inbox -- Lee Barnett The weeks best Apple news reviews and how-tos from Cult of Mac every Saturday morning Our readers say: Thank you guys for always posting cool stuff -- Vaughn Nevins Very informative -- Kenly Xavier"

To earn $500 per month or $6000 annually from dividends alone you would need an investment of approximately $1160250 or around 6250 shares For a more modest $100 per month or $1200 per year you would need $232050 or around 1250 shares Read This: $1M Bet On This Healthcare Stock? Check Out These 3 Penny Stocks Insiders Are Aggressively Buying To Calculate: Divide the desired annual income ($6000 or $1200) by the dividend ($168 in this case) So $6000 / $096 = 6250 ($500 per month) and $1200 / $096 = 1250 shares ($100 per month) Note that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time How that works: The dividend yield is computed by dividing the annual dividend payment by the stocks current price For example if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and is currently priced at $50 the dividend yield would be 4% ($2/$50) However if the stock price increases to $60 the dividend yield drops to 333% ($2/$60) Conversely if the stock price falls to $40 the dividend yield rises to 5% ($2/$40) Similarly changes in the dividend payment can impact the yield If a company increases its dividend the yield will also increase provided the stock price stays the same Conversely if the dividend payment decreases so will the yield AAPL Price Action: Shares of Apple fell 36% to close at $18564 on Tuesday Read More: This Jeff Bezos-backed platform has made real estate investing as easy as ordering stuff on Amazon Read how you can invest as little as $100 in its offerings Image: Shutterstock ACTIVE INVESTORS SECRET WEAPON Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 news & everything else trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!

Some of them have become friends and others I hadn‚Äôt seen for a long time‚Äù Back in 1984 Macintosh engineer Andy Hertzfeld had told Levy ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre all maniacs People want to be computer scientists but we are also hackers trying to make Macintosh incredibly small and tight and fast‚Äù And Levy‚Äôs book cites CEO John Sculley‚Äôs observation that the Mac team almost exuded ‚Äúsome spiritual force mesmerizing people‚Ä¶ Excitement showed on everyone‚Äôs face‚Äù Andy_Hertzfeld_1985_(cropped) ‚Äì photo by Tony Wills ‚Äì Creative Commons via Wikipedi But Levy makes a counterpoint ‚ÄúDay by day the evidence accumulated that they had it within their power to create something a quantum leap better than anything the industry indeed the world had ever witnessed They believed they could make a dent in the universe‚Äù And whatever scale of reverberations might lay ahead Levy had already heard this particularly far-reaching pronouncement from a 28-year-old Steve Jobs ‚ÄúComputers and society are out on a first date in this decade and for some crazy reason we‚Äôre just in the right place at the right time to make that romance blossom‚Ä¶‚Äù Dan‚Äôl Lewin the Computer History museum‚Äôs president and CEO warmly opened the event ‚Äî and then told the audience ‚ÄúThis one is special‚Äù since Lewin had also led the initial launch of the Macintosh during his time at Apple Lewin believes history is about the present as much as the past ‚Äî a conversation between both eras he said bringing a chance to ‚Äúreflect forward‚Ä¶ and ideally make the world a better place‚Äù And then Lewin added almost as an aside that changing the world had been Douglas Engelbart‚Äôs intent from the very beginning‚Ä¶ Working over at Xerox‚Äôs legendary PARC R&D center Engelbart had engineered (and eventually demoed) the ideas which ‚Äúbegot all of these things‚Äù ‚Äî including the idea of the mouse and of overlapping application windows In 1994 Levy wrote that Engelbart remained at least somewhat overlooked while ‚ÄúHis vision was at the mercy of those he inspired‚Äù Specifically Levy recounted the tale of Engelbart‚Äôs legendary demonstration for eight people from Apple where an excited Steve Jobs ‚Äúnearly exploded‚Äù when he said‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúWhy aren‚Äôt you doing anything with this? This is the greatest thing! This is revolutionary!‚Äù The first panel included Susan Kare creator of all the Mac‚Äôs icons and fonts as well as three development team members Macintosh engineer Bill Atkinson remembered demonstrating the Mac‚Äôs predecessor the Lisa to Engelbart and getting some impactful advice: ‚ÄúIn your quest to make something user-friendly be sure you don‚Äôt lock out the power user who wants to go fast later‚Äù That very night Atkinson added a feature still in use today ‚ÄúThe fact that there are keyboard shortcuts I credit a little goading from Doug Engelbart‚Äù The panel also remembered how the Macintosh project had originally been started in 1979 (and supervised for its first year) by Jef Raskin who had written the manuals for the Apple II But while Rafkin started the project he told Levy that ‚ÄúIt was clear that Macintosh was the most interesting thing at Apple ‚Äî and Steve Jobs took it over‚Äù Speaking in January Macintosh engineer Andy Hertzfeld said Rafkin deserved a lot of credit ‚Äúfor putting together the vision of the Macintosh which was if we could make a computer that was inexpensive and easy to use we could sell computers by the millions‚Äù Hertzfeld says that even though Rafkin left the team his original vision stuck with the project throughout its development Steve Capps added that ‚Äúthe whole team ‚Äî from manufacturing manuals to software to hardware ‚Äî was 100 people And that‚Äôs just unheard of today‚Äù Levy‚Äôs book says the team started as ‚Äúa scrappy assortment of outcasts and mutts‚Ä¶‚Äù The audience applauded when Susan Kare remembered the positivity and encouragement she‚Äôd experienced from Steve Jobs Levy‚Äôs book also notes that in January of 1983 Steve Jobs scrawled three words onto an easel ‚ÄúReal artists ship‚Äù But Bill Atkinson remembered another way Jobs motivated them ‚ÄúHe said ‚ÄòReal artists sign their work‚Äô And he brought around a piece of white paper and sharpies and all of us got to sign on them ‚Äî and then he had those engraved on the hard tooling for the case So if you take off the back of an original Mac all of us have signed it He wanted us to take pride in our work‚Äù Levy captured more of that sentiment in his book ‚Äî remembering his 1984 interview with Steve Jobs ‚ÄúI look at most of the people I get to work with as artists‚Äù Jobs had said ‚ÄúI look at myself as an artist if anything‚Äù And when Levy said ‚ÄúReally?‚Äù Jobs had joked ‚ÄúSort of a trapeze artist‚Äù ‚ÄúWith or without a net?‚Äù ‚ÄúWithout‚Äù But then Jobs said seriously ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a way of expressing feelings Wanting to put something back into the world‚Äù While we spend our lives eating the food that others have grown ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a wonderful ecstatic feeling to create something that puts it back in the pool of human experience and knowledge‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúI‚Äôm one of those people who think that Thomas Edison and the light bulb changed the world a lot more than Karl Marx ever did‚Äù Levy himself appeared on the final panel along with Chris Espinosa Apple‚Äôs longest-serving employee and former Apple Chief Evangelist Guy Kawasaki And Levy remembered that using computers at that time ‚Äúwas like throwing messages over a fence‚Äù ‚Äî whereas opening folders on a Mac or using a cursor felt like finally interacting with the digital world ‚ÄúThat was the inflection point that I was seeing right at that moment‚Äù The museum also held a panel with the marketing team ‚Äî Andy Cunningham Dan‚Äôl Lewin and Mike Murray ‚Äî who remembered how Apple‚Äôs Board of Directors had originally demanded that they not broadcast their soon-to-be-famous Super Bowl ad Murray said even after their eventual triumph he continued feeling a pressure to succeed ‚ÄúThe technical team was just so brilliant and the work they had done ‚Äî it was just so extraordinary taking from Lisa and taking from PARC and putting it all in this small box They had worked so hard ‚Äî and we couldn‚Äôt fail them‚Ä¶ Though it was imperfect for the marketplace at the time we had to get it out there and we had to make it stick‚Äù Levy spoke to Jobs before the launch who insisted his motivation was a love for the users the product and the company that Apple could become ‚ÄúIf we fail that will mean my entire worldview is all wrong‚Äù And Jobs went on to predict they‚Äôd sell two million by the end of the next year He was wrong Levy‚Äôs book notes that even in its first five years barely one million Macs were sold (‚ÄúIt almost failed‚Ä¶‚Äù Levy writes ‚ÄúThe Macintosh factory kept churning out gorgeous boxes that gathered dust in dealerships‚Ä¶ Apple would experience months where it moved no more than five thousand Macs‚Äù) Apple showed a quarterly loss; it laid off 20% of its workforce and ‚ÄúThe board decided finally that Jobs was the problem‚Äù Just 16 months after the launch Steve Jobs left Apple ‚Äî not to return until 1997 In Levy‚Äôs book the Mac ultimately makes inroads with the arrival of serious business applications like the desktop publishing software PageMaker The Macintosh was upgraded with more memory and a second plug-in floppy drive ‚Äî and crucially a redesigned ‚ÄúMac Classic‚Äù was released for under $1000 So in its second five years from 1989 to 1994 Apple sold roughly 10 million Macintoshes In his book Levy called the Mac ‚Äúbut a step in a path that was probably inevitable the trail leading to a Digital Nirvana where all information all music all pictures all transactions and all mental activity gets parsed into seething bits of ones and zeros‚Äù But still ‚Äî it was ‚Äúthe crucial step the turning point‚Ä¶‚Äù Pogue told the audience at the Computer History Museum that the Macintosh was the result of people who‚Äôd worked for ‚Äúinsanely long hours for insanely low pay ‚Äî because they believed in their mission‚Ä¶‚Äù And when he asked his audience to stand if they‚Äôd ever worked on the Macintosh ‚Äî dozens did At the end of the night Lewin also acknowledged all of the people who‚Äôd worked on the hardware ‚Äî ‚Äúthe manufacturing infrastructure and everything else Because software‚Äôs pretty and there‚Äôs a lot of good stories about marketing and everything else but those who had anything to do with hardware ‚Äî associated with any of these products ‚Äî I just want to acknowledge the fact that we weren‚Äôt able to put it all on stage‚Äù And the audience applauded loudly At the end of the night the museum invited anyone who‚Äôd worked in the Mac division to join a group photo for the museum‚Äôs collection (Computer History Museum) Community created roadmaps articles resources and journeys for developers to help you choose your path and grow in your career"

partners who compensate us This may influence which products we write about and where and how the product appears on a page However this does not influence our evaluations Our opinions are our own Here is a list of our partners and heres how we make money 45 For Apple users Apple Pay Later may be an especially convenient way to delay full payment on a purchase without incurring interest or fees Apple is the newest entrant into the ‚Äúbuy now pay later‚Äù space Its classic pay-in-four plan known as Apple Pay Later is similar to other BNPL plans but promises no interest or fees making it a particularly affordable credit option for borrowers You can use Apple Pay Later to make online and in-app purchases up to $1000 and eligible users can apply in the Apple Wallet mobile app ¬ª COMPARE: The best buy now pay later apps Loan amount $75-$1000 Payment structure Pay-in-four plan Interest 0% Availability Available online and in-app Conducts soft credit check Yes Minimum credit score None Late fee No late fee Other fees No other fees Option to reschedule a payment No Pauses account when payment is missed Yes Apple Pay Later divides your purchase into four equal installments with the first installment due at checkout and the remaining three installments due every two weeks until the loan is paid off For example if you use Apple Pay Later to make a $400 purchase you‚Äôll pay $100 at checkout You‚Äôll then have three remaining installments ‚Äî each $100 ‚Äî spread out over six weeks The first payment is taken from the debit card you use to check out Future payments are managed in the Apple Wallet mobile app where you can change your payment method make payments early make extra payments or pay off the loan entirely You can also view the total amount due for Pay Later loans in the next 30 days Apple Pay Later is available for online and in-app purchases but the merchant must accept Apple Pay ¬ª MORE: Apple announces BNPL feature Apple Pay Later Whether you should use Apple Pay Later depends on your financial situation Weigh the pros and cons below to decide whether it‚Äôs the right fit for you No interest or fees: Apple Pay Later charges zero interest or fees which makes this a particularly affordable way to access credit especially compared with other financing options like a credit card where you can accrue interest and fees each month depending on your repayment behavior Convenient application and approval: If you already have an iPhone or iPad with access to Apple Pay Later you can apply for a Pay Later loan directly from your device with no hit to your credit score For Apple users this may be a more convenient option than setting up an account with a different BNPL provider Consumer-friendly features: Apple Pay Later has several built-in features that help protect users For example if you miss a payment Apple won‚Äôt approve you for additional Pay Later loans until you‚Äôve caught up which can help you avoid overextending yourself You also can only check out with a debit card Many BNPL providers let you tie your account to a credit card which means you‚Äôre paying for credit with credit Autopay flexibility: You aren‚Äôt required to opt in to autopay to check out with Apple Pay Later Though autopay can be a convenient way to make payments it can also lead you to overdraft your bank account if you don‚Äôt have enough money on your debit card to cover an installment If you do check out with autopay you can turn it off at any time Also if your payment is declined while autopay is enabled Apple will automatically turn off autopay to prevent overdrafts Credit reporting: Apple reports payment history for Apple Pay Later loans to the credit bureau Experian That means other lenders can see your Apple Pay Later loan information if they pull your Experian credit report which could help prevent overextension across credit products According to Experian this reporting isnt currently factored into credit scores but may be in the future Small loan amounts: Apple Pay Later offers loans only up to $1000 which is smaller than those of some BNPL providers If you want to break up a large purchase like a new computer or furniture you may not be able to use Apple Pay Later Only one type of payment plan available: Apple doesn‚Äôt offer a monthly financing option which other BNPL providers do Monthly plans let you break up payments over a longer period ‚Äî think three months to five years ‚Äî which can help you finance a larger purchase These plans can come with interest though and are not always a good fit for borrowers Not available for in-store use: Apple Pay Later is available only for online and in-app purchases which means you can‚Äôt use Apple Pay Later to shop in stores unlike most other BNPL providers You can now use ‚Äúbuy now pay later‚Äù to check out at most retailers The type of payment plan ‚Äî and whether it charges interest or fees ‚Äî depends on the BNPL provider so it‚Äôs important to pay close attention to the loan terms you‚Äôre offered at checkout For some users BNPL is a smart way to break up a purchase especially if you get a zero-interest offer and are positive you can afford the installments Getting approved may also be easier compared with credit cards or loans because there‚Äôs no minimum credit score requirement But BNPL is still a form of debt and there are risks The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau released a study in September 2022 raising concerns about inconsistent consumer protections the ease of debt accumulation and overspending and data harvesting and monetization Another CFPB study from March 2023 identified BNPL users as more likely to show signs of financial distress BNPL pros BNPL cons Zero-interest plans available No minimum credit score required Available at most major retailers during checkout Some plans may charge interest Some plans may charge fees Payments may not be reported to the three main credit bureaus Easy to overspend Disputes and returns can be challenging NerdWallet recommends using BNPL only for necessary expenses Though BNPL can be a convenient and low-cost payment option you‚Äôre still taking on debt and it‚Äôs rarely a good idea to go into debt for a nonessential purchase Approval for Apple Pay Later is based on your credit report details about your purchase and any previous payment history you may have with Apple Pay Later Every purchase you make is a separate loan and requires individual approval To get approved you‚Äôll need to be at least 18 years old and be a US citizen or a lawful resident with a valid US address thats not a PO Box You might need to verify your identity with a driver‚Äôs license or other state-issued ID You‚Äôll also need to update your iPhone or iPad to the latest version of iOS or iPadOS and set up two-factor authentication A valid debit card is required to check out with Apple Pay Later Apple may conduct a soft credit pull when you apply for Apple Pay Later This won‚Äôt affect your credit score Though there‚Äôs no minimum credit score required users with a 610 FICO score or lower may have a harder time getting approved according to Apple‚Äôs website Apple Pay Later is similar to pay-in-four plans offered by Affirm and PayPal which also come with no interest or fees But Affirm and PayPal offer monthly payment options with larger loan amounts and Affirm is available for in-store purchases Interest Terms Fees Affirm 0% for pay-in-four 0%-36% for monthly financing Pay in four installments due every two weeks Pay monthly with terms of

slide in its stock price that opened 2024 it ceded the title of the world‚Äôs most valuable company to Microsoft late last week The Supreme Court chose not to hear Apple‚Äôs appeal of an antitrust ruling forcing it to allow alternative in-app payment options which could cut Apple‚Äôs 30% App Store commission And a federal appeals court ruled the company could not import Apple Watches with pulse oximeters built in as patent litigation with health tech company Masimo plays out in court While some of these issues are just flukes of timing analysts say it could symbolize a shift in where business is going Apple is largely a device company While it has a robust services arm Apple‚Äôs key business is selling iPhones Apple Watches MacBooks and iPads‚Äîa business that analysts say has been slowing Microsoft has some devices but it‚Äôs more of a services company today Microsoft has made itself a leader in the nascent AI sector reportedly owning a 49% stake in AI chatbot titan OpenAI

good news in the last week as well While iPhone sales have been lackluster‚Äîespecially in China where it faces significant competition from local companies‚ÄîApple now dominates the smartphone market

the world‚Äôs most valuable brand with 74% growth in its brand value in just one year Both Apple and Microsoft are slated to report their new set of quarterly earnings in the coming weeks The picture of how each company is performing‚Äîand what is becoming more valuable to forward-looking investors‚Äîwill come into sharper focus then As the year begins it‚Äôs also a time to take stock of security

how AI might be used to make systems and the code behind them more secure Samsung Galaxy S24 series smartphones at a media preview event in Seoul (Photo by JUNG YEON-JE/AFP via Getty Images) While Apple may now have the title as the world‚Äôs top cell phone manufacturer the more-than-decade-long champion Samsung is nipping at Apple‚Äôs heels with a new launch that has AI at its core The Galaxy S24 unveiled this week brings AI to consumers by marrying some of the potentially most helpful features for everyday users with a popular smartphone interface The Galaxy AI feature has a new

hottest tech companies in the US Its top-of-the-line GPUs which are commonly seen as some of the best to facilitate the current AI boom has increased the focus and amped up the importance in what it does And that means Nvidia is putting together a new lobbying and policy team Last year Nvidia had only spent $350000 on lobbying next to nothing compared to tech giants Alphabet ($109 million) and Meta ($146 million) and a fraction of rival chip makers AMD ($27 million) and Intel ($5 million) according to OpenSecrets figures Nvidia‚Äôs new policy arm reported on by Forbes‚Äô Richard Nieva

Amazon getty Omkhar Arasaratnam has spent most of his career working in the realm of cybersecurity As the general manager of the Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) which is part of the Linux Foundation he works to combat security threats to open source software which he estimated comprises about 90% of commercial software out there I talked to him about the threats‚Äîand solutions‚Äîin front of us in 2024 This conversation has been edited for length and clarity Where are the biggest cybersecurity threats coming from now? Arasaratnam: If we‚Äôre to fast forward December 31 2024 and we‚Äôve got the balance beam out what you‚Äôre going to see is the majority of breaches are going to be these rather pedestrian well-known security exploits Maybe there will be a little bit of sizzle in terms of some really novel attacks ‚Ä¶If we go back to something like the MOVEit security vulnerability it was spring of last year that we first started seeing that exploit That was a SQL injection SQL injection was first discussed as a novel security issue more than 25 years ago If I recall it was Christmas Day of 1998 There was a post to a security mailing list saying ‚ÄòHey this kind of thing could be a problem‚Äô What I come back around to is absolutely as technology evolves there‚Äôs going to be all these other interesting areas that we need to protect that maybe weren‚Äôt as much of a concern before But I think where the majority of issues are going to continue to occur in 2024 is going to be in the basics: authentication good patch management practices And the incidence will occur as a result of those protections not being in place Does AI play a role in cybersecurity? Arasaratnam: One of the ways that we believe artificial intelligence and large language models can help us is by leveraging them to help secure open source software August of last year we launched a challenge with DARPA‚Äîthe Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency who brought us such things as the internet who are apt to facilitate these kinds of moonshot challenges‚Äîto challenge the community and say ‚ÄòHey we think this new technology could be used to secure and eliminate entire classes of problems in open source software‚Äô That SQL injection that keeps cropping up for the last 25 years If we could figure out how to use large language models to eliminate those classes of vulnerability from the open source code base that would be really cool How do you think this would be done? Arasaratnam: We rely on three big buckets The most basic‚Ä¶is called a linter It‚Äôs called a linter because much like a lint brush would pick up lint on clothing it just gets rid of the basic crusty stuff Think of that as almost an automated editor that goes through and makes sure that everything conforms to the right style Much like writing prose when you write code everyone‚Äôs got a different style It makes sure that all the stylistic things like putting an enter before an open bracket is conformed to in a way that‚Äôs consistent Over and above that we have static analysis Static analysis is a little more sophisticated When your code is being compiled it‚Äôll go in and say ‚ÄòAh you know what? That looks like a potential security exploit‚Äô and give you a warning So you the developer can correct the code Beyond that there are some things that can only be determined at runtime Not when the code is being compiled but when it‚Äôs executing on a computer That‚Äôs called dynamic testing There‚Äôs a number of different methods of doing dynamic testing including things called fuzzers which are used to just send random input and see how the program will react My prediction [and] DARPA‚Äôs prediction is that there‚Äôs going to be an even more sophisticated set of analysis that large language models will be able to perform Whether it be static analysis or dynamic analysis computers themselves are kind of constrained to understand what good looks like Our belief is that with similar benefit to what we‚Äôve seen from Gemini or ChatGPT our assumption is leveraging these large language models there‚Äôs even more novel approaches to understand the code and how the code will run One of the most vexing challenges that we get into in software engineering to pick a very specific problem is a kind of error condition called a race condition In a race condition you basically have all of these multiple kinds of events that could be occurring at the same time but to observe that effect everything has to line up just right Maybe it could be a scenario like that that large language models are able to quickly identify that some of our traditional security error checking may not be able to You‚Äôve talked about good things that AI could do for cybersecurity Are there any risks? Arasaratnam: The way that LLMs can be used to more effectively run social engineering campaigns whether that be trickery of an AI-generated video Whether it be an AI-generated voice that sounds like your child or your mother or another loved one calling you up and expressing a ransom has to be paid in gift cards Whether that be LLMs crafting the proverbial scam emails en masse but with much better accuracy and better command of the English language I think we‚Äôre already seeing a lot of these right now and I think that‚Äôll continue to occur I think the same analysis that I just mentioned in terms of LLMs being able to perform this analysis of open source software with the intent of correcting it can also use LLMs to find holes in open source software that haven‚Äôt yet been identified Or to pore over vast quantities of data that hasn‚Äôt yet been analyzed to understand ways of exploiting that data or being able to glean trend analysis things like that Criminals are no longer the proverbial smash-and-grab punks It‚Äôs not people that are taking a crime of opportunity on the internet They operate like businesses We‚Äôve seen evidence that they operate 9 to 5 in their local time zone and have management hierarchies ‚Ä¶Bad people may try to exploit the LLMs themselves so they can engineer the large language model to produce a bad result If it‚Äôs an LLM that‚Äôs focused on secure code generate to manipulate it in such a way that it generates insecure code whether it is by manipulating the training data manipulating how the LLM runs at runtime It‚Äôs what we call a watering hole attack If you can make a central place that is accountable for producing an artifact to a large quantity of people if you can manipulate that to be an outcome that‚Äôs insecure and one that you can exploit I suspect that people are going to start looking to do that as well What kinds of outcomes are you hoping to see in the DARPA Challenge? Arasaratnam: One of the challenges that we‚Äôve seen in software engineering especially for those of us who‚Äôve been around a couple of decades like myself is some of the languages that we historically use for a lot of low-level programming ‚Ä¶like C and C++ are particularly fragile when it comes to what we would call now memory safety There was a study by CISA [Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency] in DHS that said [almost] 70% of recent security exploits ‚Ä¶ had been memory safety failures Were they everything? No Were they a disproportionate amount? Absolutely Because of that especially when it comes to low-level programming there‚Äôs been a lot of popularity and interest around languages like Rust Rust has this opportunity to be able to perform: very high performance very low-level environments that were previously the domain of C and C++ but to do so in a memory-safe manner How does this apply to AI and LLMs? As much as software engineers would like not to admit it every time a human touches code there‚Äôs the potential for a bug to be introduced It would be incredible if large language models could come in and rewrite legacy C code as Rust or at least do so for what I‚Äôd say are security sensitive code paths where you‚Äôre taking input from a user where you‚Äôre handling cryptographic keys where you‚Äôre handling authorization And in doing so you balance the potential that even an LLM could make a translation mistake with benefit of recoding and a memory-safe language How can you utilize AI and keep your system secure? Arasaratnam: When it comes to AI in particular the learnings that I would take from previous technologies is to really be considerate about making it a risk-based approach There are tons of ways that AI LLMs and all the new artificial intelligence technologies can benefit your business Whether that is being able to understand sentiment from text or to be able to better handle your call center or to be able to do image analysis It can benefit your business‚Äôs bottom line and that‚Äôs really why we invest in these technologies‚Äînot just for the sake of technology But for each of these business advantages there‚Äôs also a business risk ‚Ä¶You should be making those decisions eyes wide open If you are going to use an LLM to secure your codebase against security vulnerabilities you should have some confidence in the LLM‚Äôs ability to do that If there isn‚Äôt maybe keep a human in the mix to make sure that something inappropriate hasn‚Äôt been added I do think that there‚Äôs going to be some novelty in terms of the exploits we see I think that the controls that we have at our disposal don‚Äôt necessarily have to be novel They need to be common sense They need to be risk-based Sheryl Sandberg former chief operating officer of Meta announced yesterday she will leave the company‚Äôs board of directors when her term ends in May 12 years: Length of time she served on Meta‚Äôs board $19 billion: Forbes estimate of Sandberg‚Äôs net worth It ‚Äòfeels like the right time to step away‚Äô: Sandberg‚Äôs Facebook post announcing her decision Forbes Chinese search engine giant Baidu saw its Nasdaq shares drop more than 12% this week Why?

Annabelle Chih/Getty Images News TSMC (NYSE:TSM) is and will likely remain for years to come a prudent choice to invest in the semiconductor industry which has been and is expected to remain a growing market over time As a (pure play) foundry TSMC derives its revenue from hundreds of customers including a dozen or so major ones However one key risk for what would otherwise be a relatively low-risk company with a very digestible valuation (outside of perhaps some geopolitical concerns) that is becoming increasingly apparent is the rise in competition at the leading edge which is both the largest and fastest-growing part of the market This could ultimately result in market share and pricing power loss or even the (almost) complete loss of customers in the case TSMC would be unable to provide them with the technology that allows them to be successful in their own markets (ie loss of process leadership) My prior coverage on the stock from over half a year remains relevant (as the thesis as described there continues to play out): TSMC: Losing Leadership Apple (AAPL) as its largest customer has been a major contributor to TSMCs success over time Both in terms of revenue (perhaps on the order of 20-25% of total revenue) but also as primary adopter of basically all of TSMCs latest nodes for the last decade which the companies do partner closely According to this source Apple accounted for $175B of TSMCs 2022 revenue However recently Apple Silicon lead Johny Srouji and John Ternus Senior VP of hardware engineering said some quite concerning things in an interview (emphasis mine) We do rely on TSMC for a good part of our internal chips‚Ä¶Its actually very complicated Those transistor technologies are very advanced and complicated but I distill it down to a few principles: We always want to deliver and build the best chips on the planet for the best products So thats the North Star And that means we need to have access to the best tools including the best transistor technology So thats extremely important - Srouji Srouji said Apple needs the best process technology The issue here for TSMC is that it is on a quick pace to lose the leadership it inherited due to Intels (INTC) stumbles around 10/7nm back to Intel (around 2nm) Coincidentally Intel also started a foundry business Some have already speculated the prepayment Intel received to accelerate the build-out of its 18A Arizona fab even was from Apple Although I wouldnt go that far yet altogether these developments do mean that the Apple foundry business is right open for grabbing for anyone who can deliver to Apple what it deems is its North Star Indeed further in the interview he confirmed that Apple is not religious about partnering with TSMC 8/11 Srouji said that while diversification of the supply chain is important his first principal is key: where can you get the best technology and where can you get the scale if some foundry has that and they meet our requirements we are always exploring - including outside of Taiwan Note that while Intel is new to the foundry business there certainly shouldnt be any concerns about scale As a (primarily) CPU company most of Intels manufacturing capacity has always been on the leading edge and given its ambitions in foundry (and growth in general) Intel has been planning and building many new fabs including in Arizona ($30B) Ohio ($20B initially) Germany ($30B initially) and Israel ($25B) As a further recent indication of how TSMC seems to be struggling to keep up in the upcoming gate-all-around transistor era this recent TSMC roadmap shows how the A10 node is planned for 2030 On the surface this seems to keep up with Moores Law which is slowing down from a 2-year towards a 3-year cadence and indeed this roadmap has gaps of either 2 or 3 years between nodes TSMC TSMC However the target for a monolithic chip with over 200B transistors just seems low/unambitious since even on N5 (2020) there are already monolithic chips with nearly 100B transistors Even when noting that the introduction of high-NA lithography will reduce the (maximum) size of a monolithic chip by half it remains to be seen if TSMC can re-accelerate its rate of shrinking from the slow rate at N3/N2 (similar to Intel at its 10/7nm nodes) For example if 100B is the goal for N2 (despite this already being possible with N3 although TSMC has disclosed that N2 would be a very minor shrink) then A10 with 200B transistors on half the area would require a 4x shrink in two nodes which is aligned with Moores Law Like many (including Intel) TSMC had been expecting a recovery in H2 However Q3 revenue was down 15% to $173B EPS was $129 marking a 25% decline More in general beyond the Apple risk the importance of leading-edge nodes is shown in that 7nm and below nodes accounted for 59% of revenue While TSMC already has a competitor in that segment with Samsung the added competition from Intel Foundry Services only adds further pressure especially given TSMCs expanded margins in recent years This has indeed been acknowledged by Pat Gelsinger who said TSMCs margins are so high that there is ample room to undercut TSMC on pricing and still end up with a lucrative business Note that this contrasts with some popular comments one might have read (The (leading edge) foundry industry is definitely large enough to support a few players but also so advanced that no more players could compete thereby securing the overall profitability for all competitors) So in a few years TSMC is on a path to both lose its (foundry) process leadership as well as potentially becoming a more expensive foundry in general At that point there do not seem many (if any) reasons for TSMC to maintain such a market share resulting in the loss of pricing power as well as market share Nevertheless contrary to the comment just referred to there should not be any reason to expect a race-to-the-bottom price war since both companies are very much focused on achieving high margins Looking forward even the top end of Q4 guidance would still see revenue decline by about $1B marking the fourth consecutive quarter of decline Note that this means the surge in GAI has not benefited TSMC very much since most of the gross margin dollars have gone to Nvidia (NVDA) with the BOM (bill of materials) for the H100 silicon (a few hundred dollars at most assuming on the order of 75 chips per wafer and a $15k per wafer) being pretty much a rounding error compared to the actual sales price (well into the 5 digits) Despite the forward-looking uncertainty in TSMCs business as described the company on the surface is actually very investible which remains in line with my prior analysis This is shown by the forward P/E of just 20x despite trading at the high end of its one-year range One could only guess why the stock doesnt have a higher valuation Perhaps it is the Asia/China effect that has also affected stocks such as Alibaba (BABA) Perhaps it is the Taiwan effect in particular the China invasion risk Perhaps it is just the actual financial performance with investors awaiting a new upcycle The risk of literally losing a quarter of its business while as described seems very real in reality likely isnt considered yet by investors Even if it were to happen similar to the transition from Intel to Apple silicon this would be a multiyear process even after it started with the start itself in the first place likely still years away By that time the rest of the market might have grown so much that TSMCs financials could remain quite stable compared to the current level Overall while at least in principle the risk of TSMC losing its biggest customer is a real one how to factor this into the valuation is quite tricky since the actual probability is unknown Disregarding any black swan events TSMC is an investible stock At this point perhaps even more so than its new competitor Intel as the formers valuation hasnt increased much at all yet As trends such as GAI show the semiconductor industry remains a long-term growing market so investing in a leading foundry such as TSMC which is the definite leader in terms of market share with hundreds of (major and minor) customers would be a prudent choice for investors Of course as described one possible black swan event would be the rise of new competitor Intel In fact there already seems to be some initial notable activity shown by the prepayment Intel got from an undisclosed 18A customer to accelerate the build-out of the new Arizona fabs The possibilities here range from customers looking for an alternative supplier for at least some of their chips to even completely losing the business for their flagship highest volume chips as they flock toward the best technology in the market At the end of the day at the leading edge the only that matters for TSMCs customers is how their chips stack up against their competitors Using a foundry/process that is further along the Moores Law curve to that end has been a proven strategy for decades to outcompete competitors So ultimately as quoted while Apple has not made any formal announcements it did say that it is not religious about which foundry it uses The company is only religious to the goal of creating the best possible chips Since TSMC losing its process leadership is getting ever more guaranteed (with Intel already delivering the 09 PDK of 18A to customers) this is one key risk investors will have to face as at least a possibility Beyond just Apple these competitive dynamics in general could result in loss of market share and/or pricing power putting downward pressure on revenue and earnings which could balance out any general market growth of which TSMC has been a prime beneficiary in the last several years (and decades) This article was written by Analyst‚Äôs Disclosure: I/we have a beneficial long position in the shares of INTC either through stock ownership

746,"None","1/20/2024","https://seekingalpha.com/article/4663884-apple-faces-major-potential-risks","Nikada/iStock Unreleased via Getty Images Entering the year as the most valuable company on the planet Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) faces some large potential risks The question is can the company get back to innovating to overcome these hurdles AAPL designs hardware and software for its own brand of smartphones computers laptops tablets wearable devices and accessories Sales of iPhones made up over half its revenue in fiscal 2023 The company also generates Service revenue through its App store marketplace cloud storage services payment services and advertising Services accounted for about 22% of its FY23 revenue The first big risk that AAPL faces is with its app store Services has been the big bright spot for the company Services revenue reached $852 billion in fiscal year 2023 (ended September) up 9% while it recorded a quarterly record in its FQ4 with Services revenue of $223 billion up 16% The segment also carries much high gross margins of over 70% compared to 365% for its Products segment Now AAPL Services has several components including advertising cloud storage services and payment services But a large portion of this revenue comes for its App store where the company receives a 30% fee (15% for small developers) for every app and in-app purchase made on its platform Earlier this month AAPL updated its policy in response to a court decision that developers could use payment methods outside of AAPL In response the company will allow app developers to use additional payment methods but said it would collect a 27% commission (12% for small developers) for use of its platform While AAPL seems to have found a way to keep control of its app store commissions this fight is likely far from over Developers are not happy with the cut AAPL is getting and will likely continue to press the issue The original lawsuit stems from Epic Games the maker of Fortnite but others such as Spotify (SPOT) have also voiced their displeasure The fight is likely to spill over into Europe and SPOT has urge EU and UK courts to prohibit these fees Meanwhile it appears the US Department of Justice is planning a large anti-trust lawsuit against the iPhone maker AAPL meanwhile also noted in court filings that collecting the commission fees could prove very difficult Whether this is true or not is still to be seen However at the end of the day a big chunk of AAPL‚Äôs app store revenue could be in jeopardy down the road Legal cases are never easy to predict and AAPL undoubtedly will have the best lawyers in the business It can argue that it is no different than any other e-commerce market place such as eBay (EBAY) or Etsy (ETSY) that takes a commission although those two companies have much lower commissions than 27% As such I think there is a real risk that its App Store take rate may come down at some point If the App store makes up half its Services revenue a cut to a 20% take rate from 30% would be an over $4 billion hit to revenue and likely over $3 billion in profits At the same time Alphabet (GOOGL) is being pressured over the payments it makes to companies under its default search agreements These agreements are currently being challenged by the Justice Department as being anti-competitive So why does this matter to AAPL because it was revealed that GOOGL pays AAPL 36% of its search revenue that comes from Safari That appears to between $10-18 billion a year of very high margin revenue that could be lost if this practice is deemed anti-competitive These risks come at a time when AAPL has seen its revenue decline for four straight quarters For fiscal 2023 revenue fell -28% to $3833 billion It‚Äôs the third time AAPL has seen a yearly revenue decline in the past 10 years with the company also seeing sales declines in FY16 and FY19 Given the risks AAPL is facing and the revenue declines it has seen the company really needs to return to its innovative ways Under now deceased founder and former CEO Steve Jobs AAPL was at the forefront of innovation and elegant design During his second tenure with the company AAPL introduced the iPad MacBook iPhone and iPad while the iWatch was released shortly after he passed away The biggest innovations since Tim Cook has taken over are iPods AirTags Apple making its own chips and yearly incremental upgrades to the iPhone That is why the company‚Äôs introduction of the Vision Pro is important The mixed reality headset is one of the biggest innovations to come from AAPL since Tim Cook took over the company in 2011 The product has gotten pretty good reviews and undoubtedly over time the product will get better in later iterations But at $3500 this is a very expensive toy at the moment The Vision Pro will likely do well with AAPL‚Äôs biggest fans and early adopters although I wouldn‚Äôt expect it to be a mainstream success at current prices Later generations at lower prices will be key for this to be a true success but it is good to finally see AAPL innovating again Another area AAPL will have the opportunity to innovate is with the upcoming hardware cycle to run AI-powered solutions Users can‚Äôt run programs like Adobe (ADBE) Photoshop‚Äôs new generative AI features on older Macs and as more apps and program incorporate AI consumers will need more powerful smartphones and tablets as well AAPL has tended to slow play its iPhone advancements each year generally making smaller incremental changes However with AI upon us it could have an opportunity to make some larger important upgrades that will drive sales across its hardware product lines Samsung just launched its latest Galaxy smartphones with a heavy emphasis on AI AAPL currently trades at an EV/EBITDA multiple of 217x the FY24 (ending September) consensus of $1323 billion Based on FY25 EBITDA projections of $1413 billion it trades at a 204x multiple On a P/E basis the company trades at 24x the FY25 consensus of $659 and 20x the FY26 consensus of $713 Revenue is projected to grow nearly 4% in fiscal year 2024 and nearly 6% in FY2025 AAPL trades towards the high-end of large mega-cap tech stocks (growing under 15%) although its projected revenue growth is among the slowest AAPL Valuation Vs Peers (FinBox) Given its modest growth and the risks it faces I‚Äôd value the company between 13-16x FY26 EBITDA That would be a range between $115-$145 AAPL stock has been a huge winner both the past decade and past five years However coming out of the pandemic much of its gains have from multiple expansion This was especially true in 2023 where it saw revenue and net income decline but its stock rise 54% AAPL EBITDA Vs EV/EBITDA Multiple (FinBox) Meanwhile the company faces some potential risks to two large high-margin revenue streams I wouldn‚Äôt expect its app store and search default revenue to go away or be reduced soon but there is a real possibility that they do get a haircut at some point And while I think a hardware upgrade cycle and the Vision Pro could help in 2024 the stock‚Äôs valuation isn‚Äôt attractive given some of the potential risks the company faces As such I‚Äôm going to place a ‚ÄúSell‚Äù rating on AAPL with a $145 target I would become more constructive on the name as its legal battles get cleared up This

National Center on Sexual Exploitation contacted the company with concerns about the alleged use of Wizz in sextortion scams according to a series of emails reviewed by NBC News In an email from an

been used by people to find and connect with young users in ‚Äúfinancial sextortion‚Äù scams according to a recent study by the Network Contagion Research Institute a nonprofit organization that studies the spread of extremism hatred and crime online to help combat and prevent it The FBI defines sextortion as ‚Äúa crime that involves adults coercing kids and teens into sending explicit images online‚Äù After the images are sent the criminals threaten to widely publish or send the explicit photos or videos to the victims‚Äô friends and family unless the victims pay up repeatedly through a variety of peer-to-peer payment apps gift cards and cryptocurrency transfers Sextortion can be so devastating that victims died by suicide in at least 20 known cases in the US according to the FBI In its most recent study of rising sextortion levels in North America and Australia the institute strongly criticized Wizz along with Meta-owned Instagram Snapchat and TikTok for what it called an inadequate effort to protect minors and young adults online ‚ÄúSome victims report being targeted by sextortion within minutes of joining the app suggesting that criminals have saturated Wizz‚Äù the study said adding that researchers found frequent complaints to the Google Play Store and Apple App Store about Wizz with users claiming the app was ‚Äúserving pornographic ads to minors‚Äù Adam Sohn CEO of the Network Contagion Research Institute said in an email that generally ‚Äúsocial media platforms struggle to adequately address‚Äù risks to underage users and ‚Äúare at times financially incentivized to overlook them‚Äù The research institute‚Äôs director of intelligence Alex Goldenberg said app stores can significantly impact the reach of social media platforms ‚ÄúWizz has something in the ballpark of 20 million active users‚Äù he said ‚ÄúBut if the app store doesn‚Äôt continue to carry it they cannot sustain let alone grow their user base‚Äù Goldenberg said that he believes Wizz‚Äôs age verification system is not strong enough ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve seen threat actors who can bypass age verification facial recognition by having their cousin or brother take a selfie and then they will be off and running on the platform‚Äù he said ‚ÄúAnd it‚Äôs not just threat actors ‚Äî if you‚Äôre under the age of 13 it‚Äôs very easy to have an older sibling have a photo taken as well‚Äù Wizz

Vacatures Foto: Apple; Mike Kemp/In Pictures via Getty Images; Alyssa Powell/BI The reviews are in and the tech press is lauding the Apple Vision Pro headset for delivering on the companys promises Its well-designed the video and sound are startlingly precise the Minority Report-style gestural interface is future-tastic Nobodys exactly sure what its for or whether even the Readiest Players One will spend $3500 on it but hey ‚Äî thats gadgets for you Still this is a new gadget frontier The Vision Pro like the similarly kitted-out Quest 3 and Quest Pro headsets from Meta uses whats known as passthrough video ‚Äî cameras and other sensors that capture imagery of the outside world and reproduce it inside the device They feed you a synthetic environment made to look like the real one with Apple apps and other non-real elements floating in front of it Apple and Meta are hoping that this virtual world will be so compelling that you wont just visit Theyre hoping youll live there That unfortunately could have some very weird and very messy consequences for the human brain Researchers have found that widespread long-term immersion in VR headsets could literally change the way we perceive the world ‚Äî and each other We now have companies who are advocating that you spend many hours each day in them says Jeremy Bailenson director of the Virtual Human Interaction Lab at Stanford Youve got many many people and theyre wearing it for many many hours And everything magnifies at scale Meaning: Our brains are about to undergo a massive society-wide experiment that could rewire our sense of the world around us and make it even harder to agree on what constitutes reality The short-term side effects of virtual reality are well established People in synthetic environments tend to misjudge distance both at a distance and close up Thats no surprise: Even in the real three-dimensional universe our ability to determine how close or far away something is is subject to all kinds of external factors Virtual environments with their lower resolution and synthetic 3D make all that worse ‚Äî which is especially bad if youre one of those users posting videos of yourself doing things like skateboarding and driving while wearing a mixed-reality headset You think your hands are in one place theyre actually in another and pretty soon youre driving your Honda Civic through a supermarket Objects in a headset can also get funhoused Thats called object distortion ‚Äî things get warped and change size or shape or color especially when you move your head A video render cant compete with the processing speed and fidelity of your eyes and brain Apple Vision Pro Foto: Apple These are all as the IT people say known issues For a few minutes or an hour long enough to play a game or watch a movie theyre minor annoyances But wear perception-shifting glasses for days at a time ‚Äî as Bailensons team of researchers did ‚Äî and the problems get worse Way worse The team wore Vision Pros and Quests around college campuses for a couple of weeks trying to do all the things they would have done without them (with a minder nearby in case they tripped or walked into a wall) They experienced simulator sickness ‚Äî nausea headaches dizziness That was weird given how experienced they all were with headsets of all kinds And they felt all the distance and distortion effects: thinking elevator buttons were farther from their fingers or experiencing difficulty bringing food to their mouths But as any of us would they adapted ‚Äî their brains and muscles learned to compensate for their new view of the world That seems like a solution but it aint When people adapt to a perceptual change for long enough the real world starts to look wrong in the opposite direction If you wore glasses that turned your vision upside down lets say youd have to adapt again when the glasses came off The longer youre inside a funhouse world the longer the weird perceptual aftereffects last So people who spend their workday inside a Vision Pro might go home at night with a miscalibrated targeting system and what feels like a shroom hangover Heres where the passthrough video gets uniquely important Old-school cyberpunk envisioned virtual reality as an all-encompassing synthetic environment New-school techies meanwhile proposed an augmented reality of digital pop-ups floating on see-through lenses Google Glass-style But both of those approaches have limits Full sense-isolating VR hasnt progressed much further than niche entertainment while AR tends to make both its apps and the real world look bad From a visual standpoint passthrough is the least-worst solution ‚Äî but its social consequences are scarier Because passthrough captures and then re-renders reality it can have an unnerving distancing effect over time When Bailensons colleagues actually tried to talk to people the world turned into a giant confusing Zoom Video chats as weve all experienced are plagued by delays in responses and missed social cues Conversations lose subtlety but its good enough for a meeting But passthrough magnifies the effect ‚Äî the people you talk to start to seem unreal Up close they look like avatars Farther away they become just part of the background Bailenson describes the feeling as one of social absence Other people just arent fully there He doesnt put it this way but Ill wave the warning flag: Long-term use of passthrough headsets could make it easier to think of other people as unhumans ‚Äî non-player characters in a gamified uncanny valley We all live in our own perceptual bubbles Every person has slightly different sensory thresholds ‚Äî we see colors a little bit differently hear at different levels of acuity are more or less sensitive to different odors And we process all that with brains uniquely tuned first by our genes and then by a lifetime of neural changes of thinking and doing But in general we agree on some common ground Even if your blue looks a little different than mine we can agree on what color the sky is Maybe my tolerance for chili peppers is higher than yours but we both know when were eating them Headsets make the walls of those sensory bubbles even thicker and harder to bridge We already lack for common ground politically Now as millions of Americans wear VR headsets for hours at a time we may find ourselves unable to agree on our physical reality The headsets will put things into our visual world that arent there for anyone else The objects arent objective And thats not all These headsets can not only add things to the real world they can also delete them Bailenson says He first realized VRs strange editing function while he was playing a game on the Quest 3 that knocked out portions of the real walls around him and replaced them with a virtual scene Ive been doing VR and AR for a while he says and I had never in my life seen deletion work so well At first that seems pretty great Stuck on a crowded bus? Delete everyone and replace them with the first-class cabin of a jumbo jet Hate intrusive billboards? Replace all the commercial images with soothing vistas of your choosing But what happens when the technology gets good enough to delete say homeless people? Or Pride flags? You can see where Im going here ‚Äî literal erasure When the sci-fi writer William Gibson came up with the concept of cyberspace he described it as a consensual hallucination This is the exact opposite ‚Äî billions of discrete unshared hallucinations each one snowflake-special What were about to experience is using these headsets in public common ground disappears Bailenson says People will be in the same physical place experiencing simultaneous visually different versions of the world Were going to lose common ground Stipulated: Everyone always freaks out about new consumer technology and the freak-out is almost always the same The new form of sensory input will harm kids! Its a dangerous distraction! Its socially alienating! They said it about the iPhone about the Walkman ‚Ä¶ hell half a millennium ago they said it about the book New technologies arrive and we adapt And I dont need to lean hard on my nerdiness to imagine fun sci-fi uses for passthrough The real potential here is the ability to see the invisible informational metastructure of the world ‚Äî translation overlays; pop-up tags that display peoples names and pronouns and where you know them from; walking directions; user-manual-linked X-ray vision for assembling an Ikea coffee table Link my shopping list to the aisles I need to visit in the supermarket Maybe even expand my vision beyond what my meatbag eyes can do and let me see into the ultraviolet or perceive electrical fields Passthrough has limits but it might also have superpowers Like me Bailenson isnt a freaker-outer; he loves VR and thinks the new headsets are keen He knows that over time screens will get better resolution and faster rendering New algorithms will minimize distortion Its not the technology hes worried about Its how much were going to become immersed in it The worlds going to be just fine he says People adapt to media These headsets are incredible But philosophically I do not believe we need to be wearing these headsets for hours every day Weve been here before ‚Äî and very recently at that A decade or so ago no one paused to consider the unintended consequences of thrusting millions of people into impossible-to-moderate social networks And we all know how that turned out Now were on the verge of sticking millions of people into helmets that give us all our own editable realities Thats why the kind of research that Bailenson is conducting on passthrough headsets is so important Im encouraging all scholars to act with some urgency to understand them he says In the meantime while hes doing his work maybe dont forget to take that Vision Pro off once in a while The longer you keep it on the more youre turning yourself into a human guinea pig ‚Äî one with really really bad depth perception Adam Rogers is a senior correspondent at Business Insider De capaciteit van een thuisbatterij is nog te klein om een elektrische auto √©√©n keer op te laden Ook zijn er richtlijnen opgesteld om het Windows-besturingssysteem en buitenlands gemaakte databa De totale waarde van de Amerikaanse beurs is nu bijna twee keer zo groot als de omvang van de eco Westerse landen zijn dankzij de Urenco-fabriek in Almelo straks niet meer afhankelijk van Russisc De meeste wervingsteams begrijpen wel dat niemand volledig eerlijk kan zijn tijdens een sollicita Finding a therapist can be tricky and time-consuming But staying with a therapist who isn‚Äô Stocks are in a bubble that will almost certainly burst Jeremy Grantham said The GMO cofounder Luchtvaartmaatschappijen vinden dat de havengelden buitensporig zijn maar de rechter oordeelt da Trader Joe‚Äôs has raised the price of its bananas from 19 cents after more than 20 years It Experts sought to explain how the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore collapsed They centered Wil je groeien met je bedrijf?

PhotoCD failed miserably as a consumer product Subsequent pivots to professional graphics users (a segment they knew well) came too late as low-cost scanners and non-proprietary standards (JPEG) prevailed Similarly Apple is trying to push Vision Pro onto their existing consumer customers All the demos and existing applications are tailored to the consumer market Additionally Apple did not create demos for how the Vision Pro could be used in new markets where users would jump at the opportunity to buy a Vision Pro For example the internet is rife with proof of demand in an adjacent mass market: helping millions of homeowners repair things around their property There is also proven demand for Industrial applications outside of the consumer space Every company that has complex machinery has been experimenting with AR for years Imagine car repair with a Vision Pro AR tutorial Or jet engine maintenance Or the entire gamut of complex machinery All of these would have been great Vision Pro demos for training and repair It‚Äôs hard to understand why Apple ignored these easy wins Apple‚Äôs entry into new markets by creating new product categories‚ÄìiPods iPads iPhones‚Äìis unprecedented in the history of modern corporations $300 billion (75% of their revenue) is from non-computer hardware In addition they‚Äôve created an entirely new $85+ billion subscription business model with the App Store iTunes Apple Care Apple Pay Apple Cash Apple Arcade Apple Music and Apple TV It‚Äôs hard to remember but the first versions of these products launched with serious limitations that follow-on versions remedied The first version of the iPhone only ran Apple software it had no app store It was a closed system It had no copy-and-paste function and couldn‚Äôt record video among other limitations The original Apple Watch was positioned as a fashion accessory It wasn‚Äôt until later that Apple realized the Watch‚Äôs killer apps were fitness and health Fixing the technical flaws while finding the right markets took time and commitment The same will likely be true for the Vision Pro Apple‚Äôs model is to provide the hardware and then let their developer community come up with the kind of applications However all of the applications on this first release are in their current markets (entertainment music etc) None of these are killer apps for the product Apple marketers will realize that adjacent spaces they are less familiar with will provide the first ‚Äúgot to have it‚Äù beachhead markets Newer iterations will ride the technology wave of lighter and cheaper versions Apple‚Äôs CEO Tim Cook has made a personal bet on the Vision Pro More than any other company they have sufficient resources (cash on hand and engineering talent) to pivot‚Äìand ensure the Vision Pro‚Äôs product-market fit in the real markets that need it Here‚Äôs to hoping they find it Steve Blank is an adjunct professor at Stanford and co-founder of the Gordian Knot Center for National Security Innovation The opinions expressed in Fortunecom commentary pieces are solely the views of their authors and do not necessarily reflect the opinions and beliefs of Fortune ¬© 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited All Rights Reserved Use of this site constitutes acceptance of our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy CA Notice at Collection and Privacy Notice Do Not Sell/Share My Personal Information Ad Choices FORTUNE is a trademark of Fortune Media IP Limited registered in the US and other countries FORTUNE may receive compensation for some links to products and services on this website Offers may be subject to change without notice S&P Index data is the property of Chicago Mercantile Exchange Inc and its licensors All rights reserved Terms & Conditions Powered and implemented by Interactive Data Managed Solutions"

We generally believe that a companys value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future However a DCF is just one valuation metric among many and it is not without flaws If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model Check out our latest analysis for Apple We are going to use a two-stage DCF model which as the name states takes into account two stages of growth The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value captured in the second steady growth period To start off with we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows Where possible we use analyst estimates but when these arent available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow over this period We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in todays dollars: (Est = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$999b After calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period we need to calculate the Terminal Value which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a countrys GDP growth In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (22%) to estimate future growth In the same way as with the 10-year growth period we discount future cash flows to todays value using a cost of equity of 82% Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 √ó (1 + g) √∑ (r ‚Äì g) = US$195b√ó (1 + 22%) √∑ (82%‚Äì 22%) = US$33t Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$33t√∑ ( 1 + 82%)10= US$15t The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value which results in the Total Equity Value which in this case is US$25t The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding Relative to the current share price of US$192 the company appears around fair value at the time of writing Remember though that this is just an approximate valuation and like any complex formula - garbage in garbage out We would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a companys future performance so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry or a companys future capital requirements so it does not give a full picture of a companys potential performance Given that we are looking at Apple as potential shareholders the cost of equity is used as the discount rate rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital WACC) which accounts for debt In this calculation weve used 82% which is based on a levered beta of 1191 Beta is a measure of a stocks volatility compared to the market as a whole We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies with an imposed limit between 08 and 20 which is a reasonable range for a stable business Whilst important the DCF calculation ideally wont be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company Its not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model Preferably youd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the companys valuation For example changes in the companys cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation For Apple there are three essential aspects you should consider: PS The Simply Wall St app conducts a discounted cash flow valuation for every stock on the NASDAQGS every day If you want to find the calculation for other stocks just search here Find out whether Apple is potentially over or undervalued by checking out our comprehensive analysis which includes fair value estimates risks and warnings dividends insider transactions and financial health Have feedback on this article?

Let‚Äôs look at its financial metrics to know more‚Ä¶ Jan 3 2024 Apple Inc (AAPL) made history in mid-2023 by being the first tech company to reach a $3 trillion market value while the tech sector garnered significant investor attention due to the hype surrounding Artificial Intelligence (AI) However for the fiscal fourth quarter (ended September 30 2023) the company‚Äôs total net sales declined marginally year-over-year to $8950 billion due to weaknesses in the Mac and wearables segment Moreover the iPhone maker forecasted weakness for its holiday quarter About this forecast the brokerage Bernstein said ‚ÄúApple‚Äôs revenue growth has stalled over the past few quarters ‚Äì and appears likely to continue to stagnate over the next year‚Äù On top of it Barclays downgraded AAPL on the backs of weak iPhone sales in China Analyst Tim Long believes that this softness in sales will persist even after the company launches the iPhone 16 this year as the model is unlikely to have any drastic updates compared to the latest model in circulation This paints an uncertain picture of this big tech company‚Äôs outlook Therefore investors could wait and monitor AAPL for an opportune moment to invest in its stock Let‚Äôs look at the trends of its key financial metrics to gain further insight Tracking Apple Inc‚Äôs Financial Performance: Analyzing Key Metrics and Growth Over Two Years (2021-2023) The trailing-12-month net income of AAPL has shown a fluctuating trend over the last two years from March 27 2021 to September 30 2023 with general overall growth seen From these figures the growth rate from the initial to the final value shows a significant 2709% increase in AAPL‚Äôs reported net income over these years 3 STOCKS TO DOUBLE THIS YEAR The emphasis on more recent data reflects that even though there were some declines in the second half of 2022 and the start of 2023 the upward tick in the third quarter indicates potential resilience and recovery in AAPL‚Äôs profitability with the final noted net income of $9699 billion This is a crucial trend to consider for future projections and appraisal of AAPL‚Äôs financial performance The trailing-12-month revenue trends and fluctuations of AAPL from March 2021 to September 2023 are as outlined: Annual Revenue Trend: From this data the annual growth from March 2021 to September 2022 was approximately 212% Recent Fluctuations: The most recent data shows that as of September 2023 AAPL‚Äôs revenue stands at $3833 billion reflecting a downward trend from its peak in 2022 Overall between the first value in March 2021 and the latest in September 2023 there has been growth of approximately 178% The data series provided offers a view into the gross margin trends of AAPL Beginning on March 27 2021 decoding the data series unveils: The gross margin demonstrated an overall upward trend from the beginning of the series in March 2021 to the end in September 2023 The growth rate calculated by measuring the last value from the first value suggests a positive growth of approximately 410% However there were periods of relative stability such as roughly half of 2022 when the gross margin plateaued at around 4330% It‚Äôs also worth noting a slight dip at the end of 2022 before it continued on its upward trajectory throughout 2023 This data underlines that although fluctuations (and some steady periods) were present within each fiscal quarter the overall gross margin for AAPL increased over the specified timeline reflecting positively on its economic performance The current ratio of AAPL exhibited a decreasing trend for the period from March 27 2021 to June 25 2022 It decreased from 114 in March 2021 to 087 in June 2022 However from that point on the numerical trend indicated a slight rebound demonstrating minor fluctuations but ultimately climbing to 099 by September 30 2023 Here are a few highlighted data points: The overall growth rate measured by comparing the current ratio from March 27 2021 (114) to the most recent observation on September 30 2023 (099) indicates a decrease of around 13% Analyzing Apple Inc‚Äôs Share Price Fluctuations: July 2023 ‚Äì January 2024 The trend and growth rate of AAPL share prices from July 2023 to January 2024 is characterized by variability and some degree of volatility To summarize AAPL‚Äôs stock exhibited initial stability followed by a decline a period of volatility and then a robust increase towards December 2023 This was however followed by another price reduction at the start of the subsequent year Despite these fluctuations the overall growth rate in this period is not consistent instead showing signs of volatility The trend could be characterized as slightly upward through mid-December and then a decrease towards the end of December and early January Here is a chart of AAPL‚Äôs price over the past 180 days Analyzing Apple Inc‚Äôs Performance: Quality Stability and Sentiment Dimensions Based on the provided data AAPL a stock in the Technology ‚Äì Hardware category of stocks maintains a consistent POWR Ratings grade of C (Neutral) throughout an extended period spanning from July 2023 to January 2024 A detailed summary of the POWR grade and rank within the category for the given period is outlined below: Throughout this period despite the shifts in ranking AAPL maintained the POWR grade C (Neutral) indicating a balanced trajectory with room for potential improvement Based on the data provided the three most noteworthy dimensions for AAPL in the POWR Ratings are Quality Stability and Sentiment Here is a deeper analysis of these dimensions: Quality: Quality consistently achieves the highest ratings for AAPL throughout the period In July 2023 the quality score was at 97 maintaining this impressive rating right through until October of that same year Impressively it continued to increase further in the following two months to reach 98 by November 2023 and retained this high score into January 2024 Stability: The Stability dimension also exhibits consistent ratings over this period Though not as high as Quality there are patterns worth noting Starting from a score of 63 in July 2023 Stability reached its peak of 68 in August before experiencing minor fluctuations but maintaining an upward trend throughout the period Sentiment: Sentiment scores for Apple show more volatility exhibiting slight ups and downs over the observed period Despite this wavering the given sentiment score shows a mostly positive trajectory Beginning with a rating of 61 in July 2023 there are noticeable upward movements by August 2023 to 75 There is then a decline to 57 by October but an upturn again to 74 by January 2024 This indicates fluctuating sentiment towards Apple Inc within this timeframe In summary AAPL‚Äôs Quality score consistently achieved the highest among the three noteworthy dimensions across six months Stability showed steady improvements while Sentiment demonstrated a more fluctuating pattern Overall this suggests a generally favorable context for AAPL highlighting its strong Quality and increasing Stability despite the variances in Sentiment How does Apple Inc

the month of December were also up by 10% This follows a 9% growth rate for the month of November 2023 and Evercore says that there was a continued broad strength across all categories Significantly

829,"Apple Amazon Microsoft Meta and Nvidia are part of Zacks Earnings Preview","2/12/2024","https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-amazon-microsoft-meta-nvidia-110000505.html","Chicago IL ‚Äì February 12 2024 ‚Äì Zackscom releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises This week‚Äôs list includes Apple AAPL Amazon AMZN Microsoft MSFT Meta META and Nvidia NVDA The overall picture that has emerged from the Q4 earnings season is one of stability and resilience as a whole with key pockets starting to enjoy notable acceleration regarding growth momentum Earnings aren‚Äôt great but then again no one expected corporate profitability to be great The earnings naysayers have been relatively less vocal in their doom-and-gloom pronouncements lately But the fear of an impending earnings cliff has been in the back of market participants‚Äô minds These results have likely eased many of those fears With quarterly results from about two-thirds of S&P 500 members already out through Friday February 9th here are the five key features these quarterly results have confirmed First the Q4 earnings and revenue growth pace represents an acceleration from what we have been seeing in recent quarters The absolute level of Q4 earnings and revenue growth isn‚Äôt much and the improving trend may not seem like a big deal to some of you But we nevertheless see this improving growth trend as significant and a sign of the things to come in the coming periods For the 338 S&P 500 members that have reported results through Friday February 9th total earnings and revenues are up +55% and +37% from the same period last year respectively Concerning the beats percentages 805% of the companies have beaten EPS estimates and 65% have beaten revenue estimates Second companies are making good progress on the margins front The year-over-year change in net margins turned positive in 2023 Q3 after staying in negative territory for six consecutive quarters This margins recovery is a key driver of earnings growth in the coming periods At the sector level Q4 net margins are above the year level for 9 of the 16 sectors with the biggest gains at Tech Consumer Discretionary Retail Industrial Products Utilities Finance and others On the negative side Q4 margins are below the year-earlier level for 7 of the 16 Zacks sectors with the biggest declines at the Medical Autos Energy and Transportation sectors Third the Tech sector is firmly back in the growth mode now and the trend is expected to continue going forward For the 645% of Tech companies in the S&P 500 index that have reported Q4 results already total earnings are up +215% on +64% higher revenues with 86% beating EPS estimates and 72% beating revenue estimates Looking at Q4 results for the sector as a whole combining the results that have come out with estimates for the still-to-come companies total Tech sector earnings are on track to be up +254% from the same period last year on +81% higher revenues The sector went through a period of post-Covid adjustment in 2022 and the first half of 2023 when it became a drag on the aggregate growth picture Please remember that Tech isn‚Äôt just any other sector as it‚Äôs the biggest earnings contributor to the S&P 500 index The sector is currently expected to bring in 285% of the index‚Äôs total earnings over the coming four-quarter period with the second and third biggest contributors in Finance and Medical at 177% and 125% respectively What this means is that the Tech sector‚Äôs growth profile has a significant impact on the aggregate picture both negative as well as positive The Tech sector dragged down the aggregate growth picture in 2022 and the first half of 2023 now appearing ready to resume its historical positive growth role Please note that the Tech sector is instrumental in keeping the aggregate growth picture in positive territory in Q4 Of the reported results the +55% earnings growth drops to a decline of -07% when Technology is excluded from the results Fourth related to the Tech sector‚Äôs strong showing is the dominance of the so-called Magnificent 7 companies ‚Äì Apple Amazon Google parent Alphabet Microsoft Meta Nvidia and Tesla Each of the Mag 7 companies relies on technological innovation to dominate its respective space But strictly speaking not all of them are in the Tech sector as we at Zacks have Amazon as part of the Zacks Retail sector and Tesla as part of the Zacks Auto sector Nvidia will report its Q4 results on February 21st but the rest of the Mag 7 members have already reported results For Q4 as a whole for the group combining the actuals that have come out for the six group members with estimates for Nvidia total Mag 7 earnings are expected to be up +487% on +145% higher revenues The Mag 7 companies are expected to bring in 20% of all S&P 500 earnings in 2024 and currently account for 295% of the index‚Äôs total market capitalization Please note that S&P 500 earnings growth for Q4 would be in negative territory had it not been for the heavy lifting from Mag 7: -3% vs +54% Five the revisions trend has notably stabilized after appearing to turn substantially negative at the start of 2023 Q4 Estimates for 2024 Q1 and full-year 2024 are modestly coming down with negative revisions from some sectors mostly getting offset by positive revisions from others For a detailed

835,"Hold Up! Why Its Too Early to Take a Bite of Apple Stock Right Now","2/18/2024","https://investorplace.com/2024/02/hold-up-why-its-too-early-to-take-a-bite-of-apple-stock-right-now/","Countdown to Luke Lango‚Äôs ‚Äú2nd Trillion-Dollar AI Trade‚Äù The US govt just unlocked an $8 trillion market to move in a new direction See how it could unleash 6000% potential upside Its too early to buy AAPL stock at this point Advertisement Source: Yalcin Sonat / Shutterstockcom I believe that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and AAPL stock have two core problems First excitement about the company‚Äôs flagship product the iPhone has largely evaporated And second the company‚Äôs efforts to create ‚Äúthe next big thing‚Äù to supplement the iPhone have largely failed The Vision Pro won‚Äôt change this pattern On the other hand I think there‚Äôs a chance that the firm‚Äôs upcoming iPhone can bring back the long persistent lines of iPhone fans eager to buy the newest version of the device However until we learn more about the upcoming offering I advise investors to avoid the name For the first five years or so after the iPhone was launched many if not most consumers viewed the newest versions of the devices as ‚Äúmust haves‚Äù And a multitude of other fans would get new iPhones every two years Currently devices are seen as similar to cars Many consumers hold on to their iPhones for several years and some wait until their phones aren‚Äôt working anymore to buy new ones Indeed the tech website Zdnet reported last year that ‚Äú61% of iPhone users keep their previous iPhones for two years or more‚Äù This factor has played a key role in Apple‚Äôs lackluster revenue growth Over the last five years it was only during the pandemic when the tech giant‚Äôs results were boosted by the work-from-home trend that Apple really delivered strong revenue increase For example last year the firm‚Äôs top line actually fell slightly dropping to $383 billion from $394 billion and the same phenomenon occurred in fiscal 2019 when its sales came in at $260 billion compared with $2655 billion in fiscal 2018 And last quarter the firm‚Äôs top line only rose about 2% versus the same period a year earlier Moreover the numbers would have been much worse if Chinese consumers had not become enthralled with the iPhone In fact the iPhone became the best-selling smartphone in China in 2023 But the device‚Äôs popularity in the Asian country appears to be waning as deliveries of the device in China dropped 2% last quarter versus the same period a year earlier Apple TV+ has largely been a failure as Barron‚Äôs reported in 2023 that the offering ‚Äúwill lose billions of dollars‚Ä¶for years to come‚Äù There has been much talk over the years about the conglomerate‚Äôs efforts to develop an Apple-influenced vehicle but of course such a product has never emerged The firm‚Äôs watch and its Services have been mid-level successes but haven‚Äôt really moved the top-line needle for the tech giant And I‚Äôd bet against the firm‚Äôs new 3D headset the Vision Pro making a positive impact on the firm‚Äôs financial results Both Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG)and Meta (NASDAQ:META) have tried and failed to get consumers excited about high-tech headsets The New York Post recently reported that the devices cause ‚Äúextreme headaches‚Äù and ‚Äúmotion sickness‚Äù The next update to Apple‚Äôs operating system iOS will reportedly boost its AI capabilities There are rumors that the next iPhone iPhone 16 will feature new hardware which will enable users to exploit these capabilities According to one report Siri‚Äôs intelligence will be boosted by the upgrades and will help ‚Äúusers‚Ä¶ field complex questions and auto-complete sentences more effectively‚Äù Developers will create apps for the device more quickly The latter change could result in huge increases in the quantity and quality of apps available for the platform Apple‚Äôs growth is anemic while its forward price-earnings ratio of 282 is not exactly low Therefore I don‚Äôt expect the shares to outperform the market soonAnd while the AI upgrades of the next version of the iPhone may be a positive game changer I think it‚Äôs too early to tell if that will indeed be the case On the date of publication Larry Ramer did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article

GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with NVDA As of 2024-02-26 Apple Incs intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $15547 Its currently trading at a price of $18252 Therefore the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -174% The company is fair valued The GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage In the growth stage the company is experiencing faster growth while in the terminal stage a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run Apple Incs intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps Term Value Explanation EPS without NRI $642 GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow Discount Rate 11% An appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 424% rounded up to the nearest whole number which is 5% A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate Growth Stage Growth rate (g1) = 1620% Years of Growth Stage = 10 We choose the growth rate based on the availability prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10 5 or 3 years in that order and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate The default growth period is set to 10 years Terminal Stage Growth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10 For the terminal stage the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation Growth Stage = EPS without NRI * [ (1 + g1) / (1 + d) * (1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2 + + (1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ] = 833 Terminal Stage = EPS without NRI * (1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 * [ (1 + g2) / (1 + d) + (1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2 + + (1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ] = 7217 Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based) = Growth Stage + Terminal Stage = 15547 GuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $14319 This valuation indicates that the Apple Inc is fair valued accompanied by a margin of safety of -2747% You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page Please note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model: Future Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings Embracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role All else being equal a company with rapid growth will have a higher value Predictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance For companies with unpredictable performance such as cyclical companies the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized Discount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate Using the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based) To identify undervalued predictable companies focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based) This article generated by GuruFocus is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice Our commentary is rooted in historical data and analyst projections utilizing an impartial methodology and is not intended to serve as specific investment guidance It does not formulate a recommendation to purchase or divest any stock and does not consider individual investment objectives or financial circumstances Our objective is to deliver long-term fundamental data-driven analysis Be aware that our analysis might not incorporate the most recent price-sensitive company announcements or qualitative information GuruFocus holds no position in the stocks mentioned herein This article first appeared on GuruFocus Related Quotes"

854,"Apple Stock (NASDAQ:AAPL): 2 Catalysts That Could Power Shares to $250","2/8/2024","https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-stock-nasdaq-aapl-2-055048576.html","Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock has been really struggling to break through to a new all-time high Undoubtedly Apple seems to have been outshined by its peers in the Magnificent Seven but there exist catalysts that could help power a much-awaited rally perhaps to the Street-high price target of $250 per share Indeed Apple stock seems to be quite the battleground between the bulls and the bears especially lately The bears would point to weak growth and stagnation in iPhone demand in the Chinese market Meanwhile the bulls have a strong argument that the high-margin Services segment continues to swell and that looming products could easily drive growth rates much higher Personally I‚Äôm siding with the bull camp Though bearish arguments are quite sound I do believe they‚Äôre too backward-looking Sure the iPhone 15 Pro Max could have had much better sales had the Chinese economy not been in a massive slump And the recent drama revolving around Apple Watches being pulled from shelves has taken a subtle jab to the wearables segment Though the recent quarter wasn‚Äôt bad it certainly left much to be desired Nonetheless with the Vision Pro selling quite reasonably well look for the new spatial computing device to become a bigger part of the Apple revenue pie each and every year Though the Vision Pro probably won‚Äôt surpass iPhone sales in the next three to five years I think it could give the Mac segment a good run for its money This is especially true if Apple‚Äôs innovators can reduce the size and power requirements of the device (a smaller form factor with no detached battery would certainly help the device become more than just a ‚Äúniche product‚Äù) Though it‚Äôll take time for sales in Vision Pro to march higher I believe that advancements on the software side could act as a driver on the share price in the near-to-medium term We‚Äôre likely more than a year away from the next iteration of Apple‚Äôs spatial computer However 2024 could see some significant software improvements (especially when it comes to AI) until then Whether we‚Äôre talking about more sophisticated updates to visionOS (the Vision Pro‚Äôs operating system) or a growing number of apps (perhaps some of them will be so-called ‚Äúkiller‚Äù apps?) the enthusiasm surrounding the product has the potential to grow at an exponential rate from here In the meantime I think the Vision Pro‚Äôs App Store (there were 600 apps on day one of the release) library is looking quite robust As more developers get their hands on the visionOS tools I‚Äôd look for the number of apps and games to surge into year‚Äôs end That alone could make the Vision Pro a massive driver of the stock as investors anticipate greater sales in the future in response to the rapidly advancing software ecosystem Following the release of Apple‚Äôs latest results CEO Tim Cook teased analysts hinting that generative AI products will be coming later in the year It‚Äôs no mystery that Apple has been investing ‚Äútremendous time and effort‚Äù (as per Tim Cook) into AI integration And though it would have been nice to have some more specifics from Cook like a specific date and features I believe the AI premium that many Magnificent Seven stocks now command will be commanded by Apple once its new AI innovations are finally unveiled Mark Gurman of Bloomberg thinks iOS 18 (the next update to iPhone‚Äôs operating system that could be a highlight of this year‚Äôs WWDC) could represent the ‚Äúbiggest‚Äù update in its history thanks in part to AI We can only speculate at this point but I think he‚Äôs right on the money More details on the update may very well help drive the stock above $200 perhaps toward the $250 Street-high target currently held by Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives Ives sees the Vision Pro as Apple‚Äôs ‚Äúfirst major push‚Äù into the realm of AI If he‚Äôs right other analysts on Wall Street may find themselves racing to upgrade their targets to prices more in line (or maybe exceeding) that of Ives‚Äô Undoubtedly ChatGPT-like Siri Updates and a potential AI App Store could propel Apple stock from an AI underdog to one of the top contenders perhaps even a leader This is especially likely given that a vast majority of Apple‚Äôs ‚Äúgolden‚Äù installed base will actively use such technologies if they are featured as part of iOS 18 On TipRanks AAPL stock comes in as a Moderate Buy Out of 26 analyst ratings there are 17 Buys eight Holds and one Sell recommendation The average AAPL stock price target is $20807 implying upside potential of 105% Analyst price targets range from a low of $15800 per share to a high of $25000 per share It‚Äôs easy to be less-than-upbeat on Apple stock as the iPhone maker‚Äôs sales growth and shares stall That said if you look to Apple‚Äôs near future it‚Äôs clear that selling AAPL stock right here could prove to be a mistake especially if Ives‚Äô predictions come true For now I‚Äôd look to WWDC 2024 and Vision Pro news as potential catalysts to help drive shares higher on the year Could 2024 be Apple‚Äôs year of AI? I think it could be Disclosure Related Quotes"

That‚Äôs the million-dollar question In the meantime I believe Apple‚Äôs valuation remains choked by keeping its cards close to the vest regarding AI Soon enough investors will understand what Tim Cook‚Äôs battle plan is When that day comes you‚Äôll be glad you bought AAPL stock beforehand ‚ÄúIt was inevitable that Microsoft would overtake Apple since Microsoft is growing faster and has more to benefit from the generative AI revolution‚Äù Reuters reported DA Davidson analyst Gil Luria‚Äôs comments about the horse race ‚ÄúMicrosoft and Apple have been trading places for the title of the most valuable public company for several years now Microsoft surpassed Apple‚Äôs market cap in 2021 2020 and 2018 before Apple once again regained its place at the top‚Äù Munich-based Nermin S commented about the latest switch on LinkedIn He‚Äôs not wrong This dance has been ongoing It‚Äôs unlikely to be settled for many more years unless one of the two companies stumbles badly or hits a home run In baseball vocabulary we‚Äôre in the early innings of an extra-inning game While Apple hasn‚Äôt delivered a new-new product since the iPhone in 2007 (by that I mean something entirely different from existing products available at the time) it routinely upgrades its existing lineup to keep Apple lovers from moving to another ecosystem I suppose you could say that the Apple Vision Pro mixed-reality headset is a new-new product but there isn‚Äôt much for consumers to compare it with so we‚Äôre all somewhat in the dark about why we should spend nearly $3500 for one of these bad boys Five years ago many would have said that $1000 was too expensive for a phone but I‚Äôm not sure how many feel that way today Yes they‚Äôve turned us into walking zombies unable to carry on conversations without looking at our phones every few seconds but for many they are indispensable So it‚Äôs very possible that five years from now many of us will wonder if we could live without our Vision Pro If that is the case a $3500 price tag won‚Äôt be an issue for Apple And that‚Äôs where I think Warren Buffett got it right He bought Apple stock because he realized people wouldn‚Äôt give up their phones even if offered $10000 ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre an Apple user and somebody offers you $10000 but the only proviso is they‚Äôll take away your iPhone and you‚Äôll never be able to buy another you‚Äôre not going to take it If they tell you if you buy another Ford car they‚Äôll give you $10000 not to do that you‚Äôll take the $10000 and you‚Äôll buy a Chevy instead‚Äù Buffett told CNBC in April 2023 Maybe I‚Äôm wrong but as much as I respect Satya Nadella‚Äôs job as Microsoft CEO I just don‚Äôt see it having a product that its customers can‚Äôt live without AI aside Microsoft‚Äôs bevy of products can‚Äôt hold a candle to Apple‚Äôs when it comes to consumer excitement Microsoft stock trades at 1329x sales about 30% higher than its 5-year average Meanwhile Apple stock trades at 767x sales 22% higher than its five-year average Apple‚Äôs earnings yield is 330% compared to 266% for Microsoft From where I sit Microsoft‚Äôs out-performance over the past year has everything to do with AI and very little to do with consumer excitement about CoPilot or ChatGPT Don‚Äôt get me wrong these are significant advances in software technology but the market is pricing in that AI will bring all sorts of revenue to Microsoft Still ignoring the possibility that Apple‚Äôs refrain from discussing AI publicly to a large extent isn‚Äôt because they don‚Äôt have any plans for it; it‚Äôs because they don‚Äôt want to take away from the Vision Pro launch in February As far as I can tell AI is naturally suited for use with the Vision Pro mixed reality headset but I‚Äôm far from a tech expert One way for example that businesses could use it is to put out augmented reality content through their investor relations people that gives a user an immersive experience of a plant or facility It‚Äôs like a plant tour but in the privacy of your own home AI could determine what shareholders and potential investors want to see and experience So I‚Äôve said in the past that if you can afford to buy both Apple and Microsoft you absolutely should That hasn‚Äôt changed Could Apple stock play second fiddle to Microsoft for the rest of 2024?

fees‚Äô","1/25/2024","https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/25/epic-games-ceo-calls-out-apples-dma-rules-as-malicious-compliance-and-full-of-junk-fees/","Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney is none too pleased with Apple‚Äôs new App Store rules dubbing them once again a case of ‚Äúmalicious compliance‚Äù and filled with ‚Äújunk fees‚Äù As reported earlier this week Apple today announced it will charge additional fees on apps in the EU including apps and games downloaded from outside its own App Store like those Epic plans to offer Apple‚Äôs new rules which go into effect in the EU as part of the tech giant‚Äôs compliance with the bloc‚Äôs Digital Markets Act (DMA) target larger developers like Epic who have to pay ‚Ç¨050 for each install per year over a 1 million threshold as part of a new ‚Äúcore technology fee‚Äù This fee could help Apple to make up for the losses that came from no longer hosting the apps directly on its App Store where today it enjoys a 15% to 30% commission depending on the developer size and type In the EU Apple said it will lower its App Store commissions to either 17% for digital goods and services or as low as 10% for subscriptions in their second year and small business developers who qualify If the apps choose to use Apple‚Äôs payment processing technology they‚Äôll be charged an additional 3% fee as well Or developers can opt to stay on Apple‚Äôs existing terms ‚Äî the standard 30% commission or 15% for small businesses and subscription in their second year if they choose The company is providing a fee calculator tool that will help them to decide In response to the new rules Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney calls out Apple‚Äôs terms as ‚Äúanti-competitive‚Äù In a post on X Sweeney writes that Apple is ‚Äúforcing developers to choose between App Store exclusivity and the store terms which will be illegal under DMA or accept a new also-illegal anticompetitive scheme rife with new Junk Fees on downloads and new Apple taxes on payments they don‚Äôt process‚Äù Apples plan to thwart Europes new Digital Markets Act law is a devious new instance of Malicious Compliance They are forcing developers to choose between App Store exclusivity and the store terms which will be illegal under DMA or accept a new also-illegal anticompetitive‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Tim Sweeney (@TimSweeneyEpic) January 25 2024 The ‚Äújunk fees‚Äù are a reference to the new ‚Äúcore technology fee‚Äù that covers apps that are downloaded to users‚Äô devices outside the App Store and Apple‚Äôs own payment processing systems It seems that Apple‚Äôs stance is that it‚Äôs entitled to a commission no matter how apps are discovered and downloaded because the App Store is not the platform that makes these app-sized businesses possible ‚Äî rather all of iOS is Arguably iOS offers a sizable platform for developers thanks to Apple‚Äôs ability to continually ship new iPhones in response to consumer demand However claiming that Apple is entitled to anything installed on its proprietary hardware/software combination is pushing up against the regulation‚Äôs purpose The DMA was meant to encourage more competition by lessening the App Store‚Äôs grip on the app ecosystem Apple responded by widening its grip to include the entirety of the iPhone and iOS more broadly This surely puts a dent in Sweeney‚Äôs plans to run a profitable games store in the market as Epic Games would still have to pay Apple for sideloaded app installs over the first million At ‚Ç¨050 per install the number could add up for larger apps with millions of users (Nevertheless Epic said Fortnite will return to iOS in Europe this year details to come) Fortnite will return to iOS in Europe in 2024 distributed by the upcoming @EpicGames Store for iOS Stay tuned for details as we figure out the regulatory timeline Well continue to argue to the courts and regulators that Apple is breaking the law https://tco/MHh6EGVinC ‚Äî Epic Games Newsroom (@EpicNewsroom) January 25 2024 Sweeney also rails against the idea that Apple can choose which stores are allowed to compete with its App Store a seeming reference to Apple‚Äôs new ‚ÄúNotarization‚Äù requirements which Apple claims are necessary to protect its users from malware and other security checks Though Sweeney says Epic has supported the idea of Notarization the company rejects Apple‚Äôs use of this process ‚Äúto undermine competition and continue imposing Apple taxes on transactions they‚Äôre not involved in‚Äù Notarization requirements put Apple in control of apps that end up on users‚Äô iPhones and iPads by way of third-party marketplaces Apple says it plans to encrypt and sign all iOS apps intended for alternative distribution so users can trust they‚Äôre getting apps from known parties Another surprising requirement related to alternative app stores is Apple‚Äôs rule that providers must show the company a stand-by letter of credit of ‚Ç¨1000000 from an ‚ÄúA-rated‚Äù financial institution before developers can receive the entitlement (an exception to its normal rules) to open up their third-party app marketplace This won‚Äôt likely stand in Epic‚Äôs way but could prevent smaller developers from innovating in this space Sweeney‚Äôs comments come fresh off the rulings of two lawsuits where the Fortnite game maker sued both Apple and Google over antitrust concerns Apple won its case as the court declared it was not a monopolist but said that Apple had to allow app developers to link to their own websites if they chose Oddly Epic won the Google case even though Google today already permits sideloading likely because the latter was a jury trial which meant regular people not judges got to make the decisions Apple responded to that ruling much as it did with the DMA by ‚Äúlegally‚Äù complying with the guidelines while also imposing its own system of rules fees and caveats as it deemed necessary Sweeney said he planned to contest Apple‚Äôs ‚Äúbad-faith‚Äù compliance with the US District Court‚Äôs ruling As for the DMA the statement reads as follows: Apple‚Äôs plan to thwart Europe‚Äôs new Digital Markets Act law is a devious new instance of Malicious Compliance They are forcing developers to choose between App Store exclusivity and the store terms which will be illegal under DMA or accept a new also-illegal anticompetitive scheme rife with new Junk Fees on downloads and new Apple taxes on payments they don‚Äôt process Apple proposes that it can choose which stores are allowed to compete with their App Store They could block Epic from launching the Epic Games Store and distributing Fortnite through it for example or block Microsoft Valve Good Old Games or new entrants The Epic Games Store is the #7 software store in the world (behind the 3 console stores 2 mobile stores and Steam on PC) We‚Äôre determined to launch on iOS and Android and enter the competition to become the #1 multi-platform software store on the foundation of payment competition 0%-12% fees and exclusive games like Fortnite Epic has always supported the notion of Apple notarization and malware scanning for apps but we strongly reject Apple‚Äôs twisting this process to undermine competition and continue imposing Apple taxes on transactions they‚Äôre not involved in There‚Äôs a lot more hot garbage in Apple‚Äôs announcement It will take more time to parse both the written and unwritten parts of this new horror show so stay tuned Apple‚Äôs answer to EU‚Äôs gatekeeper rules is new ‚Äòcore tech‚Äô fee for apps"

Apples up 45000% Microsoft up 1200% I think a lot of investors would take that But essentially if you had to buy 2008 to 2010 to reach any comparable number with Apple and if you got in between 2000 and 2008 that was dead money That was a losing trade And thats because in the wake of the tech bubble and also the antitrust suit that Microsoft was facing 20 years ago it just became dead money for about a decade Let me now show you the story in terms of sales growth This is Apple sales growth going back into the late 90s This is when Steve Jobs took over And lets not forget Apple was left for dead almost went bankrupt How about that? But this incredible years-- these years of sales growth here a lot of them topping 75% Thats the iPod And then thats the iPhone And you can see things have trailed off The services side of the equation has gotten a lot of play here but it doesnt always live up to expectations Right now four quarters of declining revenue growth That is a negative situation for Apple Expectations are for that to be broken But well have to see how this plays out in earnings season Give it another month RACHELLE AKUFFO: Looking forward to that Our very own Jared Blikre Thank you so much Related Quotes"

900,"5% Cash Yields Pulling Investors From Slow-Growth Names Like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)","2/21/2024","https://seekingalpha.com/article/4672012-5-percent-cash-yields-pulling-investors-from-slow-growth-names-like-apple","tumsasedgars/iStock via Getty Images tumsasedgars/iStock via Getty Images I dont know if Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) investors fully appreciate the sell decision just made by Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA) (BRKB) asset managers including the esteemed CEO Warren Buffett I believe liquidating 10 million shares in Q4 (13-G filing) from its massive Apple stake (6% interest in the tech giant) for the first time since 2020 is really a huge red-flag warning that Apples best days for shareholder value creation may be behind it Why? Sliding company sales in 2023 were a clear bummer after years of above-average results The whole China/Taiwan political mess of having most all of its products and high-tech parts manufactured in this area of the world is not remotely a long-term positive for future supply-chain deliveries and net manufacturing costs And as I explained in previous articles during 2023 the high stock valuation on slow to no business growth makes little sense to own vs 5% risk-free cash yields as alternatives Thats the background setup Berkshire has decided to sell into Berkshire likely doesnt need extra liquidity or money with $157 billion in cash already held on the balance sheet at the end of September patiently looking for a new home My conclusion is selling Apple shares was a reason-based decision weighing downside share price risk vs weakening potential long-term rewards where managers now believe earning 5% in guaranteed cash-investment income is a stronger investment proposition than holding Apple the next couple of years When you logically review all of the possible inputs for their decision in my opinion higher interest rates appear to be radically changing the calculus for owning Apple (and soon other Big Tech winners) For long-term shareholders of Apple this is a seminal turning point regarding the relative attractiveness of the stock in my view The problem for Berkshire is it is next to impossible to liquidate a monster-sized position in Apple ($170+ billion in value remaining on 905 million shares) without cratering the stock quote simply for share supply/demand reasons Not only would aggressive selling overwhelm daily trading buying interest but follow-the-leader bearish sentiment by Wall Street would dramatically downshift bullish enthusiasm on the other side of each transaction If Buffetts excitement to own Apple was a positive catalyst for the share price since 2016 wont his selling potentially have the opposite chilling effect starting in 2024? The crux of the valuation problem for Apple (and Big Tech generally in early 2024) is the company is priced near a peak valuation on fundamental business results measured over the last several decades despite very high interest rates Typically over the previous century of Wall Street trading stocks have typically traded at very low valuations when rates are high Not today The closest cousin for the current market valuation setup is 1999-2000 if a recession is next in America Basically Apple investors are paying an extended valuation for a business that could see operating results actually decline on recessionary demand soon The easiest way to highlight Buffetts decision process to sell Apple is represented below I believe Berkshire is getting out of the equity price risk and relatively low earnings yield provided by Apple shares in exchange for the 100% guaranteed return of capital and annual 5% guaranteed yield from Treasury Bills The relative business return on investment vs safe cash gains using todays $183 Apple price is a NEGATIVE -144% with only 354% for a trailing earnings yield stacked against 5% in cash distributions available from 1-year Treasury securities This is the worst relative yield situation since 2007 Why not bypass the risk of recession including a lower Apple valuation on falling business trends and just grab the higher cash yield?

Given a normalized long-term valuation over 15-years (using price to earnings sales cash flow and book value) on rosy analyst estimates for 2024 I come up with $120 to $140 a share for bear targets If we experience a recession with lower than now-estimated earnings sales and cash flow a -45% price drop to $100 a share is not out of the question for a worst-case scenario (15-year average 17x EPS 4x sales and 14x cash flow on slightly lower results vs 2023) In my opinion thats why Buffett is selling I think he would rather sidestep some of the coming downdraft in Apple and capture a guaranteed 5% annual yield with the almost 100% sure return of his (Berkshires) upfront capital In my view Apple owners are holding incredible price risk today Will Apple be a positive long-term compounder at 5% to 10% yearly rates over time? Probably But if you can wait to buy shares at far lower quotes your compounded gains will be significantly better I will continue with my Sell rating for a 12-month outlook projecting a price below $150 for Apple by the second half of 2024 Thanks for reading Please consider this article a first step in your due diligence process Consulting with a registered and experienced investment advisor is recommended before making any trade This article was written by Analyst‚Äôs Disclosure: I/we have no stock option or similar derivative position in any of the companies mentioned and no plans to initiate any such positions within the next 72 hours I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha) I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article This writing is for educational and informational purposes only All opinions expressed herein are not investment recommendations and are not meant to be relied upon in investment decisions The author is not acting in an investment advisor capacity and is not a registered investment advisor The author recommends investors consult a qualified investment advisor before making any trade Any projections market outlooks or estimates herein are forward-looking statements based upon certain assumptions that should not be construed as indicative of actual events that will occur This article is not an investment research report but an opinion written at a point in time The authors opinions expressed herein address only a small cross-section of data related to an investment in securities mentioned Any analysis presented is based on incomplete information and is limited in scope and accuracy The information and data in this article are obtained from sources believed to be reliable but their accuracy and completeness are not guaranteed The author expressly disclaims all liability for errors and omissions in the service and for the use or interpretation by others of information contained herein Any and all opinions estimates and conclusions are based on the authors best judgment at the time of publication and are subject to change without notice The author undertakes no obligation to correct update or revise the information in this document or to otherwise provide any additional materials Past performance is no guarantee of future returns Seeking Alphas Disclosure: Past performance is no guarantee of future results No recommendation or advice is being given as to whether any investment is suitable for a particular investor Any views or opinions expressed above may not reflect those of Seeking Alpha as a whole Seeking Alpha is not a licensed securities dealer broker or US investment adviser or investment bank Our analysts are third party authors that include both professional investors and individual investors who may not be licensed or certified by any institute or regulatory body"

This growth has positioned Huawei as the fourth-largest smartphone vendor in China The Chinese brand now has a market share of 139% up from 103% in the same period a year ago The Chinese mobile phone market is the third-largest for Apple and the company takes this market seriously However the intensifying competition from local rivals led by Huawei is not an easy hurdle to climb In the global setting Statista Counterpoint Research and IDC agree that Apple and Samsung are the two dominant players in the market Apple did hold on to the top spot in terms of market share in 2023 Other major players include Xiaomi Huawei Oppo and Vivo The market is highly competitive with companies vying for market share through aggressive trade-in offers There are also many interest-free financing plans

made significant strides The decline in Apple‚Äôs smartphone shipments in China reflects the increasing competition from local players and the impact of government restrictions on the use of Apple devices Despite offering substantial discounts Apple faced a 21% decrease in its shipments in the final quarter of 2023 This decline has raised concerns about the company‚Äôs position in one of its key markets Apple was not impressed with its financial report in Greater China The company‚Äôs executives did not fail to openly express their dissapointment with the performance Apple CFO Luca Maestri said that the company is not satisfied with the decline in revenue in China However he affirms that the Chinese market contains long-term major opportunities Of course the sharp decline in revenue in Greater China is mainly due to weak iPhone sales In this regard Apple‚Äôs CEO Tim Cook reiterated in an interview that it is not that the iPhone is difficult to sell He said that the iPhone‚Äôs performance in China is still excellent but the company can achieve more He showed confidence that Apple will bounce back from the slight decline Cook also reiterated that iPhone occupies four of the top six sales positions in China The decline in revenue is not due to the loss of iPhone popularity but is mainly a reflection of overall economic problems Cook said that taking into account exchange rate factors the overall impact of the 13% year-on-year decline in Greater China on the company will become a ‚Äúmid-single digit‚Äù Cook added: ‚ÄúChina has always been the most competitive smartphone market in the world and that hasn‚Äôt changed‚Äù The Chinese mobile phone market is a dynamic and highly competitive landscape with over 285 million smartphone shipments in 2022 Domestic brands such as Huawei Xiaomi Oppo and Vivo have established strong footholds through their brand reputation extensive distribution networks and competitive pricing strategies These brands are expected to continue dominating the market especially in the mid-range and budget segments International brands like Apple and Samsung also have a significant presence in the premium segment The market is highly competitive driven by evolving consumer preferences technological advancements and intense competition among domestic and international brands The smartphone market in China can be segmented based on price range brand positioning screen size and camera capabilities Chinese consumers are highly tech-savvy and place a strong emphasis on smartphones‚Äô features design and value for money The market is also influenced by factors such as localized features ecosystem integration and tapping into the untapped rural market Huawei maintained its market leadership with a 45% market share in the third quarter of 2022 and the company‚Äôs 5G smartphones received positive market feedback driving it to the top of China‚Äôs best-selling models list Despite the challenging environment and sluggish consumer demand Huawei and Apple were the only vendors with a positive year-on-year growth in the top 5 ranking indicating the intense rivalry and competition in the market IDC‚Äôs latest report on the Chinese smartphone market highlights the contrasting fortunes of Apple and Huawei in the fourth quarter of 2023 While Apple faced a 2% decline in iPhone shipments Huawei experienced a remarkable 362% growth solidifying its position as a major player with a 139% market share Huawei‚Äôs resurgence fueled by new product launches and increasing demand for its 5G handsets underscores its resilience despite past challenges The dynamics of the Chinese mobile phone market continue to evolve with intense competition among domestic and international brands Domestic players like Huawei Xiaomi Oppo and Vivo dominate through brand reputation and competitive pricing while Apple and Samsung maintain a presence in the premium segment The market‚Äôs competitiveness reflects consumers‚Äô emphasis on features design and value for money driving innovation and adaptation among manufacturers For Apple the decline in smartphone shipments in China signals the need to navigate the competitive landscape and address evolving consumer preferences Despite challenges Tim Cook‚Äôs optimism about the long-term opportunities in China underscores Apple‚Äôs commitment to the market As

(NASDAQ:AAPL)","2/6/2024","https://seekingalpha.com/article/4667770-apple-stock-vision-pro-sucess-may-just-move-furniture-around","ANGELA WEISS/AFP via Getty Images ANGELA WEISS/AFP via Getty Images Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported its latest quarterly result with EPS and revenue beating estimates Despite weakness in China the company benefited from resilient conditions in other regions and continued momentum from services while softer guidance retained a layer of uncertainty Maybe the bigger story was the launch of the Vision Pro Apples version of a VR headset it refers to as a spatial computer Early reviews have been very positive with a sense that this first-generation device marks a preview for the company as the next big growth driver Were impressed by the technology which appears to be well ahead of what other companies are doing At the same time we believe that potential success could be too much of a good thing thinking about platform cannibalization If the Vision Pro truly represents a revolution in consumer electronics that would have some consequences for Apples ecosystem including the Mac iPad and wearables We last covered AAPL back in September calling it our least favorite among the Magnificent 7 While Tesla Inc (TSLA) is in strong contention for that title today we remain on the sidelines with Apple eyeing valuation headwinds amid what we believe to be structural growth challenges Ultimately we still see risks for the stock as tilted to the downside and expect volatility going forward Seeking Alpha Seeking Alpha AAPL reported Q1 EPS of $218 coming in $007 above consensus and up 16% from the period last year Revenue of $1196 billion was slightly above estimates but still only representing an increase of 21% year-over-year The gross margin reached 459% from 429% in Q1 fiscal 2023 reflecting the strength in services and the rebound of iPhone sales Apple has also made an effort to control costs with total operating expenses up 1% y/y We mentioned the weakness in China where sales declined by -13% y/y to $208 billion also missing the segment consensus forecast closer to $235 billion This was balanced by otherwise stronger-than-expected trends in the Americas and particularly from Europe where sales increased by 10% y/y During the earnings conference call management pointed out the success of the iPhone 15 which contributed to the best quarter for segment sales since the launch of the iPhone 13 two years ago On the other hand nearly flat Mac sales and the -25% decline from iPad were about in line with expectations source: company IR (author annotation) source: company IR (author annotation) Beyond the nuances it is fair to say Apple remains an operating cash flow juggernaut with the metric reaching $399 billion up from $340 billion in the period last year The company repurchased $21 billion in stock this quarter incremental to the $38 billion in the regular dividend In terms of guidance while not providing financial targets for the current Q2 management suggested total revenue to be in line with last years $95 billion adjusted for the timing of supply chain disruptions that skewed the results in early 2023 Services are expected to be similar to this prior quarter with growth above double digits The setup for Apple into 2024 remains centered on the macro picture The good news here is that the data from the US has come in stronger than expected with a sense that consumer spending remains strong and a path for lower interest rates could provide a rebound of underlying demand There is a sense that sales in segments like the Mac and wearables could stabilize and begin to climb as a replacement cycle kicks in nearly three years removed from the pandemic era boom The company now claims a record installed base of 22 billion devices globally and the impact there moves the flywheel into services with users more engaged across the ecosystem According to consensus the market is forecasting 14% revenue growth this year that should re-accelerate into fiscal 2025 above 6% Higher margins can support room for EPS to climb a bit higher into the high-single digits over the next few years We believe these figures are reasonable even if it is our opinion there is a risk of underperforming For a company on track to generate $400 billion in annual sales it takes a lot to move the needle which is what Apple is attempting to accomplish Seeking Alpha Seeking Alpha The wildcard in the conversation over the next several years has become the Vision Pro headset The understanding is that the company is on track to sell above 400k units this calendar year with the only limitation being supplier manufacturing constraints Still even with the retail price of $3500 that full sales amount of around $14 billion represents less than 05% in the annual top line A small drop for the company in the grand scheme That said the expectation is for a significant ramp-up over the next few years with Bank of America Global Research forecasting units sold could reach 12 million and contribute $18 billion in revenue by calendar year 2028 The group believes the business could add upwards of $046 to firm-wide EPS over the period generating more than $1 billion in profits as soon as 2026 We wont argue with these forecasts considering the strong launch reports and our initial positive impressions of the device The idea here is that Apple has entered a new hardware category that could work as a separate channel into its apps ecosystem Users can experience both entertainment and productivity tools through a novel format but with the familiar Apple design language source: BoA Research shared via X source: BoA Research shared via X As we see it the $3500 price tag is steep for a first-generation product but its easy to envision a roadmap where improvements to the technology eventually reach a mass market-accessible price point An effort to make the headset more mobile while improving the graphical performance seems like the logical next step The same BofA research from above suggests the devices average sales price could drop to $1500 over the next five years The problem we have is in consideration of what Vision Pro means for the rest of the Apple catalog Just as the iPhone launch in 2007 marked the eventual retirement of the iPod the Vision Pro could ultimately make the iPad obsolete over the next decade while also competing with the Mac and iPhone to some extent The difference here is that these categories are already mature with the low-hanging fruit of global adoption already captured The point were getting at here is that Vision Pro doesnt necessarily expand the pie for Apples addressable market but simply shifts sales from existing devices Going back to the latest earnings report sales of iPads and wearables have been in decline with the base case of Vision Pro likely replacing some of those sales from here Were not the first to suggest this concept of the Vision Pro cannibalizing sales of other Apple products but the discussion gains a new light as the device is now on sale We believe the following dynamics are at play: Well agree that there is some speculation here and were sure Apples strategy takes these factors into account in terms of pricing and future development If anything our effort here is simply to roll back expectations that Vision Pro is a game changer or will lead to a new growth renaissance for Apple We dont believe so Looking at AAPL our take is that the company is fine but still faces headwinds to drive long-term growth Chinas macro data hasnt helped but we can also bring up the legitimate competition to the iPhone where its differentiated aspects have been diluted over the last several years with alternatives from premium Android devices On the upside wed like to see strong organic growth and were skeptical that the Vision Pro is the answer Other services like advertising payments and the cloud business are still small and only work to supplement the core hardware business With the stock trading around 28x free cash flow or 29x forward earnings we havent seen enough to justify a significant expansion of multiples from here The company is great but shares remain pricey and would face a deeper correction with exposure to cyclical trends At the end of the day Apple remains a hardware-first company which warrants a more grounded growth premium relative to software tech names source: yCharts source: yCharts We rate AAPL as a hold implying a neutral view on the direction of price from the current level $190 per share seems fair with the market continuing to assign the company a quality and leadership premium On the other hand a sustained rally above $200 in our opinion needs a string of quarterly reports that materially exceed expectations To the downside a break in shares under $180 would open the door for a reset of the 2023 Q4 lows around $165 Monitoring points through 2024

government-induced antitrust headaches now plaguing Big Tech rivals like Amazon (AMZN) Google (GOOG GOOGL) and Meta (META) Until now The Justice Department is reportedly in the final stages of deciding whether to wage a sweeping legal attack on Apple that could compound headwinds already picking up steam for the worlds most valuable company in a rough start to the new year According to the New York Times US antitrust investigators are wrapping up a two-year probe into Apple‚Äôs closely guarded ecosystem Investigators are looking into whether the integration between the company‚Äôs suite of products ‚Äî including iPhones the App Store Apple Watch iMessage and AirTags ‚Äî blocks competition You dont ramp up unless you find that theres something significant there that you want to investigate adjunct Columbia University Law School professor Martin Edel said about the reported probe The multiyear probe he said tends to serve as a harbinger that the department found something it wants to pursue Still he cautioned its possible that the DOJs investigation doesnt turn up any wrongdoing on Apples part Apples antitrust worries come as the company faces a trio of downgrades from Wall Street analysts amid fears of weak demand for iPhones in China where it has offered a rare discount as that countrys economy continues to sputter On Friday Microsoft surpassed Apple as the worlds most valuable publicly traded company at the close of the trading day Apple is also preparing to launch its most ambitious product yet the Vision Pro spatial computer The AR/VR headset which goes on sale Feb 2 is Apples first new device category since it launched the Apple Watch in 2015 and could serve as the companys successor to the iPhone But the AR/VR market is still incredibly small compared to the smartphone space and consumers have tended to tire of the devices after a few months of use A DOJ lawsuit seeking to dismantle Apple‚Äôs walled garden ecosystem would pose a major threat to the companys various revenue streams Apple generates the bulk of its cash through the sale of its wildly popular iPhone which accounted for $2006 billion of the companys $3833 billion in total revenue in 2023 But Apples services and hardware that tie into the iPhone are also incredibly lucrative The companys wearables home and accessories business which includes its Apple Watch and AirPods sales generated $398 billion last year while its growing services business which includes subscriptions for things like Apple Music+ and App Store sales brought in $852 billion Edel said he expects any DOJ antitrust action against Apple to look at how the company maintains its dominant position in a particular market where it holds an alleged monopoly and not how it established prominent market position Apple may be particularly vulnerable to a government-led antitrust challenge in the final months of the Biden administration which has kept up an aggressive push to rein in Big Tech The department has been fairly aggressive after companies that it thinks has maintained a monopoly position through illegal means Edel said University of Miami School of Law professor John Newman told Yahoo Finance that while no antitrust case is easy and monopolization cases are among the hardest the DOJ brings a lot of strengths to the table For one he said prosecutors can gain access to company documents and data before filing a complaint If I were Apple I‚Äôd be pretty worried about this Newman said adding that the DOJ has some of the world‚Äôs top antitrust litigators in-house Critics say that Apple abuses its market position in a number of ways including by charging app developers a 15% to 30% fee on app store sales The company has also been accused of locking out competitors from using Apple services like Find My and the tech giants payment technology Interoperability between Apple and third-party services is also a sticking point as app developers and hardware makers accuse Apple of purposely cutting off access to certain features that Apples devices and services can use There are currently two separate antitrust cases that could impact how the DOJ approaches claims against Apple One is a federal antitrust case heard by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in October Justice Department lawyers were permitted to present arguments in a high-stakes dispute between popular app developer Epic Games and Apple In that case the appeals court upheld a California trial courts ruling that said Apple did not hold a monopoly in the market for mobile app stores However in a minor win for Epic the appeals court also upheld the trial courts ruling that said under anti-steering laws Apple must allow app developers to offer more ways for app users to pay for purchases Apple and Epic are now appealing the decision to the Supreme Court which has yet to say whether it will hear the case What impact the case would have on a DOJ-led antitrust suit Newman said would depend on where the department chose to file its case They could take the fight to Apple‚Äôs doorstep but that would cause the Epic case to loom larger over a DOJ case Newman said DOJ may want to stay out of the Ninth Circuit altogether and write on a clean slate The second case that could that could impact how the DOJ approaches Apple is a pending antitrust suit against Google over its dominance of the search engine market Closing arguments for the case are scheduled to take place in March Apple plays into the conversation because in 2021 Google paid mobile phone manufactures including Apple a combined $26 billion to serve as their default search engines The lions share of those payments went to Apple Analysts at Bernstein say the figure likely nets Apple between $18 billion and $20 billion per year At $20 billion the payments would represent somewhere between 55% and 7% of Apples annual revenue over the last three years If the DOJs investigation of Apple is in fact near its end Edel said talks are probably already underway between its attorneys and Apple Those talks and negotiations he said could potentially also resolve any DOJ competition concerns without the need for litigation Alexis Keenan

Let‚Äôs find out Apple started the year with a handful of analyst downgrades that weighed down its share price after a turbulent finish to 2023 Many unenthused analysts don‚Äôt expect much from the firm this year as iPhone sales continue to be underwhelming Indeed Apple remains a Magnificent Seven firm that‚Äôs continued to put up the returns with more than 40% in gains over the past year That said it‚Äôs been outshined by many of its Magnificent Seven peers on the front of recent returns And questions linger as to what could help iPhone 15 (and its coming iPhone 16) sales kick up a notch Perhaps recent discounts in China could help boost iPhone 15 demand in an ultra-competitive market (Huawei is the force over in China) that‚Äôs faced more than its fair share of economic headwinds In any case don‚Äôt count on such efforts to impact the quarterly numbers due to be released in just over a week With earnings ahead I wouldn‚Äôt chase AAPL stock after its latest jump back to $193 and change Though expectations are now relatively modest I think it will take more than just better-than-expected numbers to move the needle higher Perhaps some AI commentary could do the job? In recent sessions Apple stock seems to be ascending again over hopes for some artificial intelligence (AI) announcement Amazon‚Äôs momentum could continue through the year as it continues trimming its workforce in a bid to shore up financial firepower while also investing heavily in its generative AI projects Over the past 12 months shares of AMZN are up around 58% a solid gain even for a Magnificent Seven member Though shares are still off nearly 16% from their all-time highs I think it‚Äôs just a matter of time before new heights are reached as Amazon looks to gain the cloud with a bit of help from new AI tech Additionally hopes for a healthier consumer could help jolt the e-commerce business which has taken a backseat to Amazon‚Äôs other initiatives of late With layoffs sweeping through various Amazon subsidiaries (Twitch recently shed 35% of its staff) it certainly seems like the company is pushing to bolster profitability in this higher-rate environment Even as rates come down again I‚Äôd look for Amazon to be more deliberate in how it spends money on growth projects moving forward Perhaps AI could receive more love than Amazon subsidiaries like Twitch that aren‚Äôt really helping Amazon pay the bills All considered I think Amazon has what it takes to impress for its coming quarter However I‚Äôd prefer waiting for a pullback which may just happen post-earnings I‚Äôm sure dip-buyers will be ready to pounce quickly Microsoft stock is close to fresh new all-time highs with shares just a few bucks below the $400 per-share mark Going into earnings expectations are going to be quite high That‚Äôs to be expected for a firm that‚Äôs up more than 64% over the past year With shares trading at 384 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) you‚Äôre going to be paying a hefty historical premium to play the tech titan ahead of earnings Though Microsoft‚Äôs AI will pay more of the firm‚Äôs bills over time I‚Äôm not so sure this past quarter is the one that will have AI written all over it Microsoft Copilot still has a long way to go as it works its way into our favorite Microsoft software In any case the expensive AI gem could easily stand to become even more expensive after earnings If you‚Äôre worried about MSFT stock getting away from you after posting its numbers perhaps it makes sense to buy half a stake before and the other half after earnings With the recent launch of the popular Xbox Game Pass title Palworld and the Activision Blizzard integration in full swing it will be interesting to see what the firm has to say about its gaming ambitions during its conference call On the date of publication Joey Frenette held shares of Apple Amazon and Microsoft The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer subject to the InvestorPlacecom Publishing Guidelines Joey Frenette is a seasoned investment writer specializing in technology and consumer stocks Contributing to the Motley Fool Canada TipRanks and Barchart Joey excels in spotting mispriced stocks with long-term growth potential in a fast-paced market Article printed from InvestorPlace Media https://investorplacecom/2024/01/aapl-amzn-msft-how-to-play-the-tech-giants-ahead-of-earnings/ ¬©2024 InvestorPlace Media LLC Stocks to Buy Stocks to Buy Todays Market Stocks to Buy Crypto & Blockchain Stocks to Buy Stocks to Buy Stocks to Buy Financial Market Data powered by FinancialContent Services Inc All rights reserved Nasdaq quotes delayed at least 15 minutes all others at least 20 minutes Copyright ¬© 2024 InvestorPlace Media LLC All rights reserved 1125 N Charles St Baltimore MD 21201 Not Yet a Premium Subscriber?

In the early 1980s the company had established itself as a promising tech business with products like the Apple II In an attempt to make personal computers more accessible it had then developed the Lisa named after Steve Jobs‚Äô daughter Though innovative the computer had sold poorly especially compared to IBM‚Äôs (IBM) PC which was released in 1981 Meanwhile Apple had begun working on the Macintosh which was meant to accelerate the adoption of the personal computer by the masses ‚ÄúApple came into 1984 being walloped by IBM in the personal computing market and needing a new big hit ‚Ä¶ the company had bet it all on the Macintosh spending huge on its R&D building a new state-of-the-art factory for it‚Äù said Margaret OMara the Scott and Dorothy Bullitt chair of American History at the University of Washington But then arose the question of how to advertise the revolutionary new product Steve Hayden now 76 then a copywriter at Chiat/Day still remembers receiving the assignment from Steve Jobs directly The young tech visionary reportedly wanted to ‚Äústop the world in its tracks‚Äù and entrusted the LA-based firm with the job Along with art director Brent Thomas Hayden began brainstorming He rifled through old ad concepts he had worked on in San Francisco and found one with the headline Why 1984 wont be like 1984 a line Hayden attributed to fellow Chiat/Day copywriter Gary Gussick At first Hayden and Thomas toyed with a comical conception of 1984 ‚Äúlike the Jetsons‚Äù But the ad‚Äôs director a well-known talent by the name of Ridley Scott had a better idea ‚ÄúHe came and looked at our initial board ‚Ä¶ he brought in this wonderful coffee table book about the making of Metropolis the movie and the dramatic huge machines and the interface between humans and these kinds of overwhelming technologies‚Äù Hayden explained ‚ÄúAnd so the art direction took a really sharp turn at that point to meet that vision‚Äù The advertising experts had already come up with the Big Brother character and Scott insisted that they introduce another a heroine who would contrast starkly with the all-male cast and break the spell Hayden said A new age The heroine symbolized more than simple rebellion against Big Brother As historian O‚ÄôMara pointed out the ad aired during the height of the Cold War and year of the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles ‚ÄúI think its telling that shes dressed as a track athlete and dressed as if shes running for the United States she said The heroine also represented the Macintosh While computers had previously been monopolized by experts ‚Äî think mainframes and IBM ‚Äî the Macintosh offered a revolutionary user interface that made personal computers accessible to the mass market ‚ÄúShe was supposed to represent freedom and the dawning of a new age and therefore Macintosh‚Äù Hayden said Added Chiat/Day‚Äôs Schwartz: ‚ÄúYou have to remember that this was a time when computers were only used for business ‚Ä¶ When she throws that sledgehammer she is all of us ‚Ä¶ and she represents all of us trying to destroy any kind of tyranny or dictatorship even if its just a dictator for a day we dont want that We want to be free And I think the power of that is the reason why people talk about it 40 years later‚Äù But there were some naysayers within the company Apples board of directors hated it and almost stopped it from airing Meanwhile Hayden himself felt unsure about his work ‚ÄúI had my own concerns that it might be too foreign in structure and content for an American audience‚Äù he said ‚ÄúIt didnt match the traditional advertising forms‚Äù But Jean-Louis Gass√©e now 79 who was then running Apple France still recalls the first time he saw the ad at a 1983 meeting to prepare for the January launch of the Macintosh ‚ÄúWe had never seen advertising like this it was absolutely stunning And then the lights went up a little bit and from the top of the theater machinery a Mac came down on a wire and halfway through the descent it [was amplified by microphones]‚Äù he told Yahoo Finance ‚ÄúSo we could hear what became the highly recognizable ‚Äúbong‚Äù of the Mac starting There was this hysteria in the room‚Äù Though Hayden and the rest of his team at Chiat/Day had never specifically intended ‚ÄúBig Brother‚Äù to represent IBM Jobs quickly adopted that framing After showing the ad Jobs gave a ‚Äúfiery‚Äù anti-IBM speech ‚Äúsaying that the Macintosh would change the world‚Äù according to Gass√©e ‚ÄúIt was easy at the time to superimpose the Big Brother and the big IBM images‚Äù Holding up It is actually stunning to watch the ad today and see how it still holds up Only this time you can imagine Big Brother appearing on your screen as Tesla‚Äôs (TSLA) Elon Musk Meta‚Äôs (META) Mark Zuckerberg and the developers of ChatGPT and other artificial intelligence products At least Jean-Louis Gass√©e sees it that way He asserted that the ad is still relevant as we grapple with the likes of AI and user privacy in the world of Facebook and Google It serves as ‚Äúa good way to remind us of the necessary fight between established powers and upstarts‚Äù He added: ‚ÄúI think the ad presents two views of technology One that is Big Brother-like oppressive and one which is the Macintosh a way to break through the domination of Big Brother technology‚Äù he said ‚ÄúSo this ad in 1983 1984 presented a view of the conflict between usages of technology I think that that conflict is still alive‚Äù Enjoy the Super Bowl Dylan Croll is a Yahoo Finance reporter Related Quotes"

957,"Apples Vision Pro Doesnt Augment Reality‚ÄîIt Sacrifices It","2/19/2024","https://news.yahoo.com/apple-vision-pro-doesn-t-074200971.html","There are many technically impressive aspects of Apple‚Äôs Vision Pro the digital face eater the tech giant released earlier this month But perhaps the most fascinating element is EyeSight which displays a dynamic digital rendering of your eyes (or generic eyes if you don‚Äôt choose to personalize it) on the device‚Äôs front screen Smize and the device smizes with you Cry though and it sounds like EyeSight will not display your tears This function features prominently in the Vision Pro ad that has followed me around the internet for weeks It‚Äôs a close crop of a woman in her 20s with perfect skin and bouncy hair staring into the camera She makes eye contact‚Äîwell ‚Äúeye contact‚Äù‚Äîwith the audience: What we see is not her eyes of course but her EyeSight Apple hopes that this facsimile is enough to fool our lizard brains and CEO Tim Cook has even insisted that this ‚Äúaugmented reality‚Äù with its high-resolution internal live stream of one‚Äôs surroundings will actually keep us in touch with the world around us People donning the Vision Pro may be able to convince themselves they are still connected to others‚Äîto family and friends and colleagues‚Äîdespite the bulky computers strapped to their faces But they will never be able to convince anyone else The spark of human connection we feel making eye contact with EyeSight is a fraud and even our lizard brains will know it I have not tested a Vision Pro or encountered one in person and I realize that may discredit my case with some readers But for all its technical novelty and glint when it comes to human connection the Vision Pro differs from familiar screens in degree more than kind When we are absorbed in an ordinary screen it is obvious to those around us Even very small children can tell when we‚Äôre giving them half our attention making half a human connection (I speak from regrettable experience) You no doubt know what this is like having been on both sides of such conversations yourself: the little half-glances upward the slightly too frequent confusion over a simple narrative (wait who said that?) the steady murmurs of mhm and yeah wow and oh totally meant to suggest at least some attention is diverted from the screen The face computer will be this but worse The same disconnect only more apparent Talking to someone while looking at their EyeSight‚Äîwhile they look through you to the Word document in the middle distance‚Äîwill never feel quite like a normal human interaction It can‚Äôt because it isn‚Äôt a normal human interaction It‚Äôs half an interaction at best mediated by an animation expressly designed to fool our loved ones into forgetting we have other more absorbing things in view Apple‚Äôs trailer for the Vision Pro couldn‚Äôt disguise this fact particularly in its depiction of a father who wears the device while interacting with his kids then uses it to review videos of them while sitting on his couch The time with the children is bad enough He‚Äôs positioned just a little too far from them half his face concealed while they play with each other and make halfhearted attempts to include the digital hybrid crouching where their father should be But the father‚Äôs rewatch of the interaction on the couch is even worse He sits alone in a darkening room‚Äîa spotless gorgeous room bereft of any sign of childish inhabitants‚Äîgazing at happier moments in which he chose not to participate His smile beneath the screen is no doubt intended to communicate happy nostalgia but it plays instead as sorrow If EyeSight showed tears surely we‚Äôd see them Why is he alone like this too lonely to even turn on the lights? Is he divorced? Did his whole family die in a freak accident? Either explanation is more plausible than the patently ridiculous notion that this man is having a good time ‚ÄúRelive a memory as if you‚Äôre right back in the exact moment‚Äù the narrator offers over the couch scene though all the evidence suggests this man did not actually live the moment the first time around Maybe he can tell himself he‚Äôs connecting with his kids Outside the goggles however it‚Äôs obvious he has not augmented reality; he‚Äôs sacrificed it Apple‚Äôs long-term plan for the Vision Pro likely does not include EyeSight with the not-yet-attainable goal being a device that looks like normal glasses and includes a single transparent screen that can change from clear to shaded and back again‚Äîlike those transition lenses your uncle uses That effect if achieved might feel a little more natural But the user‚Äôs attention would be no less divided and the human connection no less inadequate This disconnect has implications beyond personal relationships especially for the work uses laid out in this Wall Street Journal review The Vision Pro may be good for some kinds of focused desk work though I have my doubts (I also suspect a certain somnolent effect) For any kind of social or collaborative work and especially any situation with power dynamics in play the artifice and interruption of normal interaction will be a serious detriment Can you tap someone on the shoulder to talk when they‚Äôre off in a digital world? Can you ask your supervisor to take off her face computer and give you her full attention? Do you just have to gut through a presentation to a conference room full of EyeSights? Imagine asking for a raise via Vision Pro‚Äôs video chat using Apple‚Äôs Personas the full digital avatar of which EyeSight is just one part How do you have that conversation in Uncanny Valley? How do you gauge your conversation partner‚Äôs reactions when they‚Äôve undergone digital Botox? How do you ask for due recognition of your skill and expertise while taking the form of a cartoon?

price is an example of Apple using mimetic desire to stir up interest Public figures with a Vision Pro may in theory inspire their followers to buy it if its cheaper The Vision Pros whopping $3499 price tag may be part of Apples marketing ploy to entice more customers to purchase the mixed-reality headset in the future At least thats what some members of the business community think In a post on X formerly Twitter Jason Levin a marketing strategist who writes about spatial computing characterized Apples so-called promotional tactic as a concept known as mimetic desire Rooted in philosophical thought mimetic desire refers to the notion that people desire the same things that their role models want In the context of the Vision Pro that theory could mean consumers may be more likely to purchase the device because celebrities or influencers they admire own it When consumers see high-status people rocking Vision Pros in public it becomes a status symbol to have one Levin told Business Insider If these people are models to you‚Äîwhich they are for many young people‚Äîmimetic desire kicks in and you subconsciously want a Vision Pro too Some public figures whove been open about their experiences with the Vision Pro on the internet include YouTubers Logan Paul and Casey Neistat rappers like T-Pain and Kid Cudi and tech leaders like former Microsoft strategist Robert Scoble according to Levin Sam Altman the CEO behind OpenAI even said on X that the Vision Pro is the second most impressive tech since the iPhone I just went on my walk again This time on my

Luckey the founder of the Oculus VR headset thats now Metas Quest from last July In it Luckey shared his thoughts on how the Vision Pros multi-thousand dollar price is aligned with Apples plans to attract people to the product The price just doesnt matter for the group of early adopters that theyre targeting he said in the interview referring to Apple But what theyre going to do is to inspire lust in a much larger group of people After all the Oculus founder who did not respond to BIs request for comment said he believes the Vision Pro will eventually be cheaper for the masses During its initial phase after launch the headset he said was purposefully designed with cutting-edge screen resolution display quality and ergonomics to target a wealthier customer base Those with more disposable income would have no problem dishing out thousands of dollars for the glossy device compared to those who dont he said This wealthier customer base who buy and flaunt their headset out in the open may eventually stir up greater consumer interest in the product once its price drops If Apple had tried to go to the low end of the market that wouldve been a mistake Luckey said in the interview Its not just Apple trying to lure future customers to expensive shiny new objects Levin said that Tesla the electrical vehicle company run by CEO Elon Musk has used mimetic desire by putting an expensive price tag on the companys first model to make owning an electric car cool As a result those who see people they respect purchase an expensive Tesla would in theory increase their desire

Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: Football is back in full force this weekend Sorry the other one Saturday marks the beginning of Apple‚Äôs second year of streaming Major League Soccer matches a decade-long $25 billion deal that‚Äôs part of an ambitious effort to attract more fans and money to the 28-year-old league which has long struggled for relevancy in the shadows of other North American sports A centerpiece of that plan is ‚ÄúMLS Season Pass‚Äù a sleekly designed streaming package that ditches the fragmentation other sports suffer from and lets fans stream globally every game ‚Äî without blackouts ‚Äî in the Apple TV app The package costs $1499 per month or $99 for the season and slightly less ($1299 per month or $79 for the year) for existing Apple TV+ subscribers Besides every regular season game it also includes the playoffs and final plus the Leagues Cup and lower-level MLS Next Pro and MLS Next matches ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre creating something new‚Äù Sacha Kljestan a former MLS player and now a broadcast personality told CNN ‚ÄúSomething from nothing that I think 10 years from now people will look back and this might be a game changer in modern television media‚Äù Kljestan co-hosts ‚ÄúMLS 360‚Äù which airs at 7:30 pm ET on Saturdays when a majority of the weekly MLS slate is played Think of ‚Äú360‚Äù as ‚ÄúNFL RedZone‚Äù for soccer junkies with lead anchor Kevin Egan analyst Andrew Wiebe and former soccer players Kaylyn Kyle and Bradley Wright-Phillips whipping viewers around as many as 10 games simultaneously happening showing highlights and providing analysis Similar to how NBC or CBS treats the NFL Apple streams pregame and postgame coverage programs expanded to an hour this year with the latter now beginning at a consistent time (12:30 am ET mostly following the finish of the Saturday games) Also new this season is a Spanish-language version of ‚Äú360‚Äù airing at the same time as the English-language edition The glossy studio shows with sleek graphics and coverage changes to make games easier to findÔªø and watch especially compared to previous MLS coverage deals when games were shown on a hodgepodge of TV networks and local affiliates have worked ‚ÄúOnce people tuned into the product they were watching longer than our linear versions in past years‚Äù Camilo Durana executive vice president of MLS‚Äô Apple partnership properties and events told CNN ‚ÄúWe know that consumers have responded well to the high-quality production and the care we‚Äôve taken with Apple to produce something that looks the part feels premium and is produced in the best possible way‚Äù he added A small number of matches are still shown on broadcast networks like FOX in the US and TSN and French-language RDS in Canada with their own commentators Under the Apple deal games are no longer shown on local broadcast partners Apple is also helping the MLS expand its presence in other products it owns practically making soccer impossible to escape On Wednesday Apple released a new Sports app that shows live MLS scores and pushes people to watch them on ‚ÄúMLS Season Pass‚Äù on the Apple TV app (It was likely not a coincidence that it rolled out the same day that soccer superstar Lionel Messi made his first full-season debut for Inter Miami that streamed exclusively on Apple TV) MLS content will also be shown in Apple News Maps and Music apps plus the matches can be watched on the new $3499 Vision Pro headset The league also released team-branded Beats by Dre (also owned by Apple) headphones this year with player-curated playlists streaming on where else Apple Music The idea according to Durana are ‚Äúmore expansive integrations within Apple‚Äôs ecosystem of products and services to just make the experience better‚Äù thus satisfying existing fans and ideally attracting new ones to the MLS Of course all of this promotion is meaningless if no one is watching or paying Apple doesn‚Äôt release viewership or subscriber numbers Sports Business Journal recently reported that the package has ‚Äúsurpassed‚Äù two million subscribers however it‚Äôs unclear how many are actually paying for it since the service was made free to T-Mobile subscribers and MLS season ticket holders Durana also didn‚Äôt reveal any numbers but said the company saw a ‚Äúmassive and very strong wave of subscribers mid-year‚Äù in 2023 after Messi signed with Inter Miami That matches a third-party report from analytics firm Antenna showing that ‚ÄúMLS Season Pass‚Äù was getting 6000 new signups a day before Messi arrived but soared to 110000 signups a day after he signed Antenna said that the ‚ÄúMessi Effect‚Äù on a year-old streaming package was ‚Äúunique and profound‚Äù Even if the actual viewership is low the $250 million yearly cost for Apple is a practically a ‚Äúrounding error‚Äù for a company worth about $3 trillion It‚Äôs also a ‚Äúgood investment because it‚Äôs another sticky offering to pull people into its ecosystem‚Äù Santosh Rao partner and head of research for Manhattan Venture Partners told CNN Soccer‚Äôs global popularity and the young demographic MLS predominately attracts makes

starting at $149 Reading lens inserts start at $99 Once you factor in additional accessories like a $200 travel case and $50 battery pack holder and more it can cost up to $4600 The New York Times reported The headset enters just as the extended reality (XR) market ‚Äî a category that includes augmented virtual and mixed reality ‚Äî has plateaued with little mainstream consumer adoption The Vision Pro has limited apps out of the gate and will be tethered to a battery pack the size of an iPhone offering about 25 hours of battery life on a single charge The experience however is unmatched when it comes to watching immersive videos and interacting with the world around you Its rare to find a new technology that feels groundbreaking but in the two demos CNN experienced ahead of the launch its easy to see the future ‚Äî or at least an early and very pricey prototype of it The headset itself looks like a pair of designer ski goggles It features a soft adjustable strap on the top a digital crown on the back ‚Äî a bigger version than what youd find on an Apple Watch ‚Äî and another digital crown on the top that serves as a kind of home button Although its still a computer around the eyes its surprisingly light and comfortable to wear The setup process is easy: First the headset tracks the eyes scan hands and maps the room Users will then see an iOS-like interface placed in front of their environment By using eye movements and touching the thumb and pointer finger together it activates a select button allowing people to seamlessly go in and out of apps such as Messages FaceTime Safari and Photos The interface also responds to voice to activate Siri Photos can be viewed at life size or as if youre watching them on a giant movie screen Panoramics meanwhile place you directly within the scene Vision Pro also offers a spatial photo option which lets users view images and videos in 3D for an even more life-like experience Use cases for the Vision Pro vary from cooking and meditating to working Users can sync up their Mac computer to turn the screen into an enormous display and connect a physical keyboard To maximize productivity its possible to have several windows open at once: Email can be kept on one side a Safari browser opened perhaps in the middle and a FaceTime call on the right If a user is wearing Vision Pro while on FaceTime they appear as a Persona or an avatar-like digital representation of their face The real magic of the Vision Pro however is in the immersive videos During a recent demo we watched Star Wars clips on Disney+ while sitting inside a virtual representation of Luke Skywalkers landspeeder vehicle a viewing experience that will delight any movie fan Watching an underwater scene from Avatar 2 in 3D meanwhile was also surreal seemingly placing users right in the ocean Apple has taken steps to reduce the motion sickness problem that has plagued other headsets thanks to a custom chip that cuts down on the latency issue found in similar products Vision Pro includes surround sound with audio pods that sit outside the ears to deliver rich immersive audio To help users navigate their new headset Apple has included a nearly 10-minute guided tour on its website Almost every new Apple product from the iPhone to the Apple Watch promises to use screens of varying sizes to change how we live work and interact with the world The Vision Pro has the potential to do all of that in an even more striking way But out of the gate the Vision Pro will likely remain a niche product for die-hard Apple enthusiasts and developers largely due to the price tag Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said during the first pre-order weekend last month the company sold an estimated 160000 to 180000 Vision Pro headsets Shipping times remained largely unchanged after the first 48 hours indicating demand could wane after core fans have placed orders Shipping windows typically widen after new iPhone models sell out Morgan Stanley analysts project the company will ship up to 400000 Vision Pro units this year The-CNN-Wire ‚Ñ¢ & ¬© 2024 Cable News Network Inc a Warner Bros Discovery Company All rights reserved Your browser is out

971,"None","2/4/2024","https://www.mymobileindia.com/apple-third-party-app-marketplaces-eu-risks/","Apple Fellow Phil Schiller has raised concerns over the security and privacy implications for iPhone users in the EU as Apple prepares to comply with the EU Digital Markets Act by introducing third-party app marketplaces Starting in March 2024 with the iOS 174 update this legislative requirement will allow sideloading and alternative digital storefronts alongside the existing App Store in EU member states While this opens up new avenues for developers it also presents significant risks to end users The ‚Äúwalled garden‚Äù approach of Apple has traditionally safeguarded users against malicious software with the App Store‚Äôs rigorous review process rejecting nearly 17 million app submissions in 2022 alone due to privacy security and content standard failures The introduction of third-party storefronts however introduces a potential pathway for harmful apps to be installed on iPhones circumventing the stringent security measures Apple has in place In response to these regulatory changes Apple has been proactive in implementing security mechanisms to mitigate risks including the notarization of all apps which ensures they are secure and non-malicious before installation regardless of the originating app store Schiller highlighted Apple‚Äôs efforts in engineering over 600 new APIs to support developers in creating secure marketplaces and installing apps emphasizing user control throughout the process Additionally an information sheet will be provided to users prior to app installation offering basic details about the app and enhancing marketplace selection control Despite these measures Schiller acknowledges that Apple‚Äôs ability to protect users is not absolute especially concerning the content of apps from alternative storefronts Notarization focuses on security rather than content leaving the door open for apps that Apple would typically restrict due to objectionable content The onus will be on these third-party marketplaces to establish their own rules and limitations which may not necessarily align with Apple‚Äôs established standards aimed at protecting users and families from inappropriate content In an interview with Fast Company‚Äôs Michael Grothaus published today Apple‚Äôs former marketing chief and current App Store head Phil Schiller said there are privacy and security risks associated with these alternative app marketplaces: ‚ÄúThese new regulations while they bring new options for developers also bring new risks There‚Äôs no getting around that So we‚Äôre doing everything we can to minimize those risks for everyone‚Äù Schiller told me in a recent discussion about the privacy and security impact of the European Commission‚Äôs Digital Markets Act Another risk is that the App Store‚Äôs strict rules surrounding objectionable content might not extend to alternative app marketplaces according to Schiller: ‚ÄúWe have dealt with a lot of input from families from governments on things that we need to do to try to either not allow certain kinds of objectionable content on our App Store or give users control over that experience to decide what‚Äôs best for themselves‚Äîand we have rules around that‚Äù Schiller says ‚ÄúThose rules will not apply in another marketplace unless they choose to make rules of their own [with] whatever criteria they come up with Does that increase the risk of users and families running into objectionable content or other experiences? Yes it does‚Äù Schiller‚Äôs comments reiterate many of the risks that Apple outlined on its website: If not properly managed alternative distribution poses increased privacy safety and security risks for users and developers This includes risks from installing software from unknown developers that are not subject to the Apple Developer Program requirements installing software that compromises system integrity with malware or other malicious code the distribution of pirated software exposure to illicit objectionable and harmful content due to lower content and moderation standards and increased risks of scams fraud and abuse Apple has less ability to address these risks and to support and refund customers regarding these issues Even with safeguards many of these risks remain Due to the EU Digital Markets Act Apple will allow sideloading and third-party digital storefronts alongside the existing App Store in EU member states starting with the iOS 174 update in March 2024 Apple‚Äôs ‚Äúwalled garden‚Äù approach including a rigorous review process has protected users by rejecting nearly 17 million app submissions in 2022 for failing to meet privacy security and content standards App notarization is a security measure implemented by Apple to ensure all apps regardless of their source are secure and non-malicious before being installed on an iPhone as part of Apple‚Äôs effort to mitigate risks from third-party app marketplaces While Apple can secure apps through notarization it does not control the content of apps from third-party storefronts This means apps that Apple would typically restrict could be available through alternative marketplaces Apple is complying with the European Union‚Äôs Digital Markets Act by allowing third-party app downloads and offering developer consultations to navigate these changes effectively ensuring a smooth transition for app distribution and payments in the EU Developers can request 30-minute online or in-person consultations with Apple‚Äôs team to discuss changes impacting iOS Safari and the App Store in the EU including alternative distribution and payment methods Apple reported a revenue of $11958 billion in Fiscal Q1 2024 surpassing analyst expectations and indicating strong sales across iPhone Services and other product lines despite slight shortfalls in Mac and iPad revenues The EU accounts for approximately 7% of Apple‚Äôs global App Store revenue Despite the small percentage the recent regulatory changes pose new challenges and opportunities for Apple in the European market While Apple CEO Tim Cook acknowledges the challenges posed by the DMA compliance the company remains focused on preserving its ecosystem‚Äôs privacy security and usability The full impact on financial performance remains to be seen in future quarters Apple announced plans to allow third-party app stores in Europe including a ‚ÄúCore Technology Fee‚Äù for apps sold outside its App Store and a ‚Ç¨1000000 letter of credit requirement for opening an app store Critics including Spotify‚Äôs CEO argue that Apple‚Äôs new policy imposes high financial burdens on developers especially smaller ones potentially stifling innovation and diversity in the app market Spotify CEO Daniel Ek criticized Apple‚Äôs policy in a blog post calling it ‚Äúextortion‚Äù due to the combination of the per-install fee and restrictions on in-app payments The requirement of a ‚Ç¨1M letter of credit and per-install fees pose significant financial challenges for smaller developers potentially excluding them from establishing their own app stores Apple‚Äôs approach to DMA compliance is expected to lead to legal challenges with accusations that the company is making it difficult and costly to leave its App Store Also Read: EU‚Äôs DMA Pushing Apple to Enable App Sideloading on iPhones Also Read: Apple Announces iOS Safari and App Store Changes in EU to Comply with DMA Also Read: Apple Faces Criticism Over New Third-Party App Store Policy in Europe Also Read: Apple Adapts to EU Digital Markets Act with Developer Consultations and Q1 Earnings Success My Mobile has always believed in well researched in-depth truthful and relevant content which has evolved with time and produced by the very best of well informed journalists It has always been our endeavour to provide tremendous value to both readers and advertisers with our relevance and reach Copyright ¬© 2023 All Right Reserved My Mobile India"

Why Apple Is In Better Shape Than People Realize","2/8/2024","https://investorplace.com/2024/02/aapl-stock-forecast-surprise-why-apple-is-in-better-shape-than-people-realize/","Countdown to Luke Lango‚Äôs ‚Äú2nd Trillion-Dollar AI Trade‚Äù The US govt just unlocked an $8 trillion market to move in a new direction See how it could unleash 6000% potential upside The consumer electronics giant continues to perform strongly and reward its stockholders Advertisement Source: Yalcin Sonat / Shutterstockcom Despite some ongoing concerns according to my Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock forecast there are still plenty of reasons to buy Questions continue to surround Apple some of which were not answered by the company‚Äôs recent fourth-quarter financial results Sales of the company‚Äôs legacy technology products such as its iPhone and MacBook computer remain tepid and it‚Äôs not yet known how its new augmented reality headset will fare with consumers But these questions don‚Äôt take away from the fact that Apple remains one of the best stocks investors can hold in their portfolio There was a lot of nail-biting when Apple issued its Q4 2023 print Analysts and media zeroed in on the fact that Apple‚Äôs iPhone sales in China declined 13% in the October through December quarter Home to its main iPhone manufacturing plant and with 20% of its global iPhone sales coming from China the nation of 14 billion people remains strategically important to Apple However all the handwringing over China obscured some very strong results from the company Apple‚Äôs revenue rose 2% year-over-year in Q4 ending four consecutive quarters in which the company‚Äôs annual sales declined Apple‚Äôs gross margin came in at 459% versus 453% that was forecast Despite a decrease in China iPhone sales globally totaled $6970 billion beating Wall Street forecasts of $6782 billion It was the company‚Äôs first full quarter of iPhone 15 sales Revenue from the MacBook computer also came in ahead of estimates at $778 billion In fact Apple‚Äôs consumer electronic devices showed sales growth in all regions of the world except for China which is undergoing an economic slowdown and where Apple faces growing competition from domestic smartphone makers such as Huawei But overall Apple produced very strong results beating analysts‚Äô estimates on both the top and bottom lines Management said they expect iPhone sales in the current first quarter to be similar to last year‚Äôs $5133 billion and that its services should grow 11% The day after Apple‚Äôs Q4 print the company‚Äôs new Vision Pro mixed-reality headset went on sale around the world Reviews of the device have been positive This is Apple‚Äôs first entirely new electronics product since 2015 and pre-orders were so strong that Apple moved up the launch date to February from a previous schedule of late spring While some analysts have taken issue with the Vision Pro‚Äôs price of $3499 reviewers seem to agree that the headset is worth the expense The Vision Pro‚Äôs global sales will be included in Apple‚Äôs next earnings report and should help counter any slowdown in sales of its iPhone or other devices In recent days it was reported that Apple‚Äôs manufacturing facilities in China have increased production of the Vision Pro to meet growing demand Apple is also working with software developers to create apps that can be used with the augmented reality headset Analysts are forecasting 200000 to one million unit sales of the device this year Outside China Apple‚Äôs business continues to fire on all cylinders But even in China Apple is managing the situation as best it can In mid-January Apple announced discounts on its devices to spur sales including knocking the equivalent of $70 off its iPhone 15 The company is also moving its manufacturing out of China and to low-cost centers such as India Other US companies ranging from Nike (NYSE:NKE) to Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) have also run into trouble in China and are pulling up stakes At the same time Apple continues to prioritize its shareholders In Q4 2023 Apple spent nearly $27 billion on dividend payments and stock buybacks The company continues to buyback more of its own shares than any other publicly traded company It‚Äôs also one of the few mega-cap technology companies that pays a dividend And AAPL stock continues to appreciate rising 25% in the last 12 months bringing its five-year gain to 345% Apple‚Äôs future outlook and growth are being questioned but its current problems are mainly in China Outside that country Apple remains a strong brand and continues to post strong sales That its Vision Pro headset has just gone on sale should give the company‚Äôs earnings a jolt going forward There‚Äôs no question that Apple continues to provide solid returns to investors with its share price gains dividend payouts and stock buybacks Anyway you look at it AAPL stock is a buy On the date of publication Joel Baglole held a long

986,"Is Everyone Sleeping On Apples Real Potential In 2024? (Rating Upgrade) (NASDAQ:AAPL)","1/18/2024","https://seekingalpha.com/article/4663595-is-everyone-sleeping-on-apple-real-potential-in-2024-rating-upgrade","Justin Sullivan/Getty Images News Justin Sullivan/Getty Images News We are upgrading our recommendation on Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock from a Sell to a Buy As we get further away from those weak earnings back in June 2023 were feeling better about Apples sales and profits going forward The company seems to have worked through that rough patch successfully Looking ahead to 2024 we see a few things that should drive growth for Apple: the new iPhone 15 coming out later this year and their augmented reality glasses Vision Pro that are launching soon In our view analysts are being too cautious with their single-digit growth estimates for Apples revenue and earnings in 2024 We see several reasons why growth could exceed those modest expectations: First Apples new AI-powered products should provide a nice boost to sales in 2024 as they roll out innovations like AI Phone/ PC/ Smartwatch and augmented reality Second Apple just reclaimed the top spot in smartphone shipments That larger installed base along with their services business that grew 15% last quarter gives them stable recurring revenues that can support ongoing top line growth Third these new products and services should generate operating leverage that can drive EPS growth faster than revenues And fourth Apples massive share buyback program - currently reducing shares outstanding by around 3% per year - is already set to deliver a nice lift to EPS just from that financial engineering So between the AI product tailwinds the services momentum operating leverage and capital allocation we believe Apple has upside potential from the single-digit growth rates currently modeled by analysts The story is stronger than the modest consensus suggests We see room for positive surprises as 2024 unfolds In this article well also take a look at the potential for Apples upcoming Vision augmented reality headset Analyst estimates dont seem to be factoring in much impact from Vision Pro yet But its slated to be announced on January 19th and available for shipment starting February 2nd Getting a sense of Vision Pros possibilities can help investors be prepared for its launch and impact We want to give you a heads-up on what this futuristic product might mean for Apples business as the launch date fast approaches The market may not be pricing it in yet but we think Vision could be a bigger deal than people expect once it hits the market We think Apples Vision Pro headset will avoid comfort issues and dizziness by separating batteries and using augmented realitys natural focus on real and virtual objects This extended wearability expands use cases beyond gaming into productivity apps In addition Apple also has an edge on content over Meta Platforms Inc (META) thanks to visionOS allowing users to access tons of existing 2D iOS apps until AR versions are available Its pretty exciting that Apple just passed Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (OTCPK:SSNLF) as the top-selling smartphone brand in 2023 according to IDC IDC IDC Were not too shocked by the news There were a lot of signs pointing to huge demand for the iPhone 15 that just came out For example Google Trends showing way higher search interest for the iPhone 15 compared to last years iPhone 14 Google Google With Apple now shipping the most smartphones it gives them even more leverage over suppliers They already had plenty of bargaining power before when negotiating deals But being number one in sales makes Apples position stronger Since Tim Cook took over as CEO Apples culture has changed Its no longer the pioneering innovator it was under Steve Jobs Todays Apple despite the mocking it still gets at each iPhone launch has turned into a profit-focused machine that iteratively improves existing tech So securing the best parts and manufacturing has become a priority for Apple Apples advantage in shipments helps it maintain its standing and ensures it keeps getting the best components from suppliers 2024 is looking like a big year for consumer electronics like AI-powered phones and computers Even though Alphabet Inc (GOOG GOOGL) and Samsung got their AI gadgets to market first the field is so competitive now that Apple can still make a wave with a late entrance The key for Apple is using its relationships to get the most advanced chips before rivals like the cutting-edge 3nm processors theyve lined up from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSM) for the iPhone 15 That should give them a performance edge even if their AI phone launches after competitors in 2024 We think these AI phones and PCs are kicking off a whole new consumer tech cycle which will keep fueling Apples growth in 2024 Also while we arent expecting any sci-fi magic from Apples rumored augmented reality headset they have a talent for perfecting emerging tech in a slick usable way people love AR may start as a niche plaything but Apple could turn it into a mainstream computing platform Thats the big leap to watch for Importantly we dont think the Vision Pro will cannibalize iPhone or Mac sales since it serves different use cases It should be incremental revenue strengthening the ecosystem We dont think the market has fully accounted for the potential of the Vision Pro yet for two reasons: (1) it hasnt launched yet and (2) the current VR/AR market isnt very active right now However we believe Apples Vision Pro could really shake up and revive the AR/VR/MR market in 2024 It seems focused on solving some of the issues with current headsets and improving the overall customer experience Apple has a history of coming into emerging tech markets late but then completely changing the game The Vision Pro launch could spark a lot more mainstream interest and adoption of AR/VR tech To demonstrate how we believe Apples strategy can impact the AR/VR/MR market in 2024 we will utilize Metas Quest 3 as an example Well also chat about Apples competitive edge in this market Later we want to talk about which types of users and scenarios seem the best fit for Apples product And how the launch could impact Apples stock price VR headsets can offer a really convenient and visually engaging experience compared to current consumer electronics especially for more passive activities like browsing watching videos and reading articles online However issues like dizziness and heavy weight have prevented VR from going fully mainstream so far Doing these more passive activities in the Quest 3 is easier and better than staring at a computer screen phone or even a 4K TV The Quests screen size and resolution either match or blows those other devices out of the water And you can adjust the virtual screen size and distance to customize it perfectly for you What we love is the transparent mode that lets you see the real world while using the headset We can be watching a YouTube video then get up and walk to the kitchen for coffee stop on the couch or even use the bathroom without taking the headset off or pausing what were doing Thats huge for multitasking and avoiding interruptions if youre deep into research or focused work The virtual keyboard works surprisingly well too for light typing needs You can also use hand-tracking gestures to navigate Overall the typing and input experience feels slightly inferior to using a real keyboard or touchscreen But its good enough for casual use We think the Quest 3 really nails convenience and flexibility for productive at-home use cases Once you free yourself from a fixed screen and can move around freely its hard to go back Were excited to see how Apple pushes the envelope further with the Vision Pro glasses So lets chat about Apple and the new Vision Pro glasses This is a new product for Apple but it utilizes existing mature AR/VR technologies To provide some perspective lets look at Meta CEO Mark Zuckerbergs recent comments on the Vision Pro: Theres no kind of magical solutions that they have to any of the constraints on laws of physics that our teams havent already explored and thought of Hes right that companies like Meta Samsung Microsoft and Sony have been leading in AR/VR steadily advancing the core technologies over the years Apple wasnt first - theyve never been shy about being late adopters when it comes to the latest tech whether its photography charging or other innovations But what Apple excels at is refinement and fine-tuning Rather than inventing brand-new tech they focus intensely on performance stability and polish Weve seen this movie before Toms Hardware Toms Hardware Additionally by controlling both the hardware and software Apple faces far fewer compatibility issues compared to the fragmented Android landscape Quote from Bill Gates: Your most unhappy customers are your greatest source of learning So what lessons acquired from Meta can Apple apply to the improvement of MR headsets? Lets look at a couple of areas: After using the Quest 3 for about an hour we definitely felt the weight on our necks and shoulders even while changing positions Early reviews suggest its around 453g including 200-300g for the separate battery pack Compared to Quest 3 the experience is enhanced by moving the battery off the head Thus in theory it may partially resolve the weight problem XR Today XR Today Mark Zuckerberg seemed to dismiss the benefits of higher-resolution displays: They went with a higher resolution display and between that and all the technology they put in there to power it it costs seven times more and now requires so much energy that now you need a battery and a wire attached to it to use it They made that design trade-off and it might make sense for the cases that theyre going for We agree that Quest 3s resolution is good enough for media viewing But the see-through VR mode is pixelated and blurry Thats because its not true transparency - the cameras capture your surroundings and project it on the screens While youre focused on the virtual content most of the time the low VR visual quality causes eye strain and dizziness with prolonged use It seems like Mark Zuckerberg and Meta have been laser-focused on building a virtual world that connects everyone Thats why their VR technology prioritizes creating a completely immersive and visually stunning alternate reality you can share with others But in Metas rush to build this virtual universe they may have neglected some fundamentals around integrating that digital experience seamlessly with the real world Aline tech Aline tech Quest 3 lacks the excellent resolution of Vision Pro It is anticipated to have reduced motion sickness and improved see-through vision over Quest 3 LEL LEL The advantage of Apples approach is it provides a more natural experience since you maintain a visual connection to the real world around you This reduces the possibility of lag and allows for a more precise blending of real and virtual objects Apple Apple Apple has a big advantage over other companies in building augmented reality headsets because of its huge community of app developers Even though Metas Oculus Quest is currently the top-selling headset its app store doesnt have that many productivity tools for users - most of the apps are games and entertainment Apples new Vision OS will allow users to download existing iPhone and iPad apps in a 2D version on the headset even if those apps havent been updated for a 3D interface yet This gives Apple a huge advantage in terms of the selection of apps available for the headset since there are way more apps on the App Store for iOS compared to whats available on the Quest store So even though the Oculus Quest costs less than Apples rumored Vision headsets and launched earlier we think Apples Vision Pro headset will end up having a much larger total addressable market and more long-term success than the Quest given its software edge So who will be the first target audience for the Vision Pro and what value will it create for them? We think the superior media viewing and reading experience should appeal most to knowledge workers and creatives For office workers doing lots of typing and writing like coders or report writers it may not replace their main workstation yet But for senior managers who read more than write the Pro could boost productivity when working remotely If Apple solves the weight and dizziness issues its a huge upgrade for focused reading and thinking work Some critics mock the separate battery pack design as clumsy and inconvenient But in our experience using headsets you tune out the real world anyway when absorbed in virtual content The battery pack fades away Further Mark Zuckerberg questioned the premium pricing strategy: We innovate to make sure that our products are as accessible and affordable to everyone as possible But new tech often debuts expensive targeting early adopters first Premium pricing is sustainable if it creates exclusive appeal for affluent users The demand and buzz this generates can kickstart the viral aspirational effect needed for mainstream adoption The original iPhone followed this model The Vision Pros steep $3500 price limits the addressable market initially But we think the unique use cases like premium airline travel have a high social status value that will drive an influencer halo effect Imagine the TikTok potential when wealthy execs don their futuristic Apple AR headsets in first-class cabins This buzz is key to building the brand So how much could the Vision Pro contribute to Apples bottom line? We see three key market opportunities: First if we assume affluent business managers/travelers are a core target there are 460 million business travelers in the US If just 1% buy the Vision Pro thats $16 billion in potential revenue Currently the Pro is only launching in the US but longer term it could expand globally if successful Business travelers worldwide spend $740 billion annually If 5% of that budget went towards Vision Pros to boost productivity it could drive $37 billion in sales Additionally we expect wealthy consumers will purchase Vision Pros for home entertainment and status buying multiple units for family members If the top 025% of the 22 billion households worldwide opt for the immersive experience averaging 4 headsets each thats 22 million units moved and $77 billion in revenue A massive 20% growth catalyst for Apple from this product alone At first glance Apples valuation looks steep - its P/E and P/S ratios sit well above 5-year averages SA SA Analysts seem to be taking a cautious view on Apple for 2024 - currently estimating low-to-mid-single digit growth for revenue and earnings per share That puts Apples forward P/E ratio around 27x SA SA But we think those estimates are too conservative for a few reasons: First 2024 should see the launch of exciting new AI consumer electronics from Apple For example Canalys predicts decent growth in smartphones PCs and smartwatches of 48 and 17% CanalysCanalysCanalys Canalys Canalys Canalys We expect Apples AI products except maybe the Vision augmented reality headset to hit in the second half of 2024 As a premium brand Apple could grow as fast or faster than the overall market trends Second Apples services revenue grew 15% last quarter in 2023 - thats a stable recurring revenue stream tied to their huge installed base of users With Apple regaining the top spot in shipments we dont see service revenue slowing down much And third estimates seem to discount the potential boost from the rumored Vision headset and related services That could be big So we believe revenue growth assumptions are too low If Apple can accelerate the top line operating leverage should boost earnings growth even faster The aggressive share buybacks reducing shares outstanding by around 3% annually are already set to deliver half the baseline EPS growth analysts have modeled SA SA Also we need to factor in the companys profitability which has also expanded significantly versus historical levels Gross margins are 350 basis points higher and return on equity hit 171% compared to a 106% 5-year average SA SA Apples ROE is top-tier even among large tech peers we track With many concerns around rich valuations in tech ROE is an important metric to watch According to our CAPM model the required return threshold to hold a stock is around 11% -

992,"Spotify plans to launch in-app purchases if Apple gets out of the way","1/24/2024","https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/24/24048561/spotify-dma-eu-apple-app-store-epic","By Ariel Shapiro lead reporter of Hot Pod a newsletter covering podcasting and the audio industry She previously worked at Forbes where she covered media and entertainment At first glance the mockups Spotify has created of its dream app don‚Äôt look like much of anything: a card that says how much a subscription costs the list price of an audiobook and a button that lets you enter your payment information Isn‚Äôt that how the app already works? Much to Spotify‚Äôs consternation none of that is there today Because Apple takes a 30 percent fee on in-app purchases for digital goods and services companies like Spotify have decided it is simply not worth it to allow such transactions inside their apps It‚Äôs led to a bad experience for users ‚Äî how do we even buy these things? ‚Äî and fewer sales for Spotify which has to hope its users are motivated enough to go somewhere else to sign up for a subscription or purchase an audiobook But that could all change soon at least in Europe In the next few months we will start to see the effects of the Digital Markets Act a 2022 EU law that clamps down on anticompetitive practices by tech giants it has deemed gatekeepers Apple included The law prohibits gatekeeper services like Apple‚Äôs App Store from charging a fee for apps to promote their own products and subscriptions or requiring apps to use a specific payments processor something that gets at the core of Spotify‚Äôs fury with Apple and attacks the heart of Apple‚Äôs app business With enforcement of the law coming up Spotify is sharing how it hopes to revamp its app in response But how exactly Apple complies with the law could have major implications for both companies ‚Äî including how much of these app mockups turn into reality Spotify which has aggressively pursued Apple‚Äôs App Store practices in public communications and in court is preparing for the dream scenario The company is hoping to implement full in-app payment functionality that will allow users to upgrade their subscription or buy an audiobook with a tap Parts of the new user experience will begin to roll out in Europe on March 7th But how much of it comes to fruition depends on Apple‚Äôs compliance It is not clear whether Apple will have to freely allow developers to offer their own in-app purchases under the law Apple has not yet shared how its policies will change But in other countries where regulators have forced open exceptions in the App Store Apple has found ways to limit them as much as possible If in-app purchases are freely allowed the most obvious benefit would be for Spotify‚Äôs core business: its premium subscription since it‚Äôll be much easier for free users to upgrade Gustav Gyllenhammar Spotify‚Äôs vice president of markets and subscriber growth says the new App Store rules could be game-changing for the company‚Äôs audiobook and podcasting verticals too since right now it‚Äôs too difficult for users to make purchases from either ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve seen that the √† la carte audiobooks business has not taken off materially yet And we think that this is a key reason for that because it‚Äôs just impossible when you want to purchase the item where you consume it and where you discover it‚Äù Gyllenhammar told The Verge Gyllenhammar says that people are listening to audiobooks on Spotify when they‚Äôre bundled into the app subscription The problem is the ‚Äúfriction of the purchase‚Äù is stopping users from buying one-off books Podcasts which Spotify has struggled to monetize beyond advertising (a fickle business at best) could also operate differently under more relaxed rules ‚ÄúThe way that podcasting as we know it really started growing on iOS has always had these restrictions ‚Ä¶ You haven‚Äôt been able inside of the app to upsell to gated content exclusive content and enhanced content‚Äù Gyllenhammar said He thinks that with in-app purchase options available creators are more likely to ‚Äúevolve‚Äù beyond the traditional ad-supported model The effect on podcasting and audiobooks for Spotify is not marginal The ability of those two verticals to thrive is key to Spotify‚Äôs long-term growth Spotify CEO Daniel Ek has justified the billion-dollar-plus investment in the spoken word business so the company can be less dependent on the music industry which siphons off a good chunk of Spotify‚Äôs revenue through licensing fees Europe is far and away Spotify‚Äôs biggest market ‚Äî 39 percent of its premium subscribers are in Europe followed by 27 percent in North America 21 percent in Latin America and 12 percent across the rest of the world And the Digital Markets Act contributes to what appears to be a global reckoning with Big Tech For the first time large-scale regulation has tailwinds The fact that such regulation is happening in Europe first is no surprise ‚Äî the EU has a much stronger regulatory tradition than in the US But you are also seeing crackdowns in countries such as South Korea Japan and Australia Even in the US which is pretty weak on antitrust the Justice Department is reported to be opening an investigation into Apple specifically After decades of fruitless chatter about tech giants‚Äô unchecked power governments all at once are finally doing something about it According to Anu Bradford law professor at Columbia University and author of Digital Empires: The Global Battle to Regulate Technology this global shift is due to an escalating loss of trust in Big Tech companies ‚ÄúThere is this kind of a cumulative effect of resentment across a number of the leading companies across a number of grounds There are privacy concerns there are content moderation concerns and there are market power concerns Now there‚Äôs this momentum around AI the idea that these shifts are really just tremendous and it‚Äôs the same big players that are now going to control the AI future‚Äù Bradford told The Verge ‚ÄúTheir dominance is palpable; you can‚Äôt anymore kind of close your eyes to it‚Äù Spotify has been among the most visible tech opponents to Apple‚Äôs dominance because it is in a unique position It is a large tech company with a massively popular product but it is substantially at the mercy of the platforms on which it operates Epic Games which makes Fortnite also fought against Apple by suing the company in US federal court over its App Store policies It won a minor victory: The court ruled that Apple needed to make it easier for app developers to at least provide a pathway to off-app payments Apple‚Äôs compliance with the ruling elicited even more rage from Epic Spotify and other developers Instead of charging 30 percent for in-app purchases the company said it would charge a mere 27 percent of revenue from digital products and services if an app so much as linked to an off-app payment portal The move signaled to the tech industry that Apple would not comply easily or quietly with the Digital Markets Act The reason why Apple is being so fussy even compared to its fellow tech giants according to Bradford is that this law takes aim at the core of their app business And if compliance means that it cannot charge for in-app purchases it stands to lose a lot of money ‚ÄúThis is not a casual obligation for them This is a really major issue and they‚Äôd be much more comfortable continuing to pay fines‚Äù said Bradford ‚ÄúBut to me kind of the momentum is pretty clear that regulators are not comfortable with this model Apple has heard the message loud and clear and the question becomes whether there will be a point at which they just decide that this is the reality and they need to deal with it‚Äù If this all plays out as the non-gatekeepers hope it will make for a more competitive space Spotify has a lot to benefit from that but it could also gain new nemeses in the process ‚ÄúThe idea is that if the regulation works there will not be others that grow into being gatekeepers because the market is contestable‚Äù Bradford said ‚ÄúThe ideal is that Spotify would face competition from many other players that have been able to take advantage of the opening of the marketplace‚Äù / News and analysis on the biggest events in audio Subscribe to Hot Pod Insider for full

Hardly On Thursday changes were made to the way app distribution works on iPhones ‚Äî changes that should have been welcomed by developers who have long been at the mercy of strict rules around that process Specifically the changes take effect in the European Union where Apple has been pushed to comply with the Digital Markets Act by March this year Its a law that designates the App Store which takes a 30% commission from developers as an unfair gatekeeper by acting as the only digital store from which apps can be sold and bought on iPhones Despite trying to retain that control ruthlessly over the years Apples changes in the face of the EU legislation mean two main things for developers First third-party stores will finally be allowed onto Apples operating system once iOS 174 is released It means developers can simply bypass the App Store Second Apples cut on transactions will drop from 30% to 17% with an extra 3% fee for use of its payment processing As my colleague Peter Kafka writes this has all made Apple quite unhappy In a release announcing the changes Apple said this new system under the EU act opens new avenues for malware fraud and scams as well as other harmful content But it seems to have made a lot of people quite unhappy too Tim Sweeney CEO of Fortnite-maker Epic Games described the changes as hot garbage as he pointed to the fine print that seemingly complicates matters for developers Apple for instance will have tight control over which third-party app stores end up on its system and compete with it Apple said this was to ensure marketplace developers commit to ongoing requirements that help protect users and developers Sweeney suggests otherwise Related stories Apple proposes that it can choose which stores are allowed to compete with their App Store Sweeney wrote on X They could block Epic from launching the Epic Games Store and distributing Fortnite through it for example or block Microsoft Valve Good Old Games or new entrants Nikita Bier who founded businesses acquired by Discord and Meta took aim at a new core technology fee being introduced by Apple The fee means that apps sold from its App Store or third-party marketplaces will have to pay ‚Ç¨050 for each first annual install per year over a 1 million threshold Using Apples own fee calculator he estimated that companies that made $10 million in sales from 10 million customers would result in an annual cut of $62 million for Apple However when the revenue per user was placed to higher than $1 it resulted in much better returns for app makers Eric Seufert general partner at Heracles Capital noted that the fee presents an appreciable financial hurdle to clear for apps that are downloaded from third-party stores seemingly defeating the purpose of those stores being allowed onto iOS in the first place It seems odd to me that the European Commission would approve these platforms charging fees on apps that are sideloaded / downloaded from third-party stores Seufert said Others like Ashley Gullen lead developer of game-making software Construct likened Apples new fee structure to a controversial install fee introduced by Unity last year Did did Apple just introduce the equivalent of Unitys runtime install fee but for all iOS app developers in the EU?! pictwittercom/Z7KMiWEqmD Unity creator of a game engine platform initially planned on charging developers $020 per install for games with over 200000 installs but later revised the plans after facing backlash In a statement Apple said its changes which came after spending months in conversation with the European Commission comply with the DMA However it said it would limit the changes to the EU because it is concerned about their impacts on the privacy and security of users Apples focus remains on creating the most secure system possible within the DMAs requirements But even with these safeguards in place many risks remain ‚Äî and in the EU the DMAs changes will result in a less secure system the company said It added that it created new tools for developers such as a fee calculator and developer documentation to help them understand the options available for their EU apps and make informed decisions Developers will be forced to reckon with a whole new reality of app distribution that theyve barely begun to grasp As Epic Games Sweeney put it: It will take more time to parse both the written and unwritten parts of this new horror show so stay tuned Read next Jump to"

Although iPhone shipments declined by 21% in Q4 Apple surpassed Vivo for the entire year However analysts predict sales pressure in 2024 attributing it to competition limited product upgrades

Reichman University An Israeli startup has created a smart wristband that uniquely turns an Apple Watch into a camera capable of taking photos and recording video and audio without relying on an accompanying phone Wristcam‚Äôs special strap includes two cameras (front and rear facing) to allow users to take the images or record short messages which they can then send directly to others with the app or upload to their paired phone to share in other ways ‚ÄúThe developer ecosystem for the Apple Watch is nowhere near [as advanced as] the iPhone‚Äù Writstcam CEO Roi Ginat tells NoCamels ‚ÄúMany companies on an ongoing basis struggle with their phone applications and they did not want to share any resources with developing a watch app‚Äù But for Wristcam the evolution into a camera for the watch was a natural one Seeking to make an easy-to-use video platform the company initially produced a live streaming app for the iPhone but soon realized that it did not offer any unique features to attract new users Instead the company transformed their product into the device for the Apple Watch which according to analysts was on 115 million wrists by December 2022 While the Wristcam is not formally affiliated with Apple the tech giant did provide the company with a special security chip to embed into the strap so that it can properly connect to an iPhone The Made for iPhone (MfI) chip is provided to third-party companies whose products such as chargers and headphones are deemed compatible by Apple The app is downloaded onto the paired phone and therefore automatically the watch too and once installed the app connects to the camera on the strap This allows the strap to send audio and video messages directly to another device with the same app or to a paired phone in order to share via messaging services such as WhatsApp or even post to social media In order to work all devices must be connected to the internet While most of the audio and video messages are designed to be around 20 seconds long the app can record for several minutes at a time The strap can also store a large number of messages as it has eight gigabytes of memory Safety Strap The unique camera also works as a safety feature with a separate Wristcam app called Protect This allows a user to automatically live stream in an emergency to up to three people with the app who form what Ginat calls a ‚Äúsafe network‚Äù ‚ÄúProtect is a first of all on a mission to try and prevent emergencies prevent physical or mental damage and suffering if possible and improve handling of those situations when they occur with better speed and better accuracy‚Äù Ginat explains All the user needs to do he says is push a button that will start live broadcasting for people in their safe network The application is set up to immediately alert everyone in that safe network as a critical notification which is sent even when the phone is in silent or do not disturb mode (Israel‚Äôs national alert system for incoming rocket fire also bypasses these modes) The Protect app automatically uploads the live-streamed video and audio to the cloud for review at a later date The app even works without the camera only recording audio Once another person is watching the live stream they can start voice communication with the original user through the app Ginat says this particular feature works well when people are in distress and need someone to calm them down ‚ÄúWhether it‚Äôs making sense of the person in distress whether it‚Äôs calming them down or directing them on the right things to do ‚Äì it‚Äôs basically being there‚Äù he says ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs already helpful and it‚Äôs fast‚Äù In the US and in Israel Protect is also designed to facilitate calls from someone watching the livestream to the emergency services The feature was made available for free in Israel last year following the massive terror attack of October 7 When the emergency services in either country are contacted the caller can easily transmit the video and audio from the Protect app to the call center giving the operator an understanding of the situation who is involved and where the caller is located ‚Äú911 calls typically start with a lot of very basic questions like your name where are you who‚Äôs there with you‚Äù he says and the app helps to provide this information The emergency call can be made while still watching the live stream which Ginat says is a crucial feature as it means the line of communication with the person in distress remains open The company which was founded in 2012 and has offices in Ramat Gan California and China is funded by private investors rather than venture capital firms They are Ginat says nonetheless always looking for new sources of support The wristband is currently available on Amazon in the US and Europe as well as in certain European countries that do not have the option to purchase from the online shopping platform Future plans Ginat says include incorporating artificial intelligence to improve the technology both for communication and personal safety ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs most exciting for me now is the combination of AI and our rich media technologies because it‚Äôs just a perfect match both for safety and health‚Äù he says NOCAMELS Straight To Your Inbox Accessibility Tools"

1017,"Is an iPad Worth It? 5 Reasons Why You Should Buy One","2/19/2024","https://www.lifewire.com/should-i-buy-an-ipad-5248640","EVs have been around a long time but are quickly gaining speed in the automotive industry Learn how the long-coming and inevitable shift to electric impacts you Whether you want to build your own home theater or just learn more about TVs displays projectors and more weve got you covered Get techs top stories in 30 seconds: iPads are expensive but useful if you like to stream videos or read on the go Jump to a Section An iPad offers better portability than a laptop and their big screens make them better than a phone for streaming video reading websites and getting work done The iPad is also a great e-book reader You may not need an iPad if you already carry around a phone and a laptop and they are pretty expensive but you might be surprised at just how often an iPad can come in handy This guide will help determine whether you need an iPad based on your lifestyle and needs if youre on the fence An iPad is a tablet that runs on iPadOS a variation of the operating system that powers iPhones As a tablet an iPad is a thin touchscreen device that resembles an oversized iPhone or the screen of a laptop with the keyboard portion removed In addition to the standard iPad you can also get a lightweight iPad Air a powerful iPad Pro or a compact iPad mini These devices are all highly integrated into the Apple ecosystem allowing you to access your iCloud files on the go and use most of the same apps you can use on an iPhone Theyre better for consuming media and getting work done than iPhones due to their larger displays and theyre more portable than MacBooks An iPad may replace your need for a laptop in specific situations You should consider an iPad if you: Not everyone needs an iPad You might not if you: There are a lot of situations where an iPad can come in handy and some people can even replace their desktop computer or laptop with an iPad Here are some reasons you might consider getting an iPad The iPad is a high-quality tablet that can be useful regardless of what other hardware you own It comes alive if you‚Äôre already in the Apple Ecosystem If you use an iPhone wear an Apple Watch and do most of your work on an iMac or MacBook you‚Äôll find that an iPad is a natural extension of that family of devices AirDrop lets you seamlessly transfer files iCloud gives you access to photos settings and other data and you can even use an iPad as a second monitor with your Mac If you‚Äôre an artist or enjoy doodling in your free time the Apple Pencil is a game-changer It turns the iPad into a drawing tablet and the latest version even wirelessly charges when magnetically connected to the iPad It‚Äôs also tremendously helpful if you take a lot of handwritten notes for your job or any other purpose as it makes it easy to jot down notes and organize them for quick access later Whether you love binge-watching Netflix spend all day listening to music or podcasts or are an avid reader an iPad represents an upgrade over using a phone or laptop The big screen is better for video content and e-books and the built-in speakers provide better sound for instances where you find yourself without your earbuds An iPad is also easier to carry and hold for long periods than a laptop An iPad is a perfect solution whether you‚Äôre FaceTiming friends and family or stuck in Zoom meetings all day for work Instead of tying up your computer or laptop or relying on the tiny screen of your phone making video calls on your iPad allows you to free up your other devices and increase your productivity The latest iPads also have unique features like Center Stage designed to improve video calls Despite their big screens and powerful hardware iPads have excellent battery life If you often find yourself on the go all day without time to stop and charge your phone an iPad could be a game-changer Instead of your phone battery hanging by a thread at days end shifting tasks to the iPad will likely see both batteries in the green even after the longest most active days There are many reasons to get an iPad but not everyone needs one They are expensive and some people won‚Äôt get enough out of an iPad to justify the purchase Here are some of the reasons you might not want an iPad The base iPad model might be more affordable than you expect but its still pretty expensive compared to other tablets If youre working on a tight budget and already have a phone and laptop it might be a stretch to justify an iPads premium price tag You can find Android tablets that cost significantly less if you dont need a high-performance device Or consider sticking with the gear you already have One of the biggest problems with the iPad family of devices is Apple charges a premium for storage There is always a base model with little internal storage and significantly more expensive options with more storage Most Android tablets let you insert an inexpensive microSD card if you need more space but Apple doesn‚Äôt give you that option If that‚Äôs a deal-breaker then you shouldn‚Äôt get an iPad Apple releases a new iPad every 12 to 18 months and the releases of new iPads iPad Airs and iPad Pros are staggered That means a new iPad is almost always around the corner and the iPad you buy today might be overshadowed by a new model tomorrow If you don‚Äôt need an iPad see when the next model and the most likely new features are coming If the next model includes any killer new features you need you may want to wait before you buy An iPad can help you increase your productivity if youre an artist or find yourself in many video calls spend a lot of time out of the office or take lots of notes While you can do many things with a phone and laptop that you can do with an iPad there are a lot of situations where an iPad is a more efficient option is easier to carry around and provides a superior experience An iPad is also handy during downtime as the big screen is great for streaming media and reading e-books especially if you currently do those things on a cramped phone screen While an iPad can accomplish many of the same tasks as a laptop that doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre interchangeable There are probably some tasks you‚Äôll still need your laptop for but there are also a lot of situations where you‚Äôll be able to leave your laptop at home and only carry the much lighter iPad The transition is seamless if you use an iPhone iPad or MacBook You can also use an iPad as a second screen for your MacBook for video calls while still using your MacBook for other tasks and for creating art and jotting notes if you add an Apple Pencil You can use an iPad exclusively depending on where you go to school and the apps you‚Äôre required to use That could save you money since iPads are cheaper than MacBooks lighter and easier to carry between classes However your school might require apps that won‚Äôt run on an iPad or your workload requires an actual laptop In those cases you‚Äôll need to decide if the convenience of the iPad is worth the extra cost especially if you‚Äôll typically need to carry a laptop to class in addition to the iPad Apple offers several iPad models to hit a wide variety of price points and the difference in price between the entry-level iPad and a top-of-the-line iPad Pro is huge If you plan on reasonably light usage like streaming media sending emails and taking notes you can safely avoid an iPad Pro and get a regular iPad The current iPad Air model will typically have hardware similar to the previous iPad Pro at a significantly lower price point if you want to save money without taking too much of a hit in performance If you need extra power or enjoy all the latest bells and whistles and can afford the higher price tag the latest iPad Pro will significantly outperform the competition The first- and second-generation Apple Pencils use different means to sync with an iPad but theyre both easy For the original plug the Pencil into the Lightning port at the bottom of your tablet (the same one you use to charge the iPad) For the second-gen attach the Pencil to the magnetic connector on the side of the iPad Its on the same side as the volume buttons After doing either of these steps the iPad will automatically detect and pair with the Apple Pencil Like the iPhone the iPad supports AirPrint which lets you send documents and photos to a compatible printer As long as both the printer and your iPad are on the same wireless network you can transmit something and print it through the Share menu Get the Latest Tech News Delivered Every Day Hit Refresh on Your Tech News"

With the broader equity market surging to record highs on the back of a risk-on sentiment that keeps getting stronger there are only a handful of stocks out there that are plummeting right now One such stock is Dropbox Inc NASDAQ: DBX whose shares were as recently as two weeks ago trading at a multi-year high but have since fallen some 30% It will be a bitter pill to swallow for Dropbox investors who‚Äôll be forgiven for wondering why it‚Äôs their stock out of the hundreds of tech companies out there that‚Äôs bucking the wider trend It all started going wrong for the cloud storage giant around St Valentine‚Äôs Day when they released their Q4 earnings In a sign of just how fickle investors can be the stock sank despite Dropbox landing a solid beat on expectations for both the headline revenue and bottom-line earnings Further bright spots in the report included the company‚Äôs expansion into artificial intelligence (AI) opportunities and the solid increase in average revenue per paying user year on year Operating margins were also much improved but the slowing growth especially with Dropbox‚Äôs revenue seems to outweigh all of these bullish signs For the fourth straight quarter Dropbox‚Äôs ARR was down a pattern that would give even the most bullish investor something to worry about Dropbox‚Äôs shares gapped down at the open and haven‚Äôt really paused for breath since Yesterday‚Äôs 25% drop put the stock back at 2018 levels On the same day NVIDIA Corp‚Äôs NASDAQ: NVDA earnings sent the rest of the market soaring So what‚Äôs the angle here?

And where should we invest now? This is why today we‚Äôre going to look at the best options for those looking to invest in Warren Buffett stocks And these three are at the top of the list Buffett began investing in Apple stock back in 2016 Over time has bought the tech stock again and again Since then the company has become the largest holding in Berkshire Hathaway stock making up over 40%! So why did Buffett sell off about 10 million shares for almost US$2 billion? In short to make up for other losses in other companies It was a good time to get some returns from Apple stock and take advantage of the losses Buffett still loves the stock stating ‚ÄúApple is probably the best business I know in the world‚Äù Buffett continues to love Apple stock for its strong brand loyal customer base consistent profitability strong ecosystem and share buybacks The company has now cemented a long-term position at the top of the leaderboard in tech stocks And that could only expand as it finds new areas to invest in Apple stock seems to know how to convince its loyal base that they need its products every day And that looks likely to continue in the near and distant future Beyond Apple stock Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) is another stock that Warren Buffett loves While nowhere near Apple Buffett holds about 8% of the shares making it the largest shareholder And why does he like it so much? It‚Äôs proven time and again that it can weather any bad storm Take the financial crisis of 2008 Bank of America stock emerged as one of the best banking franchises in the United States Moreover it still holds the potential for long-term growth in the banking industry ‚Äî especially when improved market conditions return That‚Äôs why lately Buffett has been increasing his positions in banks like Bank of America stock They provide value for future growth and that‚Äôs what Buffett likes to see Plus as the largest shareholder he gets to influence some decisions! As he‚Äôs said in the past ‚ÄúWe believe Bank of America is very well-positioned for the future‚Äù Finally there are very few consumer products out there that weather any economic downturn with ease That includes The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) which Buffett has held since 1988 It now takes up 6% of the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio and it doesn‚Äôt look like it will decrease any time soon Buffett loves the stock for its iconic brand and global reach No matter where you are you can grab a Coke And no matter what you‚Äôre making it‚Äôs something you‚Äôll likely always be able to purchase It continues to have a huge competitive advantage with a recession-resistant product Add in the fact that the company is a Dividend King with over 50 years of dividend increases and it‚Äôs hard to argue this as a Buffett favourite KO stock will continue to provide strong passive income thanks to its strong business model This is likely why he‚Äôs said in the past ‚ÄúIf you are looking for a long-term investment this is one of the best because the world drinks a lot of soda‚Äù This article represents the opinion of the writer who may disagree with the ‚Äúofficial‚Äù recommendation position of a Motley Fool premium service or advisor We‚Äôre Motley!

1033,"Apple: Autonomous Driving Laggard (NASDAQ:AAPL)","2/6/2024","https://seekingalpha.com/article/4667785-apple-autonomous-driving-laggard","ozgurdonmaz ozgurdonmaz A recent report has indicated yet another setback in the Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) Car project The project is further delayed and has seen a reduction in technological capabilities Overall what was once an aspiring new potentially large market opportunity sparking investments across the tech and automotive industry including notable companies such as Google (GOOG GOOGL) Nvidia (NVDA) Intel (INTC) and Apple in reality has proved to be a much more challenging endeavor than expected My initial coverage was quite bullish on the project as it could drive competition as legacy OEMs would have to avoid becoming like Nokia (NOK) similar to how the iPhone had transformed the phone According to the latest news Project Titan as it has been called since 2014 has been scaled back from L4 (basically fully autonomous) to L2+ which is a term that Mobileye Global (MBLY) has coined for its advanced SuperVision system capable of hands-off but eyes-on autonomous driving similar to Tesla (TSLA) FSD The launch date has purportedly been delayed as well from 2025 to 2028 Overall this is a massive setback If Apple launches an L2+ vehicle in 2028 then it would be just another one of many vehicles (in an already highly saturated market) with such a capability It would be just a car with an Apple logo For comparison based on current design wins Mobileye already expects a surge in L2+ vehicles by 2026 with around 10 models by 2025 and another 20 in 2026 (although 17 of those are from one western OEM) Moreover for Mobileye its L2+ SuperVision system is just a stepping stone towards its actual L4 fully autonomous Chauffeur system The number of models included in all our design wins are now projected at 30 models as compared to nine models at the beginning of 2023 Our portfolio strategy where SuperVision serves as a bridge to Chauffeur is being proven out as Polestar FAW and a multi-brand major western OEM all awarded production programs on the Chauffeur platform during 2023 So with the initial marquee design wins from the likes of Porsche and the ‚Äúwestern OEM‚Äù Mobileye is finding that the due diligence period is shortening as instead competition among OEMs is intensifying for including advanced driving capabilities in their models: Mobileye said potential SuperVision customers are using the due diligence already done by these existing customers as proof for the systems capability leading to shorter sales cycles To that end OEMs are finding out that developing their own systems from scratch is infeasible (ending up with a worse system at a higher price and later time to market) and hence instead they are turning to the industry leader Mobileye even if they have or had their own in-house projects As such it isn‚Äôt just Apple that has seen setbacks in its developments Others include Tesla General Motors (GM) Cruise and Ford (F) It turns out that developing an autonomous driving system isn‚Äôt the same as developing any other consumer or even enterprise-grade software where bugs are patched as they are found One such example is the difficulty of mapping Maps are pretty much required to develop a reliable AV However regular GPS maps are not suitable lacking precision This has required existing robotaxi players such as Waymo to manually craft maps a process which is unscalable In contrast Mobileye has developed its own crowdsourced REM mapping system that it first launched as part of its ‚Äúcloud-enhanced‚Äù ADAS systems (and even some models before that to start collecting data) It is already in millions of vehicles collecting billions of kilometers of road data In its fiscal Q1 Apple reported less than 2% revenue growth Except for its services segment all its other major reported businesses (iPhone Mac iPad and other hardware such as wearables) are quite mature with little long-term potential for future growth unless perhaps by raising prices Although the earnings were up low double digits this was mainly driven by lower cost of goods sold So while the Apple Car rumor has mixed reception among investors major product launches are nevertheless one of the few ways for Apple to drive growth However given the size of its business even a product such as the $3500 Vision Pro is unlikely to contribute more than single digits to its overall revenue which amounted to about $120B in fiscal Q1 Hence Apples premium valuation of nearly 30x P/E clearly isnt based on its growth performance Nevertheless for investors to see compelling returns from the current stock price or even just to continue justifying the current valuation exactly such growth is lacking that an Apple Car might deliver Looking at Tesla Apple Inc has arguably missed an opportunity to add another trillion dollars to its market cap by missing the rise of the electric vehicle or EV In addition Apple may hence have missed the opportunity to add another trillion or so to its market cap as it is now also missing the rise of the autonomous vehicle or AV Taken together these developments are turning the car into the next computing platform In its currently rumored form the Apple Car would have a non-differentiated feature set being an L2+ system which is technological level of which there are already vehicles on the road and many more are expected in the next three years most notably based on Mobileye‚Äôs SuperVision system On the surface it might have seen that developing an AV would play to Apple‚Äôs strengths: sensors highly capable chips and advanced software and AI However in reality developing an AV has turned out to be more like designing a mission-critical system like airplanes‚Äô autopilot while having the requirement of nevertheless scaling this globally to millions of consumers potentially Mobileye in that regard remains pretty much the only company to have solved the for newcomers almost insurmountable challenge of creating global HD maps Nevertheless taking a long-term outlook despite a lot of frenzy over the last decade today L2+ in consumers vehicles and L4 in robotaxis (never mind in consumer vehicles) remain at the very initial stages of small-scale adoption This could mean that even in 2028 Apple could make quite some headlines with an Apple

1035,"What Tim Cook and Apple knew that Elon Musk didn‚Äôt about executive compensation: It can be smart to take less money","2/8/2024","https://fortune.com/2024/02/08/tim-cook-elon-musk-apple-tesla-ceo-compensation/","Just a week after Elon Musk‚Äôs $55 billion Tesla payday was struck down by a Delaware judge a New York court dismissed a challenge to Apple CEO Tim Cook‚Äôs compensation package which clocked in at under $100 million Some coincidence At face value the two cases seem to have a lot in common Both were shareholder suits waged against some of the highest-paid superstar tech CEOs in the world And both were filed amid a backdrop of increased public scrutiny over executive compensation in recent years which is near all-time highs across S&P 500 companies But for all their similarities from a legal standpoint the two cases are apples and oranges‚Äîand Cook was always going to stand a better chance of holding on to his paycheck Elon Musk‚Äôs $55 billion compensation package at Tesla made headlines last month after Delaware chancellor Kathaleen McCormick ruled in favor of a shareholder who argued that Tesla was paying its CEO an unfairly high amount with the moonshot grant Plaintiff Richard Tornetta argued that because Musk wields so much power at Tesla and maintains close relationships with his board members the supposedly independent board of directors‚Äô vote approving his massive pay scheme was anything but ‚ÄúChancellor McCormick found that the process for setting Elon Musk‚Äôs pay was essentially controlled by Elon Musk‚Äù said Tulane University law professor Ann M Lipton in an interview with Fortune ‚ÄúThe board didn‚Äôt engage in any kind of pushback or real bargaining‚Äù In response Musk has threatened to relocate Tesla from Delaware (where almost 70% of Fortune 500 companies are incorporated) to Texas where a more favorable political climate could leave him less exposed to these types of challenges While the Musk case was focused on a broad more abstract legal question related to the Tesla board of directors‚Äô degree of independence the Cook case resolved yesterday was much simpler ‚ÄúThe question before Delaware [in the Musk case] was simply ‚ÄòWas the pay substantively unfair?‚Äô whereas the question in the Tim Cook case was solely ‚ÄòWas the proxy statement misleading?‚Äô‚Äù said Lipton The Teamsters‚Äô pension fund sued Apple last year arguing that the company had misled investors by misrepresenting Cook‚Äôs 2021 and 2022 pay in its proxy statements and paying him more than it had initially proposed Because Cook and other Apple executives are primarily paid in equity known as RSUs the company enlists financial models to estimate what Cook‚Äôs actual pay will be for shareholders‚Äô approval each year (For CEOs being compensated primarily with stock isn‚Äôt uncommon Mark Zuckerberg famously earns just $1 in annual salary but he‚Äôs made billions through Meta stock grants included in his compensation package The Economic Policy Institute found in a report last year that stock-related pay accounts for over 80% of CEO compensation) The pension fund that sued Cook argued that Apple misrepresented its CEO‚Äôs actual compensation package by downplaying the value of his equity Cook and other Apple executives netted over $90 million in compensation for 2021 and 2022 higher than the $775 million estimate the company initially asked shareholders to vote on for approval (Both of those figures are well below Cook‚Äôs current annual compensation; at his own request the Apple CEO took a 40% pay cut last year That change was approved by shareholders and the Apple board‚Äôs compensation committee which counts former Vice President Al Gore as one of its members) The plaintiffs claimed that Apple used an unusual financial model to artificially deflate Cook‚Äôs pay estimate and also buried the compensation tables in a drab gray section of the proxy statement where shareholders would be less likely to notice it before casting their Say-on-Pay votes The court didn‚Äôt buy it ‚ÄúWhat happened with Tim Cook is very common in public companies‚Äù said Marc Hodak partner at executive compensation consultancy Farient Advisors ‚ÄúThey award performance shares based on the face value of the stock And each of those performance share units has a market value that‚Äôs higher than the face value stock at the time of grant‚Äù One key difference between the two cases was the size of the contested pay package Musk‚Äôs $55 billion award from Tesla was part of the largest compensation plan in corporate history While Cook‚Äôs $100 million annual pay is by no means a small sum it‚Äôs on par with his peers In fact Apple uses a group of its competitors including Meta Netflix Visa and Cisco to benchmark its executives‚Äô compensation (Notably it added Tesla to that peer group last year) ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have any question that the size and scale of [Musk‚Äôs] pay package was a driver both in terms of the litigation and the decision that we saw‚Äù said Hodak ‚Äú[$55 billion] is automatically going to attract an unusual amount of scrutiny‚Äù Taken together these two cases do seem to hint at a broader trend toward greater scrutiny of bloated CEO pay‚Äîbut Lipton advised against reading the tea leaves prematurely ‚ÄúElon Musk is beating this drum that everyone should leave Delaware to suggest that somehow this is a trend‚Äù said Lipton ‚ÄúI think this is an Elon Musk problem That Tim Cook thing it was a different law It was a different argument‚Äù Representatives from Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment ¬© 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited All Rights Reserved Use of this site constitutes acceptance of our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy CA Notice at Collection and Privacy Notice Do Not Sell/Share My Personal Information Ad Choices FORTUNE is a trademark of Fortune Media IP Limited registered in the US and other countries FORTUNE may receive compensation for some links to products and services on this website Offers may be subject to change without notice S&P Index data is the property of Chicago Mercantile Exchange Inc and its licensors All rights reserved Terms & Conditions Powered and implemented by Interactive Data Managed Solutions"

When Apple announced its last 4-for-1 split on July 30 2020 its stock was trading at $385 When it announced its previous 7-for-1 split on April 23 2014 it was trading at $525 Based on those two decisions it doesnt seem likely that Apple will choose to split its stock at its current level of around $200 a share It has also been just three and a half years since its last split and the shortest period between its stock splits has been nearly five years (2000 to 2005) so far Therefore it will probably be at least a few more years before Apples board approves another stock split Apple is already worth almost $29 trillion which makes it one of the two most valuable companies in the world alongside Microsoft (Microsoft briefly moved ahead of Apple to take the No 1 spot on Thursday) It could be difficult for Apple to grow its market cap meaningfully from there as its revenue growth and earnings growth cool off Analysts expect Apples revenue and earnings to only rise 4% and 8% respectively in its fiscal 2024 (which will end in September) as iPhone sales slow down Its iPhone sales fell 2% in fiscal 2023 -- due to the end of the 5G upgrade cycle and macroeconomic challenges in China -- but the flagship smartphone still accounted for over half of the companys total revenue Declining sales of Macs in the post-pandemic market and currency headwinds exacerbated that slowdown Apple is trying to offset that pressure by expanding its services ecosystem which now features more than a billion paid subscriptions but it remains overwhelmingly dependent on the iPhone A patent dispute also recently disrupted the sales of Apple Watches in the US and the $3500 price tag of the new Vision Pro headset will limit its mainstream appeal when it launches in early February Considering all the challenges Apple faces its stock doesnt look like a bargain at 28 times forward earnings And its paltry dividend yield of 05% wont attract any serious income investors at a time when CDs and Treasuries offer risk-free yields of more than 5% Instead of wondering when Apple might split its stock again investors should focus on the companys cash flows and buybacks as it navigates the near-term headwinds It generated $996 billion in free cash flow (FCF) over the past 12 months and it spent $776 billion of that total on buybacks and $15 billion on dividends It bought back 38% of its outstanding shares over the past 10 years and it has raised its dividend every year since it reinstated the payout in 2012 Those moves indicate Apple is a shareholder-friendly company that would rather return its excess cash to its investors instead of di-worsifying itself with reckless investments or acquisitions That might be why Warren Buffetts Berkshire Hathaway has allocated nearly half of its stock portfolio to Apple But with $162 billion in cash and marketable securities on its books at the end of its latest quarter Apple still has plenty of room to make big acquisitions to expand its ecosystem That cash cushion also makes it a good safe haven stock to own during economic downturns Apples upside might be limited this year but its core strengths should limit its downside potential until its next growth cycle starts Therefore it might still be a good time to accumulate this stock as the bears bemoan its lack of near-term catalysts Should you invest $1000 in Apple right now?

1048,"TSMC: Major Apple Risk Persists But Stock Still Investible (NYSE:TSM)","1/1/2024","https://seekingalpha.com/article/4660614-tsmc-major-apple-risk-exposed","Annabelle Chih/Getty Images News Annabelle Chih/Getty Images News TSMC (NYSE:TSM) is and will likely remain for years to come a prudent choice to invest in the semiconductor industry which has been and is expected to remain a growing market over time As a (pure play) foundry TSMC derives its revenue from hundreds of customers including a dozen or so major ones However one key risk for what would otherwise be a relatively low-risk company with a very digestible valuation (outside of perhaps some geopolitical concerns) that is becoming increasingly apparent is the rise in competition at the leading edge which is both the largest and fastest-growing part of the market This could ultimately result in market share and pricing power loss or even the (almost) complete loss of customers in the case TSMC would be unable to provide them with the technology that allows them to be successful in their own markets (ie loss of process leadership) My prior coverage on the stock from over half a year remains relevant (as the thesis as described there continues to play out): TSMC: Losing Leadership Apple (AAPL) as its largest customer has been a major contributor to TSMCs success over time Both in terms of revenue (perhaps on the order of 20-25% of total revenue) but also as primary adopter of basically all of TSMCs latest nodes for the last decade which the companies do partner closely According to this source Apple accounted for $175B of TSMCs 2022 revenue However recently Apple Silicon lead Johny Srouji and John Ternus Senior VP of hardware engineering said some quite concerning things in an interview (emphasis mine) We do rely on TSMC for a good part of our internal chips‚Ä¶Its actually very complicated Those transistor technologies are very advanced and complicated but I distill it down to a few principles: We always want to deliver and build the best chips on the planet for the best products So thats the North Star And that means we need to have access to the best tools including the best transistor technology So thats extremely important - Srouji Srouji said Apple needs the best process technology The issue here for TSMC is that it is on a quick pace to lose the leadership it inherited due to Intels (INTC) stumbles around 10/7nm back to Intel (around 2nm) Coincidentally Intel also started a foundry business Some have already speculated the prepayment Intel received to accelerate the build-out of its 18A Arizona fab even was from Apple Although I wouldnt go that far yet altogether these developments do mean that the Apple foundry business is right open for grabbing for anyone who can deliver to Apple what it deems is its North Star Indeed further in the interview he confirmed that Apple is not religious about partnering with TSMC 8/11 Srouji said that while diversification of the supply chain is important his first principal is key: where can you get the best technology and where can you get the scale if some foundry has that and they meet our requirements we are always exploring - including outside of Taiwan Note that while Intel is new to the foundry business there certainly shouldnt be any concerns about scale As a (primarily) CPU company most of Intels manufacturing capacity has always been on the leading edge and given its ambitions in foundry (and growth in general) Intel has been planning and building many new fabs including in Arizona ($30B) Ohio ($20B initially) Germany ($30B initially) and Israel ($25B) As a further recent indication of how TSMC seems to be struggling to keep up in the upcoming gate-all-around transistor era this recent TSMC roadmap shows how the A10 node is planned for 2030 On the surface this seems to keep up with Moores Law which is slowing down from a 2-year towards a 3-year cadence and indeed this roadmap has gaps of either 2 or 3 years between nodes TSMC TSMC However the target for a monolithic chip with over 200B transistors just seems low/unambitious since even on N5 (2020) there are already monolithic chips with nearly 100B transistors Even when noting that the introduction of high-NA lithography will reduce the (maximum) size of a monolithic chip by half it remains to be seen if TSMC can re-accelerate its rate of shrinking from the slow rate at N3/N2 (similar to Intel at its 10/7nm nodes) For example if 100B is the goal for N2 (despite this already being possible with N3 although TSMC has disclosed that N2 would be a very minor shrink) then A10 with 200B transistors on half the area would require a 4x shrink in two nodes which is aligned with Moores Law Like many (including Intel) TSMC had been expecting a recovery in H2 However Q3 revenue was down 15% to $173B EPS was $129 marking a 25% decline More in general beyond the Apple risk the importance of leading-edge nodes is shown in that 7nm and below nodes accounted for 59% of revenue While TSMC already has a competitor in that segment with Samsung the added competition from Intel Foundry Services only adds further pressure especially given TSMCs expanded margins in recent years This has indeed been acknowledged by Pat Gelsinger who said TSMCs margins are so high that there is ample room to undercut TSMC on pricing and still end up with a lucrative business Note that this contrasts with some popular comments one might have read (The (leading edge) foundry industry is definitely large enough to support a few players but also so advanced that no more players could compete thereby securing the overall profitability for all competitors) So in a few years TSMC is on a path to both lose its (foundry) process leadership as well as potentially becoming a more expensive foundry in general At that point there do not seem many (if any) reasons for TSMC to maintain such a market share resulting in the loss of pricing power as well as market share Nevertheless contrary to the comment just referred to there should not be any reason to expect a race-to-the-bottom price war since both companies are very much focused on achieving high margins Looking forward even the top end of Q4 guidance would still see revenue decline by about $1B marking the fourth consecutive quarter of decline Note that this means the surge in GAI has not benefited TSMC very much since most of the gross margin dollars have gone to Nvidia (NVDA) with the BOM (bill of materials) for the H100 silicon (a few hundred dollars at most assuming on the order of 75 chips per wafer and a $15k per wafer) being pretty much a rounding error compared to the actual sales price (well into the 5 digits) Despite the forward-looking uncertainty in TSMCs business as described the company on the surface is actually very investible which remains in line with my prior analysis This is shown by the forward P/E of just 20x despite trading at the high end of its one-year range One could only guess why the stock doesnt have a higher valuation Perhaps it is the Asia/China effect that has also affected stocks such as Alibaba (BABA) Perhaps it is the Taiwan effect in particular the China invasion risk Perhaps it is just the actual financial performance with investors awaiting a new upcycle The risk of literally losing a quarter of its business while as described seems very real in reality likely isnt considered yet by investors Even if it were to happen similar to the transition from Intel to Apple silicon this would be a multiyear process even after it started with the start itself in the first place likely still years away By that time the rest of the market might have grown so much that TSMCs financials could remain quite stable compared to the current level Overall while at least in principle the risk of TSMC losing its biggest customer is a real one how to factor this into the valuation is quite tricky since the actual probability is unknown Disregarding any black swan events TSMC is an investible stock At this point perhaps even more so than its new competitor Intel as the formers valuation hasnt increased much at all yet As trends such as GAI show the semiconductor industry remains a long-term growing market so investing in a leading foundry such as TSMC which is the definite leader in terms of market share with hundreds of (major and minor) customers would be a prudent choice for investors Of course as described one possible black swan event would be the rise of new competitor Intel In fact there already seems to be some initial notable activity shown by the prepayment Intel got from an undisclosed 18A customer to accelerate the build-out of the new Arizona fabs The possibilities here range from customers looking for an alternative supplier for at least some of their chips to even completely losing the business for their flagship highest volume chips as they flock toward the best technology in the market At the end of the day at the leading edge the only that matters for TSMCs customers is how their chips stack up against their competitors Using a foundry/process that is further along the Moores Law curve to that end has been a proven strategy for decades to outcompete competitors So ultimately as quoted while Apple has not made any formal announcements it did say that it is not religious about which foundry it uses The company is only religious to the goal of creating the best possible chips Since TSMC losing its process leadership is getting ever more guaranteed (with Intel already delivering the 09 PDK of 18A to customers) this is one key risk investors will have to face as at least a possibility Beyond just Apple these competitive dynamics in general could result in loss of market share and/or pricing power putting downward pressure on revenue and earnings which could balance out any general market growth of which TSMC has been a prime

like it‚Äôs been a heck of a lot longer for Apple (AAPL) watchers The tech giant has been making headlines left and right as it juggles a handful of downgrades to its stock price faces required major changes to its App Store policies and gears up for a potential antitrust lawsuit that could target large swaths of its business All of this comes as Apple prepares to launch its $3499 Vision Pro headset Apple‚Äôs most ambitious product in years the Vision Pro catapults the company into a product category that even established players like Meta (META) have struggled to turn into a hit It‚Äôs a lot to say the least But it‚Äôs not all doom and gloom for Apple Generative AI-equipped iPhones and a reacceleration of the company‚Äôs services business should help goose growth in the years ahead And if the Vision Pro takes off it would provide an entirely new revenue stream across both Apple‚Äôs hardware and services segments ‚ÄúI dont think Apples in any way under any existential threat right now that didnt exist before‚Äù Deepwater Asset Management managing partner Gene Munster told Yahoo Finance ‚ÄúIts just that theyre participating in markets that [have] slower growth and theyre

biggest market generated $1626 billion while Europe generated $943 billion All this makes reports of a slowdown in iPhone sales in China perhaps Apple‚Äôs biggest and most pressing story A sluggish economic recovery coupled with a resurgent Huawei which despite US sanctions has managed to put out smartphones with modern processors and features are expected to hurt Apple‚Äôs market share in the country According to Counterpoint Research the iPhone maker controlled 15% of the Chinese market in Q3 2023 That was slightly better than Huawei‚Äôs 14% but behind Vivo‚Äôs 16% and Oppo‚Äôs 19% Analysts at Barclays Piper Sandler and Redburn Atlantic each pointed to the region as a potential problem for Apple with Barclays‚Äôs Tim Long saying that the firm saw ‚Äúincrementally worse‚Äù iPhone 15 data out of China He also added that he doesn‚Äôt predict any ‚Äúfeatures or upgrades that are likely to make the iPhone 16 more compelling‚Äù Redburn Atlantic‚Äôs James Cordwell also called out China in a Jan 10 note saying that he remains concerned about Apple‚Äôs competitive position in the country Piper Sandler‚Äôs Harsh Kumar and Robert Aguanno said that the deteriorating macro environment in China could weigh on Apple‚Äôs handset business ‚ÄúWe highlight in our outlook that China is a key swing factor for sales next year‚Äù Aguanno told Yahoo Finance ‚ÄúAny recovery in expectations for iPhone growth will be fueled by either the reemergence of the Chinese consumer along with outsized growth in other emerging markets such as India‚Äù Apple is also contending with reports that the Department of Justice is preparing to file an antitrust lawsuit against the company According to the New York Times the department could file the lawsuit which would focus on Apple‚Äôs strategic hardware and software moats as soon as March Critics have long called on antitrust enforcers to take action against Apple for establishing policies that prevent users from accessing apps from third-party app stores or keep device and app makers from using certain hardware features of Apple‚Äôs iPhone such as its mobile payment technology The European Union is also attempting to force Apple to loosen restrictions on its App Store including allowing third-party app stores on the iPhone The company has also set up new App Store rules in the US that allow developers to advertise third-party links for making app purchases outside of the App Store Apple will still charge a commission on those sales but will lower the amount from 15% or 30% to 12% or 27% That drew a sharp rebuke from longtime rivals like Spotify who say Apple‚Äôs changes don‚Äôt go far enough Apple‚Äôs new Vision Pro AR/VR headset is also a major part of its 2024 equation The device which is available for preorder and hits the market Feb 2 is a huge gamble for Apple as it looks to enter a completely new market With a starting price of $3499 the Vision Pro won‚Äôt reach the kind of sales volumes as the iPhone And while early reports say preorders have sold out there‚Äôs no guarantee that interest in the spatial computer will remain high ‚ÄúInitial sales data upon the device

Despite being a rarified industry of only a handful of major players not all semiconductor firms are built the same Getting to grips with the semiconductor industry and the key players at each step of the production cycle can be a head spinner One saving grace is how the semiconductor industry is effectively a layer cake of oligopolies; it‚Äôs the bedrock of modern technology but the sector is dominated by only a handful of big players Let‚Äôs start at the end of the production line with the foundries A semiconductor foundry is a facility that manufactures semiconductor chips for other companies based on their designs These foundries specialise in the complex and capital-intensive process of semiconductor fabrication allowing companies without their own manufacturing capabilities to access advanced chip-making technologies Clients provide the foundry with the necessary designs and the foundry produces the chips according to these specifications Building a single foundry can cost as much as $20 billion Little wonder then why only a few massive companies have notable fabrication capabilities These include: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC): The titular island‚Äôs largest company TSMC is the world‚Äôs largest most cutting-edge semiconductor manufacturing firm comprising dozens of plants across Taiwan Japan and the US TSMC is heavily subsidised by the Taiwanese government and is regarded as the purest of semiconductor plays on the global stock market Its customers are the who‚Äôs who of global tech including Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL ETR:APC) Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) Broadcom Sony and AMD It has a market capitalisation of 15 trillion New Taiwan dollars ($483 billion) and a price-to-earnings ratio of 1474 TSMC commands 59% of the global foundry market Samsung Corporation: Alongside its smartphone division South Korean tech company Samsung is the second-largest semiconductor manufacturer globally Though Samsung Foundry shares a similar client portfolio to TSMC it is used for producing lower-spec chips out of its South Korean and US-based foundries Samsung Corporation comprising all divisions has a market cap of 510 trillion Korean won ($390 billion) and a P/E ratio of 1318 Samsung Foundry commands 13% of the global semiconductor market Other major foundries: Previously a part of Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD ETR:AMD) US firm GlobalFoundries has 6% of the foundry industry roughly equivalent to Chinese partially state-owned pure play Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC) If foundries are the industrial workhorses fabless chipmakers are are brains A fabless semiconductor designer refers to a company or entity that designs and develops semiconductor chips and circuits but does not have its own semiconductor fabrication plants Instead they outsource the manufacturing of their designs to TSMC et al This model allows the designer to focus on the research development and design aspects of semiconductor technology without the substantial investment and resources required for manufacturing As you‚Äôll see they command higher valuations and tend to be more ‚Äòhousehold‚Äô names Nvidia: The titan of fabless chipmaking Nvidia shot to the forefront of the global tech sector following a groundbreaking year as the spearhead of artificial intelligence-focused chipmaking technology Its chips were used to train OpenAI‚Äôs landmark ChatGPT large-language model Thus Nvidia alongside Microsoft has emerged as a top stock stock for betting on the AI sector Nvidia designs AI-based chips for Google Microsoft Amazon Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Meta to name a few Apple notably ditched Nvidia for AMD in the 2010 and the two tech titans have a fractured relationship Nvidia became the latest one-trillion-dollar company in 2023 and its valuation reflects that Nvidia has a market cap of $119 trillion and a PE ratio of 63 Advanced Micro Devices (AMD): AMD has long played second fiddle to Nvidia in the fabless chipmaking space though as stated above the Silicon Valley grandee nabbed major client Apple from Nvidia in the 2010s However it‚Äôs AMD‚Äôs partnership with Sony Corporation to supply graphics processors for the PlayStation 5 that put AMD in a new light AMD chips are also used to power the latest Xbox consoles Though Nvidia‚Äôs chip designs have taken centre stage in the AI space there‚Äôs no doubt that AMD holds its weight in the gaming side of the industry AMD‚Äôs market cap is $224 billion but it is ridiculously overvalued with a PE ratio of 765 Arm Holdings: The crown jewel of the British tech sector (despite snubbing London for a Nasdaq listing in 2023) Cambridge-based Softbank-owned Arm‚Äôs semiconductor designs are found in over 99% of smartphones globally Arm is a slightly different beast from Nvidia and AMD in that the group licenses out its designs to other chipmakers who then pay Arm royalties for using its designs Whereas Nvidia‚Äôs and AMD‚Äôs chips are used primarily for graphics-intensive parallel processing needs Arm‚Äôs CPU designs are lower-end and more versatile making them ideal for both low-end and high-end smartphones Since Arm‚Äôs clients are in effect every single smartphone maker in the world every time a smartphone is sold Arm gets a small cut of the profits Arm has a market cap of $706 billion with an approximate PE ratio of 65 IDMs design and manufacture chips in-house They are rarer and typically for specialised Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC): Intel is one of the few US companies with fabrication capabilities but its expertise is significantly behind TSMC or Samsung However Intel stands to gain from the US government‚Äôs $53 billion CHIPS and Science Act According to recent reports Intel is a frontrunner in a bid to secure a multibillion-dollar funding package from the US government to construct foundries to produce cutting-edge microchips for military and intelligence applications IInside of an Intel foundry ‚Äì Credit: Intel Intel has also received a $32 billion grant from the government of Israel to help fund a $25 billion chip factory in the country according to an announcement Tuesday Intel has a market cap of $2015 billion but was a lossmaker in 2023 due to extensive operating and R&D expenses Texas Instruments: Dallas-based Tex Instruments is an outlier in the semiconductor space in that it designs and manufactures analogue chipsets that go into personal electronics communications equipment and enterprise systems Sitting at the base of the semiconductor supply chain are the providers of equipment and materials that make the sector work This scene includes Dutch lithography monopolist ASML ($288 billion market cap 34 PE ratio) Lithography systems are crucial for the semiconductor manufacturing process as they use a technique called photolithography to imprint intricate circuit patterns onto silicon wafers ASML lithography machine ‚Äì Credit: ASML ASMLs machines are known for their advanced technology including extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography which allows for the creation of circuits with extremely small features essential for producing smaller more powerful and energy-efficient semiconductor chips Cadence Design Systems ($75 billion market cap 75 PE ratio) provides software hardware and IP to facilitate the design and verification of semiconductors enabling engineers to create complex chips and electronic systems more efficiently and with higher performance Entegris Inc ($17 billion market cap 86 PE ratio) provides critical materials handling solutions and advanced materials that are essential for manufacturing semiconductors Entegris provides the sector with filtration solutions speciality chemicals fluid management systems and advanced materials handling containers Applied Materials ($128 billion market cap 19 PE ratio) develops equipment services and software that are essential for the manufacturing of semiconductor chips Its products are used in various stages of the semiconductor fabrication process including deposition (adding layers of material onto a silicon wafer) etching (removing materials to create circuit patterns) ion implantation (altering the material properties of the wafer) and metrology and inspection (measuring and ensuring the quality of the wafers) Though only a cursory look at the valuations of companies across the semiconductor spectrum it is clear that the fabless entities are extremely overpriced some in the triple digits They tend to be priced by the market as tech companies while major foundry TSMC is priced as a manufacturing stock This makes sense though both sides of the coin are subject to the same cyclical headwinds since they ultimately service the same end customers There is a case to be made that the semiconductor equipment manufacturers present possible value plays Though they are still exposed to the cyclicality of the semiconductor industry they also benefit from recurring services and repair revenues ASML and Applied Materials are potential stocks providing exposure to the industry with less exposure to cyclical headwinds They also benefit from being relative monopolies which is not to say they don‚Äôt come with their own certain risks All share prices taken 1pm UK 3 January P/E ratios calculated on a trailing 12-month basis Market

The entire behind-the-scenes video was shot using iPhone 15 Apple says that this video was shot using over 40 iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max devices These devices were placed throughout the show itself and rehearsals including being strapped to performers themselves The behind-the-scenes video was directed by Mike Carson who said: ‚ÄúChoosing iPhone allowed me to have my dream amount of coverage which was necessary for a docu-style project like this because we had to be in so many places at once And since it is an all-in-one device and we didn‚Äôt use any external lenses we were able to have a multitude of angles and operators in spaces that would have proven to be both difficult and expensive given the sheer scale needed for this film While we had an incredibly talented crew I truly believe it also freed us up to be able to just shoot and focus on beautiful compositions camera movement and storytelling and it made shooting a lot more fun & exciting Being able to switch lenses instantly when the moment called for either more information or a more intimate close-up allowed our team to stay focused on their frames versus having to overthink especially in high-pressure ‚Äúthink quick on your feet‚Äù scenarios For example we embedded camera operators into the field cast/mosh pit of the live performance and our operators were able to literally have a camera a few feet away from guest talent‚Äôs face creating beautiful wide angle frames and 10 seconds later when action was happening on the main stage 50ft away we‚Äôre able to have a high-quality medium shot instantly‚Äù Carson also explained why the iPhone 15 Pro‚Äôs support for LOG and Pro Res recording was such a key factor for this project: ‚ÄúThis was a game-changer especially with so many uncontrollable lighting scenarios given our docu-style approach We were able to retain so much visual information and data with the amount of dynamic range we had and Log was paramount in that I was blown away in the color session by the final image‚Äù Overall Carson concluded: ‚ÄúOverall it was great As a director who also likes to be hands-on I especially had fun being able to just pick up a camera and shoot without having to overthink about gear and I could focus on what was in my frame and the overall story and emotion I wanted to evoke The learning curve was small As someone who just loves creating regardless of scale or medium seeing the results of what we shot has definitely inspired me to pick up iPhone and just shoot so I‚Äôm excited to keep exploring the possibilities and embedding iPhone into my process‚Äù Xiaolong Liu director of photography for the behind-the-scenes video added: ‚ÄúiPhones are significantly more portable and discreet compared to traditional cameras allowing for shooting in a wider variety of locations and rigs with minimal setup The ability to swap between lenses (Wide Ultra Wide Telephoto) quickly without additional equipment is an efficient advantage for schedule-intensive shooting situations The unobtrusive nature of an iPhone can help capture more natural and spontaneous shots The size and flexibility of iPhone allows for capturing footage from unique angles and tight spaces where traditional cameras wouldn‚Äôt fit For example the throne shot of Usher and the piano shot of Alicia Keys‚Äù You can find the full 11-minute behind-the-scenes video below How long until we see an actual Super Bowl Halftime Show shot on iPhone?

only for well-heeled but time-barred infringement defendants to conveniently join the proceedings and shoulder the cost VirnetX cited a patent board case in which patent office director Kathi Vidal imposed sanctions on an entity called OpenSky Industries for attempting to extort both sides in a multi-billion-dollar dispute between Intel and patent owner VLSI Technology Vidal removed OpenSky from the case based on its misconduct and the tribunal allowed the challenge to a VLSI patent to continue with Intel leading it VirnetX also argued that former patent office interim director Drew Hirshfeld who presided before Vidal was appointed exceeded his authority by denying VirnetXs requests for director review of the decisions Apple and Mangrove responded that VirnetXs arguments were not supported by applicable federal law President Joe Bidens administration representing the patent office also urged the justices to reject the case VirnetX previously won $440 million from Apple based on a 2016 verdict that the tech giant used its security technology in features like FaceTime video calls Got a confidential news tip?

1079,"Broadcom Stock: Broad Runway In Growth Providing Apple With FBAR Chips","2/21/2024","https://seekingalpha.com/article/4672029-broadcom-broad-runway-in-growth-providing-apple-with-fbar-chips","Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is not just an average chipmaker From a small chipmaker previously called Avago Technologies it transformed itself into a massive tech titan through a combination of strategic acquisitions and organic growth Today it dominates the BAW filter market This is a crucial component in most leading smartphone products Recently it even secured a multi-year deal with Apple for its cutting-edge FBAR chips The company is a market leader in this FBAR filter market the predecessor to the older SAW filters FBAR is the future of RF filters for smartphones and other devices Broadcom potentially owns 87% of the crucial market For the benefit of consumers FBAR brings to the table the advantage of clearer call experiences faster data transfer and better battery life Moreover their recent Apple deal further strengthens their already market-leading dominance Broadcoms financials are impressive Its revenue and free cash flow are climbing steadily year after year Their balance sheet is pristine and its debt profile is under control In my opinion the company is also 1191% undervalued Investors should also note that China is a major source of AVGOs revenue Hence despite its impressive quality of business and financial profile should there be a significant rise in trade tension the macroeconomic tailwind could throw a wrench in the gears of the companys progression So while Broadcom shines bright right now investors should keep an eye on this potential geopolitical storm Overall we think this tech powerhouse still deserves a place for investors looking for visibly profitable companies with clear competitive advantages The ticker symbol of a company usually resembles its real name In the case of Broadcom this is not the case The reason is that back in 2015 Broadcom was acquired by Avago Technologies Ltd for $37B which took on the former‚Äôs name while retaining its ticker symbol of AVGO With this deal Broadcom was transformed from a small chipmaker into a combined $77B company At that time the combined company also becomes the third-largest US semiconductor maker by revenue Today Broadcom isnt just a chipmaker its a master acquirer Their history is peppered with strategic purchases each carefully chosen to fill a gap or expand their reach Broadcom has a proven track record of seamlessly integrating acquired technologies maximizing their value and strengthening their overall market position According to Wikipedia cited earlier: At this point year 2015 the company officially became Broadcom Ltd before becoming the present name Broadcom Inc Today AVGO is one of the largest 10 companies in the United States This is after the company acquired VMWare in late November 2023 causing its market capitalization to gain about $50B solidifying its presence in enterprise software VMware is expected to contribute $12 billion of its total FY24 revenue which is expected to be $50B This is 24% of its total revenue for FY24 According to this LinkedIn article Broadcom is already one of the leading BAW (Bulk Acoustic Wave) Filter producers in the world and commands 87% of the global market share Within BAW filters it is one of the leading FBAR BAW filter producers According to IEEE Spectrum the FBAR BAW filter is superior to the older SAW filter in the following ways: FBAR Filter (IEEE Spectrum) FBAR Filter (IEEE Spectrum) To put it simply: According to the LinkedIn article cited earlier FBAR forms the lions share of smartphones RF filters: In terms of product type FBAR BAW Filters is the largest segment occupied for a share of about 90% and in terms of application Smartphones has a share about 85 percent Recently Broadcom signed a multiyear deal with Apple to provide the latter with FBAR chips which should further strengthen its already market-leading position: Apple said it will tap Broadcom for what are known as film bulk acoustic resonator (FBAR) chips This is not the first time Broadcom has provided FBAR chips to major leading smartphone producers The company under Avago provided these chips for most of the leading smartphone makers back in 2014: In 2014 Avago‚Äôs Wireless Communications business generated $169 billion in revenue nearly doubling in size from the previous year FBAR-related products contributed the vast majority of this revenue Avago filters appear in the Apple iPhone 6 and Samsung Galaxy S6 as well as flagship smartphones from HTC Huawei LG Xiaomi and others Apple has an incentive to work with US partners like Broadcom for chip supplies due to its pledge made in 2019 to invest heavily in the US after Congress passed a measure lowering taxes on repatriated profits for American firms These should benefit US-based partners of Apple including Broadcom In my opinion such a partnership is

Guru) The company highlighted its risk in the annual report According to the report: Sustained uncertainty about or worsening of current global economic conditions and further escalation of trade tensions between the US and its trading partners especially China and possible decoupling of the US and China economies could result in a global economic slowdown and long-term changes to global trade Such events may also (i) cause our customers and consumers to reduce delay or forgo technology spending (ii) result in customers sourcing products from other suppliers not subject to such restrictions or tariffs (iii) lead to the insolvency or consolidation of key suppliers and customers and (iv) intensify pricing pressures While the company has no control over the possible worsening of the US-China trade tensions investors should factor this risk into their investment decisions Broadcom has come a long way since its days as Avago Technologies From a small chipmaker it morphed into a leader in semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions In terms of market share it dominates the BAW filter market which is the predecessor to the older SAW filter The newer FBAR filter provides clearer call experiences faster data transfer and better battery life In my opinion their recent deal with Apple should further strengthen their already leading market share Broadcoms financials are generally pristine with top and bottom lines rising consistently Their balance sheet is asset-rich and low in debt In my opinion the company is also undervalued providing a margin of safety of 1191% There is a small risk associated with Broadcom having 1/3 of its revenue coming from the Chinese market Investors should consider this when making any investment decisions in AVGO

European Commission set to rule on Spotifys complaint focused on competition in the streaming music market there are hints that the ruling will not be in Apples favor This week the Financial Times reported the EC will issue its first-ever fine against the tech giant for allegedly breaking EU law over competition in the streaming music market The fine is expected to be around ‚Ç¨500 million (about $539 million USD) the report noted Instead of chalking up the fine as the cost of doing business as a company that made history as the first to be valued at $3 trillion surely could the tech giant is taking the fight to the public In a statement shared with media today Apple argued against the idea that Spotify has been harmed by any anticompetitive practices on its part (The statement was not issued by a single spokesperson but rather comes from Apple itself) It reads: We‚Äôre happy to support the success of all developers ‚Äî including Spotify which is the largest music streaming app in the world Spotify pays Apple nothing for the services that have helped them build update and share their app with Apple users in 160 countries spanning the globe Fundamentally their complaint is about trying to get limitless access to all of Apple‚Äôs tools without paying anything for the value Apple provides Apple pointed out also that Spotify has a 56% share of the market compared with 20% for Amazon Music and Apple Musics 11% per MIDiAs 2022 report on the subscription music market In addition Apple shared a number of non-public details about Spotifys business as it pertains to Apples platforms including for example that Spotify uses thousands of Apples APIs across 60 frameworks; that Spotify uses Apples beta testing platform TestFlight; that Spotify has submitted over 420 versions of its app to App Review which were approved; and even that Apple engineers have helped Spotify solve various challenges like those impacting hardware-accelerated media playback and battery optimization And for those number watchers out there Apple also said that Spotifys app had been downloaded re-downloaded or updated more than 119 billion times across Apple devices -- a stat we had not heard before we should note The fact that Apple is front-running the ECs decision with its own commentary is remarkable in and of itself It speaks to a company that so solidly believes that its doing the best thing for its own customers and developer partners that any sort of ruling that deems otherwise is so absurd that it demands comment and pushback Apple believes its system of in-app purchases for things like music subscriptions saves consumers not only the headache and inconvenience of having to visit external websites on the iPhones small screen -- they can just click the side button instead -- but also protects against fraud excess data collection consumer confusion over cancellations and errant purchases by children (Of course Apple is familiar with the latter itself) Apple believes that Spotify only wants to increase its profits by leveraging regulations to its advantage In the case of the EU complaint the concern is that Apples App Store distorts competition in the music streaming market It is not solely a complaint that Spotify has been harmed in other words but that the nature of the App Store may have thwarted other rivals Spotify is a big player in the music streaming market but we don‚Äôt know what would have been the conditions without this EVP and competition chief Margrethe Vestager said about the ECs investigation back in 2021 There are other rivals to Apple Music ‚Äî there are Deezer there are Soundcloud Smaller competitors and here we have real concerns about their developments This is not a Spotify case ‚Äî this is a music streaming case she noted Spotify however has been the loudest of the Apple Music rivals and has fought against the company on other matters for instance by calling Apples new DMA rules extortion and a complete and total farce To protect its interests (and Apple argues consumers) Apples response to the EUs DMA (Digital Markets Act) regulation is the introduction of a new system that requires developers to pay for its services beyond just App Store payment processing Rather it now separates payment processing from other services by levying a Core Technology Fee for those developers who want to do business under the new DMA rules In other words it wants developers to pay Apple for the work it does to create and maintain its iOS platform where apps can run rather than acknowledging that access to consumers favorite apps helps sell its iPhones For the record Apple disputes Spotifys claims that its been harmed by any anticompetitive practices It speaks to the success Spotify has seen over the years having grown its streaming app over eight years from 25 million to 160 million subscribers -- a 27% average growth rate It points out that Spotify users regularly subscribe to the service outside its app and that Spotify qualifies for the Reader app exception to Apples rules which allows it to link directly to its website for account creation and payment similar to Netflix However Apple seems to ignore the fact that Spotify turning a quarterly profit still makes headlines that it just laid off 17% of its workforce and that you know Spotify does face competition on iOS globally from Apple Music which is preinstalled on iPhones iPads and other Apple devices In addition to being offered as a standalone service Apples music streaming app is upsold to customers as part of the Apple One bundles which combine multiple Apple services like iCloud+ News+ Apple TV+ and others under one roof Apple also stresses how closely Spotify has worked with the Commission on its complaint having met with the regulators more than 65 times since the investigation began The investigation however has been ongoing for years A rep for the EC declined to comment on news related to Spotifys complaint or any pending fines The FT had reported the fine is expected to be announced early next month Spotify responded to Apples statement with one of its own saying: Spotify‚Äôs success has happened despite Apples best efforts to gain an artificial advantage by favoring their own music service at every turn while placing roadblocks and imposing unfair restrictions on ours Under their current rules Apple controls Spotify‚Äôs access to its own customers and gives Spotify one of two untenable options: We either have to deliver a poor user experience where we can‚Äôt directly communicate how to buy or subscribe to Spotify on iPhones or we have to accept a 30% cost disadvantage against our biggest competitor This is not a level playing field We support the European Commission and trust that they will take action soon to create a fair ecosystem for everyone involved Additional reporting: Natasha Lomas; Updated 2/22/24 5:54 PM with Spotify statement Europe charges

GIL LURIA: Well the first thing it does is it changes perceptions about Apples ability to innovate We havent had a new product category in a while and this is a very big new innovation It will change how we do computing Spatial computing is very different than how we do it now how we interact with applications how we would view what were seeing where the battery is where the display is So its Apple taking us way out into the future For now at a price point that most folks cant afford but will give at least some people a perspective on where things are headed especially so developers can develop the new applications and tools that are more appropriate for spatial computing JARED BILKRE: Gil maybe Im just reading into this personally but I see the pictures with Tim Cook and the new headset on He doesnt look the happiest And you know I go back Jony Ive was really never into AR and VR Im not sure he would have endorsed this In fact he left Apple before this was really developed Im just wondering if theres something there If you think people inside Apple are really gung-ho about this GIL LURIA: Well again the point is this isnt what were going to have on our head in five years Nobody is going to have this heavy clunky device that has an external battery and weighs a pound and has multiple straps that needs to be adjusted Thats not what its going to look like in five years In five years its just going to be glasses Were just going to have glasses that we can see our surroundings we can see multiple screens and multiple applications at once and thats how were going to use this device Its not going to look like the big ski goggles that they are today JULIE HYMAN: Gil can we assume even as this spatial computing innovation is happening that like the iPhone is kind innovated out right? Its got like the-- are we going to see any more leaps of innovation in smartphones or with the existing technologies of pretty much as far as its going to go? GIL LURIA: Well I think theres a few more opportunities for innovation So phones can still get lighter thinner maybe transparent some other handset makers make them foldable But what would really look out for is Apple is going to introduce new generative AI capabilities most likely in the June WWDC event and they might tie it to the next iPhone cycle So they may make the iPhone 16 be the only handset that can run these types of applications And if thats the case well have a major upgrade cycle The last time we had a major upgrade cycle was the iPhone 12 that was the first phone that was capable of getting on a 5G network If they make a phone thats the first and only phone that can operate something that consumers want such as generative capabilities that may drive another upgrade cycle JARED BILKRE: Ive got to ask you about China because that has been a sore spot not only for Apple but for the entire exporting world for that matter What do you think the future is for Apple specifically in China? GIL LURIA: We have very little visibility the outlook is murky because theres so many factors that contribute to performance in China First and foremost the Chinese consumer the economy there is weak the markets weak the real estate markets weak the sources of wealth are dissipating for that high end Chinese consumer Then you have-- its the most competitive handset market with a local incumbent that is very price competitive but also has some rich features that theyre introducing And then finally you have the government deciding how protectionist they want to be Theres reports out of China that theyre not allowing government backed agencies for people that work in those types of agencies to have iPhones Possibly as a retaliation around our measures in limiting AI chips Possibly as part of a bigger political statement Either way those are things that are going to be very hard for Apple to predict Its going to continue to be in that market In fact they had the highest share in China last year still with all of this but its going to be very hard to predict whats going to happen to that going forward JULIE HYMAN: Gil you mentioned AI in passing right? And Tim Cook sort of teased that something is coming from the company on the AI front I mean Apple does tend to leak a little bit Maybe well get a little more insight into what it might be But I mean do you have any theories? And I guess three-part question Do you have any theories? When do you think well learn more? And what is that going to do for Apple? GIL LURIA: Well so its usually not Apple thats leaking its their-- they have such a broad supply chain that just-- that somebody somewhere a vendor of Apples is usually the person whos leaking it Apple actually tries really hard not to front run its product just so-- because theres so much speculation And thats what theyre doing here All we know for now is that there are uses of AI already When we use our text to-- and they autocomplete a text thats the use of AI You could expect that to expand from there But based on the resources they have and the attention theyre focused on and how important it is for their future I would expect some things that were not thinking about yet to come out later this year to make the experience better to help us summarize experiences pre-populate messages and possibly help more with translation either to language or to programming or to application maneuvering Theres a lot of things they can do And again they have so many resources so many smart people working in Cupertino that I would expect them to do something that will impress us JULIE HYMAN: Gil thanks so much Appreciate it GIL LURIA: Thank you Related Quotes"

countries in 2024 You can skip our detailed analysis on the economic potential and race for power in the world‚Äôs largest continent by heading over to the 5 Most Powerful Asian Countries in 2024 Western observers have been talking about Asia‚Äôs future potential for quite some time and that future is catching up faster than expected According to a report by McKinsey & Company Asia which in the year 2000 accounted for less than one-third of the world‚Äôs GDP in purchasing power parity terms is poised to make up more than 50% of the global economy by 2040 In addition to this Asia will also account for about 40% of the world‚Äôs consumption by then PricewaterhouseCoopers has forecast that China alone would constitute 20% of the world‚Äôs GDP by 2050 while India will surpass the United States to become the second largest economy in the world with Indonesia being fourth biggest economic power All of these projections reiterate what many experts have long been saying that this is going to be Asia‚Äôs century Over the last decade or so several large corporations including Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) have outsourced some of their operations to Asian countries for reasons ranging from cheap skillful labor to the lucrative opportunities offered by the huge market size in the continent Today 95% of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)‚Äôs iPhone iPads and MacBooks are made in China ‚Äì the country which also happened to be the source of 20% of the company‚Äôs overall revenue in 2022 Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is also making inroads in the Indian market Its first retail store in the country was inaugurated last year in Mumbai There has been an uptick in Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)‚Äôs investments in Asia as well In 2021 the company announced to set up a new data center in Indonesia which is expected to increase revenues for the tech giant by $63 billion Moreover the International Data Corporation (IDC) has noted that Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is likely to add to $39 billion and create 100000 new jobs in the UAE‚Äôs economy between 2022 and 2026 through its cloud based services Asian corporations themselves contribute about $19 trillion to the world economy each year according to a report The continent is home to some of the largest corporations in the world like Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM) Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) TATA Group and Reliance Industries among others The Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM) holds a 12% share of the world‚Äôs automobile industry 112 million vehicles were sold by the company in 2023 which secured Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM)‚Äôs status as the top automaker for the fourth successive year Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is the largest producer of semiconductors in the world holding a 60% share of the global market In 2023 it even beat the likes of Intel and Samsung in revenue according to a report Several economic powerhouses in Asia have begun leveraging their financial strength to enhance their military capabilities According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) about 25% of the world‚Äôs military expenditure of $22 trillion in 2022 was incurred by Asian countries Defense expenditure has spiked 45% in the continent over the past decade with the steepest rise seen in South Asia (46%) and East Asia (50%) ‚Äì the two major flashpoints in the region The threat of China invading Taiwan is higher today than it has ever been The US has been ramping up its presence in the Indo-Pacific and has approved sales of weapons worth billions to Taipei lately Last year in March Washington approved the sale of weapons worth $619 million for Taiwan including 100 AGM-88B HARM and 200 AMRAAM missiles for its F-16 fleet RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) and Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) are the primary contractors of the deal South Korea is also set to receive up to 25 F-35 fighter jets developed by Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) from the US for a deal worth $5 billion amid increasing aggression from Pyongyang and Beijing Oil-rich countries in the Middle East are also racking up their defense capabilities The trend has picked up pace especially after the Arab Spring of 2010 that rattled several Arab monarchies Saudi Arabia for instance has become the fifth largest spender on defense having incurred over $75 billion in 2022 which included a $3 billion agreement with RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) to acquire 300 MIM-104E Patriot missiles

break ranks depending on the SEC‚Äôs next move TOPLINE Spring has come early to cryptoland Bitcoin is trading above $60000 up more than 167% in the last 12 months and more than $7 billion has poured into the new bitcoin ETFs The market is buzzing with anticipation for an ETF backed by bitcoin‚Äôs little brother ether the native token associated with the Ethereum blockchain and used to create such things as NFTs Ether has a market cap of more than $400 billion second only to Bitcoin whose market cap exceeds $12 trillion In May the SEC will likely pass final judgment on nine spot ether ETF applications But unlike bitcoin‚Äôs decision day in early January which seemed to be a fait accompli ether‚Äôs outlook is far less certain The most immediate concern is whether the SEC believes that ether is a security which means that it would be subject to registration and regulatory oversight by the SEC under the Investment Company Act of 1940 Most ETFs like the QQQ or the SPDR S&P 500 trust fall under the so-called 40 Act precisely because they are bundles of stocks or registered securities Despite the fact that cryptocurrencies seem to trade and behave much like any number of stocks in the market the digital asset community believes that the thousands of different cryptocurrencies behind the $18 trillion dollar industry are not securities In fact they bristle at the thought calling it anathema to the decentralized ethos that launched bitcoin 15 years ago To some extent these beliefs were vindicated when the SEC greenlit spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in January after a 10-plus year wait under the 1933 Securities Exchange Act which recognized the underlying bitcoin in these funds as commodities WHY IT MATTERS If the SEC decides that ether is a security it will insist on ETF issuers treating it as such in their applications for approval While this might seem like just a bunch of legal paperwork doing so would be an affront to crypto industry insiders and idealists and throw into question the status of thousands of cryptocurrencies However given the potential billions at stake for early movers in the new booming market for crypto ETFs those that can gain market share rapidly as Blackrock Invesco Fidelity have with their bitcoin ETFs could benefit from such an SEC ruling When it comes to asset gathering and profits ‚Äúcrypto community ideals‚Äù

uncommon to see hundreds (or even thousands) of applicants on a job posting on LinkedIn which can make it all the more confusing when a role like that is reposted Counterintuitively this might be the right time to apply: Job listings get the largest volume of applicants within the first 48 hours and this brief window tends to yield enough quality candidates for recruiters to move forward But if a role is later reposted it probably means no candidate was selected and there may even be a greater sense of urgency this time around Senate Democrats reintroduced a voting rights act that has already

DAN HOWLEY: Hey Jared Right now Im actually coming through the setup process to try to get one of these When you do youre going to have to have an iPhone or iPad with you basically to take a scan of your face Its going to tell you to look up down left right kind of similar to what you do when you set up face ID And thats the way that it takes measurements for you to ensure that youre getting a right fit when you have this The big reason why you want a good fit is because you dont want light leaking in to take you away from that immersive experience that Apples offering So far though it looks like there are backups as far as the delivery date So theyre appear to be slipping as far away as March Its going to take quite a while I just set one up $3500 $3499 I set one up with Zeiss Optical inserts for my glasses $4147 is what I would pay I dont think I got paid this week so its not happening But I do think that its something worth watching to see how many people actually buy and how long those delivery times end up getting delayed just because it shows how much people are interested in this product And its still a nascent market but you know weve seen Meta in here for quite a while and it hasnt taken off as much as maybe Mark Zuckerberg would have hoped So well have to see if Apple can stoke these fires JOSH LIPTON: And Dan what do you think the most popular use cases for this device are going to be? Not just in the near term but kind of farther out Do you think this is going to be-- listen this is really going to be for gamers? Is it going to be for people watching movies or sports or are people going to use it at work? DAN HOWLEY: I mean hands down the reason why people have these headsets right now is gaming right? And so if youre not a gamer or youre not even you know interested in gaming at all then its not really a system for you Thats how it is with the Meta Quest There are some work options where you can dip into meetings and things like that But lets face it you dont want to turn on your camera on your laptop for a meeting youre not going to want to strap on a headset for a meeting You dont want to see something-- someone in the flesh you dont want to see a virtual version of them either The thing that I think Apple is banking on is that you would use this as a productivity device to extend your screen So you would look down at your Mac and then oh heres a giant version of that screen up here Thats very cool I got to look at a version of that The other is watching interactive videos or 3D videos things like that When I tried it in June at WWDC I got to see a version-- a 3D version of the Avatar movie which looked very cool you know I got to say the overall between any of the devices that Ive used the Vision Pro is the best The fidelity for the screen is amazing You put it on and you see the pass through and it looks great I think the real question is do people want something like this? And if so why? Ive said it before I have a 65-inch OLED TV I have my PlayStation there I can get up and walk to the fridge I can lay down I dont have to worry about a headset Ill have to see when I get my hands on the Vision Pro if that makes me change my mind Related Quotes"

For a quick overview of such stocks read our article 5 High Growth Low PE Stocks When value stocks came back with a vengeance in 2022 value investors cheered what they thought was the beginning of a long bull run of value stocks But thanks to the AI boom growth stocks rebounded in 2023 In a ten-year period ending 2021 the Russell Growth 1000 Index doubled the performance of the Russell 1000 Value Index The so-called value investing strategy has taken a hit amid an unending growth of technology stocks But over the years the traditional boundaries between value and growth investing have faded In fact successful investors like Warren Buffett have long been saying that differentiating between value and growth does not make sense as they see growth a part of the broader value investing philosophy Warren Buffett once said: There is no such thing as growth stocks or value stocks as Wall Street generally portrays them as contrasting asset classes Growth is part of the value equation‚Äù There was a time Buffett stayed away from tech stocks like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) Amazoncom Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) saying he did not understand business models of these companies But today he has huge stakes in some of the top tech companies in the US Relying totally on PE ratios without paying attention to fundamentals and growth of companies is also not useful For example Oakmark in its September 2023 report on Value Vs Growth said the following which shows the importance of paying attention to both value multiples and growth metrics before making investment decisions: When we compare the 50 lowest ranked companies by P/E ratio on the S&P 500 today to the ones that made that list in previous periods we don‚Äôt observe any decline in business quality Therefore considering both the relatively high price of the higher P/E companies and the solid business quality of the lower P/E companies‚Äîwe believe that low P/E stocks today present a better hunting ground than they normally do Last year we bought depressed stocks of high- growth businesses such as Uber at a double-digit free cash flow yield; Workday at a low price relative to sales; and Adobe at only a slightly higher than average P/E ratio This year after strong outperformance we sold them and bought much lower P/E stocks Here‚Äôs a fun way to think of it: In 2022 we bought a share of Adobe for about three shares of CVS Health (CVS was just under $100 and Adobe under $300) This year we sold Adobe to buy more than six shares of CVS (Adobe increased to well over $400 and CVS fell

Though Apple‚Äôs market value has been among the world‚Äôs top ten since 2010 until a few years ago it traded at a low valuation relative to profits It was thought of as a maker of hardware a business that is more difficult to scale than software For much of the 2010s its price-to-earnings (p/e) ratio which captures investors‚Äô expectations of future profits was below 20 comparable to that of HPE or Lenovo boring computer-makers with low growth and tight margins It was also below the average for big American companies in the S&P 500 index (see chart 1) This started to change around 2019 notes Toni Sacconaghi of Bernstein a broker Revenue from Apple‚Äôs ‚Äúservices‚Äù business which provides software to its devices‚Äô 1bn or so users began to grow The two biggest parts of this category are an advertising business which Bernstein puts at $24bn a year (including around $20bn a year from Google for making the search engine the default option on Apple‚Äôs devices) and the App Store (another $24bn) Services also include Apple Music and Apple TV its streaming offerings as well as a fast-growing payments business All told revenues from services amount to $85bn a year or a fifth of total sales In 2016 they contributed just $24bn or a tenth of overall revenues (see chart 2) This helped convince investors that Apple was no longer a stodgy hardware provider It was a software platform where new paying users could be added at little extra cost That meant higher profits‚Äîthe gross-profit margin for Apple‚Äôs services arm is 71% compared with 37% for devices‚Äîand more recurring revenue As services became a bigger part of the business Apple‚Äôs overall profitability swelled too from 38% in 2018 to 44% last year That was also aided by the fact it was selling more high-end high-margin iPhone models All of this helped lift Apple‚Äôs p/e ratio to around 30 comfortably above the S&P 500 average and higher than that of Alphabet (Google‚Äôs parent company) though still below Microsoft‚Äôs (38) and Amazon‚Äôs (72) One set of risks that could undo Apple‚Äôs p/e progress has to do with its legal headaches Some such as the patent problem look like minor threats In October the International Trade Commission a federal agency ruled that Apple infringed patents related to an oxygen-measuring sensor that were owned by Masimo a medical-device maker Apple stopped selling the models which contained the offending technology But on January 18th it started to sell them again after disabling the disputed sensor Apple‚Äôs bigger legal problems have to do with its services business In March new rules will come into effect in the EU a huge market that force Apple to allow apps to be installed on its devices without going through its App Store That makes it harder for it to charge the 30% fee it levies on most in-app purchases (Apple has filed a lawsuit against the rules) In America the DoJ is reportedly looking into whether Apple‚Äôs smartwatch works better with the iPhone than with other smartphones and why its messaging service is unavailable on rival devices If in a separate case against Google the courts agree with the DoJ that its default-search deals with device-makers are anticompetitive Apple could be deprived of roughly $20bn a year in virtually free money As a result of a lawsuit filed in 2021 by Epic Games a video-game developer Apple has already had to change the way the App Store charges developers to sell apps there Apple is not defenceless in the legal battles It quickly found a workaround to the Epic-induced changes to its App Store policy that lets it keep collecting hefty fees A final ruling in the DoJ‚Äôs case against Google is probably years away The same is true of its expected case against Apple As with many antitrust cases against big tech investors seem unfazed The company is more vulnerable to the second area of concern‚Äîits slowing core business According to a poll of analysts Apple sold about 220m iPhones last year barely more than the 217m it shifted in 2017 In 2024 the number might not be much higher For a while Apple could offset the slowing volumes with higher prices But annual revenue growth has slipped to 2% in the past two years down from an average of 10% between 2012 and 2021 Some rivals are trying to eat into Apple‚Äôs market share in high-end devices by exploiting consumers‚Äô appetite for ChatGPT-like ‚Äúgenerative‚Äù artificial intelligence (AI) Samsung a South Korean tech titan said that it would launch a new range of AI-powered phones by the end of January Flashy features will include real-time voice translation and turbocharged photo- and video-editing The devices may be on sale eight months before Apple‚Äôs next iPhones Apple by contrast has said little about its plans for the hottest thing in tech since well the iPhone ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre investing quite a bit‚Äù Mr Cook noted cryptically on the company‚Äôs most recent earnings call Apple is also being given a run for its money in China the source of 17% of its overall revenues According to Jefferies an investment bank Apple‚Äôs share of smartphones in the country declined last year Meanwhile that of Huawei a domestic tech champion grew by around six percentage points In August Huawei stunned industry-watchers‚Äîand America‚Äôs government which has for years barred sales of American technology to the firm on national-security grounds‚Äîby launching the first 5G device containing advanced chips that were Chinese-made rather than imported Patriotic shoppers in China snapped up the phone and for good measure other Huawei devices When it comes to AI worries about Apple‚Äôs progress may be overstated Erik Woodring of Morgan Stanley an investment bank points to signs that the company is indeed investing quite a bit In October the firm‚Äôs boffins and researchers at Columbia University jointly released an open-source AI model called Ferret Two months later Apple published a paper about how such models could run on smartphones which are much less powerful than the data centres typically used for the purpose In January a South Korean tech blogger reported that an update to Apple‚Äôs operating system possibly as early as June would include AI enhancements for Siri its robot assistant Rumours swirl that Apple is planning to use generative AI in its own search engine China however represents a bigger threat‚Äîand not just because of a revitalised Huawei Apple‚Äôs plans for future growth depend in large part on success in emerging markets including the biggest one of all Mr Cook kicked off Apple‚Äôs past three earnings calls by talking about the company‚Äôs sales outside the rich world China was doubtless on his mind Apple is also exposed to China risk through its supply chain Despite much-publicised efforts to move some production to India around 90% of iPhones are still manufactured in Chinese factories So are most Mac computers and iPads Mr Sacconaghi of Bernstein says that Apple will be hugely exposed to a serious geopolitical escalation such as a conflict over Taiwan for at least the next five years Events short of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan could also hurt the company The return of Donald Trump to the White House a serious possibility now that he has all but wrapped up the Republican nomination would almost certainly raise barriers to trade and heighten Sino-American tensions Even if Joe Biden defeats Mr Trump in the presidential election in November he is hardly a China dove The Chinese government is beginning to hit back against American sanctions It has already banned products made by Micron a chipmaker from Idaho from some infrastructure projects In September reports surfaced of a ban on Apple products among government officials Although the authorities later denied the claims the episode put investors on edge Any Chinese action that hurts Apple in China would hurt China too Apple says 3m people work in its supply chain Many of those workers are Chinese One analyst likens Apple‚Äôs position vis-√†-vis China‚Äôs government to ‚Äúmutually assured destruction‚Äù The same could be said of the commercial balance between America and

unlocked an $8 trillion market to move in a new direction See how it could unleash 6000% potential upside Apple AB InBev and Johnson & Johnson may be the blue-chip stocks you have been looking to buy and hold to add that extra stability to your portfolio Advertisement Source: Shutterstock Blue-chip stocks refer to stocks of large well-established companies with a reputation for high-quality reliable investments They tend to be industry leaders in their sectors and have a large market capitalization in the billions of dollars This led us to create our list of blue-chip stocks to buy and hold for the long haul The precise definition of blue-chip stocks can be subjective though However blue-chip companies can offer general stability through consistent steady performance without witnessing dramatic fluctuations in their share prices They are overall better candidates to buy and hold for the long haulThis makes blue-chip stocks ideal for investment strategies seeking to balance portfolios and mitigate volatility It may be more pertinent to buy and hold now This is especially true as the Federal Reserve (Fed) estimates a 61% recession probability within the next 12 monthsWhether looking to diversify a portfolio strive for stability or simply have the appetite to avoid turbulence in light of the upcoming national elections the following three blue-chip stocks represent an opportunity for steady returns in the long haul They are well-suited as long-term blue-chip stocks to buy and hold: The world‚Äôs most profitable company Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) enjoys a history of sustained growth and expectations for continued expansion going forward Don‚Äôt just take our word for it This was said by renowned investor Warren Buffett It should be noted that he did modestly downsize his stake in the company recently While shares retreated somewhat on disappointing sales from the Chinese market Apple‚Äôs strong brand and financial position imply further potential Nonetheless Apple‚Äôs sales in China rebounded to more than $70 billion in 2021 and 2022 following covid Accounting for around 20% of AAPL‚Äôs sales China will remain critical for the company‚Äôs

EPS expectations in 2023 Apple also offers a marginal dividend yield of 052% Brewers are known for resisting economic downturns This makes AB InBev (NYSE:BUD) an exciting choice for investors looking for long-term blue-chip stocks to buy and hold As the largest in the United States and globally AB InBev benefits from global consumer demand in the context of investment hedge even during economic turbulence The company involved themselves in a marketing controversy last year through its flagship Bud Light but has since normalized leaving an opportunity for further shareholder gains However potential March strikes may put the stock in a better position to consider buying should BUD fail to negotiate contract terms with Teamsters successfully At a P/E ratio of 203x below the industry average of 255 times AB InBev also offers a forward dividend of 13% Like AAPL the company has also beaten all quarterly analysts‚Äô EPS estimates in 2023 Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is widely recognized as a leading global healthcare company Having recently spun off its consumer products division in 2023 into Kenvue (NYSE:KVUE) in a deal involving $36 billion JNJ can now focus its efforts on the healthcare sector Specifically it can channel its expertise and resources into medical devices diagnostics and pharmaceutical research and development Moreover JNJ‚Äôs product pipeline contains more than 90 additional drug candidates currently progressing through clinical trials In addition to numerous well-known medications JNJ‚Äôs diversification and financial strength support its 30x P/E

Zuckerberg sure hopes so In late 2022 the Meta chief acknowledged that while there is still some time before bets on the metaverse can prove successful business messaging is probably going to be the next major pillar Expect him to push that hard in the US Thanks for signing up for our daily insight on the African economy We bring you daily editor picks from the best Business Insider news content so you can stay updated on the latest topics and conversations on the African market leaders careers and lifestyle Also join us across all of our other channels - we love to be connected! ¬© 2024 africabusinessinsidercom"
