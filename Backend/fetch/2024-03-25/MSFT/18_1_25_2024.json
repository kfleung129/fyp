    "text": "By Jill Goldsmith Co-Business Editor Microsoft is laying off about 1,900 people in its gaming division following the closing of its acquisition of Activision Blizzard. In a memo sent to employees today, the company said the move was to address \u201careas of overlap.\u201d Blizzard President Mike Ybarra is also leaving. In a post on X, Ybarra called it \u201can incredibly hard day.\u201d His post said: \u201cI want to thank everyone who is impacted today for their meaningful contributions to their teams, to Blizzard, and to players\u2019 lives. It\u2019s an incredibly hard day and my energy and support will be focused on all those amazing individuals impacted \u2013 this is in no way a reflection on your amazing work. If there\u2019s anything I can help with, connections, recommendations, etc., DM me. To the Blizzard community: I also want to let you all know today is my last day at Blizzard. Leading Blizzard through an incredible time and being part of the team, shaping it for the future ahead, was an absolute honor. Having already spent 20+ years at Microsoft and with the acquisition of Activision Blizzard behind us, it\u2019s time for me to (once again) become Blizzard\u2019s biggest fan from the outside. To the incredible teams at Blizzard \u2013 thank you. Words can\u2019t express how I feel about all of you. You are amazing. Continue to do incredible things and always keep Blizzard blue and the player at the forefront of every decision. To all of those impacted today \u2013 I am always available to you and understand how challenging today\u2019s news is. My heart is with each one of you.\u201d The circa 1,900 layoffs were noted in a memo to staff Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer today, according to news outlets that have seen it. Microsoft closed its $69 billion acquisition of Activision in October after a battle with regulators. The videogame business has been hit by layoffs recently along with big tech and media.
