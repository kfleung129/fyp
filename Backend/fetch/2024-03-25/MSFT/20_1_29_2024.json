    "text": "Microsoft (MSFT) is poised to unveil its earnings after the market closes Tuesday, with a management conference call scheduled for 5:30 p.m. Reflecting on the previous quarter, Microsoft outperformed expectations with its fiscal first-quarter results, alongside providing promising revenue forecasts. For the current quarter, projections indicate a potential increase of over 15% in both earnings and revenue compared to the same period last year, according to LSEG data. One key area to watch, is the impact of Microsoft\u2019s recent launch of the Copilot add-on subscriptions for its productivity software. Initially available to enterprises purchasing a minimum of 300 seats, the significance of this rollout in the earnings report remains uncertain. However, there could be positive implications if industry analysts\u2019 predictions of reduced efforts to optimize cloud infrastructure spending hold true. Additionally, the recent uptick in PC shipments, marking the first growth in two years, might positively influence Windows license sales to device manufacturers, a segment that saw a 39% decline in the same quarter last year following a pandemic-induced surge in PC purchases. Historically, Microsoft has consistently surpassed earnings expectations, achieving this in five of the last six quarters. Bespoke\u2019s data also indicates that Microsoft\u2019s shares tend to see a modest increase on earnings announcement days. "
