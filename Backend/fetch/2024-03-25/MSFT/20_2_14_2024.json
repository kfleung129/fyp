    "text": "by Todd Bishop on February 14, 2024 at 7:50 amFebruary 14, 2024 at 7:52 am State-affiliated online attackers are finding ChatGPT and other AI tools useful for improving their productivity, and streamlining and accelerating their work, but they have yet to unleash the technology\u2019s full potential. Microsoft and OpenAI say they\u2019re doing their best to keep it from happening. That\u2019s the takeaway from a new research report issued by the companies this morning, detailing the use of large language models by nation-state attackers affiliated with China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran. \u201cThese actors generally sought to use OpenAI services for querying open-source information, translating, finding coding errors, and running basic coding tasks,\u201d OpenAI said in a post Wednesday morning. The San Francisco-based company said it worked with Microsoft to identify and terminate accounts associated with five state-affiliated groups. State-affiliated threat actors \u201chave not yet observed particularly novel or unique AI-enabled attack or abuse techniques resulting from threat actors\u2019 usage of AI,\u201d Microsoft said in its own post. \u201cHowever, Microsoft and our partners continue to study this landscape closely.\u201d Microsoft announced several principles for disrupting the malicious use of its AI technologies and APIs. In addition to detecting and suspending the accounts of state-affiliated threat actors, the company says it will notify other service providers, collaborate with key stakeholders, and issue public reports about its findings. The Redmond company also discussed the ways that AI will help to defend against online attacks. Microsoft said its Copilot for Security product, currently in customer preview, \u201cshowed increased security analyst speed and accuracy, regardless of their expertise level, across common tasks like identifying scripts used by attackers, creating incident reports, and identifying appropriate remediation steps.\u201d Subscribe to GeekWire's free newsletters to catch every headline Have a scoop that you'd like GeekWire to cover?
