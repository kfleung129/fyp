Read more Microsoft confirmed today that\u00a0unauthorized actors gained access to a limited number of internal email accounts, including those of some executives and employees. The company attributed the breach to a\u00a0compromised legacy test account that lacked multi-factor authentication (MFA) safeguards. According to Microsoft\u2019s official statement, the incident involved a technique known as password spraying, where attackers attempt multiple password combinations on a specific account. The actors gained a foothold within the company\u2019s network by exploiting a legacy test account without MFA enabled.\u00a0They subsequently compromised an OAuth application, granting them access to\u00a0several employee email accounts.

In response to the incident,\u00a0Microsoft emphasized its commitment to strengthening its security posture.\u00a0The company announced plans to\u00a0accelerate the rollout of MFA across all accounts, including legacy systems, and to conduct a comprehensive review of its security protocols.
