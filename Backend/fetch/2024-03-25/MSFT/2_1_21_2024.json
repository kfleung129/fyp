Did you miss them? 1 \u2013 Microsoft\u2019s new CoPilot Pro brings AI-powered office features to the rest of us. On Monday Microsoft announced their CoPilot Pro premium service for $20 dollars per month. The subscription fee gives users access to features including Microsoft 365 apps \u2013 Excel, PowerPoint, Microsoft Teams \u2013 with \u201cpriority access\u201d to GPT-4. As stated on the Microsoft Blog, it will also be available on iOS and Android. For those who already use Microsoft 365, CoPilot Pro will activate CoPilot in all apps, offering AI-powered capabilities for each. (Source: The Verge) Why this is important for your business: CoPilot Pro will help your employees draft better emails, write better documents, create better presentations and take better notes \u2013 among other things \u2013 which will all combine to making them more productive. My recommendation, if your company uses Office 365, is to lean into this. Start with a small group and expand its use. Get training and consultation. But take advantage of these tools as they\u2019ll significantly help your people get more things done quickly. 2 \u2013 ChatGPT will have video functionality and more accuracy in future versions \u2013 Sam Altman says ChatGPT-5 will be a big improvement. An improved version of ChatGPT was the topic of conversation on the Unconfuse Me podcast where Sam Altman shared with Bill Gates what users can expect with GPT-5. Altman detailed that issues with accuracy and query commands are being worked on. Images and video will also receive noticeable enhancements. In the 10 months since GPT-4 was launched, numerous accuracy issues were reported and many users voiced frustrations. Altman also touched on what\u2019s known as \u201challucinations,\u201d meaning instances where the chatbot produces irrelevant data. Now \u2013 ahead of GPT-5\u2019s official launch yet to be announced \u2013 OpenAI is getting ahead of the glitches by promoting a much-improved product. (Source: Tom\u2019s Guide) Why this is important for your business: Microsoft is a significant partner to OpenAI (a Microsoft spokesperson says while details of the agreement between Microsoft and Open AI remain confidential, it is important to note that Microsoft does not own any portion of OpenAI and is simply entitled to share of profit distributions) so Office users can expect to benefit from any new features in the highly anticipated GPT-5. 3 \u2013 Mastercard is developing AI-powered tool for small business mentorship. Mastercard is planning to launch Mastercard Small Business AI \u2013 a tool to help entrepreneurs and small businesses \u201cadapt, keep pace, and thrive\u201d in the evolving landscape of technology and consumer demands. In partnership with Create Labs, the AI will contain key data while also offering a \u201cconversational experience\u201d on various business-related questions.. (Source: ASBN) Why this is important for your business: I\u2019m still a little unclear on what this service will actually do for small businesses, but hoping its generative AI functionality will provide us with a better way for getting financing and cash flow guidance. The launch is still a few months away so I\u2019m assuming we\u2019ll get more clarity as the time approaches. 4 \u2013 Email automation from GoDaddy offers custom emails to deliver the right message at the right time. Continuing with their mission to empower entrepreneurs, GoDaddy has launched email automation to lighten the load of email marketing. Available for new and existing users at no extra cost, the feature is listed on GoDaddy\u2019s product page. (Source: CRN India) Why this is important for your business: Included are templates \u2013 welcome messages, appointment reminders \u2013 and personalized emails that users can draft for specific recipients then schedule them to be sent at a chosen date and time. Templates can be tailored with color schemes/graphics that reflect the users\u2019 company or brand. For GoDaddy customers using email this is definitely a good tool to try. 5 \u2013 Before you buy a Windows 11 \u2018AI PC\u2019 in 2024, read this. Chris Hoffman of Computer World recommends taking a pause if you\u2019re in the market for the Windows 11 \u201cAI PC.\u201d Promoted as a major boost in laptop performance, AI PCs were also on display at last week\u2019s CES 2024 event. For more, visit the link. (Source: Computerworld) Why this is important for your business: As Hoffman points out, we as consumers should \u201ccut through the hype\u201d and take a closer look. First, the AI-powered performance isn\u2019t occurring on the device itself, Hoffman says. That process occurs on an external \u201cdata center\u201d your laptop communicates with. Technology is working toward a self-operating AI laptop, which requires NPUs (neural processing unit) and \u201csoon\u201d every PC will have one. Hoffman concludes the better option would be to get a laptop with a powerful GPU (graphics processing unit).  "
