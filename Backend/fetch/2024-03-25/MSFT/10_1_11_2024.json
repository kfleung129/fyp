    "text": "Microsoft\u2019s\u00a0AI investments have helped it surpass long-time rival\u00a0Apple as the world\u2019s most valuable company. Shares in the software company climbed early Thursday (Jan. 11) to bring its market value to\u00a0$2.87 trillion, ahead of that of Apple, the Financial Times (FT) reported. As the morning progressed, the two companies jumped back and forth between the number one and two spots several times, the report said. Microsoft has benefitted from investor enthusiasm in the rise of generative artificial intelligence (AI) technology in the wake of the rising popularity of AI chatbot ChatGPT. Microsoft is the\u00a0largest backer\u00a0of\u00a0OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT. The FT report argued that Apple \u2014 Microsoft\u2019s rival since the rise of personal computers in the 1980s \u2014 has been largely left out of the AI craze (or, taking a quieter approach, as PYMNTS argued last summer). The company is also dealing with slowing iPhone sales \u2014 especially in China \u2014 leading its stock to be\u00a0downgraded\u00a0by analysts earlier this year. Meanwhile, PYMNTS on Thursday examined the potential of OpenAI\u2019s new ChatGPT store\u2019s potential as a\u00a0monetization strategy. The store, which debuted Wednesday (Jan. 10) offers a low-to-no-code platform for users to create customized AI-powered chatbots. The company said in a blog post that its users have already built more than 3 million custom versions of ChatGPT. A major element of the GPT store, similar to Apple\u2019s App Store, is the \u201cleaderboard\u201d it will use to showcase the most popular and most-used GPTs. \u201cAlready, the AI developer is featuring GPTs that include personalized hiking trail recommendations from AllTrails, the ability to surface results from 200 million academic papers via Consensus, a way to design presentations and social posts from Canva, and more,\u201d the report said. As PYMNTS CEO Karen Webster has written, for an\u00a0app store to take off, it needs the same thing Apple and Google needed with their app stores 16 years ago: a critical mass of developers and users. \u201cOpenAI claims to have a lot of both, with 100 million weekly users after only its first year and hundreds (if not thousands) of developers using GPT and its derivatives to create new apps that would ultimately live in a GPT app store,\u201d PYMNTS wrote. We\u2019re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors. "
