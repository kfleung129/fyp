Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. With that in mind, the ROCE of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) looks great, so lets see what the trend can tell us. If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Microsoft is: Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities) 0.29 = US$101b \u00f7 (US$471b - US$121b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023). Therefore, Microsoft has an ROCE of 29%. That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 7.6% earned by companies in a similar industry.
