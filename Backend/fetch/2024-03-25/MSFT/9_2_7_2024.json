Microsoft will return to the Super Bowl with a 60-second spot focused on the everyday use cases of artificial intelligence, from illustrating a story to writing code for a game. Called Watch Me, the spot features a series of \u201ceveryday people\u201d who use Microsoft\u2019s Copilot to help them learn a topic or build their business. The spot will serve as a broad launch platform for Copilot, the AI chatbot that first launched as Bing Chat in February 2023 and has since been integrated across Microsoft\u2019s suite of products. Built with OpenAI\u2019s latest GPT-4 and DALL-E 3 large language models, Copilot offers consumers and businesses a variety of text and image generation tools. Created by Panay Films, the ad has been designed to tap into growing curiosity among consumers about how AI can transform everyday tasks, Microsoft chief brand officer Kathleen Hall told Campaign US. The technology giant had been conducting \u201ca ton of social listening and mapping\u201d on consumer sentiment towards AI last year and decided \u201cwe want to make a statement in this field.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve seen this movement from fear to curiosity \u2014 there\u2019s been a pretty marked shift from \u2018Oh, what\u2019s this scary thing called AI?\u2019 to \u2018Hey, I\u2019m seeing more and more of this, I\u2019m starting to wonder what I could do with it or how I could use it,\u2019\u201d she said. Through its work tracking social conversations, Microsoft identified a cohort of the population \u2014 \u201cabout 20%\u201d of those online, Hall said \u2014 who are \u201cleaned in, tech adept and excited and positive about what AI may do.\u201d These are people who see AI as a vehicle for improvement and learning. Microsoft calls them \u201cAI optimists.\u201d The Super Bowl spot and surrounding digital activations are targeted at these \u201cAI optimists\u201d; Microsoft is not looking to convert consumers who are convinced AI is a negative force. \u201cIt\u2019s to show there\u2019s a ton of really useful goodness that can happen that isn\u2019t threatening or scary or worrisome at all,\u201d said Hall. Copilot was used to generate the goals featured within the ad: the chatbot was asked what people\u2019s hopes and dreams are and responded with themes like \u201cstart my own business,\u201d \u201cget my degree\u201d and \u201cwrite my story.\u201d Microsoft was a last-minute entrant to the Super Bowl this year. It decided on the theme of its spot in November and bought the last 60-second spot available in CBS\u2019 broadcast in early December, Hall said. Navigating production around the holidays was a challenge. \u201cIt\u2019s been quite a sprint,\u201d she said. Thead will air during fourth quarter of the game. While some major brands have told Campaign US they managed to negotiate CBS down from the roughly $7 million per 30-seconds of ad time the broadcaster was charging for the Big Game, Microsoft wasn\u2019t in a position to haggle. \u201cWhat happens when you\u2019re late is that you don\u2019t have a lot of negotiating power, so I would not say we got a bargain. But based on our analysis, it's worth the investment,\u201d said Hall. She said there are \u201cvery few, if any\u201d opportunities for marketers to gain immediate reach at such a scale as the Super Bowl. \u201cThere used to be more opportunities for communal experience of messaging \u2014 the final episode of\u00a0Mash\u00a0or\u00a0Seinfeld\u00a0\u2014 and that gave marketers an opportunity for really broad exposure really quickly,\u201d Hall said. \u201cThere aren\u2019t many left; football is one of them. So, if you\u2019re looking to change perceptions, and reach a mass audience with immediacy, it\u2019s the thing to do.\u201d This is Microsoft\u2019s fifth Super Bowl spot; it first entered the Big Game a decade ago with an\u00a0ad\u00a0showing how its software products can \u201cempower\u201d humans by transforming medicine, education and everyday life \u2014 a theme the brand continues to adopt today. The brand also ran ads in the 2015, 2019 and 2020 game. Its\u00a02019 spot\u00a0focused on the Xbox Adaptive Controller, designed for gamers with disabilities. This year\u2019s Super Bowl spot will be supported by search ads across Bing and Google, YouTube ads and paid, organic and influencer ads across TikTok, Meta and X. Dentsu\u2019s Carat was responsible for media buying and planning. Despite the continuous stream of negative headlines about the safety of Elon Musk\u2019s X as a platform for consumers and advertisers, Hall said \u201cwe have had no issues with X.\u201d \u201cWe are super diligent in reviewing brand safety and brand safety measures,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re very satisfied with the boundaries that they have in place as it relates to brands.\u201d She said the \u201cimmediacy of the conversation\u201d that happens on X around major events is what continues to attract Microsoft to the platform, an element that competitors like Threads have struggled to replicate. The Super Bowl spot will eventually be translated into 30 markets to form a global campaign marketing Copilot that will run throughout the year.
