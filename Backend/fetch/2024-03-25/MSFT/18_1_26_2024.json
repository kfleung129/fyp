Investors hope a mix of robust US economic data, cost-cutting, and AI optimism will mean upbeat results from these tech titans. (AI Video Summary) In the upcoming week starting 29 January, there are some important things happening that could affect the global economy. This will include finding out how the economy is doing in France and the eurozone, how people are feeling about the economy in Europe, and how many jobs are available and how confident consumers are in the US. We'll also see how things are going in China, Australia, and Germany. On top of that, there will be reports about how many private jobs were added in the US, how much crude oil is stored, and whether or not they're changing the interest rate. The eurozone will also share information about how much things cost, and the Bank of England will let us know if they're changing their interest rate. There will also be lots of companies sharing how they're doing financially. Some famous ones include Philips, Ryanair, Diageo, Pfizer, General Motors, Advanced Micro Devices, Microsoft, Alphabet, UPS, H&M, GSK, Novartis, Boeing, Qualcomm, Shell, BT, Deutsche Bank, Apple, Peloton, Meta Platforms, Amazon, Chevron, and ExxonMobil. These reports will give us a better idea about how these companies are doing and could affect how people feel about the stock market. Right now, the stock market is doing pretty well and keeps reaching new record highs. Even though Intel and Tesla didn't do as well as expected, it hasn't really changed how people feel about the overall market. It seems like how each individual company is doing isn't really affecting the whole market very much, and people are feeling cautiously optimistic. Looking ahead to the earnings reports, Amazon is expected to have good news because their stock has done well and people keep buying it even if the price goes down. But they'll need to give us good news about the future to keep everyone happy. All in all, it's going to be an interesting week with lots of important news that could change how people feel about the economy and the stock market.
