The survey surfaces some surprising information about the state of Active Directory disaster recovery preparedness today. Microsoft has released a new device readiness test feature for its Windows Update for Business deployment service. This release allows organizations to evaluate their devices\u2019 eligibility for Windows quality updates before the actual deployment process. The Windows Update for Business deployment service allows administrators to approve, schedule, and monitor updates delivered to managed devices through Windows Updates. The cloud-based service works seamlessly with existing Windows Update for Business reports and policies. It helps to ensure that problematic updates are not delivered to devices that could lead to downtime and productivity loss. Microsoft added a new expedite capability to Windows Update for Business in December 2022. This feature enables organizations to speed up the delivery of monthly patches that are considered critical. For example, IT administrators can prioritize the patching of security vulnerabilities that are deemed a high priority for their organization. The expedited updates capability only applies to Windows 11 and Windows 10 security patches. However, commercial customers will require an E3 or E5 license to use the expedited quality updates feature in Microsoft Intune. Previously, the Windows Update for Business deployment service only allowed administrators to receive post-deployment report summaries for devices that could not be expedited. However, the new feature now provides additional information on whether a Windows device can install a patch without deploying it first. It should help customers respond quickly to potential security threats or vulnerabilities. \u201cUnlike the actual deployment, the new device readiness test doesn\u2019t deliver content to the devices. Instead, it scans each device and generates alerts if any prerequisites are missing. Once you resolve these alerts successfully, you\u2019ll have confidence that the deployment process will be smooth, with minimal disruptions,\u201d Microsoft explained. Microsoft notes that the new device readiness test feature is available through Microsoft Graph. This feature is designed to assist administrators in identifying Windows devices that qualify for expedited updates. Administrators can review the alerts to detect ineligible devices, and the report also provides remediation steps that should help resolve any issues.
