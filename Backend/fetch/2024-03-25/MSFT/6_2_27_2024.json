    "text": "Microsoft\u2019s approximately $16.3 million investment in startup Mistral AI has attracted the attention of the European Union (EU) antitrust watchdog. As part of this strategic partnership, the latest AI models of the French developer will be available to customers of the Microsoft Azure cloud platform.  Image source: Mistral AI A distinctive feature of Mistral AI\u2019s AI models is that they are publicly available, unlike similar OpenAI algorithmic models used to create smart chatbots and other AI services. According to the terms of the deal, Microsoft\u2019s investment will be converted into an equity stake in the startup during the next round of financing. Microsoft\u2019s long-term partnership with California startup OpenAI, valued at approximately $13 billion, is also under scrutiny from UK and EU regulators. A European Commission spokesman said Tuesday that the agency will review Microsoft\u2019s investment in Mistral AI after receiving a copy of the agreement. This process could result in an official investigation that could hinder Microsoft\u2019s plans. The analysis shows that the close attention of regulators to the activities of technology giants in the field of AI is becoming increasingly relevant. Investments in Mistral AI and partnership with OpenAI open new horizons for Microsoft in the field of cloud technologies and AI, but also expose the corporation to additional control from antitrust authorities.
