SureImpact Inc., launched in 2018, is an imaginative leader in data-driven distinction and impact. The company is devoted to transforming the social sector through ground-breaking data solutions and empowering organizations in the nonprofit, social enterprise, government, and foundation sectors with unmatched data-driven insights.

With an unwavering pledge to excellence and impact, SureImpact is logging new possibilities in the social sector, transforming communities, and shaping a future where data is employed for the world's greater good. The company will soon be featured in the app marketplace for nonprofit cloud customers as an independent service vendor within Microsoft's new offering, solely tailored for nonprofits. This dynamic collaboration is set to enable global sales of their impactful software, emphasizing why founder and CEO of SureImpact, Sheri Chaney Jones, describes the affiliation as a \"channel partnership.\" Jones stated on the move, \"This partnership with Microsoft marks a significant milestone in our journey. It allows us to extend our reach globally and helps nonprofits around the world to optimize their impact through data-driven decisions.\" At this time, SureImpact's software collectively serves more than 200,000 clients, as 439 organizations have adopted it.
