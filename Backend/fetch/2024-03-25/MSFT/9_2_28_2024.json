    "text": "MORE Representative Image (IANS) WASHINGTON: Microsoft announced an artificial intelligence partnership Monday with the French startup Mistral AI that could lessen the software giant\u2019s reliance on ChatGPT-maker OpenAI for supplying the next wave of chatbots and other generative AI products. Mistral AI emerged less than a year ago but is already what Microsoft described Monday as an \u201cinnovator and trailblazer\u201d at the vanguard of building more efficient and cost-effective AI systems. Microsoft and Mistral didn\u2019t disclose the financial terms of the deal, though Microsoft said it involves a small investment in the Paris-based startup. That suggests it is far smaller than Microsoft\u2019s investment of billions of dollars into OpenAI, a years-long relationship that has attracted the scrutiny of antitrust regulators in the U.S. and Europe. Mistral on Monday released a public test version of its own chatbot, called Le Chat, that apparently was flooded with so much interest that a company executive said it was temporarily unavailable for part of the day. The company also announced its newest large language model, Mistral Large, which it claims is in the same league as competitors such as OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4, Anthropic\u2019s Claude 2 and Google\u2019s Gemini Pro and will be available on Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud computing platform. Mistral has also previously said it is teaming up with other big cloud providers including Amazon and Google. Mistral made a big splash by attracting big amounts of investor funding to give it a multibillion-dollar valuation just months after it was founded last spring. It was started by three French former researchers from Google and Meta: CEO Arthur Mensch, Chief Scientist Guillaume Lample and Chief Technology Officer Timothee Lacroix. It has advertised an \u201copen-source\u201d approach to developing AI that involves publicly releasing key components of some AI systems, in contrast to companies such as OpenAI that closely guard them. But Mistral Large, the new flagship model, won\u2019t be open, according to the company\u2019s website. Mistral didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment Monday. When the European Union last fall was drafting the final version of its Artificial Intelligence Act, a comprehensive set of AI regulations, Mistral pushed back against efforts to impose restrictions on foundation models that power generative AI systems. Mensch took to social media to say the EU\u2019s proposals for a two-tier system would discourage innovative newcomers.  \u00a9 Copyright  | Powered by Hocalwire "
