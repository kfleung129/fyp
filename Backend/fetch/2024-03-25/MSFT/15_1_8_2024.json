    "text": "Countdown to Luke Lango\u2019s \u201c2nd Trillion-Dollar A.I. Trade\u201d The U.S. govt just unlocked an $8 trillion market to move in a new direction. See how it could unleash 6,000% potential upside. These Magnificant 7 stocks have strong positive catalysts and attractive valuations Advertisement Source: Shutterstock When it comes to investing in equities, buying stocks that are benefiting a great deal from current trends and those poised for a significant lift from future trends is a very good approach to take. After all, as we saw from the performances of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) during last year\u2019s artificial intelligence (AI) boom, company stocks that exploited trends could rally tremendously. Another important factor when it comes to choosing the best stocks to buy is valuation. Specifically, stocks with very high valuations relative to their growth can often plunge a great deal if their issuing companies miss the Street\u2019s expectations by even small amounts. Given these points, when choosing the three best Magnificent 7 stocks to buy, I selected those benefiting from strong current trends and without very high valuations. Microsoft is getting a huge boost from the AI boom. That\u2019s because MSFT is the largest investor in the popular AI-powered chatbot, ChatGPT, while the software giant is infusing AI into its operating system. Moreover, as the owner of the second-largest cloud infrastructure provider, Azure, MSFT will be able to sell many AI-powered services to its current customers. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) recently named MSFT one of its top three software picks. Citing \u201cthe newest AI wave, improving IT spending and the continued shift to the Cloud,\u201d the bank is generally bullish on the software sector. What\u2019s more, Bank of America expects the strong demand for AI to accelerate the growth of Azure and MSFT Office offerings. Also upbeat on MSFT stock recently was Dan Ives, the well-known analyst at investment bank Wedbush. Ives named MSFT as one of his top nine picks in the tech sector. MSFT stock has a reasonably attractive forward price-earnings ratio of 33. Amazon\u2019s (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS is the largest cloud infrastructure provider. As a result, AWS should get a huge boost from selling AI services. As I noted in a Dec. 6 column, the tech giant \u201cunveiled many new, AI-oriented services it\u2019s going to sell,\u201d including an \u201cAI assistant\u2026and a new AI chip.\u201d I believe the growth of Amazon\u2019s e-commerce business will also accelerate as AI makes the experience even better and Amazon takes steps to deliver products even faster. To a lesser extent, the company should benefit from an acceleration of ad spending this year as \u201cAd spending growth is widely forecast to accelerate in 2024,\u201d Forbes reported last month. Spending on \u201cretail media\u201d ads, a sector in which AMZN is a \u201cdominant\u201d player, is expected to jump almost 23% this year, the website reported. Amazon is expected to generate over $3 billion of ad revenue just from its decision to start placing ads on its Prime Video content. Meanwhile, I remain convinced that, over the longer term, pharmaceuticals will prove to be a needle mover for AMZN stock. Amazon\u2019s forward price-earnings ratio of 37 is elevated but more than justified by the company\u2019s many powerful growth catalysts. As a result, I view AMZN as the best name among the Magnificent 7 stocks. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) has a relatively small but rapidly growing cloud-infrastructure business, Google Cloud, that should get a big boost from selling AI services. Moreover, AI should significantly improve the company\u2019s core search business and will likely spur an acceleration in the growth of its search revenue. Indeed, according to Forbes, \u201cDeploying generative AI search experiences opens the door for different ad formats and placements, as well as an increase in surfaced links and content. AI can also drive help revenues higher from bid optimization.\u201d Also noteworthy is that GOOG released its own AI-powered chatbot called Bard, which should greatly enhance its search services and generate a significant amount of revenue for the company. Finally, the revenue of GOOG\u2019s YouTube business jumped 12.5% in Q3. As a result, I believe the stock will get a meaningful boost from the app\u2019s rapid growth going forward. GOOG has a very attractive forward price-earnings ratio of 20.6 times.
