    "text": "Countdown to Luke Lango\u2019s \u201c2nd Trillion-Dollar A.I. Trade\u201d The U.S. govt just unlocked an $8 trillion market to move in a new direction. See how it could unleash 6,000% potential upside. These tech stocks are running into quarterly earnings over the coming weeks Advertisement Source: whiteMocca / Shutterstock It\u2019s that time of year again: big-tech earnings season. With a fairly robust start to 2024, the tech behemoths may need to pull a surprising earnings beat out of a hat to get Mr. Market to nudge their share prices higher from current levels. Indeed, many analysts have mixed feelings about the three Magnificent Seven tech titans going into earnings. Sure, valuations seem a tad too extended as we enter earnings season. But if there are firms that can pole-vault past estimates and deliver positive surprises, it has to be members of the Magnificent Seven cohort. With earnings on tap for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) over the coming weeks, investors may be wondering which, if any, is worth pursuing ahead of their respective quarterly reveals. On the other hand, is it a better idea to wait until after the tech stocks share their earnings, given the stakes are higher after the market\u2019s recent gains? Let\u2019s find out. Apple started the year with a handful of analyst downgrades that weighed down its share price after a turbulent finish to 2023. Many unenthused analysts don\u2019t expect much from the firm this year as iPhone sales continue to be underwhelming. Indeed, Apple remains a Magnificent Seven firm that\u2019s continued to put up the returns, with more than 40% in gains over the past year. That said, it\u2019s been outshined by many of its Magnificent Seven peers on the front of recent returns. And questions linger as to what could help iPhone 15 (and its coming iPhone 16) sales kick up a notch. Perhaps recent discounts in China could help boost iPhone 15 demand in an ultra-competitive market (Huawei is the force over in China) that\u2019s faced more than its fair share of economic headwinds. In any case, don\u2019t count on such efforts to impact the quarterly numbers due to be released in just over a week. With earnings ahead, I wouldn\u2019t chase AAPL stock after its latest jump back to $193 and change. Though expectations are now relatively modest, I think it will take more than just better-than-expected numbers to move the needle higher. Perhaps some AI commentary could do the job? In recent sessions, Apple stock seems to be ascending again over hopes for some artificial intelligence (AI) announcement. Amazon\u2019s momentum could continue through the year as it continues trimming its workforce in a bid to shore up financial firepower while also investing heavily in its generative AI projects. Over the past 12 months, shares of AMZN are up around 58%, a solid gain, even for a Magnificent Seven member. Though shares are still off nearly 16% from their all-time highs, I think it\u2019s just a matter of time before new heights are reached as Amazon looks to gain the cloud with a bit of help from new AI tech. Additionally, hopes for a healthier consumer could help jolt the e-commerce business, which has taken a backseat to Amazon\u2019s other initiatives of late. With layoffs sweeping through various Amazon subsidiaries (Twitch recently shed 35% of its staff), it certainly seems like the company is pushing to bolster profitability in this higher-rate environment. Even as rates come down again, I\u2019d look for Amazon to be more deliberate in how it spends money on growth projects moving forward. Perhaps AI could receive more love than Amazon subsidiaries, like Twitch, that aren\u2019t really helping Amazon pay the bills. All considered, I think Amazon has what it takes to impress for its coming quarter. However, I\u2019d prefer waiting for a pullback, which may just happen post-earnings. I\u2019m sure dip-buyers will be ready to pounce quickly. Microsoft stock is close to fresh new all-time highs, with shares just a few bucks below the $400 per-share mark. Going into earnings, expectations are going to be quite high. That\u2019s to be expected for a firm that\u2019s up more than 64% over the past year. With shares trading at 38.4 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E), you\u2019re going to be paying a hefty historical premium to play the tech titan ahead of earnings. Though Microsoft\u2019s AI will pay more of the firm\u2019s bills over time, I\u2019m not so sure this past quarter is the one that will have AI written all over it. Microsoft Copilot still has a long way to go as it works its way into our favorite Microsoft software. In any case, the expensive AI gem could easily stand to become even more expensive after earnings. If you\u2019re worried about MSFT stock getting away from you after posting its numbers, perhaps it makes sense to buy half a stake before and the other half after earnings. With the recent launch of the popular Xbox Game Pass title Palworld and the Activision Blizzard integration in full swing, it will be interesting to see what the firm has to say about its gaming ambitions during its conference call.
