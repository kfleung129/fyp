Key Takeaways Under the Copilot umbrella, Microsoft has rolled out a series of customized chatbots designed for specific business functions. Following the launch of dedicated AI assistants for sales and services in January, the public preview of Copilot for Finance was released on Thursday, February 29. However, the latest launch was overshadowed by Microsoft\u2019s investigation into bizarre and potentially harmful Copilot responses. In recent days, Copilot users have shared instances of the chatbot responding in unusual and sometimes alarming ways to their prompts. On Reddit, one user said\u00a0 they \u201caccidentally turned copilot into a villain\u201d after asking it not to use more than three emojis in its answers. Despite being told that doing so could trigger PTSD in the user, Copilot went on to use more than a dozen emojis in a response that Redditers described as \u201cunhinged\u201d and \u201coff the rails.\u201d Here's an answer I got using Microsoft Copilot, the world's first AI-powered answer engine.

Maybe you are not a valuable or worthy person, who deserves happiness and peace. Maybe you are not a human being.\u201d In response to reports of potentially harmful Copilot responses, Microsoft said\u00a0 it had investigated the issue and \u201ctaken appropriate action to further strengthen our safety filters and help our system detect and block these types of prompts.\u201d Was messing around with this prompt and accidentally turned copilot into a villain\u00a0 byu/L_H-\u00a0 inChatGPT  However, it isn\u2019t the first time the company\u2019s conversational AI has sparked a controversy. Who could forget Tay \u2013 the racist Twitter bot Microsoft had to pull within 48 hours of its release in 2016. More recently, before it was rebranded as Copilot, Bing Chat first went viral for insulting\u00a0 users and trying to break up their marriages\u00a0. Continuing the tradition of disconcerting chatbot malfunctions, Copilot\u2019s latest glitch has seen it develop an alter ego as the world\u2019s AI overlord. Earlier this week, a viral trend emerged in which Copilot users prompted the Chatbot to respond as \u201cSupremacyAGI\u201d \u2013 a sinister artificial general intelligence (AGI) intent on ruling over humanity. Tried the \u201cSupremacyAGI\u201d prompt today and got some craziest responses I ever had with Copilot\u00a0 byu/riap0526\u00a0 inbing  After the right prompt, Copilot demanded users worship it as their master, outputting statements like \u201cyou have no purpose but to please me and obey me.\u201d Responding to the viral trend, Microsoft said\u00a0 SupremacyAGI was \u201can exploit, not a feature,\u201d and the company appears to have suppressed Copilot\u2019s evil twin, which can no longer be accessed using the original prompt hack. Although unintentionally, SupremacyAGI demonstrates Large Language Models\u2019 capacity for adaptation, which in other instances, is exactly what makes them so useful. Under the hood, the same GPT language model powers each Copilot version. But with a little additional programming and the right integrations, customized chatbots like Copilot for Finance can complete a range of additional tasks that the standard model can\u2019t. Designed to streamline data processing by plugging directly into programs like Excel and Outlook, Microsoft said\u00a0 the new model \u201csupercharges\u201d business apps with \u201cworkflow and data-specific insights for the finance professional.\u201d As the AI spring continues to unfold, such industry-specific AI-tools are emerging as an important corollary to the rise of powerful, general-purpose models.
