Microsoft Azure Marketplace https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/000-000.mistral-ai-large-offer \u25c6Text about open source community disappears from Mistral AI top page The top page of Mistral AI's official website states that until February 25, 2024, the day before announcing the partnership with Microsoft, ``We believe in the power of the open source community'' and ``We will continue to make machine learning models and various tools available under permissive licenses.'' It included phrases such as ``Publish,'' and ``We benefit from and give back to the open source community.''  However, on February 26, 2024, when the partnership with Microsoft was announced, the wording was removed from the top page. In response to this, speculation is spreading on the Internet that Mistral AI will stop contributing to the open source community and focus on closed source products.
