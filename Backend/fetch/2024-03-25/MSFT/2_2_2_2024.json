Concerns are growing over the role of Big Tech companies in moderating \u201cmisinformation,\u201d particularly due to the fear that these corporations already wield significant power and influence which could potentially sway political outcomes, including elections. Many worry that the concentrated power in these tech giants allows them to arbitrarily define what constitutes misinformation, leading to a situation where they could suppress certain viewpoints or information. This raises questions about the impartiality and fairness of such moderation, especially in the context of political discourse and the democratic process. The debate is fueled by the concern that these companies, due to their size and reach, could have a disproportionate impact on public opinion and electoral processes. In an AI-focused interview with Microsoft CEO, Satya Nadella, it was revealed that Microsoft intends to combat alleged \u201cdisinformation\u201d throughout the 2024 elections. During his conversation with NBC\u2019s Lester Holt on NBC Nightly News\u2019 January 30 edition, Nadella was questioned about how AI might either assist or endanger the future election. However, Nadella\u2019s response seemed to imply a willingness to use technology for censoring content in pursuit of fighting what he identified as disinformation. Nadella stated, \u201cThis is not the first election where we dealt with disinformation or propaganda campaigns by adversaries and election interference. \u201cWe\u2019re doing all the work across the tech industry around watermarking, detecting deep fakes and content IDs. There is going to be enough and more technology quite frankly in order to be able to identify the issues around disinformation and misinformation.\u201d If you're tired of censorship and dystopian threats against civil liberties, subscribe to Reclaim The Net.
