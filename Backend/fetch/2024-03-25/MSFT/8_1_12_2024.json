Microsoft claimed the title of the world\u2019s most valuable company on Thursday, seizing the lead from Apple, which faced a challenging start to 2024 amid concerns over demand. Redmond-based Microsoft\u2019s shares surged by 1.5%, securing a market valuation of $2.888 trillion. This ascent was propelled by Microsoft\u2019s early success in capitalizing on generative artificial intelligence, attracting eager investors. In contrast, Cupertino\u2019s Apple experienced a 0.3% dip, resulting in a market capitalization of $2.887 trillion, marking the first time since 2021 that Apple\u2019s valuation fell below Microsoft\u2019s. Apple\u2019s stock woes, down 3.3% in January, stem from rating downgrades and apprehensions about iPhone sales, particularly in China, where competition with Huawei and geopolitical tensions pose challenges. CES 2024\u2019s second day brought a wave of tech announcements. Google, under the theme \u201cBetter Together,\u201d partnered with Samsung to streamline Android inter-device communication. Honda unveiled futuristic EV concepts\u2014the sleek Saloon and innovative Space Hub. Hyundai\u2019s updated S-A2 Air Taxi promises efficient urban transport. In smart homes, Amazon embraced the Matter standard, and AI-powered innovations like the Clicks iPhone keyboard case and Rabbit R1 assistant stood out. Accessibility took center stage with products like the OrCam Hear system and GyroGlove for hand tremors. CES 2024 marks a positive shift towards meaningful advancements in assistive technology, diverging from industry norms. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman engaged in discussions about the risks associated with artificial intelligence with Republican U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson on Capitol Hill. The meeting addressed the pressing need for AI regulation, particularly as the Biden administration seeks legislative action. The polarized US Congress, with Republican control in the House and Democrats holding a Senate majority, faces challenges in passing effective regulations. AI\u2019s rapid ascent has raised concerns, including its potential to disrupt democratic processes, escalate fraud, and contribute to job displacement. Notably, Europe is leading the way in AI regulation, with lawmakers actively drafting rules to address these concerns.
