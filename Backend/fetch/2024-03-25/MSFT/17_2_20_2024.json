    "text": "FABRICE COFFRINI/AFP via Getty Images Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is working on developing a networking card in another effort to reduce its reliance on Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), The Information reported, citing a person with direct knowledge of the plans. The new networking equipment could have a two-pronged effect: saving Microsoft money and improving the performance of Nvidia's chip servers, the news outlet reported. The effort is being led by Juniper Networks (JNPR) co-founder Pradeep Sindhu after Microsoft acquired Sindhu's server chip startup Fungible last year. Microsoft and Nvidia did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Seeking Alpha. The Microsoft offering is said to be similar to Nvidia's ConnectX-7 card, the person said. The ConnectX-7 card has helped put Nvidia on pace to generate more than $10B in networking-related revenue this year. It could also benefit Microsoft-backed OpenAI, which uses Microsoft's servers to train and aid its artificial intelligence models. OpenAI is the creator of the popular ChatGPT generative AI chatbot. If Microsoft is successful with its networking chip, it would not be the first time it has tried to reduce its reliance on Nvidia. In November, Microsoft announced its own server chip aimed at AI workloads, the Maia 100, at its Ignite conference. Microsoft is still widely believed to be one of Nvidia's largest customers for GPUs for data centers. Nvidia commands roughly 90% of the AI accelerator market, according to January findings from Wccftech. Microsoft shares fell 0.8% while Nvidia dropped 5.8% in late morning trading. "
