Microsoft\u2019s shares have climbed 7% in the past three weeks to hit $404.5 on Wednesday, pushing the company\u2019s valuation to $3.004 trillion. The stock has since dipped slightly to $402.5, and the valuation has dropped just below $3 trillion. Apple was the first company to\u00a0hit\u00a0this milestone in June last year. The landmark achievement caps what has been one of Microsoft\u2019s best years. The company\u2019s bet on AI has pushed its stock to new heights as investors continue to bet on the technology. For a brief time,\u00a0Microsoft eclipsed\u00a0Apple to become the world\u2019s most valuable company, but the iPhone maker has reclaimed its spot, although the gap between the two is getting smaller. Microsoft is scheduled to announce its fourth-quarter earnings on Tuesday, January 30, and if it beats Wall Street\u2019s estimates, it could retake the top spot from\u00a0Apple. Microsoft\u2019s achievement\u00a0is no mean feat. A decade ago, the Redmond-based software giant was losing its edge, and its stock had taken a beating. Its foray into the mobile world had been disastrous as iOS and\u00a0Android\u00a0outmuscled its\u00a0Windows system. Its cloud business was facing intense competition from Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and other newcomers. Satya Nadella\u2019s appointment as CEO was the catalyst that sparked a change of fortunes for the company. His acquisitions, including LinkedIn, GitHub, Minecraft maker Mojang Studios, and Xamarin, have all been great successes. However, his bet on AI has been his crowning glory. As far back as nine years ago, Nadella was\u00a0waxing lyrical\u00a0about the power of machine learning and, later on, AI. Today, Microsoft is the most significant player in the technology as the primary investor in ChatGPT maker OpenAI. Its existing solutions also leverage AI, including its Bing search engine and Office suite; it has also launched new products\u00a0like Copilot. Azure has become the cloud computing platform of choice for the AI sector. Companies betting on AI have been the biggest gainers in market cap globally, with Nvidia (NASDAQ: MSFT) joining\u00a0the $1 trillion club\u00a0in June. In order for artificial intelligence (AI) to work right within the law and thrive in the face of growing challenges, it needs to integrate an enterprise blockchain system that ensures data input quality and ownership\u2014allowing it to keep data safe while also guaranteeing the immutability of data.
