On Monday, Phil Spencer, the head of Microsoft\u2019s gaming division, revealed that the company will share its \u201cvision for the future of Xbox\u201d next week. What has brought this about? In January, reports started to emerge that Microsoft was considering porting its excellent first-party title Hi-Fi Rush on to other hardware platforms, with the Nintendo Switch widely named as the recipient. At the time, rumours were also swirling that multiplayer pirate adventure Sea of Thieves may be coming to Switch and PS5. On Sunday, Verge suggested that Microsoft was considering a multiplatform release for the forthcoming Indiana Jones and the Great Circle (below), with a \u201cshort\u201d period of exclusivity on Xbox. A day later, the story widened. News site XboxEra claimed that Microsoft is planning to bring Starfield, its biggest Xbox exclusive of 2023 to PlayStation 5 soon after the game\u2019s expansion pack for Xbox and PC. According to XboxEra, the decision has caused \u201cfierce internal debate\u201d within the Xbox division. So what is Spencer about to announce, and why? The problem he is contending with is that Xbox has become almost unmanageable as a brand. It started as a console, the Xbox, which sold 24m units but failed to make an impact in the Asian market. The Xbox 360 followed in 2005, shifting 85m units, but still falling just behind PS3 on 87m. Then came the Xbox One, which sold a reported 58m units, half of PS4, partially due to an ill-advised attempt to market the console as an all-round media platform while Sony stuck with its \u201cPlayStation is a games machine\u201d motto. Now Xbox is also a software application that runs on PC, phones and some TVs, and it\u2019s a streaming platform that consists of both Game Pass for downloads and the Xbox Cloud Gaming service for playing classic games over the internet. The company also went through an arduous anti-monopoly investigation to complete a vast $68bn purchase of Activision Blizzard, a company whose major series, Call of Duty, must remain multiplatform. Then you have the fact that the Xbox hardware has been consistently outsold by PlayStation machines for more than a decade. The latest figures suggest that the PS5 outsold the Xbox Series X by three to one last year, bolstered by the huge success of Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man 2. Microsoft stopped reporting console sales in 2015, saying it doesn\u2019t consider those numbers to be a key indicator of the brand\u2019s success, due to its other platform manifestations; instead pointing toward Game Pass subscriptions. But since January, it also hasn\u2019t been reporting those numbers, which are believed to stand at around 30-33m worldwide, but may well have plateaued. Microsoft has effectively backed itself into a corner from which no escape route is totally desirable. In many ways, the smart thing would be to combine the business models of Sega, which abandoned console development after the failure of Dreamcast and became a third-party games publisher, and Valve, which stopped being a developer and became a digital platform holder with Steam. In effect, it could abandon the Xbox hardware and concentrate on bringing Microsoft exclusives to other platforms while maintaining the Xbox name for a streaming service accessible via PC, phones and smart devices. But that would leave a lot of extremely unhappy Xbox fans. The worry is that Microsoft will opt for a series of half measures: porting some smaller games to PS5 and Switch, but not all; bringing out a new Xbox machine, but perhaps only as an elite option; trying to get Game Pass on more platforms, while still attempting to ringfence key exclusives. To ask a brutal question: has it ever really mastered the console hardware market in the way Sony and Nintendo have? Is it time to let go? But my goodness, the backlash from the Xbox fanbase would be vast, and that alone may be enough to keep Microsoft\u2019s hand in console manufacturing. Whatever the case, it\u2019s all a bit of a mess and it symbolises the strange, slightly uncomfortable role Xbox has always had in the Microsoft empire. When Xbox gets it right, it really gets it right. The whole Xbox 360 era, with its revolutionary online multiplayer infrastructure; the legacy of Halo, Gears of War, Forza Horizon, Sea of Thieves, Minecraft, Fable; the sheer bargain of Game Pass. Xbox has been a necessary third runner in the console race, putting money into big ideas and pushing the technical agenda. Now we must wait for this announcement regarding, Spencer\u2019s \u201cvision for the future\u201d. And fans of the console will just have to hope it isn\u2019t blurred beyond recognition. Imagine Streets of Rage crossed with the Michael Douglas movie Falling Down and you have Rising Up, a pixel-art brawler about an office worker losing it when the printer malfunctions and going on a destructive equipment smashing rampage. Created by a tiny team led by Erik H J\u00f8rgensen and Laurent Gehin, the art style, tone and simple kick-punch-jump action perfectly recall the classic scrolling beat-em-ups of the late 1980s, and it\u2019s filled with ridiculous comic moments.

Available on: PC/iOSEstimated playtime: One hour I loved this Eurogamer piece about the origins of Die Hard Trilogy and how UK developer Probe set out to make three games in one \u2013 and largely succeeded. But I also like how the article starts as a profile of Simon Pick, developer of 8bit classic Daredevil Dennis. You have to read it to see how they\u2019re connected. Kotaku has a really interesting article on ageism in the games industry, talking to industry veterans about the challenges of staying active in the business when you pass your 30s. \u201cThe difficulty of the work, the low pay, drives even young developers away,\u201d says legendary designer Warren Spector. But to mature as a culture, older voices are definitely needed. And finally, a nice positive piece from Polygon entitled \u201cPalworld is the culmination of every game I\u2019ve ever loved\u201d, a review of the unexpected smash hit, which combines elements of Pok\u00e9mon and online shooters and now has around 19 million players.

Now I think that everyone should play it ; it\u2019s such a joyful, rich and hilarious experience and there is so much to do. From further back, the Ninja Gaiden games were ruthlessly brilliant, Gears of War 2 was enthralling and I loved the digital titles such as Trials and Geometry Wars. Oh and Forza Horizon 4. And Minecraft. Always, always Minecraft. If you\u2019ve got a question for Question Block \u2013 or anything else to say about the newsletter \u2013 email us on pushingbuttons@theguardian.com "
