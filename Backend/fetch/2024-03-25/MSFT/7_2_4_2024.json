    "text": "The Aig-Imoukhuede Foundation, in collaboration with the Office of the Head of the Civil Service of the Federation (OHCSF) and Microsoft, through its implementation partner, Wootlab Foundation, has announced an initiative to enhance the digital skills of civil servants across various Ministries in Nigeria. This is part of a strategic move by the OHCSF to prepare the public sector workforce for the digital era of the Civil Service. Through this partnership, Microsoft is helping lay a foundation for digital transformation in Nigeria, providing government employees with in-demand digital skills for the 21st-century workplace and empowering them to contribute towards the digitisation of important public services. In 2023, the OHCSF, supported by the Aig-Imoukhuede Foundation, implemented an Enterprise Content Management Solution (ECMS) to automate all its work processes in line with the federal government\u2019s e-governance drive. Recognising that the digital readiness of civil servants is a key driver of the success and sustainability of the ECMS, the Foundation partnered with Microsoft to develop a digital upskilling programme for civil servants. This programme will equip participating civil servants with essential digital skills, fostering a workforce that is not only digitally competent but also capable of driving continued innovation within the Civil Service. The official commencement of the digital upskilling programme was marked by a Memorandum of Understanding signing ceremony at the Federal Secretariat, OHCSF, in Abuja. Advertisement  "
