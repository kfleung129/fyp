A new SAP on Microsoft Azure video has been added below. This content was written to highlight a particular event or moment in time. Although that moment has passed, we\u2019re republishing it here so you can see what our thinking and experience was like at the time.] Microsoft is heavily invested in SAP applications\u2014it uses them extensively to run finance, human resources, global trade, supply chain, and other parts of its $168.1 billion global business. That\u2019s why it was a big deal when Microsoft moved its SAP workload to the cloud and Microsoft Azure. Moving to the cloud saved us money, but this was really about becoming more agile and innovative. \u2014Krassimir Karamfilov, general manager, Microsoft SAP program, Microsoft Digital In early 2018, the company finished moving its entire SAP landscape\u2014an estimated 50 terabytes\u2014to Microsoft Azure. It was at that time, when the last, most important systems were moved over one busy weekend, that the company was able to seize on a new opportunity. \u201cMoving to the cloud saved us money, but this was really about becoming more agile and innovative,\u201d says Krassimir Karamfilov, general manager of the Microsoft SAP program in Microsoft Digital. \u201cThis allowed our teams to stop worrying about keeping our infrastructure up and running and to focus on innovating without a lot of heartburn. They can now run experiments, learn, and then use those learnings to take us in new directions\u2014and if an experiment doesn\u2019t work? They can easily shut it down and move on to something else.\u201d Moving from on-premises to Microsoft Azure slashed the Microsoft SAP budget by 20 percent to 25 percent, cost savings that came from fine-tuning usage, snoozing systems at night and on weekends, and by leaving behind old processes that weren\u2019t needed anymore. \u201cWe\u2019re 100 percent in the cloud, and since Azure is the trusted cloud provider, our entire SAP landscape is now more secure than ever,\u201d says Karamfilov, explaining that the employees who manage the company\u2019s SAP in many instances were given new tools to work with. \u201cThe shift to the cloud enabled us to start using machine learning and artificial intelligence to look at the data underneath our entire landscape, and to start learning from that.\u201d Reutter answers questions about the company\u2019s SAP on Microsoft Azure migration and lessons learned along the way. At the time, the move to the cloud represented how committed Microsoft was and still is to its partnership with SAP, Karamfilov says. Officially and publicly, SAP has adopted a \u201cmulti-cloud strategy\u201d where it supports all hyperscale cloud providers to enable customers to use their preferred cloud. Also at the time, SAP announced it had selected Microsoft Azure to run many of its internal mission-critical SAP business systems (since then SAP has moved a lot of those internal systems to the cloud on Microsoft Azure).

Find out how Microsoft is optimizing SAP for Microsoft Azure.] Making the move to Azure Looking back at how Microsoft moved its SAP workload to the cloud, the Microsoft SAP team had been thinking about making the move since 2013, but it was only in 2017 that Azure added virtual machine SKUs big enough to handle a Microsoft-sized SAP ERP system, says Hans Reutter, the Microsoft Digital engineering manager who led the cloud migration. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just the size, it was the complexity,\u201d Reutter says, giving the example of several independent enterprise-scale purchasing processes needing to come together seamlessly at the point of purchase so the customer has a good buying experience. \u201cAll of these production landscapes were highly dependent on each other because of the traffic that flows back and forth between them.\u201d We started with the low-risk stuff\u2014the low-hanging fruit. First we moved the sandbox systems because we knew that there wouldn\u2019t be any impact on our customers if something went wrong. \u2014Hans Reutter, group engineering manager, Microsoft Digital Microsoft Azure developed the M-Series specifically to address the enterprise market demand for larger virtual machines capable of running SAP landscapes at companies just like Microsoft. \u201cWe just happened to be one of the enterprises waiting for the M-Series,\u201d Reutter says. \u201cIt was exactly what we needed to make our move to the cloud.\u201d With Azure\u2019s M64 and M128 SKUs in hand, Reutter\u2019s team migrated the company\u2019s largest and most complex SAP systems to Azure over one weekend (the team used smaller virtual machines to move most of the Microsoft landscape over the prior year). To understand how they did it, Reutter says think horizontally and vertically. \u201cWe started with the low-risk stuff\u2014the low-hanging fruit,\u201d Reutter says. \u201cFirst, we moved the sandbox systems because we knew that there wouldn\u2019t be any impact on our customers if something went wrong.\u201d That was the base layer. Next came the next least important layer, and the next, and the next. The team worked up layer by layer until it eventually got to the most important production systems. That was the horizontal approach. \u201cIf we missed anything, we found out really quickly\u2014before we got to the really important systems,\u201d Reutter says. The team wrote migration scripts, found landmines, and worked out kinks while working in the base layers, which allowed it to get everything down pat by the time things got serious. Now to the vertical. The team also used an end-to-end vertical strategy, migrating a few systems\u2014from development all the way to production\u2014all at once. \u201cWe tested the whole stack to make sure there were no gaps or surprises,\u201d Reutter says. \u201cThis vertical strategy allowed the team to accelerate learning and getting a jump on production processes.\u201d By getting it right in both dimensions, they were able to migrate the mission critical systems seamlessly. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to move some small stuff,\u201d Reutter says. \u201cYou want to make sure the crown jewels land in a safe spot.\u201d And while the migration wasn\u2019t without bumps, it went smoothly and the crown jewels were kept safe. Getting it right at home Juergen Thomas hears it all the time. If a customer is considering moving his or her SAP systems to Microsoft Azure, they always ask the same question. The ask? \u201cDoes Microsoft run its landscape in Azure?\u201d Thomas, a partner architect who manages a team in Microsoft Azure that helps SAP customers move to the cloud, was happy when he could start answering with a resounding \u201cyes,\u201d and even more importantly, that he also then had a good answer to their inevitable second question, which is \u201chow did you do it?\u201d It\u2019s proof that the Microsoft Azure platform can carry and sustain such a complex SAP platform on our Azure infrastructure. We talk about it in customer briefings and conferences\u2014it is our poster child. Running our own backend business processes with SAP in Azure is a main differentiator between us and our competitors who don\u2019t run SAP at all, or not in their own clouds. \u2014Juergen Thomas, partner architect, Microsoft Azure \u201cThen they immediately want to get into the details, which is a good thing,\u201d Thomas says. \u201cIt was very important to be able to say that Microsoft is leading again and is ahead of the mass of companies.\u201d Thomas says the story of moving the Microsoft ERP systems to the cloud has become a key showcase for the Microsoft Azure team because it shows Microsoft Azure can handle the biggest and most complicated SAP instances. \u201cIt\u2019s proof that the Microsoft Azure platform can carry and sustain such a complex SAP platform on our Azure infrastructure,\u201d he says. \u201cWe talk about it in customer briefings and conferences\u2014it is our poster child.
