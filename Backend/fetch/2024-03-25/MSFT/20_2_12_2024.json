    "text": "Microsoft has now officially announced an upcoming Xbox business update event for later this week. After getting a good look at some upcoming big-time game releases for the platform, not the least of which was the first gameplay footage for the new Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Microsoft is turning its attention to the big picture this Thursday. Many are expecting to hear about the company\u2019s vision for the future of Xbox moving forward and, more specifically, about rumors involving Xbox exclusives landing on the other two major platforms. More details below. This week\u2019s event will come in the form of an \u201cofficial Xbox Podcast\u201d\u00a0and is scheduled to feature \u201cPhil Spencer, Sarah Bond and Matt Booty as they\u00a0share updates on the Xbox business.\u201d Specific details on what will be on the slate for this discussion are relatively thin at this point. But with recent rumors all over the place for the past few weeks regarding Microsoft exclusives games coming to Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 5, it would appear many folks think this will, at least, be apart of the discussion. It is important to note that Microsoft has yet to give any specifics or really any confirmation on its titles landing on consoles from the direct competition at this point. But there have been more than few reasons to think this might be the case. Reports surfaced recently showing assets buried within the code of Microsoft exclusives, like Hi-Fi Rush, suggesting versions of the game would be coming to PS5 and Switch relatively soon (as in potentially this month). Recent rumors have also suggested some of the big-time Bethesda titles, including Starfield\u00a0and the aforementioned Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, might indeed be getting the same treatment in the near future. And while there hasn\u2019t been any official confirmation from Microsoft has of yet on any of this, Phil Spencer, the CEO of Microsoft Gaming, didn\u2019t exactly deny them either: \u201cWe\u2019re listening and we hear you.\u201d Well, it won\u2019t be long now before we find out if any of this is true or, at least, whether or not Microsoft is ready to talk about just yet. This week\u2019s Xbox business update event will be giving us some details on what\u2019s to come on Thursday, February 15, 2024 at 12 p.m. PT/3 p.m. ET Add 9to5Toys to your Google News feed.\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\nGoogle News FTC: 9to5Toys is reader supported, we may earn income on affiliate links Subscribe to the 9to5Toys YouTube Channel for all of the latest videos, reviews, and more!
