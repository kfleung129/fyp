The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) says that \u201ccontradicts\u201d Microsoft\u2019s previous representations. But Microsoft said the idea of job cuts did not originate with its takeover. \u201cConsistent with broader trends in the gaming industry, Activision was already planning on eliminating a significant number of jobs while still operating as an independent company,\u201d the firm said in a filing with the US court, seen by the BBC. The controversial deal gives Microsoft control of popular games such as Call of Duty, World of Warcraft, and Candy Crush. It was initially blocked in the UK but was later approved.
