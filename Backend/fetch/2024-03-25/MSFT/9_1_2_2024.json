Published: 11:10 02 Jan 2024 GMT 2024 is the year of the dragon in the Chinese Zodiac. Similarly, there\u2019s a fire inside the technology sector in the form of artificial intelligence (AI)\u00a0and its flames are growing ever larger. Such is the importance of AI in the tech sector that it will be the key to tech stock growth and overall demand in the year ahead, according to a recent enterprise survey conducted by Wedbush.

Though Microsoft is a frontrunner in the AI revolution, Wedbush analysts believe the tech sector as a whole stands to benefit from the burgeoning field of innovation.

Wedbush also predicted a \u201ctidal wave\u201d of mergers and acquisitions in the software and microchip sectors. Outside of the Magnificent 7, Wedbush cited Palo Alto, Palantir, Zscaler, CyberArk, Crowdstrike\u00a0and MongoDB as major AI beneficiaries in the year ahead.
