AI is redefining the boundaries of what\u2019s possible, but the unique demands of AI\u2014from vast data volumes and high-speed processing requirements to complex security and compliance challenges\u2014require a strategic approach to data and technology infrastructure. \u201cIt\u2019s been over a year now since generative AI became mainstream. We are through the science experiment phase and leading companies are now putting AI into action,\u201d says Wangui McKelvey, General Manager, Microsoft Azure Data Analytics. In this post, we\u2019ll focus on the five data and technology fundamentals required to deliver meaningful, sustainable, and responsible value creation with AI: Building a Foundation for AI Success: A Leader\u2019s Guide Successful AI projects begin with a clear, prioritized, and valued set of business objectives, such as maximizing productivity and efficiency, improving customer experience, or growth-oriented objectives such as revenue acquisition or product innovation. These goals will help you prioritize use cases against likelihood of impact and realistically assess feasibility based on data and infrastructure requirements. It\u2019s also useful to think of your technology investments in aggregate as an investment portfolio, which will enable you to set clear success criteria and reallocate resources across projects as needed. Moving successfully from proof-of-concept (POC) to production with AI depends on a mix of technology and business factors that, ideally, must work together. Microsoft cloud \u201cUnderstanding how your business strategy maps to your product strategy, and then how your product strategy maps to your infrastructure, is key,\u201d says Omar Khan, General Manager, Microsoft Azure Product Marketing. \u201cAI-optimized infrastructure will help accelerate both building AI solutions and integrating AI into applications.\u201d From a technology perspective, the most critical requirement is access to infrastructure that is built for AI\u2014with the ability to run large AI workloads and perform securely and reliably at scale. Data is the fuel that powers AI technology, so planning for any successful AI implementation requires that you identify the right data sources and ensure that the data is complete, of high quality, in the right format, and representative of your target customers and business objectives. Microsoft AI \u201cOrganizations continue to see their data as their competitive advantage,\u201d says Wangui McKelvey. \u201cUnlocking insights from their data, across their organization, in a single, integrated platform, empowers businesses to take advantage of AI. If you don\u2019t understand the insights you can deliver from your data with AI, then you\u2019re going to be left behind.\u201d The decisions you make today to buy, build, or modernize your technology infrastructure can significantly influence your ability to execute on future goals, so it\u2019s essential to choose a path that is supportive of your organization\u2019s vision. Here are some of the considerations and trade-offs: Regulatory compliance, particularly with the General Data Protection Requirement (GDPR) and the coming EU AI Act, introduces a set of technical, legal, and operational considerations for infrastructure choices.1 Factors such as data sensitivity, data residency, scalability, and governance all play a part in architecture decisions, whether organizations choose on-premises, cloud, or co-located deployments. One critical factor to consider is access to sophisticated security measures that utilize machine learning, AI, and global threat intelligence databases to contribute to a more robust defense against cyber threats. \u201cContrary to common belief, on-premises environments are often less secure than the cloud,\u201d says Omar Khan. \u201cDespite the sense of control associated with in-house infrastructure, cloud-based security solutions have evolved significantly, offering more advanced tools and technologies for threat detection and mitigation.\u201d Stay tuned for the next post in our series, \u201cBuilding a Foundation for AI Success: AI strategy and experience,\u201d in which we will explore the factors that contribute to a successful AI strategy and experience for customers. We will follow the next entry with dedicated posts focusing on organization and culture, and AI governance.
