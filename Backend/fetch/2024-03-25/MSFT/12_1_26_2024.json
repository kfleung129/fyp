    "text": "Watch CBS News By Elizabeth Napolitano Updated on:  January 26, 2024 / 6:08 PM EST\n          / CBS/AP Microsoft Teams is experiencing a service outage that has blocked access and limited features for some users. The outage began Friday at around 11 a.m. Eastern Time, with reports of technical issues spiking in the afternoon and peaking shortly before 2 p.m. More than 14,500 service incidents were reported by then, outage tracker DownDetector's data shows. By 5:44 p.m., the number of reports fell to a little less than 1,100, according to the tracker. Microsoft did not immediately respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment. According to DownDetector, 67% of the user-reported issues involved the Teams app, 25% are service connection-related problems and 8% are website issues. Users complained they were unable to use the service, citing messaging delays and problems with graphic displays. Although it was unclear how many users were affected by the outages, Microsoft was deluged with complaints on social media. It\u2019s cool @MicrosoftTeams I didn\u2019t plan on doing any work today or anything \ud83d\ude43 In an X post on Friday, Microsoft 365 Status, the company's office account for service incidents, said it identified \"a networking issue impacting a portion of the Teams service\" and that it has moved the affected processes to a backup system. The company added that it was making headway restoring Teams service in Europe and the Middle East. Microsoft also said it was working to protect its network in North and South America as it monitors the outages, adding that it was optimizing traffic patterns and applying configuration changes to reduce customer impact as quickly as possible. \u2014With reporting by the Associated Press.
