You can skip our detailed analysis on countries that welcome tourists, expatriates and immigrants with open arms, and head over directly to the 5 Friendliest Countries in Asia. Traveling abroad, whether for tourism or starting a new life, is a unique experience. While tourists have several expectations associated with visiting a country, such as architecture, landscape, culture, cuisine, shopping and more, it is often their experience with locals that has a long-lasting impact on the perception they develop of that place. Asia is the fastest growing region in the world, with its GDP projected to account for over 50% of the world\u2019s GDP by 2040. The continent offers immense economic potential, which has seen a large influx of investors and job seekers move to Asia with an eye on the lucrative opportunities available in these large, densely populated markets. Moreover, Asia is also famous for its unique landscape, cultures, and warm climates, which have enhanced the region\u2019s reputation as a growing tourist destination. 2023 was an exceptional year for tourism in Asia, especially UAE, which received over 17 million tourists. The UAE is the second most welcoming country in the world for immigrants as well, with a migrant stock in the population of 88.1%. Tens of thousands of people flock to the country every year for job hunt in search for better wages and living standards than in their home country. Several large corporations operate in the country and contribute to its economic success. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is expecting its cloud portfolio to create 100,000 new jobs and add $39 billion to the Emirati economy between 2022 and 2026. The US technology company is in talks with UAE officials on the potential use of its cloud based services in highly regulated sectors of the government. Moreover, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) plans on spending $3.4 billion to support local businesses and data centers in the UAE. Property business is thriving as well in the UAE.

Last month, Ankara eliminated the requirement for US, Canadian, and Mexican tourists to obtain e-visa for travel lasting fewer than 90 days. The move is likely to further boost tourism in the country. Turkiye\u2019s appeal as a major tourist destination has meant a booming hotel industry, with large chains like Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc. (NYSE:WH) and Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR) having announced expansions in the country. Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc. (NYSE:WH) is the largest international hotel company operating in Turkiye, with more than 100 active hotels, and about 20 more under development in the country.
