In a post on social media platform X after a meeting with the Prime Minister of Spain, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, Brad Smith, Microsoft\u2019s vice chair and president, said the company will be fulfilling its investment in Spain over the next two years. Smith said it\u2019s not just about building data centers but committing to helping develop the country\u2019s \u201csecurity, and development and digital transformation of its government, businesses, and people.\u201d I\u2019m thrilled to announce that we will expand our AI and cloud infrastructure in Spain by $2.1B USD in the next two years. Our investment is beyond just building data centers, it\u2019s a testament to our 37-year commitment to Spain, its security, and development and digital\u2026 https://t.co/arJnZzyDpc According to the Microsoft exec, the company has been investing in Spain for 37 years. In September 2021, the firm\u00a0announced\u00a0a new research and development hub for AI technologies based in Barcelona, Spain. At the time, Alberto Granados, the president of Microsoft Spain, said Microsoft\u2019s investment was proof of Spain\u2019s talent in the digital sector. This investment comes on the heels of another investment Microsoft made into Europe on Feb. 15, with 3 billion euros going toward\u00a0developing Germany\u2019s AI ecosystem. Like its plans in Spain, over the next two years, Microsoft has pledged to invest the funds to boost German AI infrastructure, build new data centers and train people to develop AI skills. Big Tech companies are piling into Europe with AI development-related investments as the European Union is about to implement its landmark EU AI Act legislation. On the same day that Microsoft announced its investment in Germany, the Ministry of the Economy, Finance and Industrial and Digital Sovereignty of France and Google announced plans to set up a new AI-dedicated hub in Paris, which will house nearly 300 researchers and engineers to support the country\u2019s AI ambitions. Two days prior, Google announced its \u201cAI Opportunity Initiative for Europe,\u201d\u00a0through which it said it would be investing 25 million euros ($26.9 million) in skills training for Europeans in the AI sector.
