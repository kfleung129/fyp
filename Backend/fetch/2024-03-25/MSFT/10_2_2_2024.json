Read more Microsoft will release 3 new solutions for its Intune Suite, and one of them will feature the ability to let users access company-approved apps on personal mobile devices, without compromising the company\u2019s data, and their device\u2019s storage. This capability will be released with the new Microsoft Cloud KPI solution, inside the Microsoft Tunnel for MAM, which is a platform that helps secure Android and iOS devices when receiving sensitive information. Microsoft Tunnel for MAM provides secure VPN access at the app level, for just the apps and browser (including Microsoft Edge) your IT admin explicitly authorizes. So, for personally owned devices, the user can access approved apps, without your company\u2019s data moving onto the user\u2019s personal device. The data within the apps will be protected by specific company policies, and they won\u2019t be stored on personal mobile devices, as well, for security reasons. That means, you\u2019ll be able to work on your phone without worrying that the data will put you in a compromising position, in case something happens with the phone. Intune Suite\u2019s other 2 new solutions, Microsoft Intune Enterprise Application Management, and Microsoft Intune Advanced Analytics, promise to deliver a unified experience in Microsoft Intune that spans across many levels: cybersecurity, productivity, mobility, cloud operations, analytics, and so on, to streamline workflows, provide training for IT admins, and reduce overhead costs. For example, the Enterprise Application Management solution will increase endpoint security, by allowing admins to have greater control over company-owned and approved apps, such as assigning privilege rights, deploying updates easier or setting them up to self-update, and many more features. Last year, Intune received a similar update to the platform\u2019s Custom App Control, that allowed it to stop malicious code from running, so this solution seems to take the existing feature to the next level. With this initial release, you will be able to discover and deploy highly popular, pre-packaged apps, so you no longer need to scour the Internet to find their installation files, repackage, and upload them into Intune. Simply add and deploy the apps directly from their app publishers. You can also allow the apps you trust to self-update, and when a new update is available, it is just one click to update all your devices with that app installed. The Advanced Analytics solution allows companies to have a deep, near real-time insight into their devices, and apps, so that they can improve the overall user experience or prevent/manage cyberattacks when they happen. Microsoft also plans to integrate more AI into this solution, in the future, and it offers companies the possibility to remotely view and interact with devices. Advanced Analytics in Intune is a powerful set of tools for actionable reporting and AI-driven analytics. It provides deep, near real-time insights into your connected devices and managed apps that help you understand, anticipate, and proactively improve the user experience. The Redmond-based tech giant says these three solutions will be enhanced as time passes, but they represent the fundamentals of the Microsoft Intune Suite, which promises to bring companies security, simplification, and savings.
