As individuals age, they may prioritize a work environment that offers reduced stress levels to enhance overall well-being and quality of life. Many seniors look forward to retirement as a phase of life that comes with relaxation, leisure, and spending time with loved ones. Consequently, opting for low-stress jobs helps them maintain a healthier work-life balance and transition smoothly into retirement. According to popular beliefs, dietitian and gardeners are considered two of the most stress-free jobs for seniors. Age should not be the sole determinant of one's ability to work. Many individuals remain active, productive, and engaged in their careers well into their 70s too. Infact, around 20% of Americans, as per a recent T. Rowe Price study, have chosen to \"unretire,\" opting for full or part-time employment. The average retirement age has risen to 61, with retirees now working longer due to economic uncertainty and pandemic-related factors.

Financial incentives have also player a key role, with 48% citing the need to work for financial reasons. Additionally, returning to work offers social and mental health benefits, as 45% of respondents in the T. Rowe Price poll re-entered the workforce for interpersonal and emotional reasons. Overall, 57% of retirees express a desire to continue working. It is interesting to note that the motivations differ along gender and marital lines, with women and single retirees more likely to cite income as their primary motivator, while men often highlight social connections. Despite these developments, AARP reports that workplace age discrimination is at its highest since 2003, with 78% of older workers experiencing or witnessing it.
