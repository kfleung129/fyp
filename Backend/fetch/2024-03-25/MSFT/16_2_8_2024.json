Read more Key notes It\u2019s been at least four years since Microsoft first launched\u00a0Universal Print, its one-stop solution for businesses to print documents without installing drivers locally. Now, the Redmond company is rolling this out for macOS users. Now supported for users of macOS Ventura 13.3, Universal Print can be accessed through the Microsoft Azure Portal for Microsoft 365 businesses. From there, you can go to the Settings page and then click on \u201cmacOS Support (preview).\u201d Folks over at\u00a0Neowin\u00a0also spotted (via the Microsoft 365 roadmap site) that the company had initially planned a full launch of Universal Print last year in September. That plan did not come to fruition, for whatever reason. Now, you can also download the Universal Print mobile app on\u00a0Apple\u2019s App Store\u00a0and choose between entering a personalized PIN code or scanning a QR code on the printer using the app. And soon, as\u00a0Microsoft promises, you\u2019ll also be able to swipe a badge on the printer for even more security. It also has a feature called Delegation Administration to do just-in-time (JIT) rights without third-party tools, allowing admins to manage printers by using a specific connector. Compatible printers include (but possibly not exclusive to) Canon, Epson, HP, Xerox, Toshiba, and more.
