In an official\u00a0disclosure, the U.K.-based telecommunications firm says the partnership will see both entities lean on their \u201crespective strengths\u201d to improve their offerings for consumers across Africa and Europe. One area of the partnership focuses on generative\u00a0artificial intelligence\u00a0(AI), with Vodafone pledging to invest $1.5 billion to develop new AI services with Microsoft over a 10-year window. Amid the push for cloud and AI innovation, Vodafone will leverage\u00a0Microsoft\u2019s generative AI offerings\u00a0to improve its customer experience. \u201cWe are delighted that together with Vodafone we will apply the latest cloud and AI technology to enhance the customer experience of hundreds of millions of people and businesses across Africa and Europe, build new products and services, and accelerate the company\u2019s transition to the cloud,\u201d Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said. Using Microsoft Azure OpenAI offering, Vodafone says it will personalize customers\u2019 experience across its offering, including integration with TOBi, its brave attempt at rolling out a chatbot. To improve workplace productivity, Vodafone employees will be unfettered by\u00a0Microsoft Copilot, with the company in pole position to receive priority access for new AI offerings. Outside of AI, the new partnership will see both firms pursue digital acceleration in Africa by targeting small and medium-scale enterprises (SMEs) on the continent. Microsoft\u2019s solution is an attempt to scale the continent\u2019s largest payment platform,\u00a0M-Pesa, by hosting it on Azure and offering digital educational outreach. Vodafone and Microsoft are keen on pursuing enterprise growth and cloud transformation, with the telecom giant eyeing a pivot to virtual data centers to save operational costs. Vodafone says the move will improve its response times to customers, lower its energy consumption rates, and allow it to meet its sustainable business targets. A vital part of the plan is Microsoft\u2019s intention to invest in Vodafone\u2019s IoT connectivity platform, with the goal of floating it as a separate business by the start of Q2. In turn, Vodafone\u2019s IoT platform will join Microsoft\u2019s Azure ecosystem, which will offer myriad scaling benefits through open APIs. Microsoft\u2019s red-hot partnership streak Microsoft has a streak of impressive partnerships under its belt, famously\u00a0inking\u00a0a $2 billion deal with professional services firm KPMG for AI research and development. At the tail end of 2023, a new\u00a0deal\u00a0with Siemens will see Microsoft pursue cross-industry AI adoption in manufacturing, healthcare, and transportation. The technology giant has similar partnerships with Australia and the U.K., pledging to invest in the digital economies of both nations via\u00a0emerging technologies. In the U.K., Microsoft\u2019s plan involves deploying over 20,000 GPUs over three years, supported by training initiatives to deepen the AI talent pool. In order for artificial intelligence (AI) to work right within the law and thrive in the face of growing challenges, it needs to integrate an enterprise blockchain system that ensures data input quality and ownership\u2014allowing it to keep data safe while also guaranteeing the immutability of data.
