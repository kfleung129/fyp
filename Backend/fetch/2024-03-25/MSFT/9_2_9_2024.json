Last year, 154 companies went public, compared to 181 in 2022, according to data compiled by Stock Analysis. In 2021, 1,035 companies went public. A record $339B was raised in the U.S. that year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Last year, that total was $26B, the data show. This week, companies raised $2.1B through IPOs, the most since September, Bloomberg said, as the market sees cracks in the ceiling.
