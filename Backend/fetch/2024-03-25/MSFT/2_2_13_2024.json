While industry giants Microsoft (MSFT) and Cisco Systems (CSCO) are well-positioned to benefit, which of these has the higher growth potential?

The stock has gained 34.4% over the past nine months compared to CSCO\u2019s 7% gain.

(SSNLF) announced new meeting room solutions to deliver enhanced collaboration experiences for hybrid meetings. With a collective vision to enable seamless and inclusive meetings for all, the companies unveiled integrated video collaboration solutions for Cisco Room Series.
