    "text": "When it comes to AI, insurers no longer need much convincing about the potential value of the technology to their business. What they need is help, partnership, and a path to adoption that recognizes the unique demands of the insurance industry. Some of the world\u2019s largest insurance companies are busy innovating on early use cases to help them evaluate the potential impact of generative AI on their operations and businesses. Most other insurers are not far behind. Use cases that transform the industry With the recent availability of Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365, which integrates the magic of the technology into everyday applications like Microsoft Teams and Excel, insurers understand that their employees and customers alike will welcome generative AI into their operations (if not demand it). Most insurers want to innovate quickly but carefully, deriving maximum value from even the earliest steps while incurring minimal risk to the business. Helping insurers unlock business value and deepen customer relationships through technology is what Microsoft Cloud for Financial Services is all about. In our work with early AI adopters, we have identified a set of progressive milestones that can help insurance companies explore generative AI so that its value can be assessed and scaled as quickly and productively as possible. Unlock business value and deepen customer relationships Today, most of the insurance companies we work with are evaluating projects at what we call the \u201cexploring\u201d phase\u2014the early horizon where the technology is deployed on a limited basis. While these use cases tend to focus on internal business scenarios, they are executed with an eye to the far horizon of opportunity, beyond improving operations to being central to new product development and reimagined processes. To help insurance manage this long-term approach, we recommend following a four-level maturity model that describes the AI adoption journey from early consideration to innovation at scale. In a remarkable way, generative AI can feel almost too appealing. Brainstorming ideas for use cases can produce lists that are quite lengthy. So, it is important to prioritize. The north star in this phase is speed to value, which can be achieved by building use cases that are relatively simple to design and easy to deploy. Use design thinking techniques to ideate use cases and map them in a two-by-two \u201cvalue versus implementation\u201d matrix to find the ones that will deliver higher business value. Early use case scenarios are often designed to help employees do their jobs more efficiently. For example, in underwriting, it can take the form of an internal chatbot to answer agent questions or help triage submissions. Claims managers can realize immediate benefits using generative AI to transcribe first notice of loss conversations. In marketing, it can speed the process of developing presentations or drafting new content. We work together with insurers by first conducting envisioning workshops, choosing the most strategic options, then building and deploying rapid prototypes. This is where leveraging your technology partner or service provider can reap great benefits. Keys to success in this phase: With the learnings from early efforts in hand, insurers can gain the confidence to move up to more substantive use cases. Business value is the key criterion, and so every candidate should be evaluated on scalability (for example, if it won\u2019t scale, don\u2019t do it). Use cases can also include more than just text-based, with visuals or audio incorporated for richer experiences. Already, we are seeing insurers building on early success to generate an innovation flywheel that generates speed, scale, and learning through experience. To move to this next level, the IT landscape needs to be made AI-ready. The most important step is to prepare your data estate by migrating to a modern platform such as Microsoft Fabric, which unifies data and analytics, and has generative AI built in. This positions the company to build custom copilots, chatbots, and other AI enhancements using Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service and other cutting-edge solutions. It also ensures that critical concerns such as privacy, security, and compliance are fully addressed. This is also the point to consider the organizational implications of AI, not only identifying how roles will be impacted but also ensuring that frameworks and training are in place to ensure responsible AI over the long term. Keys to success in this phase: Early adopters of AI in insurance are already building solutions designed to directly impact their operational efficiencies and, increasingly, the products and services they deliver. It won\u2019t be long before deeper innovation with AI will create significant differentiation among competitors, and that has implications for every organization. To enable the greatest competitive advantages with AI, insurers will require a comprehensive cloud foundation that identifies and manages data from many sources, and ensures that AI tools integrate smoothly with existing systems. This is key to enabling AI development to scale as quickly as business requirements demand. You want to be sure that cloud and AI are being provided responsibly, and that it meets the industry\u2019s stringent requirements for data privacy and protection. microsoft responsible ai practices Organizationally, business processes will change to ensure safety and responsibility. We advocate creating committees or offices to define company values for using AI, ensuring guardrails in operations, and managing pipelines of use cases and measurement across the company. Finally, you want to ensure that your people are ready. Roles will change over time, and the workforce will accommodate this evolution best with training to build on their skill sets. A great step you can take today is to put AI in their hands now with Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365, which integrates powerful capabilities into the productivity tools they use every day.
