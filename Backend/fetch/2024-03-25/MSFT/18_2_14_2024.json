    "text": "Countdown to Luke Lango\u2019s \u201c2nd Trillion-Dollar A.I. Trade\u201d The U.S. govt just unlocked an $8 trillion market to move in a new direction. See how it could unleash 6,000% potential upside. Even after an epic run, MSFT stock still has AI-and-cloud power to keep the bears at bay Advertisement Source: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com It\u2019s funny to think that Microsoft\u00a0(NASDAQ:MSFT)\u00a0was once best known for Windows 95. Today, the company isn\u2019t just a legacy tech business; it\u2019s a top-tier contender in cloud computing and artificial intelligence. Truly, the MSFT stock outlook is bright and there are few better picks for 2024, tech-sector or elsewhere. Granted, it may feel like the opportunity has passed now, especially after the epic run-up in Microsoft stock. Yet, there are always new horizons for Microsoft\u00a0to explore, and you\u2019ll surely be amazed when you discover what the CEO has in mind. There are several ways to interpret Microsoft\u2019s fourth-quarter 2023 results. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives called it a \u201cmasterpiece quarter\u201d for Microsoft, and I tend to agree. Yet, Microsoft stock went nowhere despite the company\u2019s unmistakably positive data. The real \u201cmasterpiece,\u201d as I see it, was Microsoft\u00a0dazzling 30% year-over-year cloud-business revenue growth. If there were any doubts about Azure\u2019s place in the cloud market, those doubts can now be put to rest. Microsoft posted top-line and bottom-line beats for Q4 2023, exceeding Wall Street\u2019s consensus calls for revenue and EPS. And of course, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella mentioned AI multiple times, which I think might be required by law now: \u201cWe\u2019ve moved from talking about AI to applying AI at scale\u2026 By infusing AI across every layer of our tech stack, we\u2019re winning new customers and helping drive new benefits and productivity gains across every sector.\u201d If MSFT stock didn\u2019t move despite Microsoft\u2019s expectation-topping results and outstanding cloud-business performance, that\u2019s actually not bad news.\u00a0Really, it\u2019s just an opportunity to buy the stock while the skeptics ponder and hesitate. Given the aforementioned quote about AI from Nadella, it\u2019s no surprise that the Microsoft CEO has big plans to push the envelope of AI technology. However, you\u2019ll certainly be amazed to learn to Nadella intends to source fresh talent in the AI-tech field. Did you ever imagine that Microsoft\u00a0would, in effect, build a 2-million-person army of AI technicians? Believe it or not, Nadella has plans for Microsoft to train 2 million people in India on AI and other technologies by 2025. Microsoft emphasized the benefits for India\u2019s population, stating, \u201cIndia needs a skilled workforce that can use AI to solve complex problems and create value.\u201d\u00a0Don\u2019t get the wrong idea, though. Without a doubt, Microsoft\u2019s management is seeking long-term benefits from this program. After all, if the company can train young, knowledge-hungry tech talent today, Microsoft\u00a0could position itself as the world\u2019s unbeatable AI-market dominator in a few years. Now, you have an idea of why my MSFT stock outlook is so positive for 2024. The quarterly results are indisputable: Microsoft\u00a0is a cloud king and a powerful AI-tech competitor. Plus, it might only be a matter of time before the company has an army of trained AI experts. So, don\u2019t just try to hit singles and doubles this year. Buy some Microsoft shares and aim for a grand slam by beating earnings, becoming a cloud champion, and potentially dominating AI.
