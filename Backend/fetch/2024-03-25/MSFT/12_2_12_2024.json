(Image courtesy of Pixabay/MS) SEOUL, Feb. 12 (Korea Bizwire) \u2013Amidst strong performance in the technology sector that has propelled the U.S. stock market to new heights, Microsoft has emerged as the most popular overseas stock gifted by South Korean investors since the beginning of this year. According to an analysis by KB Securities, Microsoft topped the list of most gifted stocks through its overseas stock gifting service from the start of the year until February 6. Tesla, which was the most gifted stock by South Korean investors last year, has been relegated to second place this year, followed by IonQ in third. Apple and Alphabet A rounded out the top five, securing the fourth and fifth spots, respectively. Tesla\u2019s relinquishment of the top spot to Microsoft this year can be attributed to investors\u2019 growing interest in artificial intelligence (AI)-related stocks, including Microsoft, which recently partnered with OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT. This shift reflects the market\u2019s response to concerns over the electric vehicle sector\u2019s outlook and the notable decline in Tesla\u2019s stock price at the start of the year, contrasted with the rise in Microsoft\u2019s shares. Securities industry insiders note that the choice of stocks to gift is influenced by a favorable perception of the company\u2019s image. Givers tend to prefer stocks on an upward trend, considering the recipient\u2019s feelings, over those that have recently experienced a decline. Since the beginning of the year, Tesla\u2019s stock had fallen by 23.7% as of February 8, whereas Microsoft saw a 10.1% increase over the same period. Experts anticipate Tesla\u2019s stock price may continue to face challenges, with concerns over a potential slowdown in the electric vehicle and battery markets if an administration unfriendly to the electric vehicle industry emerges from the U.S. election. On the other hand, companies like Microsoft and Nvidia are expected to maintain their upward trend due to anticipated improvements in their financial performance. The \u201cStock Gifting Service\u201d allows investors to gift stocks through a brokerage\u2019s Home Trading System (HTS) or Mobile Trading System (MTS). With KB Securities\u2019 overseas stock gifting service, for example, investors can select a foreign stock they own, enter the recipient\u2019s name and mobile number, and easily gift it through the MTS \u201cStock Gifting\u201d menu.
