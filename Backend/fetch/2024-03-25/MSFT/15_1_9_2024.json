(AP Photo/Barbara Ortutay, File) LONDON (AP) \u2014 Microsoft\u2019s multibillion-dollar investment in ChatGPT-maker OpenAI could trigger a European Union merger investigation, the bloc\u2019s executive branch said Tuesday. The European Commission said it\u2019s \u201cchecking whether Microsoft\u2019s investment in OpenAI might be reviewable\u201d under regulations covering mergers and acquisitions that would harm competition in the 27-nation EU. The review could lead to a formal investigation into whether the deal should be unconditionally cleared, allowed with concessions from the companies or blocked. Britain\u2019s antitrust watchdog opened a similar review last month. Antitrust enforcers in the U.S. also have signaled concerns about competition in the AI industry. The Federal Trade Commission in November approved new measures enabling it to more easily investigate AI products and services, noting that \u201cAI can raise competition issues in a variety of ways, including if one or just a few companies control the essential inputs or technologies that underpin AI.\u201d OpenAI has received several rounds of funding from Microsoft, including an initial $1 billion in 2019 and a multibillion-dollar investment last year. OpenAI\u2019s generative AI chatbot ChatGPT has captured world attention with its advanced capabilities, catapulting the San Francisco-based startup to the top ranks of AI companies. Generative AI systems like ChatGPT can spit out new text, images, videos or audio recordings based on prompts from users.  The European Commission, the bloc\u2019s top antitrust enforcer, is asking businesses and experts for input on any competition issues that they see in generative AI and has asked \u201cseveral large digital players\u201d \u2014 which it didn\u2019t identify \u2014 for information. The commission is \u201calso closely monitoring AI partnerships to ensure they do not unduly distort market dynamics,\u201d the EU\u2019s antitrust enforcer, Margrethe Vestager, said in a press release. Vestager is due to meet with OpenAI executives on a trip this week to the U.S., as well as Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Apple CEO Tim Cook and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang.
