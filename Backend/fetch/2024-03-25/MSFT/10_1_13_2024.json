After trailing behind Apple for the majority of the past decade, Microsoft is the world\u2019s most valuable publicly traded company as of market close on Friday. The tech giant\u2019s stock (MSFT) closed at US$388.47 a share on Friday, giving it a market capitalization of US$2.89 trillion.

Market capitalization \u2014 or market cap \u2014 is the total value of all the shares of a publicly traded company. In other words, it\u2019s the market value of the company.
