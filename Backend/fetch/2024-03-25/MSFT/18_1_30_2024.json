    "text": "by Todd Bishop on January 30, 2024 at 1:33 pmJanuary 30, 2024 at 3:11 pm Microsoft\u2019s revenue from its Azure cloud platform and related services rose 30% in the quarter ended Dec. 31, including a 6 percentage point boost from its artificial intelligence technologies. The company\u2019s overall revenue increased 18% to $62 billion, with profits of $21.9 billion and earnings per share of $2.93, up 33% by both measures, topping Wall Street\u2019s expectations across the board on the key metrics. \u201cWe\u2019ve moved from talking about AI to applying AI at scale,\u201d said Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, in the company\u2019s earnings release, citing the growing adoption of Microsoft\u2019s AI tools across different industries and technologies. Activision Blizzard, the video game developer acquired by Microsoft for $69 billion last year, was included in Microsoft\u2019s results for the first time, with revenue of $2.08 billion and an operating loss of $44 million for the quarter. From a revenue perspective, at least, the Activision acquisition means that Microsoft Gaming is now a bigger business than Microsoft Windows for the first time, according to Microsoft\u2019s detailed quarterly report filed with the SEC. The company did not report any material revenue gain from Microsoft 365 Copilot, its AI tool for businesses, which launched Nov. 1, one month into the quarter. Those results will be included in the company\u2019s Office Commercial product line, which posted a revenue increase of 15% for the quarter. Other notable segment and product results: Update: On Microsoft\u2019s earnings conference call, Nadella transitioned seamlessly from addressing the recent breach of the company\u2019s internal systems and executive email accounts by Russian hackers to discussing its security technology business. \u201cThe recent security attacks including the nation-state attack on our corporate systems we reported a week and a half ago have highlighted the urgent need for organizations to move even faster to protect themselves from cyber threats,\u201d he said. Microsoft\u2019s blending of these two issues \u2014 security problems in its products, and the security technology business \u2014  has drawn criticism from some corners of the industry. Nadella did not disclose revenue from security products as he has before at this time of year. At last report, a year ago, the total was $20 billion annually.
