    "text": "Countdown to Luke Lango\u2019s \u201c2nd Trillion-Dollar A.I. Trade\u201d The U.S. govt just unlocked an $8 trillion market to move in a new direction. See how it could unleash 6,000% potential upside. Why fight it? The AI revolution is here to stay, and owning MSFT stock is a smart way to participate Advertisement Source: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com From Bing search and the Edge browser to the Copilot assistant, Microsoft\u00a0(NASDAQ:MSFT)\u00a0is effectively deploying artificial intelligence in a variety of use cases. Our MSFT stock\u00a0analysis\u00a0is bullish for 2024, and investing in Microsoft makes sense if you\u2019re seeking prime exposure to AI technology. You may have heard about Microsoft\u2019s solid fourth-quarter 2023\u00a0results. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives called it a\u00a0\u201cmasterpiece quarter\u201d\u00a0for Microsoft, and we concur with this assessment. As you learn about the company and its status as an AI-tech leader, you\u2019ll surely agree that Microsoft stock fully deserves an \u201cA\u201d grade. Truly, Microsoft\u2019s vision for AI technology has no borders or limits. Evidently, Microsoft\u2019s next target for expansion is Germany. According to Microsoft President Brad Smith (per Reuters), Germany \u201ccame second in Europe for the creation of AI based applications.\u201d Over the next two years, Microsoft has\u00a0plans to invest nearly $3.5 billion in Germany, mainly in AI technology. \u201cWe are doing this because of the enormous confidence we have in Germany,\u201d Smith explained. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz expressed his support for this huge investment. Yet, this investment won\u2019t only benefit Germany. It should also position Microsoft as a global AI-market leader. Microsoft can expand its presence in Germany and strike up deals with major customers in the region. Plus, Microsoft\u00a0will be able to recruit top tech talent in Germany. As you\u2019re probably aware, Microsoft\u00a0invested heavily in the generative-AI technology of OpenAI. In fact, Microsoft has a 49% stake in OpenAI. So, when there\u2019s news pertaining to OpenAI, it\u2019s also major news for Microsoft. In a fresh news item, OpenAI is reportedly developing a search engine to compete directly against\u00a0Alphabet\u2019s\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google. This gen-AI search engine will be powered in part by Microsoft\u2019s Bing search engine. Could this be the watershed event that will finally enable Microsoft to topple Google, the search engine king? Anything\u2019s possible in 2024. In January, Bing only controlled 3.43% of the search-engine market, while Google controlled 91.46%. Different people will take away different conclusions from this. What we take away is that Microsoft has plenty of room to expand in the search-engine market. Google is the king, for now. Yet, Microsoft easily beats Alphabet in the area of AI technology advancement. Just consider how much more successful OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT has been, compared to Alphabet\u2019s Bard chatbot. There\u2019s really no comparison there, so Microsoft could actually pose a major threat to Alphabet and steal some of Google\u2019s search-engine market share. Microsoft\u00a0isn\u2019t the search-engine king \u2013 at least, not yet. We\u2019ve pounded the table for Microsoft stock before, and we\u2019re still confident that the company can provide value as an AI-technology innovator. So, why wager your hard-earned money on second-rate tech companies? Microsoft is the gold standard on a global scale, especially in the field of AI.\u00a0Our MSFT stock analysis remains optimistic and we\u2019re assigning the stock a confident \u201cA\u201d grade.
