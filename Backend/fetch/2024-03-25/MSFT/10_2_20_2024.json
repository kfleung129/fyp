Here\u2019s how it works. $2.1 billion Microsoft investment confirmed for Spain Microsoft has confirmed plans to bolster its artificial intelligence and cloud infrastructure in Spain with a substantial $2.1 billion investment over the next two years. The news came as Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez took to X to announce Microsoft\u2019s decision to quadruple its investment in the country. The investment follows closely on the heels of other commitments by the company, such as its $3.45 billion investment in Germany, emphasizing Redmond\u2019s plans to expand AI and cloud services across Europe. In December, Microsoft revealed a similar $3.2 billion spend in the UK, aimed at expanding its AI datacenter infrastructure, increasing skills, and improving security. Spain\u2019s S\u00e1nchez commented on X: \u201cI want to thank [Microsoft\u2019s] president, Brad Smith, for his trust in the Spanish economy and in our roadmap for an inclusive and secure digital transformation.\u201d He added that the investment would help the country strengthen cybersecurity and promote artificial intelligence in public administration. Microsoft Vice Chair and President Braad Smith commented: \u201cOur investment is beyond just building data centers, it\u2019s a testament to our 37-year commitment to Spain, its security, and development and digital transformation of its government, businesses, and people.\u201d Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! Specific details about the company\u2019s investment in Spain are yet to be confirmed, but it\u2019s reasonable to suspect it will be on similar grounds to other cash injections announced by Microsoft in recent months. Besides giving the country\u2019s business sector access to better technologies, with the hope of boosting its economy, Microsoft also looks to be increasing its presence across Europe, an area that it\u2019s previously had plenty of trouble with in relation to antitrust allegations, including its own cloud platform.
