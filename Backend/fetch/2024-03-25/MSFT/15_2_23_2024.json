See how it could unleash 6,000% potential upside. Here's why Microsoft should remain a top pick for long-term investors right now Advertisement Source: Asif Islam / Shutterstock.com Microsoft\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) recent investment in OpenAI has positioned the company as a top AI-related stock to buy, with plenty of near-term momentum. The company has adopted a well-rounded focus on its core business segments, with software and cloud operations providing the sort of cash flow to fund various high-growth endeavors. As the world demands more cloud resources, Microsoft\u2019s AI and cloud capabilities position it for growth over the long term. This is central to my MSFT stock analysis. Despite a modest dividend yield and a forward price-earnings ratio reflecting anticipation, Microsoft\u2019s strategic investments make it a contender in the high-growth segments of the tech market that matter. Accordingly, for long-term investors looking for a no-brainer pick among the mega-cap names, here\u2019s why I think MSFT stock should be on the list. Driven by its Intelligent Cloud revenue with 20% increase, Microsoft certainly should be proud of its Q4 2023 earnings report. Azure AI customers surged, driving an impressive increase of 60% in MSFT stock post-report. Over the past three months, Microsoft\u2019s stock price has been a bit more volatile, though the trend remains headed in the right direction. The company\u2019s return on equity (ROE) metric is indicative of the company\u2019s health, and how shareholder capital is utilized. Microsoft boasts an impressive ROE of 28%, easily surpassing the industry average of 10%, fueling its 16% net income growth in the past five years. This positions the company well for future investment, even at these higher levels. Microsoft\u2019s three-year median payout ratio is 27%, indicating efficient reinvestment and a well-covered dividend. With over ten years of consistent dividend payments, Microsoft prioritizes profit-sharing with shareholders. Analysts project a steady future payout ratio of 22%, aligning with the company\u2019s current ROE of 28%. This is a key part of my MSFT stock analysis. Microsoft has embarked on a global AI initiative, pledging $5.6 billion for European expansion. Investments in Spain and Germany highlight the company\u2019s strategic growth plans. The clarification was valuable, mainly since the Spanish announcement primarily focused on data center construction, possibly to comply with EU data storage regulations. Brad Smith, the company\u2019s president, announced the investment on social media, emphasizing Microsoft\u2019s commitment to Spain\u2019s security, development, and digital transformation. This follows Microsoft\u2019s previous investment of $3.45 million in AI-related initiatives in Germany. Indeed, U.S. tech giants, including Microsoft and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG), aim to expand their AI presence in European governance and cybersecurity sectors. This investment wave may sway European politicians favoring local AI startups toward some of the more prominent global mega-cap names. Microsoft is a top stock choice among 910 hedge funds, with 306 such funds currently holding stakes, as of Q3 2023. Citi has endorsed Microsoft as a prime large-cap buy for 2024, estimating the company will report earnings per share just shy of $12. Praise is certainly due following Microsoft\u2019s latest earnings report, notably for its AI ventures. Wedbush\u2019s Dan Ives highlights Microsoft\u2019s enterprise AI adoption potential, foreseeing substantial demand. Microsoft remains a top stock that analysts, investors, and the market will continue to focus on in 2024. I don\u2019t see many scenarios where this company will give up its leadership in its core segments. Accordingly, MSFT stock remains a buy-and-hold recommendation in my books. This concludes my MSFT stock analysis.
