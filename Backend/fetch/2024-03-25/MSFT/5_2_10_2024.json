If you want to read our discussion on the stock market and NASDAQ\u2019s performance, head directly to 12 Best NASDAQ Stocks To Buy In 2024. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 180 NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a global provider of graphics, compute, and networking solutions. It is one of the best NASDAQ stocks to buy. On February 9, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) reported that it is establishing a new division dedicated to creating tailored chips for cloud computing firms and other entities, specifically focusing on advanced AI processors. In the expanding generative AI field, companies such as OpenAI, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms are all vying to leverage Nvidia chips to stay competitive. According to Insider Monkey\u2019s third quarter database, 180 hedge funds were bullish on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), compared to 175 funds in the prior quarter. Rajiv Jain\u2019s GQG Partners is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 14 million shares worth $6.10 billion. Polen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter: \u201cApple and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) alone drove over 1,100 basis points of the Russell 1000 Growth Index\u2019s 42% return, so not owning them was a meaningful headwind to our relative return in 2023. NVIDIA shares rocketed higher by well over 200% in 2023 although they slightly underperformed our Portfolio and the Russell 1000 Growth in the fourth quarter. Generative AI has been a huge boon for NVIDIA as the use of LLMs like ChatGPT and others requires tremendous processing power that, today, is mostly provided by NVIDIA\u2019s GPUs. All large cloud service providers, AI factories, and many large consumer internet companies are laying the foundation for generative AI by deploying NVIDIA GPUs and other parallel processing chips to be able to do large scale generative AI either for internal use (i.e., Meta) or as a service for others (i.e., AI factories) or both (cloud service providers such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Google). Given many of NVIDIA\u2019s customers or its end customers are still very much in the experimentation phase with generative AI, it is unclear how sustainable the current demand for GPUs truly is. At the same time, it is known that NVIDIA has historically been highly cyclical. By the end of 2024, we believe NVIDIA will already account for roughly half the market for datacenter chips, servers, and networking equipment, which is unprecedented. Even though the valuation at 25x forward earnings doesn\u2019t look very demanding at first glance, it assumes NVIDIA will own virtually the entire datacenter chip market in just the next few years and will sustain year-on-year growth despite being a cyclical business that is currently experiencing much higher new peaks. We believe NVIDIA is a highly advantaged business, but we also believe the long-term growth outcomes are currently too variable, and the expectations built into the company\u2019s $1.2 trillion valuation as of this writing assume the most optimistic of those scenarios.\u201d NASDAQ:AMZNNASDAQ:METANASDAQ:MSFTNASDAQ:NVDANASDAQ:GOOGLAmazon Inc.
