Microsoft surpassed Apple to become the world's most valuable company on Thursday after the shares of the iPhone maker plummeted amid growing concerns about weak demand. Bill Gates founded company witnessed an increase of 1.5 per cent in its shares, owning to the rising investor's attention due to the company's artificial intelligence push. Today's increase in shares raised the valuation of 'Windows Creator' to a market worth of $2.888 trillion, Whereas, Apple recorded a valuation of $2.887 trillion, 0.3 per cent lower than Microsoft.  \nThis is the first time since 2021 that Apple's valuation has fallen below that of Microsoft. \nWhy Apple is facing challenges?\nApple's recent weakness is attributed to a series of rating downgrades, raising concerns about the iPhone's sales, especially in the significant Chinese market. Redburn Atlantic noted that China may negatively impact Apple's performance due to competition from Huawei and heightened Sino-U.S. tensions. Additionally, Apple's services business faces threats as regulators scrutinise a deal-making Google the default search engine on iOS. Despite ending last year with a 48% gain, Apple's market capitalization of $3.081 trillion on Dec. 14 dipped, allowing Microsoft, which aggressively introduced genAI-powered tools in 2023, to momentarily surpass Apple's value in 2021 amid COVID-related supply chain concerns. \n  \nApple Share Price Today:\nApple stock price fell to USD\u00a0184.77 today with a decrease of 0.76 per cent.  \nMicrosoft: A 'Buy Call' by investors\nMicrosoft temporarily surpassed Apple as the top-valued company several times since 2018, with the latest in 2021 due to apprehensions about COVID-related supply chain disruptions impacting Apple's stock. Presently, Microsoft enjoys a favourable outlook on Wall Street, with no \"sell\" recommendations and around 90% of covering brokerages endorsing a purchase of its stock. In contrast, Apple has garnered two \"sell\" ratings, and only two-thirds of analysts covering the company advocate a \"buy\" rating. \n\nMicrosoft Share Price Today:\nThe share price of Microsoft touched USD\u00a0382.79 today with an increase of 0.020 per cent.\nBoth stocks expensive on trading parameters\nAs per the stock market analysts, both stocks appear costly based on their price-to-earnings ratios, a widely used valuation metric for publicly traded firms. LSEG data indicates that Apple's forward PE is 28, surpassing its 10-year average of 19. Similarly, Microsoft's forward earnings are trading at around 31 times, exceeding its 10-year average of 24. This is the first time since 2021 that Apple's valuation has fallen below that of Microsoft. \nWhy Apple is facing challenges?\nApple's recent weakness is attributed to a series of rating downgrades, raising concerns about the iPhone's sales, especially in the significant Chinese market.
