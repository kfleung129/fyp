    "text": "Countdown to Luke Lango\u2019s \u201c2nd Trillion-Dollar A.I. Trade\u201d The U.S. govt just unlocked an $8 trillion market to move in a new direction. See how it could unleash 6,000% potential upside. Microsoft is the world's most valuable company again for a reason, and should stay there for a while Advertisement Source: gguy / Shutterstock.com Microsoft\u00a0(NASDAQ:MSFT) is number one again, thanks to the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. It passed\u00a0Apple\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL) in January and is now worth over $3 trillion. Since the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, MSFT stock is up over 55%. That\u2019s a gain of over $1.5 trillion in market cap. Microsoft\u2019s valuation crossed $1 trillion\u00a0less than five years ago. However, even with its post-earnings fall on January 30, MSFT stock is far from cheap. You\u2019re paying nearly 36 times the company\u2019s $11.06/share of earnings at its current price. The yield on its $3/share annual dividend is down to 0.75%. Small wonder traders took some profits. What should investors do? The post-earnings fall from a high of $411 was overdue. I\u2019m a big-tech investor, but valuations made me antsy. My\u00a0recent piece\u00a0on\u00a0Advanced Micro Devices\u00a0(NASDAQ:AMD) reflects it. That stock kept climbing after my story and is now only slightly higher than it was when I sold it. My personal view on MSFT stock is that you own it; don\u2019t trade it. I have always reinvested Microsoft dividends, letting them compound, giving me 63 shares of \u201cfree\u201d stock for every 100 I own by my last count. I expect Microsoft stock to have rough days in February as traders pick apart\u00a0the most recent earnings. Consumer revenue growth is slowing to below 10%, while cloud services are up 21% and Office365 15%. Is that sustainable? Microsoft has aggressively monetized AI on a gross level, charging $30 per user for its Office\u00a0Co-Pilot. If you bought a consumer version of Office at roughly $100/year, that\u2019s now $460! How many of the 78.4 million consumer Office customers will buy Co-Pilot? More important, what value will we get from it? These questions will drive analysts\u2019 view of the whole industry. The AI complex will catch a cold the next time Microsoft sniffles. 2024 will be a year of heavy marketing at Microsoft, which now has 221,000 employees, up 50% since I bought my shares\u00a0in 2018. (The stock is up 800%.) The company has moved from gross deals like one with (womp womp!)\u00a0Amazon\u00a0(NASDAQ:AMZN) to\u00a0industry-specific offerings\u00a0sold through\u00a0case studies on early customers. It\u2019s the kind of beneath-the-radar selling\u00a0International Business Machines\u00a0(NYSE:IBM) did in the 20th century, when it was the business computing leader. The fate of IBM, now worth 2% of Microsoft with about one-quarter of its sales, should keep Microsoft people paranoid. Microsoft doesn\u2019t have nearly the pre-eminence \u201cBig Blue\u201d did when I started covering technology 40 years ago. What was a monopoly then is an oligopoly now, engaged in \u201ccoopetition.\u201d Microsoft is ready to cooperate with Apple on its\u00a0Vision Pro\u00a0and sell Co-Pilot seats to Amazon while slurping data from\u00a0Alphabet\u2019s\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL)\u00a0Chrome. This is an era of Cloud \u201cCzars,\u201d not a single Cloud Czar. It\u2019s a world where consumers, businesses, and governments are just starting to get their arms around. It\u2019s the reason the U.S. economy is as dominant as it has ever been. How long can the good times roll? Nothing grows straight up. The post-earnings fall of Microsoft and the other winners of the Cloud Wars was welcome, given stretched valuations. I expect some follow-through over the next few months. The Federal Reserve will continue to\u00a0disappoint. The globe will continue to\u00a0simmer with war.\u00a0Political uncertainty will rise through the end of the year. There will be many predictions of\u00a0imminent doom. Watch Microsoft carefully and accumulate it on weakness.
