    "text": "Home \u00bb Tech Microsoft has beaten Apple as the world\u2019s most valuable company for the first time in two years. The firm\u2019s market capitalization stood at $2.887 trillion \u2014 its highest ever \u2014 on Jan. 12, while Apple\u2019s market capitalization was $2.875 trillion a day earlier. Worries about smartphone demand have pushed Apple\u2019s shares down 3 percent so far in 2024. Microsoft, on the other hand, is up about 3 percent on the year-to-date after, surging 57 percent in 2023 in a rally driven in part by its lead in generative artificial intelligence through an investment in ChatGPT-maker OpenAI. Apple\u2019s market capitalization peaked at $3.081 trillion on Dec. 14. Microsoft has incorporated OpenAI\u2019s technology across its suite of productivity software, and its lead on AI adoption has also created an opportunity to challenge Google\u2019s dominance of web search. Apple has been grappling with a dip in demand, including for its flagship iPhone. Demand in China, a major market, has slumped as the country\u2019s economy makes a slow recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic. Microsoft has briefly taken the lead over Apple as the planet\u2019s most valuable company only a handful of times since 2018. The most recent occurrence was in 2021, when concerns about supply-chain shortages related to the pandemic hit Apple\u2019s stock price. Apple\u2019s most recent quarterly report, released in November, gave a sales forecast for the holiday quarter that missed Wall Street expectations, which was impacted by weak demand for iPads and wearables. Analysts predict Apple will post revenue up 0.7 percent to $117.9 billion for the December quarter, with the firm due to report its results on Feb. 1. Your email address will not be published.
