The Student and Small Business Cyber Risk Project, supported by the Victorian Government, partners Victorian TAFE students who are enrolled in a cybersecurity qualification with an industry mentor and a small business in Victoria to conduct cybersecurity risk assessments. Following a successful pilot in 2023 involving 64 students and 24 small businesses, organisers are now calling for more small businesses and mentors to sign up for the 2024 intake. They expect to enrol 200 new students this year, with plans to roll out nationally over the next two years. As part of the program students are partnered with mentors from NAB and Microsoft to conduct a cybersecurity risk assessment using publicly available tools. The small business will receive a report with steps they could take to improve cybersecurity in their business. \u201cA lot of smaller companies struggle with a lack of skills or understanding of where to start when it comes to cybersecurity,\u201d said Mark Anderson, National Security Officer at Microsoft Australia and New Zealand. In many cases, taking a few simple steps can be enough to protect against 99 per cent of cyber threats. It\u2019s been great to be involved in this unique and highly scalable program, which is contributing to strengthening our nation\u2019s cybersecurity defences.\u00a0\u2013 Mark Anderson, National Security Officer, Microsoft A/NZ According to the Australian Signals Directorate\u2019s recent Annual Cyber Threat Report, the average cost per cybercrime reported for a small business has risen by 15 per cent year on year, to $46,000 in 2023. Further, research from NAB shows small businesses feel they are ill-prepared in the face of cyberattacks. Only 15 per cent of small to medium enterprises (SMEs) in Australia conduct extensive training around scams and other cyber risks, while only 4 in 10 felt that they were vigilant around their cybersecurity. \u201cAs Australia\u2019s largest business bank, we feel a deep responsibility to support the small business sector,\u201d said Sandro Bucchianeri, Chief Security Officer, NAB. \u201cThey are a huge driver of economic growth, employing two in every three Australian workers. Yet, they remain one of the most vulnerable communities to cyber attack, as they continue to face increasing costs of goods, ongoing labour shortages and rising rates of cybercrime.\u201d \u201cAs we\u2019ve seen over recent weeks, cyber criminals are stepping up their tactics, targeting high profile Australian businesses on a near-daily basis, impacting everyone from our hospital system, legal system and business community. Initiatives like these will help the small business sector respond if they are caught up in a hack,\u201d said Mr. Bucchianeri. Partnering cyber students with small businesses The Victorian Government has invested approximately $400,000 in the program, with in-kind contributions from other stakeholders taking the program\u2019s value to nearly $1 million. The program is aligned with the Victorian state\u2019s five-year, $50 million cyber strategy and its $64 million Digital Jobs program, both of which were launched in 2021. \u201cThe Allan Labor Government is proud to invest in exciting projects that enhance Victoria\u2019s high reputation as a leading digital economy,\u201d said Minister for Skills and TAFE Gayle Tierney. \u201cThe Student and Small Business Cyber Risk Project is a great example of government and industry working together to ensure Victoria has the skilled workers needed for in-demand industries like cybersecurity.\u201d Students who complete the program receive an industry certificate, verifying their satisfactory participation in the project and improving their readiness to participate in the workforce. \u201cWhat makes this program unique is that it\u2019s industry-driven, industry-based and built in conjunction with organisations who know cybersecurity and Australia\u2019s small business sector,\u201d said Dominic Schipano, National Executive Officer at CITT. \u201cThe program empowers TAFE students in Victoria on their journey to build a rewarding career in cybersecurity with not only a qualification but also valuable on-the-job experience. At the same time, it gives Victorian small businesses access to skilled and employable talent who will help them better understand cybersecurity within their business.\u201d Collaborative partnership enables innovative approach to cyber skilling CITT is managing the program and is closely supported by Microsoft and NAB, alongside the Victorian TAFE Network, The Victorian Small Business Commission and Victorian Skills Authority. Microsoft, in conjunction with CITT and its partners has developed the program\u2019s learning resources, and alongside NAB, has provided mentors and facilitators who supervise the students during their placement with the participating small businesses. Cybersecurity is a team sport and we all have a role to play. This program is a great example of the impact that public-private partnerships can have in fortifying our nation\u2019s cyber defences, and paving the way for a safer digital landscape.\u00a0\u2013 Mark Anderson, National Security Officer, Microsoft A/NZ From a small business participant: One of the first businesses selected to participate in the project was Bravo Careers, a Melbourne-based career development consultancy that offers services across ANZ, Asia, Europe and India. Client Relations Manager, Jonathon Hazelton, was responsible for overseeing the project and the four students who were selected to assess the company. \u201cAs a career-focused consultancy, we manage a significant amount of sensitive data every day. We\u2019re also a small company and, as with many businesses our size, we have faced challenges in the past that made cybersecurity a priority. But, as a small group of employees, this can be challenging, as none of us are experts in this area. That\u2019s why we were interested in participating in the project,\u201d said Mr Hazelton. \u201cThe risk assessment was key in helping us understand our current systems and processes, and to receive guidelines and recommendations on how to improve them. \u201c As a result of that, we were able to make more informed decisions and develop a clear cybersecurity policy that covers aspects such as data collection, access and storage. It also helped us to adopt a more proactive cybersecurity approach, rather than waiting for problems to happen. \u2013 Jonathan Hazelton, Bravo Careers Small businesses can apply to participate in the program by contacting CITT.
