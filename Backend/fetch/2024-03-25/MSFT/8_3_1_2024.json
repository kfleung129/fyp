    "text": " Elon Musk is suing OpenAI and its CEO Sam Altman. According to Musk, the ChatGPT maker\u2019s multibillion-dollar alliance with Microsoft has compromised the startup\u2019s original mission to build artificial intelligence systems for the benefit of humanity. And non-profit. Musk was among the first financiers of OpenAi and until 2018 a member of the Board of Directors. \u201cOpenAI, Inc. has been transformed into a de facto closed-source subsidiary of the largest technology company in the world: Microsoft,\u201d Musk\u2019s lawyers wrote in a document filed Thursday in a San Francisco court. The choice to accept Microsoft\u2019s investments, Musk\u2019s lawyers argue, would have effectively distorted the company\u2019s nature. Bringing it into the hands of an IT giant who would secret its projects. The lawyers claim that the company has kept \u201cabsolute secrecy\u201d about the design of the GPT-4, its most advanced artificial intelligence model. Musk co-founded OpenAI in 2015, but resigned from its board of directors six years ago. Today he leads the electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla and the rocket manufacturer SpaceX and purchased Twitter for 44 billion dollars in October 2022. Many believe that the basis of his departure from OpenAi are disagreements with Sam Altman, linked above all to the fact that the second would have denied him a leadership role in society. Musk launched his own generative artificial intelligence project a year ago: Grok. OpenAI is planning to appoint several new board members in March, the Washington Post reported Thursday. ChatGPT, OpenAI\u2019s chatbot, became the world\u2018s fastest-growing software application within six months of its launch in November 2022. It was the program that effectively kicked off a frantic race in Generative Artificial Intelligence, causing many companies to accelerate their projects. Meta, Google and Microsoft themselves published their large-scale linguistic systems in the following months.
