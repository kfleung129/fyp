    "text": "By\nAJ Vicens January 19, 2024 Hackers working on behalf of Russia\u2019s foreign intelligence service successfully penetrated a limited number of Microsoft corporate email accounts, stealing some emails and attached documents, the company announced Friday. Microsoft detected the attack from a hacking unit tied to Russia\u2019s External Intelligence Service (SVR) on Jan. 12 \u201cand immediately activated our response process to investigate, disrupt malicious activity, mitigate the attack, and deny the threat actor further access,\u201d the company said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. The attackers used a password spray attack \u2014\u00a0a process where multiple user names are tried against a constant password for a given account \u2014\u00a0to compromise a \u201clegacy, non-production test tenant account and gain a foothold, and then used the account\u2019s permissions to access a very small percentage of Microsoft\u2019s corporate email accounts, including members of our senior leadership team and employees in our cybersecurity, legal, and other functions, and exfiltrated some emails and attached documents.\u201d The company\u2019s investigation suggests the attackers were \u201cinitially\u201d targeting email accounts for information related to themselves. \u201cThe attack was not the result of a vulnerability in Microsoft products or services,\u201d the company added. \u201cTo date, there is no evidence that the threat actor had any access to customer environments, production systems, source code, or AI systems. We will notify customers if any action is required.\u201d This is the second time in the past six months that Microsoft has disclosed an embarrassing attack by state-aligned hackers. In July, the company announced that a Chinese-linked operation had successfully obtained an internal consumer signing key and used that to obtain access to email accounts connected with U.S. government officials. The SVR hacking unit that attacked Microsoft \u2014\u00a0tracked by Microsoft as Midnight Blizzard, but also as Nobelium, APT29, or Cozy Bear \u2014\u00a0was behind the attack on SolarWinds, first announced in 2020, which gave the hackers access to a variety of U.S. government agencies, along with hundreds of other victims, the White House said in April 2021. The group was also involved with the hack of the Democratic National Committee leading up to the 2016 U.S. elections, playing a key role in the sweeping Russian election interference operation. "
