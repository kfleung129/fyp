    "text": "Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: A Russian hacking group gained access to some email accounts of Microsoft senior leaders, the software giant disclosed in a regulatory filing Friday afternoon. \u201cThe Microsoft security team detected a nation-state attack on our corporate systems on January 12, 2024, and immediately activated our response process to investigate, disrupt malicious activity, mitigate the attack, and deny the threat actor further access,\u201d the Microsoft Security Response\u00a0Center said in a blog post. \u201cMicrosoft has identified the threat actor as\u00a0Midnight Blizzard, the Russian state-sponsored actor also known as Nobelium.\u201d Nobelium, notably, is the same group responsible for the infamous SolarWinds breach back in 2020. Hackers were able to gain access to \u201ca very small percentage of Microsoft corporate email accounts,\u201d the blog post added, including accounts belonging to members of its senior leadership team and employees in its cybersecurity and legal departments. The company said that hackers were able to exfiltrate some emails and attached documents, though the preliminary investigation indicates that the attackers seemed to be seeking information related to Midnight Blizzard itself. That mirrors\u00a0what the\u00a0same group\u00a0did when it used tampered software\u00a0made by\u00a0SolarWinds\u00a0to infiltrate US agencies in 2020\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and then\u00a0sought to track how the US government was responding to its intrusions. Microsoft said it is in the process of notifying employees whose email was accessed. There is currently no evidence that the hackers had any access to customer environments or AI systems, Microsoft said. The attack began in late November 2023, the company said, and hackers gained an initial foothold using a so-called \u201cpassword spray attack.\u201d Password spraying refers to the attempt to access a large number of accounts using commonly known passwords. The company said the investigation is ongoing and it will continue working with law enforcement and appropriate regulators, pledging to share more information publicly as it becomes available. The attack highlights \u201cthe continued risk posed to all organizations from well-resourced nation-state threat actors like\u00a0Midnight Blizzard,\u201d the company said. Microsoft systems have been the target of\u00a0multiple recent high-profile hacking efforts. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency did not immediately respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment on the hack Friday. Microsoft declined a request for additional comment. In an emailed statement to CNN, the FBI said: \u201cThe FBI is aware of the incident and we are diligently working with our federal partners to provide assistance. As always, we encourage any victim of a cyber incident to contact their local FBI field office.\u201d This story has been updated with additional developments. Most stock quote data provided by BATS.
