    "text": "Much like the rest of the tech community, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella was smitten with the idea of Rabbit R1, the AI assistant unveiled at CES 2024 in Las Vegas last week. In fact, Nadella was so impressed with Rabbit R1 that he compared the AI assistant's launch presentation to Steve Jobs' highly acclaimed presentation of the original iPhone in 2007.

All you need to know about the AI-powered smart assistant launched at CES 2024 Speaking about the Rabbit R1 in an interaction with Bloomberg, Nadella said, \u201cI think CES this year was very interesting. I thought I thought the demo of the Rabbit OS and the device was fantastic. I think I must say, after Jobs and the launch of iPhone, probably one of the most impressive presentations I've seen of capturing the vision of what is possible going forward for what is an agent-centric Operating System (OS) interface.\" \u201cI think that's what everybody is going seeking. Which device will make it and so on is unclear. If you have a breakthrough in natural interface where this idea that you have to go one app at a time and all of the cognitive load is with you as a human, does seem like there can be a real breakthrough.\" Nadella added.
