    "text": "An APT group has been exploiting a Microsoft zero-day vulnerability in attacks in order to bypass Microsoft Defender SmartScreen and infect financial market trader companies with the DarkMe malware. Researchers with Trend Micro\u2019s Zero Day Initiative said that the known APT group, called Water Hydra, was leveraging the flaw (CVE-2024-21412) in order to bypass Defender SmartScreen, Microsoft\u2019s feature in Windows 10 and 11 that is aimed at preventing phishing and malware attacks. The attack was first found by the researchers in late December, and Microsoft on Tuesday disclosed the important-severity flaw and issued a fix as part of its regularly scheduled Patch Tuesday updates. \u201cThreat actors are constantly finding new ways of identifying and exploiting gaps to bypass security measures,\u201d said Trend Micro researchers on Tuesday. \u201cWe found that the bypass of CVE-2023-36025 (a previously patched SmartScreen vulnerability) led to the discovery and exploitation of CVE-2024-21412. This highlights how threat actors can circumvent patches by identifying new vectors of attack around a patched software component.\u201d Water Hydra was first discovered in 2021 and has previously launched attacks against banks, cryptocurrency platforms, gambling sites and casinos, and stock trading platforms. The group has previously used undisclosed vulnerabilities - including the WinRAR code execution flaw (CVE-2023-38831) - as part of its attack chain to target the financial industry. Researchers observed the group leveraging the Microsoft flaw as part of what they called a streamlined infection process since late January. The attack started with the group launching spear-phishing attacks in forex trading forums and stock trading Telegram channels in order to target potential traders with the DarkMe malware. The group would post messages with links, which pretended to ask for trading advice or share financial tools. These posts instead linked back to a landing page hosted on a compromised Russian language forex, stock, and cryptocurrency news site, which served a second link to a JPEG file. \u201cIn Water Hydra\u2019s case, the group used internet shortcuts disguised as a JPEG image that, when selected by the user, allows the threat actor to exploit CVE-2024-21412,\u201d said researchers. \u201cThe group can then bypass Microsoft Defender SmartScreen and fully compromise the Windows host as part of its attack chain.\u201d The DarkMe malware allowed the APT to gather information on the victim companies and establish a command-and-control (C2) connection for further malicious activity. Microsoft in its regularly scheduled updates on Tuesday released over 70 fixes for other vulnerabilities, including a second actively exploited bypass bug in Windows SmartScreen Security (CVE-2024-21351). Microsoft said an attacker that successfully exploited this flaw could bypass the SmartScreen user experience, but that an authorized attacker would need to first send targets a malicious file and convince them to open it. Overall, researchers said CISOs can strategically position themselves to prepare for zero-day vulnerabilities like this one by implementing vulnerability management procedures into their security programs - as well as threat intelligence and incident response processes - to better identify and prioritize flaws. \u201cGiven the potential impact of a successful zero-day vulnerability exploitation, it is important that chief information security officers (CISOs) and other decision-makers are able to adopt a multilayered approach to prepare for and address the risks of zero-day vulnerabilities,\u201d said researchers. Microsoft has patched critical-severity flaws in Windows Hyper-V as part of its regularly scheduled updates, which contained no The Russian threat group known as Midnight Blizzard and APT29 gained access to some Microsoft source code repositories and other Flaws in Citrix NetScaler and ADC Gateway have historically been targeted by threat actors, though researchers don't believe the "
