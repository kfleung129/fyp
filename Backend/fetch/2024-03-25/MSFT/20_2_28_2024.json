Analysis February 28, 2024 Daphn\u00e9 Leprince-Ringuet 5 min read In just a few months, Mistral AI has become France\u2019s most prized AI company. Much of the goodwill has come from the promise of creating a European champion that could compete against US giants like ChatGPT creator OpenAI, with an open-source product that reflects the continent\u2019s push for more transparency in the sector. From the start, Mistral has made a point of providing open-source AI models \u2014 which means that users can download and use the technology\u2019s source code for free \u2014 as a European alternative to less transparent products such as those developed by OpenAI, which are known as closed source or proprietary. So when the startup announced it is partnering with US tech behemoth Microsoft \u2014 in a deal that saw the tech giant take a stake in Mistral\u2014 to distribute its new large language model (LLM), Mistral Large, which is not open source, some sceptical eyebrows were raised. Unlike Mistral\u2019s first open-source model releases, Mistral Large is a ready-made API that can be used for a fee, and gives no access to the code. Some critics see the move as a U-turn on Mistral\u2019s original commitment to open source that is not unlike OpenAI\u2019s shift from open to closed models. It wasn\u2019t long before social media filled up with debates as to whether this means the company is going down the same route as its US competitor. \u201cIt is so over,\u201d wrote one user on an open source subreddit. \u201cGREED,\u201d wrote another. \u201cThe idealistic stance they initially had around openness and transparency is now probably not going to be implemented fully,\u201d says Andreas Goeldi, an AI-focused partner at Swiss VC firm b2venture. \u201cThey still have open models and they seem to want to continue to do that, but it is not as clear as it was until now.\u201d Some will see the uproar as hysterical hand wringing. Mistral has always made clear its strategy was to offer commercial models alongside its open-source offering. Monetising open source, which is by definition free software, is a challenge for many European startups. Some, like the UK\u2019s Stability AI, have also moved away from a fully open-source business model to generate more revenue. \u201cIt\u2019s always relatively hard to monetise open source, and you have to find a way to make people pay anyway,\u201d says Goeldi. \u201cTo turn this into a real business, [Mistral] had to find a way to monetise it more.\u201d But it\u2019s not only about the technicalities of AI models. Mistral has always presented its open-source strategy as part of what makes it a distinctly European alternative to closed-source US companies like OpenAI. \u201cWe have been pursuing a clear trajectory: that of creating a European champion with a global vocation in generative artificial intelligence, based on an open, responsible and decentralised approach to technology,\u201d said the company\u2019s cofounder Arthur Mensch last December, when the company released Mixtral 8x7B. This is why the company\u2019s release of a closed-source model at the same time as it inks a partnership with Microsoft has raised some concerns with critics who say the deal has the potential to further strengthen the tech giant\u2019s control of the generative AI market. In a leaked pitch deck seen by Sifted in June, shortly after the company raised a \u20ac105m seed round, the company wrote: \u201cAn oligopoly is shaping up\u2026 All major actors are currently US-based, and Europe has yet to see the appearance of a serious contender.\u201d The European Commission has said that it will scrutinise whether the Microsoft partnership aligns with the bloc\u2019s competition rules, according to Bloomberg. As part of the deal, Mistral\u2019s models will be distributed on the tech giant\u2019s cloud computing platform Azure. Microsoft will also provide Mistral with the computing infrastructure it needs to develop and train its models \u2014 in exchange for a small stake in the company. It is a very similar setup to that of OpenAI \u2014 the only other AI company to have a distribution deal with Microsoft \u2014 and one that will reinforce the dominance of Microsoft in the sector. \u201cIt\u2019s one large step for Mistral, one giant leap for Microsoft,\u201d says Yann Lechelle, former CEO of French cloud computing platform Scaleway and now founder of open-source startup Probabl. The deal has the potential to enable Mistral to access a much larger pool of potential customers and to significantly increase its revenues, but does show that it\u2019s hard to do business in this field without the support of a Big Tech partner. \u201cThis partnership between Microsoft is a major and logical opportunity for Mistral,\u201d says Lechelle.\u201cUnfortunately, it shows that distribution of any major\u2026SaaS offering, AI or otherwise, depends and reinforces already dominating hyperscalers.\" Whether this is problematic is up for debate. Mistral\u2019s deal with Microsoft could enable the company to grow bigger and eventually compete against monopolistic US technologies. \u201cI think they are trying to find an approach that enables them to keep their positioning \u2014 a European AI company that is sovereign and open source \u2014 while accelerating their revenue,\u201d says Maxime Corbani, senior associate at deeptech VC firm Runa Capital. And if anyone did think it could develop a world-leading AI company without signing a deal with a member of the oligopoly it sought to oppose, Goeldi says it was shortsighted. \u201cIt\u2019s the reality facing Europe at this time,\u201d he says. \u201cMaybe people were a bit naive about how easy it would be to do this in standalone.\u201d Mistral have not responded to a request for comment.
