The post garnered more than 7,000 likes in two days. Similar versions of the claim were shared on Instagram, Facebook and X, formerly Twitter. More from the Fact-Check Team: How we pick and research claims | Email newsletter | Facebook page A spokesperson for the company said no such plan has been announced. The claim originated from a website that regularly publishes misinformation. Emelia Katon, a senior account executive at Microsoft, told USA TODAY in an email that the claim was false. The article, published by The People's Voice, bases its claim on a January NBC interview with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella. The interview doesn't show the CEO discussing the disabling of personal computers, however. Nadella talks about misinformation, the upcoming election and the tech industry's work to detect deepfakes and AI. When asked if he wanted to put a stop to any of the misinformation online, Nadella expressed his desire to work alongside tools such as AI. \"With all of the technology, I am more in the camp of 'Let us make sure that the technology ultimately is just a tool,'\" he said in the interview before advertising Microsoft's new AI-powered software called Copilot.

Among those debunked by USA TODAY in recent months are false claims that the World Health Organization demanded surveillance powers to monitor every person on earth\u00a0and that\u00a0Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley said only Bill Gates 'can save humanity.' USA TODAY reached out to The People's Voice and the user who shared the post for comment but did not immediately receive a response. Lead Stories and the Associated Press also debunked the claim.
