A pure monopoly, by definition, refers to a company with no competition whatsoever \u2013 a sole provider of a particular product or service. An illustration of this was Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), which, at one point, stood as the exclusive seller of software and operating systems for computers, leaving consumers with only one option for these products. The connection between monopolies and U.S. consumers is rife with contradictions. Americans harbor suspicions about companies that wield a dominant influence over their industries, closely monitoring how these entities leverage their size and market dominance to maximize profits. Paradoxically, while Americans express concerns about monopolistic power, they readily embrace the advantages associated with economies of scale. Large market leaders are often preferred over small family businesses attempting to compete, fostering an environment that encourages rather than discourages the expansion of market share by substantial corporations. Monopolies wield significant pricing power, a crucial factor that investor Warren Buffett carefully considers when selecting stocks for his globally tracked portfolio. During his 2011 testimony before the US Congress, Buffett cited pricing power as a vital criterion for evaluating a business. He emphasized that a business with the ability to increase prices without losing market share to competitors exhibits a robust business model. While pure monopolies are rare, some contemporary companies exhibit what can be termed near-monopolies. Benefiting from economies of scale, these corporations establish formidable barriers that discourage new entrants from challenging their dominance. Market leaders like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) that have penetrated a sector and captured a substantial portion of the market are deemed as some of the best monopoly stocks in that regard. In a bid to expand their market share and revenue, these companies often diversify their product offerings. While they may allows some space for competition, companies like the ones mentioned above boast considerable market power, exerting significant influence over the industry. In theory, a near-monopoly may not pose a problem, but in practice, such a system may not work in the best interests of consumers unless it is closely monitored. In the absence of competition, monopolies may set excessive prices, offer poor-quality products, and eliminate alternatives to maximize their own profits. While the law doesn't outright prohibit monopolies, various regulations have been implemented to ensure that such companies operate fairly. The Sherman Antitrust Act is a significant piece of legislation used to break up companies that hinder competition and prevent mergers and acquisitions that could lead to a virtual monopoly. While these regulations may limit the profits of monopolies, investors often find these stocks appealing. The substantial market share held by monopolies is likely to contribute to growth and value over time, mitigating some of the inherent risks associated with investing in any security.

In its Q2 2023 investor letter, Broyhill Asset Management, a boutique investment firm, commented about Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (NYSE:BUD). Here is what the firm said: \u201cThe largest detractors to performance over the quarter were First Horizon Corp (FHN), Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (NYSE:BUD), and Bayer (BAYRY). Problems at Anheuser Busch InBev began on April 1 with Dylan Mulvaney\u2019s social media post, which ignited a fiery backlash amongst Bud Light customers across \u2018Merica. With volumes down sharply, and competitors gaining share at BUD\u2019s expense, operational deleveraging is set to weigh heavily on US margins amid peak demand pressure in the second quarter. Despite severe US headwinds (second-quarter operating profit maybe half of last year\u2019s levels), we still expect BUD to grow consolidated operating profit at a mid-single-digit rate for the full year. With current issues well understood and investor sentiment in the gutters, we see significant upside in a stock, which is approaching a double-digit FCF yield. With FX headwinds and rising input costs reversing course, increasing margins are likely to drive positive surprises into FY24 as continued deleveraging accrues more value to shareholders.\u201d Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 24 Sirius XM Holdings Inc.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) was one of them.\u00a0Here\u00a0is what the fund said: \u201cAfter a strong start to the year, shares of Apple Inc. partially retraced their gains this quarter. Mixed second calendar quarter financial results, with iPhone, iPad, and Wearables revenue coming in just shy of consensus expectations, coupled with elevated investor concerns about the macro economy and potential weakness in consumer spending later this year, pressured shares. Despite these quarterly fluctuations in product sales, we are encouraged by several long-term trends, including: (1) revenue from higher-margin services like the App Store, iCloud, and Apple Pay, which are growing faster than the overall business, driving better revenue visibility and higher free-cash-flow (FCF) margins; (2) continued gains in global market share in smartphones, wearables, and other hardware categories; and (3) consistent returns of capital to shareholders via share repurchases and dividends. On top of these trends in the core business, Apple is thoughtfully investing in new categories like augmented reality, search, financial services, and streaming media content. We took advantage of weakness in the quarter to add to our position in Apple.\u201d  Click to continue reading and see 5 Near Monopoly Stocks in the US.
