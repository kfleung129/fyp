Invest Now Sam Altman\u2019s\u00a0goal of raising about\u00a0$7 trillion\u00a0to make artificial-intelligence chips tells a story beyond his borderline-insane ambitions. First, the infrastructure needed to\u00a0build\u00a0AI has become exorbitantly expensive. Second, most of that value is still \u2014 still! \u2014 held by a\u00a0handful of large technology companies \u2014\u00a0and the oligopoly is only going to get worse. For all the competition that was spurred by the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022, and the flurry of new startups that jumped into the hyped-up generative AI market, most of those new players will likely fold or be folded into the incumbents over the next year or so. The costs of doing business are too high for them to survive on their own. Take Sasha Haco, the chief executive officer of Unitary, which scans videos on social media for rule-breaking content. It would cost her company\u00a0100 times more than it charges clients\u00a0to subscribe to OpenAI\u2019s video-scanning AI tools. So Unitary makes its own models, which is a high-wire balancing act in itself. Her startup\u00a0needs to rent access to those rare AI chips via cloud\u00a0vendors like Microsoft Corp. and Amazon.com Inc\u2019s Amazon Web Services. Those chips have doubled in price since 2020, Haco says, and they\u2019re difficult to reserve. \u201cWe\u2019ve had times when we can\u2019t get access to what we need and so we have to pay 10 times the price,\u201d she told me. Unitary makes it work, but Haco admits that\u00a0no generative AI startup has figured out how to run a low-cost business at scale, at least not in the same way that large tech firms have. Another AI founder in San Francisco tells me\u00a0that some of his peers who have to rent AI chips and cloud computing find that the only way they make money \u201cis if people don\u2019t use the product.\u201d \u201cThe best analogy is electricity,\u201d says Ronald Ashri, CEO of startup Dialogue.ai, which creates tailored\u00a0chatbots for regulated industries. \u201cYou\u2019re plugged into a foundation model and that is your electricity, and you are consuming it constantly. The consumption is the single highest cost in the solution that we deliver to clients.\u201d Generative AI startups can build their technology in two different ways. They can develop their own version of OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 or Google\u2019s Gemini for instance, a so-called foundation model\u00a0that requires hundreds of millions of dollars in\u00a0investment. Or they can build on top of an existing model, which only needs tens of millions in investment and which the vast\u00a0majority of AI startups do today. In both cases, the prime beneficiaries are cloud-computing giants Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google, and AI chip maker Nvidia Corp. \"Right now all these startups take money from venture capital investors and give it to cloud companies and Nvidia,\u201d says Rodolfo Rosini, CEO of chip company Vaire Computing.\u00a0 That\u2019s why Nvidia has seen its shares more than double in the last year, putting it near a $2 trillion valuation. You would think that large tech firms would look across the landscape\u00a0of AI startups and lick\u00a0their chops at this dynamic, hungry to\u00a0acquire new talent\u00a0and ideas. But it\u2019s not that simple. Most new generative AI startups don\u2019t have\u00a0many hard-core AI research scientists to make them an attractive way to buy talent, since they\u2019re reliant on\u00a0the bigger, third-party\u00a0models. Those startups are often staffed with regular software engineers. On top of that, big tech acquirers like Meta Platforms Inc. are already investing heavily in their own internal AI efforts, says Nathan Benaich, founder of London-based AI-focused venture capital firm Air Street Capital, and many of those companies were cutting significant costs just last year. An even bigger stumbling block is regulation. Big tech firms are rightly wary of antitrust blowback on any major AI deals thanks to the recent wave of\u00a0stricter antitrust enforcement. Hence the shift to\u00a0investing instead. Big tech investments in AI startups hit more than $24.6 billion in 2023, up from $4.4 billion in 2022 \u2014 a shift aimed at avoiding regulatory scrutiny, according to Brendan Burke, a senior analyst at market research firm Pitchbook, who also provided the figures. Now that the US Federal Trade Commission\u00a0is probing some of those investments\u00a0\u2014 including Microsoft\u2019s multibillion-dollar bet\u00a0on OpenAI and Amazon\u2019s investment in Anthropic \u2014 the pendulum could swing back towards conventional acquisitions, Burke says. The view is mixed among\u00a0venture capital investors and startups about how much M&A will happen in the coming year. What seems most likely: Regulatory pressure will prevent takeovers of leading AI startups that have valuations over $1 billion, like Perplexity, Cohere, Character.ai and Inflection. They\u2019ll attract\u00a0investment\u00a0instead \u2014 at least for the time being \u2014 with some of the long tail of smaller players getting scooped up\u00a0while the rest of the upstarts fold under cost pressures. The result will be a playing field\u00a0that looks very similar to the one we have today, where the biggest players continue to get larger. That\u2019ll be a win for big tech and arguably for consumers, who\u00a0will continue getting cheap access to AI. But it\u2019s a loss for competition and society too.\u00a0When\u00a0the general-purpose AI that gets\u00a0woven\u00a0into all aspects of our lives is dominated by a small handful of firms, that gives enormous power and influence to\u00a0those firms.\u00a0We\u2019d be better off avoiding that outcome.
