    "text": "Half of Fortune 500 companies using Microsoft\u2019s OpenAI services February 1, 2024 Microsoft reported a 24% increase in cloud revenue with AI \u201cwinning new customers,\u201d according to CEO Satya Nadella. He revealed that Azure AI now has\u00a0 53,000 customers \u2013 and over one-third are new to Azure over the past 12 months, during the earnings call for the company\u2019s Q2 fiscal 2024, which runs from October to December 2023. Nadella said customers were flocking to its platform to access large language models from its partners such as Cohere, Meta, and Mistral \u201cwithout having to manage [the] underlying infrastructure.\u201d Nadella told analysts that Azure OpenAI and then OpenAI\u2019s own APIs on top of Azure were \u201cmajor drivers\u201d of the company\u2019s AI services tailwind, with over half of Fortune 500 firms using either service. \u201cThere is a lot of the small batch training that goes on, whether it's a graph or fine-tuning, and then lots of people who are starting to use models as a service with all the other new models, but it's predominantly Azure OpenAI today.\u201d Another factor the Microsoft CEO touted as a driving force for bringing in new customers was the company\u2019s small language models (SLMs), like Phi. While on par with the company\u2019s larger models, these smaller systems are small enough to run on a consumer device \u2013 meaning they do not cost as much to run. Related:Microsoft is Now Worth $3 Trillion, Thanks to Gen AI \u201cAnker, Ashley, AT&T, EY, and Thomson Reuters, for example, are all already exploring how to use our SLM Phi for their applications, and we have great momentum with Azure OpenAI Service,\u201d the Microsoft CEO revealed. \u201cWe move from talking about AI to applying AI at scale,\u201d Nadella said. \"By infusing AI across every layer of our tech stack, we\u2019re winning new customers and helping drive new benefits and productivity gains across every sector.\u201d Microsoft reported revenue of $62 billion, up 18% from a year ago. Net income rose 33% to $21.9 billion ($2.93 per diluted share) in the quarter. The stock fell 2.7% to $397.58 on Jan. 31, the first trading day after the earnings report. BofA Global Research analyst Brad Sills said Microsoft\u2019s outlook for Q3 was lower than Street expectations due to weakness in games. Also, growth in company sign-ups for Office was \u201cdisappointing\u201d due to lackluster adoption of Copilot for Microsoft 365. The rest of the business was \u201csolid,\u201d according to his research note that was shared with AI Business. Pricing for Copilot E3 ($36 per user per month add-on to 365 subscription) and E5 ($57 per user per month add-on) plans have been criticized as high when it was revealed last July. Investors also punished Google-parent Alphabet\u2019s stock this week even after posting a 13% increase in revenue to $86.3 billion and 52% increase in net income for the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2023. BofA Global Research analyst Justin Post said search revenue fell short of \u201chigh expectations.\u201d Related:Test Drive: Microsoft Copilot Pro is Useful But has Flaws Nadella told analysts the company expects revenue for Copilot for Microsoft 365 to grow \u201cover time.\u201d The company did not disclose the number of users the service has amassed, but Nadella likened the rate of adoption to the early days of the PC. \u201cJust like PCs became standard issue at some point after PCs being adopted by early adopters,\u201d he said of AI offerings like 365 Copilot. The Microsoft CEO expressed optimism, however, contending that the improvement 365 Copilot could bring to work and workflows will change \u201cas people summarize faster, draft regulatory submissions faster, chat to get knowledge from your business.\u201d Also benefiting from Microsoft\u2019s AI push was GitHub, which recorded revenue growth of over 40% year-over-year. The company said that GitHub Copilot, the AI-powered coding assistant tool, helped drive that revenue growth. Nadella told analysts that GitHub Copilot has over 1.3 million paid subscribers, up 30% quarter-over-quarter. Some 50,000 organizations are using the business version of GitHub Copilot, including the likes of Dell, Etsy and Goldman Sachs. The Microsoft CEO revealed plans to launch new AI-powered security features for the service but gave no solid indication as to what those would be.
