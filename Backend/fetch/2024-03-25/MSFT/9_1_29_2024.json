Microsoft India and South Asia's President Puneet Chandok, in an internal email sent a few weeks ago, stated that the tech giant is committed to using technology to create more opportunities in the nation, as demonstrated by Nadella's visit. \u201cAI is playing a game-changing role in shaping \u2018India\u2019s Techade\u2019 and will make India and South Asia one of the most exciting markets for technology,\" the email read as quoted by MoneyControl.
