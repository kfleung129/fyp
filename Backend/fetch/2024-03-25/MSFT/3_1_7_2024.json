    "text": "Microsoft Corporation is close to regaining the title of the\nmost expensive company in the United States,\nAzernews reports. To do this, it only needs to surpass Apple, whose capitalization\nis estimated at $2.83 trillion. Microsoft's market value is $2.73\ntrillion. The increase in the value of Microsoft shares is due to an\nincrease in corporate expenses on a global scale, which, in turn,\ncontributes to the development of the Azure cloud computing\nbusiness. Success in this area is also associated with the growing\npopularity and application of artificial intelligence (AI). AI technologies have helped Microsoft outperform one of its main\ncompetitors, Google (a subsidiary of Alphabet), in the field of\nartificial intelligence. Over the last period, Microsoft shares\nhave risen by 57%, while Apple shares have risen by 47%. --- Follow us on Twitter @AzerNewsAz \u00a9 Azernews.az 2024 "
