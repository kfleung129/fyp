The research firm came away impressed from the demand for Microsoft's GitHub Copilot and learned that the company intends to release an Enterprise Copilot SKU at the end of February at a $39 price point. GitHub Copilot, created by GitHub and OpenAI, is a cloud-based AI tool that allows programmers to write code faster. The event, which featured talks from Microsoft executives including Chief Executive Satya Nadella, Azure CTO Mark Russinovich and cloud vice president Corey Sanders, reinforced the analysts belief in the company's generative AI leadership. Redmond, Wash.-based Microsoft is slated to report fourth-quarter results on Jan. 30 after the close of trading.
