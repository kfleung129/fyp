    "text": "Artificial intelligence will be the name of the game once again when Microsoft Corp. reports earnings Tuesday afternoon. AI is an engine for Microsoft\u2019s \n        MSFT,\n        -0.15%\n       Azure cloud-computing business, and analysts expect that business to have grown at a 27% rate on a constant-currency basis during the latest quarter. They have the same growth projection for the current quarter as well. \u201cWhile macro continues to linger, we have broadly heard of stabilization and in some cases acceleration in cloud consumption,\u201d Jefferies analyst Brent Thill wrote recently. Meanwhile, Wall Street will also be watching to see how AI is impacting the company\u2019s software portfolio. Microsoft is an investor in OpenAI, and it\u2019s been putting AI features within its software products lately, including through the Copilot launch for Microsoft 365 enterprise customers late last year. Evercore ISI\u2019s Kirk Materne wrote that \u201cthe interest level in Copilot is extremely high,\u201d and investors will want to see how that factors into the company\u2019s financials. Wolfe Research analyst Alex Zukin, meanwhile, saw a buying opportunity. \u201cWe see this quarter as another opportunity to buy before expectations start to get out of control,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWhile our preview does call for\u00a0Azure acceleration and\u00a0Copilot\u00a0upside, our view is that sentiment remains mixed.\u201d See more: Microsoft earnings are on deck, and the whole software sector is riding on them Here are the key numbers to watch in the fiscal second-quarter report. Earnings: The FactSet consensus calls for $2.77 in fiscal second-quarter adjusted earnings per share, up from $2.32 in the year-earlier period. Revenue: Analysts tracked by FactSet are modeling $61.1 billion in revenue, up from $52.7 billion a year before. The consensus view calls for 10% growth, to $18.8 billion, in revenue from the productivity and business-processes segment, which houses Office. Analysts are looking for Intelligent Cloud revenue to rise 18% to $25.3 billion. That unit includes Azure. The More Personal Computing business, which includes Xbox and Windows, is expected to have grown 18% to $16.8 billion. Stock movement: Microsoft shares have gained 21% over the past three months, and they\u2019re up 69% over a 12-month span. The stock has gained following two of the company\u2019s past five earnings reports, though it gained 3.1% after the most recent report. Of the 52 analysts tracked by FactSet who cover Microsoft\u2019s stock, 48 have buy ratings and four have hold ratings. Guggenheim analyst John DiFucci said that the company\u2019s guidance of 16% constant-currency Office 365 commercial revenue growth looks \u201cachievable\u201d as it bakes in \u201ca drastic decline\u201d in new annual recurring revenue. \u201cWhile we do not expect a sizable impact from M365 Copilot\u2026in the quarter, the business should continue to benefit from the combination of broad price increases that started to take effect in March 2022, renewals of sweetener E3 deals from three years ago at much higher prices, and incentivized upgrades to the higher-priced E5 [plan],\u201d he wrote. Truist Securities analyst Joel Fishbein will be focused on the company\u2019s security commentary. \u201cHistorically, this has been the quarter that the company gives the size of its security business,\u201d he wrote recently. \u201cBased on these disclosures, we believe that MSFT is the largest cybersecurity vendor in the world. We believe that the segment will be given extra attention following the reported breach two weeks ago.\u201d Read: These 4 software stocks are \u2018underloved.\u2019 Here\u2019s what could get them appreciated. Morgan Stanley\u2019s Keith Weiss will be looking for clues about the prospect of an Azure acceleration. \u201cDespite optimism around growing AI contributions, near-term investor expectations have been kept in check by third-party data releases (which may not be fully capturing [generative] AI contributions, in our view),\u201d he wrote. As such, the focus has largely been \u201con how to think about generative AI\u2019s contribution to results and Microsoft\u2019s potential to drive an acceleration in Azure growth in the back half of FY24 versus management\u2019s commentary looking for constant currency Azure growth in [the fiscal second half] to \u2018remain roughly stable compared to Q2\u2019 against easier [year-over-year] compares,\u201d Weiss continued.
