    "text": "  February 12, 2024 By Glenn Dyer | More Articles by Glenn Dyer In a historic turn of events, Microsoft has officially dethroned Apple to claim the title of the most valuable company ever. Founded decades ago by Bill Gates and others, and listed in 1986, Microsoft's journey reached a pinnacle last week with a staggering market capitalization of $US3.125 trillion, marking the highest value ever recorded for any company. This milestone comes as Microsoft's market value surpassed the previous record set by Apple, which reached $US3.09 trillion last July. As of Friday, Apple's market cap stood at $US2.916 trillion, underscoring Microsoft's significant lead in the race for valuation supremacy. Notably, Microsoft is also the first US company to close a session and a week with a market cap exceeding $US3.1 trillion, further solidifying its position as a market powerhouse. The company's stock closed the week at $US420.55, just shy of its all-time high of $US420.82, achieved in Friday's trading frenzy. Driving Microsoft's meteoric rise is its deepening involvement in artificial intelligence (AI), with its shares surging by a remarkable 60% over the past 12 months alone. In contrast, Apple's shares closed last week at $US188.85, marking a modest 25% increase over the past year, with a peak of $US196.62 recorded in mid-December. Examining key financial metrics, Microsoft boasts a price-earnings ratio of 38.03, surpassing Apple's ratio of just over 28. Comparatively, the S&P 500 index had a price-earnings ratio of 27.55 during the same period. Despite market fluctuations and global challenges, both Microsoft and Apple have outperformed the S&P 500 over the past five years, starting from February 2019, a year before the onset of the pandemic. While the index witnessed an 81% increase, Microsoft's shares soared by an astounding 288%, showcasing the company's resilience and growth trajectory. Similarly, Apple's shares experienced a remarkable uptick of 342% during the same period, underscoring the enduring appeal of the tech giants in the eyes of investors. As the technology landscape continues to evolve and reshape the global economy, Microsoft's ascension to the summit of corporate valuation serves as a testament to the company's enduring innovation and strategic prowess. With AI poised to redefine industries and unlock new frontiers, Microsoft's leadership position underscores its potential to shape the future of technology and drive further value creation for shareholders and stakeholders alike.

A successful flow test at SS-1H will allow Tamboran to sanction a\u00a040 MMcf/d pilot project in the region, supporting the local NT gas grid.

European Metals Holdings (EMH.ASX) \u2013 The large Cinovec Project (EMH 49%), is strategically located in the heart of the growing European EV ecosystem in the northwest of the Czech Republic. Cinovec is a large historic lithium resource, with a clean pathway to underground development, resulting in minimal surface impact or disturbance. EMH\u2019s 51% JV partner is the national utility CEZ a subsidiary of CEZ Group, which is owned 70% by the Czech Government. The Czech auto industry is important as it makes up ~10% of local GDP. Hence a local gigafactory, in addition to three in southern Germany, would accelerate the transition to EV\u2019s and with broader EU support underwrite Cinovec\u2019s development.

CTQ has developed a leading proprietary assistive living technology platform\n(Sofihub) with a portfolio of best-in-class solutions for the global aged care,\nhome care, disability care and personal security sectors.

The market is very fragmented, with no competitor offering CTQ\u2019s\nbroad suite of products. CTQ\u2019s income stream is non-discretionary and largely funded by federal and\nstate governments and insurers. There is a growing recurring revenue\ncomponent built on SaaS-based subscriptions to its platform. The company has built a significant new contract pipeline in recent quarters\nand is targeting c.15,000 subscribers on its platform by Dec 2023, which\nrepresents sufficient scale to reach profitability. Cash on hand of $3.6m (2Q\nFY23) is likely sufficient to fund operations until breakeven is reached.

Canada also aims to lift EV sales from ~5% of new car sales in 2021 to 20% in 2026 before expanding to 60% by 2030 and 100% by 2035. Importantly, the Government supports the development of a vertically integrated EV ecosystem, as it seeks to return to its glory days as the world\u2019s #5 in auto manufacturing.

TerraCom released their operating results for the December quarter FY2023 with operating metrics being in line with our forecasts. Unseasonal rains in both Australia and South Africa contributed to operational and logistical issues across all mines, however guidance for annual production at Blair Athol is unaffected and highlights the quality of TerraCom\u2019s skills in operational management. We continue to like the stable operating metrics around the company\u2019s Australian operations and see potential for the South African operations to benefit from increased management focus given the rationalisation of operations following the closure of the Ubuntu mine. Corporate Connects overall financials remain unchanged as does our target price of $1.35 share.

This report looks at the results of a collaborative study Antisense undertook which looked at the largest protein expression database in Long COVID-19 patients who experienced neurologic symptoms well after the primary or acute SARS-CoV-2 infection was considered over (Groups 1 & 2, with 48 subjects Group 2 comprising a single patient from a different clinical site). The symptoms and others experienced by such patients result in a highly significant amount of illness, possibly more than all primary SARS-CoV-2 infections i.e COVID-19.

Kazia Therapeutics (KZA) announced yesterday morning that paxalisib did not meet the threshold to move into stage 2 of the GBM AGILE clinical trial (NCT03970447). The study was an adaptive trial designed to assess the potential of new therapeutics to treat the highly aggressive brain cancer glioblastoma (GBM) in a cost-effective manner. Demonstrating efficacy in GBM is an extremely high hurdle as shown by the fact that there is only one approved drug for the disease, temozolomide, and it is only effective in 1/3 of patients. Given the high nature of the hurdle, in our original initiating coverage report on KZA, we only gave paxalisib a small chance of returning a positive result from the overall study. That is the nature of drug development with one group estimating only 6% to 7% of new chemical entities that commence clinical trials reach launch (Dowden & Munro (2019) Nat Rev Drug Discov). The small percentage that do make it to launch, however, more than make up for the cash spent on those that don\u2019t.

Two recent gravity surveys have considerably exceeded expectations and revealed potential for extensions to the existing MRE at Lake Throssell, plus a material growth opportunity at Lake Yeo. This reinforces the potential for a multi-decade, Tier-1 SOP production hub based around Lake Throssell. TMG is currently completing work towards the PFS due early 2023, including drilling to start in Q3 2022, evaporation trials and permitting activities. Results from these programs will support the PFS and any future resource upgrade. Benchmark SOP prices have risen to ~US$940/t due to recent geopolitical developments. The Oct 2021 Scoping Study assumed a SOP price of US$550/t and contained a sensitivity analysis showing every 10% increase in price drives a +$144m increase in the project NPV of $364m. The c.70% increase above the Scoping Study thus implies a project NPV of ~$1.4bn.
