IANS | New Delhi | February 9, 2024 1:47 pm Microsoft.(Photo:Twitter) Microsoft has revealed that Activision Blizzard, which it acquired recently for $68.7 billion, was already planning to slash a significant number of jobs before the acquisition. The tech giant is laying off at least 1,900 employees at gaming company Activision Blizzard as well as at Xbox. In a response to the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the company said that consistent with broader trends in the gaming industry, \u201cActivision was already planning on eliminating a significant number of jobs while still operating as an independent company.\u201d  Advertisement \u201cThe recent announcement thus cannot be attributed fully to the merger,\u201d said Microsoft. The FTC is still appealing a district court\u2019s decision not to block Microsoft\u2019s Activision Blizzard acquisition. \u201cIn continuing its opposition to the deal, the FTC ignores the reality that the deal itself has substantially changed. Since the FTC lost in court last July, Microsoft was required by the UK competition authority to restructure the acquisition globally and therefore did not acquire the cloud streaming rights to Activision Blizzard games in the United States,\u201d a Microsoft spokesperson said on the FTC filing. \u201cAdditionally, Sony and Microsoft signed a binding agreement to keep Call of Duty on PlayStation on even better terms than Sony had before,\u201d added the company spokesperson, reports The Verge. The latest job cuts will affect around 8 per cent of the overall Microsoft gaming division that has some 22,000 employees. \u201cWe have made the painful decision to reduce the size of our gaming workforce by approximately 1900 roles out of the 22,000 people on our team,\u201d Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer had said in an internal memo. Activision Blizzard President Mike Ybarra has also left the company. \u201cI want to thank everyone who is impacted today for their meaningful contributions to their teams, to Blizzard, and to players\u2019 lives. It\u2019s an incredibly hard day and my energy and support will be focused on all those amazing individuals impacted \u2013 this is in no way a reflection on your amazing work,\u201d Ybarra posted on X. Microsoft completed its $68.7 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard in October last year, after a long battle with regulators in the UK and the US.

The investigation primarily focused on Meta's handling of consumer issues within the Facebook Marketplace and Instagram Marketplace, they added. In a setback for Microsoft-backed OpenAI, the US Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) has refused to allow the Sam Altman-run company to register the word GPT (generative pre-trained transformer) as a trademark.
