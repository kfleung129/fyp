On another historic day in Wall Street, the firm\u2019s shares hit a record high of $404.4. That made it the second stock market-listed firm to hit the $3trillion milestone \u2013 \u00a32.4trillion at current exchange rates \u2013 after Apple. The pair have been vying for the top spot, with Microsoft briefly becoming the world\u2019s most valuable company two weeks ago before Apple bounced back. Backed by its investment in ChatGPT maker OpenAI, Microsoft is widely seen as a frontrunner in the race for market dominance in the rollout of generative artificial intelligence among other tech heavyweights including Google owner Alphabet, Amazon, Oracle, and Facebook owner Meta Platforms.

Fresnillo reported a 12.2\u00a0per cent rise in silver production in the final three months of 2023. Over the year output was up 4.7 per cent, driven by its new Juanicipio mine. But gold production fell as one mine approached the end of its life. At Hochschild, a \u2018robust\u2019 fourth quarter of 2023 helped it end the year at the top of its revised production forecast as it gears up for its Mara Rosa project in Brazil to start producing gold in February.
