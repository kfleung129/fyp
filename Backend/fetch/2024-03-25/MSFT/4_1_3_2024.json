The app gives users access to Copilot, formerly known as Bing Chat, which operates similarly to OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Like other AI chatbot, you can type in a question or a prompt and receive responses generated by artificial intelligence. Users can leverage the AI assistant to draft emails, compose stories or scripts, summarize complex texts, create personalized travel itineraries, write and update job resumes and more. Plus, You can use the app\u2019s Image Creator feature, which is powered by DALL\u00b7E 3, to explore new styles and ideas, curate social media content, develop brand motifs, generate logo designs, create custom backgrounds, build a portfolio, visualize film and video storyboards and more.

With Copilot, you\u2019re getting access to OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 technology for free, which is pretty significant because OpenAI\u2019s GPT app runs on GPT-3.5 technology and charges for access to GPT-4.

The mobile launch also comes as Copilot has already been available on the web for some time now. With this latest launch, Microsoft is looking to offer Copilot as a standalone service and expand its reach even more. Microsoft brings Copilot to Windows 10  "
