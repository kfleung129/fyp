    "text": "U.S. Big Tech\u2019s\u00a0artificial intelligence investments\u00a0and takeover plans are increasingly drawing regulatory scrutiny worldwide. Significant merger deals, including\u00a0Nvidia Corp\u00a0NVDA \u2013\u00a0Arm Holdings Plc\u00a0ARM and\u00a0\u00a0Intel Corp\u2019s\u00a0INTC \u2013\u00a0Tower Semiconductor Ltd\u00a0TSEM, succumbed to regulatory opposition over anticompetitive grounds. The European Union\u2019s competition watchdog plans to examine\u00a0Microsoft Corp\u2019s\u00a0MSFT\u00a0recent investment in\u00a0Mistral AI, alongside its ongoing scrutiny of Microsoft\u2019s close relationship with\u00a0OpenAI Inc. Microsoft has formed a strategic partnership with Mistral, investing \u20ac15 million ($16.3 million) to make Mistral\u2019s artificial intelligence models available on its Azure cloud platform. Unlike OpenAI\u2019s models, which are proprietary, Mistral\u2019s are open for sharing. This investment in Mistral, known for developing algorithmic models for AI services similar to those by OpenAI, will turn into equity in Mistral\u2019s next funding round, Bloomberg\u00a0reports. While Microsoft has primarily collaborated with OpenAI, investing about $13 billion, its ties with OpenAI and its new investment in Mistral are closely watched by U.K. and EU regulators, raising concerns about potential formal investigations that could impact Microsoft\u2019s AI endeavors. Separately, the U.K.\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has initiated a formal investigation into\u00a0Qualcomm Inc\u2019s\u00a0QCOM\u00a0acquisition of the\u00a0Israeli semiconductor company\u00a0Autotalks Ltd\u00a0for terms undisclosed due to concerns that the deal might restrict competition in the market. The CMA has set a deadline of April 25 to determine whether to greenlight the acquisition or escalate it to a more detailed investigation, Bloomberg\u00a0reports. Qualcomm, headquartered in San Diego, California, announced its intention to acquire Autotalks through its subsidiary, Qualcomm Technologies Inc, aiming to enhance its portfolio in automotive safety systems, specifically in crash-prevention technology. Additionally, the European Union is examining the takeover, following requests from 15 EU member states, indicating significant regulatory scrutiny over the transaction\u2019s potential impact on competition.
