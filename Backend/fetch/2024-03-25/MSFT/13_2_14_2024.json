    "text": "State-sponsored hacking groups from Russia, China and other U.S. adversaries have been caught using OpenAI\u2019s tools to better attack their targets, according to a report published Wednesday by Microsoft, amid concerns of possible cybersecurity threats as AI technology improves. State-sponsored hackers from Russia, China, North Korea and Iran allegedly used OpenAI\u2019s technology ... [+] to complete simple tasks. OpenAI and Microsoft disabled accounts associated with the hacking groups Charcoal Typhoon, Salmon Typhoon, Crimson Sandstorm, Emerald Sleet and Forest Blizzard, according to reports from both companies. The China-backed groups Charcoal Typhoon and Salmon Typhoon used OpenAI\u2019s language models to improve on their \u201ctechnical operations,\u201d Microsoft alleges, including research for cybersecurity tools and phishing content. Forest Blizzard, a hacker group allegedly tied to Russia\u2019s military intelligence, used language models to research \u201cvarious satellite and radar technologies,\u201d which \u201cmay pertain to conventional military operations in Ukraine,\u201d Microsoft claims. Hackers from North Korea associated with the Emerald Sleet group generated content that would \u201clikely be for use in spear-phishing campaigns\u201d against regional experts, while Crimson Sandstorm\u2014allegedly tied to Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guard\u2014used OpenaI\u2019s tools to help write phishing emails, according to Microsoft\u2019s report. Liu Pengyu, spokesperson for China\u2019s U.S. embassy, told Reuters China has denied \u201cgroundless smears and accusations\u201d against the country, which supports the \u201csafe, reliable and controllable\u201d use of AI technology to \u201cenhance the common well-being of all mankind.\u201d Both Microsoft and OpenAI said they would improve their approach to combatting state-sponsored hacking groups using their tools, including investment in monitoring technology to identify threats, collaboration with other AI firms and being more transparent about possible safety issues linked to AI. Tom Burt, head of Microsoft\u2019s cybersecurity, told the New York Times the groups were using OpenAI\u2019s tools for simple tasks: \u201cThey\u2019re just using it like everyone else is, to try to be more productive in what they\u2019re doing.\u201d Microsoft claimed last month the company\u2019s corporate systems were attacked by the Russian-backed hacker group Midnight Blizzard. The group accessed a \u201cvery small percentage\u201d of the company\u2019s corporate email accounts, including some senior leadership and employees from its cybersecurity and legal teams, Microsoft said. Microsoft has released several reports over the last year about state-sponsored hacking efforts. Last year, Microsoft claimed a \u201cChina-based actor\u201d breached the email accounts for about 25 U.S.-based government organizations. The company also said it uncovered infrastructure hacking activity by the Chinese hacker Volt Typhoon, including attacks on U.S. military infrastructure in Guam. Sami Khoury, Canada\u2019s top cybersecurity official, told Reuters that evidence obtained by the Canadian government suggested more hackers were using AI to improve their attacks, develop malicious software and create more convincing phishing emails. Khoury\u2019s warning followed a report by the European police organization Europol, which said tools similar to OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT made it possible \u201cto impersonate an organization or individual in a highly realistic manner.\u201d The U.K.\u2019s National Cyber Security Centre also warned about the possible hacking risks through AI use, suggesting language models could \u201chelp with cyber attacks beyond their current capabilities.\u201d AI Being Used For Hacking And Misinformation, Top Canadian Cyber Official Says (Reuters)  "
