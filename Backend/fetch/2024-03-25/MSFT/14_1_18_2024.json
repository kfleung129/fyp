While major tech firms are integrating AI into their institutional profiles, the extent of expansion varies. According to Stocklytics.com, Microsoft takes the lead in the AI race, attracting almost 40% of investors seeking its AI stock in 2024. The site\u2019s financial analyst, Edith Reads, comments: Microsoft is envisioning high-end profits with growing AI collaborations and personal projects. The tech firm has been actively immersed in the AI wave for over six months. The announcement of significant pricing adjustments for Copilot within Microsoft 365 heralded the AI-driven future of Office documents. This resulted in a discernible surge in the company\u2019s stock. Since that pivotal moment, scarcely a week has transpired without Microsoft unveiling fresh AI features or implementing modifications to its software and services. Investors are projecting\u00a0Microsoft\u2019s takeover of OpenAI with little effort in the recent employee shifts. Stocklytics Financial Analyst, Edith Reads Tech leaders are poised for a promising 2024 as new tech developments capture investors\u2019 interest. Among the tech giants, Microsoft is anticipated to secure 44% of investors\u2019 backing, with Amazon following closely at 24%, slightly exceeding half of Microsoft\u2019s expected support rate. Nvidia leads the investment race, expecting 12% of investor support. Simultaneously, Alphabet, Meta, Apple, and Tesla lag slightly behind, anticipating single-digit investor backing. The AI space commands the most attention among tech developments. With its genuine investment in OpenAI and recent employee acquisitions, Microsoft particularly intrigues most investors. Following Microsoft\u2019s 39% support is Nvidia\u2019s 35%. AMD claims the third position with 13%, challenging Amazon and Alphabet, which expect 9% and 4% investor backing, respectively.  Microsoft has significantly led the AI charge, especially after funding Open AI\u2019s development with nearly\u00a0$13 billion.\u00a0In 2019, Microsoft and OpenAI\u2019s management struck an alliance to bolster outreach and research. However, in November 2023, Open AI\u2019s board fired Sam Altman from his CEO position.\u00a0 Microsoft didn\u2019t waste any time and proposed a role for Altman to take over as the head of their internal AI division. However, Open AI quickly retracted their decision to fire Altman and hired him back. While Sam was back in his position, Microsoft secured top talents from Open AI to work on its subsidiary, placing itself in a good position for future AI projects. Besides, Microsoft owns a considerable 49% stake in OpenAI, making it the most significant player in the AI space. The projected investment in 2024 is the beginning of this transformative industry. The AI domain has a lot of room to maneuver, mainly due to the lack of limiting regulations. Microsoft being at the forefront of the AI force does place the industry in a position of new improvements. Joel Nwankwo is a tech journalist.
