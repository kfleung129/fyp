    "text": "Wall Street paused for a breather Friday following a stronger-than-anticipated producer inflation report that once again caught investors off guard, echoing the heat of a similarly strong consumer inflation report earlier in the week. The Producer Price Index (PPI) for January 2024 saw a 0.3% month-over-month increase, surpassing the projected 0.1% surge, while the Consumer Price Index (CPI) surged by 3.1% year-on-year, exceeding the forecasted 2.9%, highlighting the ongoing intensity of the inflation battle. \u201cThe January inflation data vindicates the Fed\u2019s wait-and-see approach,\u201d Bank of America economist Stephen Juneau said in a note. As a result, traders trimmed their expectations for Fed rate cuts, delaying the anticipated start to this summer. Yields surged higher, with the policy-sensitive two-year note yield climbing by over 10 basis points to reach 4.67%. As of noon trading in New York, the S&P 500 showed minimal change for the day, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 lagged behind, potentially ending a five-week winning streak. A similar trend was observed with both Microsoft Corp. (NYSE:MSFT) and Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)  The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) was 0.2% lower to $500.96, the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (NYSE:DIA) fell 0.3% to $386.90 and the tech-heavy Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) fell 0.5% to $432.16, according to Benzinga Pro data. The Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLP), outperformed, up 0.5%, while the Communication Services Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLC) was the laggard, down 1.4%.
