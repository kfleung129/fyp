Speaking during a virtual session of Microsoft Africa AI Journalists Academy, organised by the leading global vendor of computer software, Ayanda Ngcebetsha, Director, Data and AI, Microsoft South Africa, and Trusha Vanmali, Business Program Manager, Microsoft South Africa, who spoke at the AI Journalist Academy, organised by Microsoft, stressed that AI would only improve productivity rather than take over jobs. \u201cThe importance of AI tools in summarising reports, carrying out accurate research, imputing language translation and coordinating several meetings in one day, while making the best use of the available time cannot be underestimated,\u201d they explained. The duo noted that although 2023 was the year AI went mainstream, 2024 would be the year in which AI tools would help free up time for more creative and fulfilling cognitive work. Ngcebetsha said that AI was around us, yet invisible, and working aside from us to enhance creativity rather than working against creativity. He said copilot, which is an AI tool, could help content developers in writ\u00ading, coding, summarising and search\u00ading for specific information like charts and tables that would help them devel\u00adop good reports in less time. Accord\u00ading to him, Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) are more interested in using AI to increase productivity than to cut headcount. The Microsoft director said that, from the data available to the corpo\u00adration, reducing headcount was last on the list of what leaders would value from AI. \u201cAfter \u2018increasing productivity\u2019, leaders\u2019 top hopes for AI are to help employees with necessary but repet\u00aditive tasks and increase employee wellbeing. \u201cThey also want to eliminate em\u00adployee time spent on low-value activi\u00adties, enhance employees\u2019 capabilities, and accelerate employees\u2019 pace of work,\u201d he said.
