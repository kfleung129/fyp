But it’s important to remember that the market’s big winners weren’t always viewed as no-brainers In the mid-1990s it wasn’t certain many people would ever trust Amazon/the internet with their bank card details Meanwhile the idea of an electric vehicle (EV) start-up like Tesla disrupting the mighty auto industry was widely seen as absurd in 2010 It sill is by some As daft as it sounds though I think electric flying taxis may soon take off in more ways than one And Joby Aviation (NYSE: JOBY) whose shares are at $5 is currently the leader in this space Here’s why I’ve invested The Toyota-backed company is building four-passenger electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft In layman’s terms flying taxis that carry four passengers They lift off like a helicopter fly like a traditional aircraft but are near-silent like EVs The benefits here include less pollution and noise traffic reduction and much shorter journeys With a top speed of 200 mph they’re perfect for regional air mobility (airport runs city-to-city trips etc) Joby acquired Uber Elevate in 2020 with the two companies agreeing to integrate their respective services into each other’s apps It expects to begin commercial operations in 2025 However there are still regulatory hurdles to overcome with the Federal Aviation Administration The company has made great progress here but there’s still more work to secure full airworthiness certification As part of this process the company successfully performed an exhibition flight in New York City in November While this marked the first ever such flight over the city a delay to commercial operations remains a risk Put simply Joby is trying to do in the air what Tesla has achieved on the ground with EVs And it is following Elon Musk’s firm in a couple of specific ways: Similar to Elon Musk investing in Tesla after leaving PayPal Joby’s executive chairman Paul Sciarra invested in the eVTOL start-up then left Pinterest the internet company he co-founded The firm currently has a market cap of $4bn This reflects a lot of optimism as the industry leader but there is competition notably from Archer Aviation However one thing I like here especially in this higher interest rate environment is that the company remains well-capitalised (for now) At the end of September it had $11bn in cash It’s too early to tell whether investing in Joby at $5 will be like investing in Tesla in 2010 It’s very high-risk But I’m convinced there will be a big winner in this market which Morgan Stanley predicts could reach $1trn by 2040 For now I’m keeping my holding small If it flops it won’t harm my overall portfolio But if Joby does turn out to be the next Tesla I’d only need a small investment to make fantastic returns Should you invest the value of your investment may rise or fall and your capital is at risk Before investing your individual circumstances should be assessed Consider taking independent financial advice John Mackey former CEO of Whole Foods Market an Amazon subsidiary is a member of The Motley Fool’s board of directors Ben McPoland has positions in Archer Aviation Joby Aviation and Tesla The Motley Fool UK has recommended Amazon PayPal Pinterest Tesla and Uber Technologies Views expressed on the companies mentioned in this article are those of the writer and therefore may differ from the official recommendations we make in our subscription services such as Share Advisor Hidden Winners and Pro Here at The Motley Fool we believe that considering a diverse range of insights makes us better investors 25 March 2024 Sumayya Mansoor This Fool explains how passive income stocks can help to create an additional income stream and details two picks she… Read more » 25 March 2024 Royston Wild These FTSE 250 trusts are on sale right now!

8,"Musk vs Zuckerberg: Elon seems to envy the other CEOs Meta control","1/19/2024","https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-elon-musk-vs-mark-zuckerberg-envy-meta-ceo-power-2024-1","Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg have been trading barbs for years And earlier this week Musk found another reason to gripe at the other CEO and founder — about the company structure that gives him a big chunk of voting control over Meta — even as Musk himself seeks to tighten his hold on Tesla Musk appeared to give Teslas board an ultimatum on Monday saying he wants 25% voting control at Tesla or hell stop growing AI development at the electric-car maker (He currently has about a 13% stake in Tesla and had around 22% before he sold off some of his shares to fund his Twitter purchase in 2022) One way of getting that would be via a dual-class stock structure This isnt uncommon and could mean Musk wouldnt necessarily get more shares but that the ones he held would deliver more voting power One problem: while Musk would be fine with that hes been told it is impossible to achieve post-IPO in Delaware he wrote on X formerly Twitter Tesla IPOed in 2010 Zuckerberg however has supervoting shares at Meta that are equivalent to 10 votes per share The companys dual-class stock structure provides Zuckerberg and select executive managers and directors with them So while Zuckerberg only owns about 13% of Metas stock he holds over 50% of total voting power meaning he essentially has a complete veto over other shareholders And the fact Musk cant now change Teslas structure seems to have irked the billionaire — and made him sound a bit envious Its weird that a crazy multi-class share structure like Meta has which gives the next 20+ generations of Zuckerbergs control is fine pre-IPO but even a reasonable dual-class is not allowed post-IPO Musk wrote Its not the first time Musk has criticized Zuckerbergs control of Meta but he now appears to want at least half that level at Tesla — though he doesnt seem to want to make himself irreplaceable Related stories If I have 25% it means I am influential but can be overridden if twice as many shareholders vote against me vs for me he wrote on X At 15% or lower the for/against ratio to override me makes a takeover by dubious interests too easy Tesla did not immediately respond to emails from Business Insider requesting further comment Some Tesla shareholders have spoken out against Musks request And it could be a risky decision according to finance experts who pointed to Musks unorthodox behavior in recent months allegations of illegal drug use as well as the negative impact of Musks Twitter acquisition on Teslas stock The whole situation points to an important weakness of Musk—insufficient respect for the outside shareholders who are contributing the capital that is essential to developing his vision Chester Spatt a professor of finance at Carnegie Mellon University and a former Chief Economist for the SEC told BI Musk has also previously faced scrutiny over his control of Teslas board which includes his brother and several close friends The billionaire is still awaiting a ruling in Delaware on his more-than-$50-billion compensation package after a Tesla shareholder sued Musk and the carmaker alleging Musk had undue influence over the pay plan Musk does not receive a salary from Tesla and his pay package centers on a series of goalposts around the carmakers financial growth set in place in 2018 Specifically the plan involves a 10-year grant of 12 tranches of stock options vested when Tesla hits certain targets According to the carmaker Tesla has accomplished all of the 12 targets as of 2023 When each milestone is passed Musk gets stock equal to 1% of outstanding shares at the time of the grant While experts point to the unusual nature of Musks compensation package it might be the only way to keep Musks focus on Tesla according to Joshua Tyler White a former financial economist for the SEC and an assistant professor of finance at Vanderbilt Musk also has a hand in five other companies including SpaceX X and The Boring Company Musks so wealthy at this point that money doesnt really motivate him power does White said It creates more utility for him than just making another few billion dollars With a 25% stake Musks power would be far more limited than Zuckerbergs voting power at Meta but his request to create a dual-class structure post-IPO is a more peculiar one according to experts Between 2017 and 2019 nearly a third of the companies that went public had a dual-class structure according to a study by Ofer Eldar a corporate governance expert out of UC Berkeley The structure is designed to motivate founders to take their companies public while still allowing them to maintain a higher level of control Zuckerberg probably wouldnt have gone public without a dual-class structure White said Meantime it would be virtually impossible for a listed company like Tesla to enact a dual-class structure now One of the only ways for a company to implement a tiered voting system after already going public would be to go private and file a new IPO as Michael Dell did in 2018 That could spook investors after the fallout from the last time Musk discussed taking Tesla private Ultimately Musks call for a 25% stake might be a warning sign Case Western Reserve University corporate law professor Anat Alon-Beck told BI she sees two primary reasons for Musks request: he thinks hes likely to lose the Delaware case or hes facing pressure behind the scenes from an activist investor Erik Gordon a professor at the University of Michigans Ross School of Business added that Musk followed Sam Altmans ousting at OpenAI closely and it might be playing into his fears especially as more Tesla owners and investors have begun to speak out against his actions on social media Maybe hes a little less confident that shareholders will go along with what he says Gordon said Read next Jump

Enbridge transports and distributes oil and gas in its extensive North American pipeline system In fact Enbridge moves about 30% of North America’s crude oil It also transports nearly 20% of the natural gas consumed in the US In recent years the company has made efforts to diversify its business in response to the pressing need for renewable clean energy Investments in areas such as liquified natural gas storage and offshore wind are securing Enbridge’s future growth Also Enbridge’s recent acquisition of three US natural gas utilities will provide additional low-risk regulated revenue This will help strengthen the balance sheet and further position Enbridge for the energy transition These strategic moves are setting Enbridge up for long-term growth and success The problem with Tesla is mainly that competition in the electric vehicle market is intense Hyundai/Kia for example captured the number two spot in US electric vehicle sales last year In fact the company’s growth in electric vehicles outpaced both Tesla and the broader electric-vehicle market last year This has been something that the company has been aggressively working on in the last few years Today Hyundai offers a broad line-up of almost 10 electric vehicles with battery technology that has faster charging In contrast Tesla offers four different types of electric vehicles at this time So what this means for Tesla is that its market share is slipping as competitors such as Hyundai rise In fact Tesla’s share of the US electric vehicle market fell to 55% last year while Hyndai/Kia’s share stands at approximately 8% To make matters worse for Tesla competition from more players is expected to explode in the next year as the number of electric vehicle models available for sale is expected to almost double to approximately 100 The market is clearly heating up and the road ahead will be increasingly more difficult for Tesla Given all of this information it appears likely that Tesla’s stock price is at risk At the very least it appears that the risk/reward proposition of Tesla is quickly deteriorating There’s nothing like a hyper competitive market to destroy a company’s advantage And this appears to be what is brewing in the electric vehicle market So with Tesla’s advantage slowly being chipped away its multiple and earnings forecasts will likely decline To be fair it’s extremely difficult to predict 2026 earnings in this environment that’s so fast changing Yet it’s not a stretch to say that Tesla’s stock price will get hit in the next couple of years In contrast Enbridge remains the beacon of predictability Steady growth over the next couple of years mixed with continued advancement of its growth strategy can very likely send Enbridge’s stock price significantly higher This article represents the opinion of the writer who may disagree with the “official” recommendation position of a Motley Fool premium service or advisor We’re Motley!

ALEXANDRA CANAL: Thats what Peltz wants to hear JOSH SCHAFER: Im just fired up to see the stock action Tesla is one of those stocks thats just always fun to watch on newsy days And when you take a look at Tesla year-to-date the stocks been awful The top 20 stocks have absolutely ripped and carried the market to start January Thats why the S&P is at a record high And the one stock that has not helped that narrative has been Tesla stock And Im wondering Pras if we do get that margin trough if we do see beats on the top and bottom line whats kind of the reaction? When you look kind of broadly at the S&P 500 the reactions havent been that strong for companies that have beat The average coming into the day with a little bit over 10% of the index reporting so not a ton But youre getting beats of about 07-- or sorry rises of about 07% if a company beat on both the top lines And then if you miss you can see pretty heavily scrutinized here down 18% if you missed on both So I think broadly Im just curious investor sentiment investor appetite for what we know is a popular retail name in Tesla PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: So a few things right? So the stock is down around 15% compared to the S&P up around 2% or so this year A lot of the estimates for Tesla have been coming down as we enter earnings So there might be a bit of a surprise to the upside there potentially right? Stock down a lot earnings estimates have come down maybe they can beat there But if you see some good things talking about Cybertruck talking about AI initiatives talking about the margin trough we hit that 18% gross margin Those are the catalysts that can move the stock a lot higher Look at Netflix and Tesla very similar they move a lot on earnings The next-day move is what we need to watch though ALEXANDRA CANAL: What do you think is the biggest catalyst? Like what do you think investors really want to see in this report in particular? PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: I mean I dont think were going to hear but if Musk says were done with price cuts were done with that Were good where we are right now Were going to focus more on profitability ALEXANDRA CANAL: The margins PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Yeah Were going to get probably a 22 million 2024 delivery target which is a bit lower than what we think that they wanted based on their 50% cap rate But it might be better for them more profitability not so much volume Dont sacrifice profits for volume JOSH SCHAFER: All right Pras is going to be looking at those fundamentals I just want to hear if the Cybertruck is getting a price cut so maybe we can get in on that action But I dont know if thats going to be happening quite yet guys Related Quotes"

(TSLA)","1/26/2024","https://seekingalpha.com/article/4665354-ignore-the-pessimism-tesla-is-undervalued-not-likely-to-collapse-anytime-soon","Spencer Platt Spencer Platt In my previous article I discussed many possible outcomes for Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) Since that article the stock has tanked by 2888% because of the fall in margins After the Q4 2023 earnings release TSLA stock tanked around 10% fueled by a miss on revenue and Teslas warning of a slowdown this year Nevertheless I will maintain my strong buy rating on Tesla stock and I will demonstrate why this fall in stock price has made Teslas stock undervalued Seeking Alpha Seeking Alpha Teslas charging network ranks second in the US with 33000 locations mainly comprising level 3 chargers positioning the company as a dominant player in the electric vehicle (EV) charging market This segment is projected to experience a substantial 36% growth rate reflecting the increasing demand for electric vehicles nationwide Authors Calculations based on many sources Authors Calculations based on many sources In terms of Teslas potential revenue streams its insurance venture holds significant promise with forecasts going as far as suggesting it could contribute up to 30% of the companys profits Despite initial challenges such as website crashes upon launch and the reliance on safety scores derived from vehicle data to determine premiums some people speculate that Teslas insurance business could bring around $250 billion in revenue at some point Currently the worldwide car insurance market is expected to grow at a CAGR of around 738% Furthermore Teslas involvement in the solar business offering products like solar panels solar roofs string inverters and batteries is expected to witness a global growth rate of 69% through 2029 Authors Calculations based on Fortune Business insights Authors Calculations based on Fortune Business insights Teslas revenue has exhibited remarkable growth averaging an annual pace of 1205% However this growth has unmistakably begun to decelerate If we examine the growth rates from 2021 to 2023 we observe an annual growth rate of approximately 27% Since my previous article was released in Q2 2023 revenue has increased by 212% Operating income plummeted by 297% driven by price cuts Nevertheless net income surged by 231% buoyed by a tax benefit of around $575 billion in Q4 2023 The operating margin understandably is lower than in Q2 2023 when my previous article was published standing at around 919% down from the previous 1346% However aided by the substantial tax benefit the net income margin ascended from 1297% to 155% Nevertheless what you can see is that even though Tesla has been slashing prices the operating margin has grown as well as the net income margin Authors Calculations Authors Calculations Authors Calculations Authors Calculations Tesla boasts excellent financial health Total debt has been declining at an annual rate of -95% while cash reserves have surged by an impressive 1273% annually-an uncommon feat in the capital-intensive industry Cash reserves have grown by 26% whereas total debt decreased by approximately 10% from Q2 2023 to Q4 2023 Authors Calculations Authors Calculations Furthermore free cash flow (FCF) has seen consistent growth at an annual pace of 596% since 2017 In my previous article this metric stood at $51 billion but has since soared to $95 billion marking an 86% increase However its important to note that this surge was largely attributed to the substantial $57 billion tax benefit The free cash flow margin has naturally increased from 55% to 98% aligning more closely with the margins recorded since 2020 Authors Calculations Authors Calculations Authors Calculations Authors Calculations Authors Calculations Authors Calculations In summary Tesla stands as a robust company boasting ample cash reserves and minimal debt This positions Tesla advantageously against competitors affording the company the luxury to adjust car prices without the looming risk of defaulting on substantial debt obligations This valuation will encompass two models The first model will be derived from the estimates available at Seeking Alpha focusing on both revenue and EPS The second model will be based on my estimates of potential sales behavior resulting from price cuts drawn from historical data Its important to note that the calculation of depreciation and amortization (D&A) interest expenses and prospective capital expenditures relies on margins associated with revenue This may be the sole assumption within this context as Tesla maintains the flexibility to adjust its capital expenditures and interest expenses potentially increasing long-term debt Moreover the WACC will be calculated from this table As mentioned earlier the first model will be based on available estimates for Tesla These estimates can be found on Seeking Alpha under the Earnings tab for the Tesla stock ticker The estimates presented in the table below indicate that Teslas EPS is projected to increase by 20618% by 2030 Furthermore they suggest that Tesla will achieve approximately $3348 billion in revenue by 2030 The projections also indicate that the net income margin is expected to remain around 10% through 2030 However my projections only extend to 2029 as per available data Its important to note that while the projections on Seeking Alpha extend to 2032 I have omitted 2031 and 2032 due to insufficient analyst support for those years Additionally following the release of Q4 2023 earnings the EPS consensus for those years has been withdrawn Authors Calculations Authors Calculations According to the available estimates Tesla is anticipated to be fairly priced at $31112 indicating an upside of 67% Moreover if the components of equity continue to grow at the same pace observed from 2017 to 2023 the future price of the stock could reach approximately $66651 This projection implies annual returns of around 43% through 2029 The second model comprises my estimates As illustrated in the table it outlines the anticipated sales of Tesla influenced by price reductions According to my projections these cuts could amount to around 53% annually aiming to align with Teslas goal of offering $25000 vehicles Its noteworthy that the average price cuts observed from 2019 to 2022 averaging 77% resulted in an average sales growth of 502% Additionally Tesla surpassed estimates by delivering 18 million cars selling approximately 15581 more vehicles than projected Looking ahead to the 2024 outlook which currently remains unavailable and is anticipated to be disclosed in the next earnings release (Q1 2024) as communicated by Vaibhav Taneja Teslas CFO Taneja said then that Tesla was focused on growing our volumes in a very cost-efficient manner and would provide 2024 guidance on the next earnings call Tesla Q4 2023 Tesla Q4 2023 To project the other two segments I will continue using the percentage of revenue they represented in Q2 2023 Then I will project them based on their respective market CAGR which is 738% for services (excluding the charging network & others) and 69% for solar Authors Calculations Authors Calculations This model presents more optimistic outcomes compared to the previous one indicating a fair price per share of approximately $35889 translating to a 927% upside from the current stock price of $18629 Furthermore the projected future price for 2029 is approximately $76668 suggesting annual returns of around 519% The narration regarding falling margins is incomplete Teslas recent drop in margins occurred rapidly due to the immediate effects of price cuts However considering historical data (available in the financials section of this article) it becomes evident that Tesla has actually increased its operating margin over time Therefore it is incorrect to assume that Teslas operating margins will suddenly plummet to 1-3% and remain at that level indefinitely Electrek Electrek BYD Company Limited (OTCPK:BYDDF) is closely comparable to Tesla for two main reasons: 1) cheaper cars; and 2) government support and Chinese preference for national products Observing BYDs operating margins its apparent that its operating margin is around 518% with a net income margin of approximately 49% This illustrates the first reason behind BYDs affordability: the company is willing to sacrifice earnings Additionally BYD along with most of its EV counterparts in China enjoys backing from the Chinese Government through subsidies stock purchases and access to cheap credit An important distinction is that BYD manufactures its own batteries a practice Tesla does not currently undertake However Tesla is developing a lithium refinery in Texas set to be operational by 2025 potentially enabling Tesla to match BYDs pricing in the future Consequently both brands may converge in pricing with consumers likely favoring Tesla due to its luxury brand perception a distinction BYD lacks as Chinese products are often associated with inferior quality Tesla boasts one of the largest charging networks globally and with numerous players already saturating the market theres little incentive for new entrants Consequently BYD has opted to collaborate with Shell plc (SHEL) & many other EV charging networks instead of developing its own charging infrastructure leaving this market firmly within Teslas grasp Remember that partnerships can be broken Looking at estimates for BYD its clear theyre projected to generate significantly less revenue than Tesla by 2030 with Tesla forecasted to reach around $330 billion in revenue BYDs revenue is estimated to grow at a CAGR of around 20% through 2030 while Tesla is expected to grow at around 35% Therefore the expectation that BYD will bankrupt Tesla is unfounded Moreover Tesla remains a hotbed of innovation BYD Revenue Estimates (Seeking Alpha) Tesla Revenue Estimates (Seeking Alpha) BYD Revenue Estimates (Seeking Alpha) Tesla Revenue Estimates (Seeking Alpha) The primary risk associated with my estimates is the possibility that Tesla may not achieve the anticipated sales volume Essentially Tesla is striving to emulate Toyota Motor Corporation (TM) I believe we should have greater confidence in Tesla given its track record of avoiding bankruptcy on multiple occasions This should reassure investors of Teslas adeptness at reducing prices while maintaining profitability Another risk pertains to CEO Elon Musks somewhat controversial behavior Instances of this have led to issues in Europe where the company is grappling with trade unions Such tensions are particularly concerning in Europe a key consumer market globally Additionally theres the risk posed by Chinese car companies as the Chinese state has demonstrated its willingness to support domestic companies through various means such as providing cheaper credit or purchasing their stock Unlike Tesla these companies have government backing to mitigate the risks of bankruptcy I dont perceive price cuts as a significant risk as this aligns with Musks primary objective of selling $25000 in electric cars and potentially expanding into buses and trucks Investors who believed that Tesla would maintain prices around $70000 may not have been paying attention In conclusion despite Teslas recent 2888% stock decline attributed to the immediate effect of price cuts which caused margins to drop and a subsequent 10% drop post-Q4 2023 earnings release I maintain a strong buy rating on the company The dip in stock price has rendered Tesla undervalued presenting an opportune moment for investment Teslas charging network which operates in a market expected to deliver 36% growth and its potential in the insurance and solar sectors indicate promising revenue streams Financially Tesla exhibits robust metrics with decreasing debt surging cash reserves and growing free cash flow Valuation models suggest significant upside potential with estimates projecting a fair price per share of $31112 to $35889 offering considerable returns Risks include Teslas sales projections Elon Musks controversial conduct and competition from Chinese car companies yet Teslas commitment to price cuts and profitability aligns with its long-term vision of democratizing electric vehicles Editors Note: This article

Does Tesla’s commentary signal a weak outlook from Fords and GMs earnings next week? Does Levi’s soft sales at department stores mean bad results from Macy’s in February?

22,"Why has Tesla Insurance fallen short for some customers?","1/4/2024","https://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/us/news/auto-motor/why-has-tesla-insurance-fallen-short-for-some-customers-471754.aspx","By Gia Snape When Tesla announced it was venturing into auto insurance in 2019 it promised a better and cheaper insurance experience for electric vehicle (EV) drivers beset by high repair costs and premiums But nearly four years since it launched Tesla Insurance has faced significant challenges and questions over its viability A slew of consumer complaints drew lawsuits and regulatory scrutiny last year and the brakes appear to have been put on Tesla Insurance’s launch in Europe originally slated for 2023 One analyst Insurance Business spoke to said the EV giant seems to have run into the same problems that other tech firms fall into while trying to enter insurance At the same time Tesla may have struggled in handling the operations of its insurance arm We are actually looking for revolutionary actuaries for Tesla Insurance! Please inquire if interested “First of all when Tesla first came into the industry they didn’t actually keep the risk themselves; they were just a distribution channel” said Adam Denninger (pictured) global industry leader for insurance at Capgemini “What you’ve seen for a long time is that a lot of technology companies coming into the industry on the distribution side – offering new agent experiences new mechanisms of gathering data even occasionally doing the underwriting piece as well – all have had a similar experience They lost a lot of money” Denninger cited high-profile insurtechs like Hippo and Lemonade as examples of startups that have had a similar experience to Tesla Insurance “[These companies] came in thinking that the technology was the hard part and thinking insurance is this old slow backwater industry” Denninger said “[They thought] it’s not that complicated and they could solve it But they realized [insurance] was pretty complicated and it’s difficult to do it without losing your shirt I think that’s what happened to Tesla” Experts earlier claimed that Tesla’s pioneering use of advanced telematics would significantly help it price risk better and bring down auto insurance premiums for its policyholders in a market where traditional insurance players were raising their rates However accounts of high auto insurance premium quotes by EV drivers soon surfaced in media reports appearing to contradict Tesla founder Elon Musk’s assurances of affordable rates In December 2023 a California judge ruled that the tech firm’s insurance arm would face a class action lawsuit from drivers who claimed they were overcharged for their premiums which Tesla allegedly based on “false” crash warnings instead of actual driving behavior Danger ahead for Tesla insurance: faulty forward collision warnings inflate premiums triggering a class-action lawsuit If youd like to see this fixed please share this article and spread the wordhttps://tco/6dEVVYXGqK$TSLA @Tesla @torquenewsauto #teslainsurance A recent investigative report by Reuters included allegations that poor management practices and understaffing by the company had led to extensive delays in claims and other operational shortfalls at Tesla Insurance “I think when Tesla came in they didn’t understand the level of difficulty for servicing and managing claims how much work it is to run an operation center and handle all the incoming calls the support that people need etc” said Denninger “Essentially they were not prepared for what it meant to actually be an insurance company from an operational perspective which led to negative reviews” There have also been questions as to whether Tesla can deliver on the promise of its telematics scheme “This is what people said would disrupt the industry because [Tesla] was going to use their cars to do telematics” said Denninger “They are going to have a data set on a large number of cars that’s incredibly rich that nobody can compete with and they will be able to price more accurately than anyone else As you look forward that probably will happen” However critics have argued that Tesla’s reliance on in-house data may not align with industry standards potentially leading to inaccurate risk assessments and mispriced insurance premiums The US class action against Tesla Insurance also raised concerns about the sensor technology they’re using and whether these are “misreading” driving events But Denninger maintained that Tesla’s fundamental insurance pricing model is sound “People are saying ‘your car isn’t scoring me correctly because the things you’re dinging me for scoring are incorrect’ So there’s a technology fail” Denninger said “But the underlying model that they’re using to price insurance there’s nothing wrong with it at all People do variations of that using smart devices “The question is really whether the technology is doing it correctly and whether Tesla has a liability associated with that That’s an interesting question and I don’t know where it’s going land” Though there are technology and operational concerns on the table from some corners Denninger also points out that increased scrutiny over Tesla Insurance could also be part of the “Elon Musk effect” “When I look at all this stuff around Tesla and all the noise around it I think some of it is just that Elon Musk is larger than life People react to him and they try to jump on any bad news” said Denninger An appeals court has ruled that Elon Musk will not have to testify in a wrongful death lawsuit after two teenagers were killed in a Tesla Model S going 116 miles per hour in 2018—after a Tesla technician removed speed limiting software on the vehicle https://tco/Sl6EkLeSvg Its controversial CEO aside Tesla seems to be making all the right moves in its insurance strategy according to the Capgemini leader “What they’re doing is cutting-edge It’s exactly where the rest of the insurance industry is going for telematics Everybody wants to feed data off their cars” Denninger said “As for retaining the risk themselves other technology companies have tried to do this It’s not new and all of them lose their shirts when they do it and they end up partnering with traditional insurance companies at some point There’s nothing new here from an insurance industry perspective” But is there hope for redemption for Tesla Insurance? Denninger told Insurance Business that the tech giant is likely already “digging their way out” “I’m sure they’re fixing it because the company is incredible when you think about what they’ve done” he said “But in the meantime it’s causing them all kinds of public relations problems” What are your thoughts on Tesla Insurance’s rollout? Do you have any experience with Tesla Insurance you’d like to share? Tell us in the comments"

not anymore As companies ranging from General Motors (NYSE:GM) to Toyota Motor (NYSE:TM) and Volkswagen (ETR:VOW3) scale their own EVs at more affordable prices Tesla is getting left in the dust Despite problems at the company Tesla’s stock and CEO Elon Musk remained unaffected Despite poor quality ratings deadly crashes vehicle recalls regulatory scrutiny and social media controversies TSLA stock continued to rally Between 2011 and 2021 TSLA stock increased an astounding 20250% rising from just $2 a share on a split adjusted basis to more than $400 Tesla became a leading growth stock that was cheered on by retail investors Tesla’s stock performance was so strong that analysts lumped the company in with a group of other mega-cap technology stocks that came to be known as the “Magnificent 7” Yet in reality TSLA stock has trailed the performance of the other Mag 7 that includes Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Since hitting an all-time high in November 2021 Tesla’s share price has fallen 54% In a sign of shifting sentiment Practically nobody is calling Tesla a top growth stock today Toyota best illustrates the competitive threat that Tesla is facing The best-selling Japanese automaker plans to be selling 35 million fully electric vehicles annually by 2030 Eventually Toyota plans to convert all of its vehicles to fully electric versions Toyota currently sells about 10 million cars trucks and SUVs a year Tesla sold 185 million vehicles in 2023 In a nice bit of irony Toyota’s stock is up 25% year-to-date while Tesla’s share price is down 25% since the start of the year While Toyota provides an instructive example it is one of more than a dozen automakers who are shifting to fully electric vehicles most of which offer superior quality and lower prices than Tesla Tesla’s share of its home market in America fell from 62% to 50% in 2023 a record low That’s a big loss of market share in a short amount of time which bodes poorly for the TSLA stock outlook It looks unlikely to reverse itself as competition intensifies in the coming months and years Other problems that are pulling TSLA stock lower include an economic slump in China that has hurt sales There also have been aggressive price cuts and discounts around the world that have hurt Tesla’s margins Plus Tesla has failed to introduce any new electric vehicles that are better made and more affordable to buy The Cybertruck that went on sale late last year looks interesting but also seems impractical and has a starting price of more than $60000 There are rumors that Tesla is developing a new mass market electric vehicle codenamed “Redwood” But that new EV is unlikely to be available before mid-2025 at the earliest Meanwhile Tesla delivered a dreadful earnings print for the fourth-quarter of last year and offered grim guidance with management saying electric vehicle volume growth in 2024 is likely to be “notably lower” It all seems to have caught up to Tesla and the once seemingly invincible automaker now appears to be vulnerable The company is no longer able to get by on a lack of competition Demand has weakened market share is in freefall and margins are being eroded The company’s management team seems to lack creativity and new products have failed to inspire With the share price sinking investors would be smart to take any profits they have and get out now TSLA stock is out of juice On the date of publication Joel Baglole held long positions in NVDA and MSFT The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer subject to the InvestorPlacecom Publishing Guidelines Joel Baglole has been a business journalist for 20 years He spent five years as a staff reporter at The Wall Street Journal and has also written for The Washington Post and Toronto Star newspapers as well as financial websites such as The Motley Fool and Investopedia Consumer Discretionary Automotive Electric Vehicles Article printed from InvestorPlace Media https://investorplacecom/2024/02/tsla-stock-warning-why-tesla-is-at-the-start-of-a-long-term-decline/ ©2024 InvestorPlace Media LLC Stocks to Buy Stocks to Buy Todays Market Stocks to Buy Todays Market Stocks to Buy Crypto & Blockchain Stocks to Buy Financial Market Data powered by FinancialContent Services Inc All rights reserved Nasdaq quotes delayed at least 15 minutes all others at least 20 minutes Copyright © 2024 InvestorPlace Media LLC All rights reserved 1125 N Charles St Baltimore MD 21201 Not Yet a Premium Subscriber?

Let’s take a look at where an investment in Tesla might be 10 years down the road EV Demand and TSLA Stock High interest rates make financing a new car purchase prohibitively expensive for many Rivian produced over 17500 vehicles in the fourth quarter 8% more than the previous quarter but delivered 10% fewer vehicles or under 14000 cars than it did in the third For the coming year the luxury EV maker sees production being essentially flat at 57000 vehicles It wasn’t much better at luxury EV peer Lucid Motors LCID which expects to produce just 9000 vehicles in 2024 a slight increase over last year but a far cry from the 22600 EVs analysts expected Industry EV sales growth is declining at a faster rate than many thought Ford F slashed its F-150 Lightning production in half while GM is standing on the brakes of its own EV production schedule Although Tesla hasn’t provided hard production numbers for the coming year it did say “vehicle volume growth rate may be notably lower than the growth rate achieved in 2023” Big Fish Small Pond There is a shakeout coming to an EV market that is much smaller than analysts believed The early adopters already bought their cars but consumers aren’t convinced EVs are worth it They are hedging their bets Where EV sales are slowing Toyota TM is seeing tremendous growth in its hybrid vehicle lineup It suggests buyers don’t fully trust the battery EV and want a fossil fuel backup plan Tesla won’t quite be the last man standing but it will be standing taller than most It revolutionized and popularized EVs when they were still quirky not-ready-for-prime-time alternatives Today it is the premiere EV company and a growing carmaker overall Tesla generated $82 billion in EV sales last year up 15% from the year before It also earned $89 billion in operating profits which was a 35% drop year over year Still almost 185 million EVs were produced in 2023 and Tesla delivered 18 million of them Not only does Tesla dominate the EV market with a 55% share despite growing competition but it owns a better than 4% share of the entire automobile market Its share is bigger than Mercedes-Benz MBGAF BMW BMWYY Subaru FUJHY and Volkswagen VWAGY Yet trading at 45 times trailing earnings and going for 6 times sales TSLA stock is still richly valued The next decade is going to be a tougher slog than the last 10 years Tesla won’t be a bust like Rivian and Lucid but I don’t see it outperforming the market either The share price will have to come down significantly from these levels to make TSLA stock a buy On the date of publication Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer subject to the InvestorPlacecom Publishing Guidelines Rich Duprey has written about stocks and investing for the past 20 years His articles have appeared on Nasdaqcom The Motley Fool and Yahoo!

59,"A Look at Teslas Bold Bet on Affordability","1/12/2024","https://finance.yahoo.com/news/look-teslas-bold-bet-affordability-190154540.html","In the rapidly evolving electric vehicle landscape Tesla Incs (NASDAQ:TSLA) strategy of reducing the average selling price to expand market reach and bolster its technological ecosystem represents a pivotal shift Today we delve into Teslas calculated move to reduce ASPs a visionary step for market expansion and pioneering advancements in the EV and tech sphere especially amidst the rising challenge from competitors like BYD (BYDDF) Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with NOW Teslas gross profit margin has been on a downward trend for the last six quarters driven by a declining ASP of its vehicles and a relatively stable cost of sales per vehicle The company has been lowering its ASP to make its vehicles more affordable and tackle the increasing competition from BYD its biggest rival for now especially in the Chinese market which contributes 218% to total revenue The gross profit margin dropped to 179% during the third quarter of 2023 down from 251% in the prior-year quarter since the ASP of Teslas vehicles dropped to $44493 from $53436 registering a 167% year-over-year decline The vehicle model mix partially influenced the decline The proportion of Teslas more affordable Model 3/Y increased to 963% of total vehicles delivered up from 946% a year earlier Nevertheless the primary driver behind the decrease in the ASP was Teslas deliberate price cuts to expand its market reach Concurrently Tesla managed a modest 48% year-over-year reduction in the cost of sales per vehicle Although the decreasing ASP adversely impacts Teslas margins it is a deliberate strategy the companys leadership envisioned long ago Elon Musk articulated this vision in 2006 when he outlined his master plan which aimed to start with a sports car leverage the profits to develop an affordable car and subsequently use those funds to create an even more budget-friendly vehicle Hence this intentional shift aligns with Teslas long-term goal of making its cars more accessible and gradually expanding its market reach The deliberate decline in ASP is a strategic necessity for Tesla aiming to extend its market reach while simultaneously fortifying the entire ecosystem of artificial intelligence-driven automotive technology This approach is crucial for realizing the ultimate vision of fully autonomous driving As Tesla broadens its market presence it gains access to a larger dataset This influx of data enhances the capabilities of the Tesla Dojo the recently launched supercomputer designed for computer vision video processing and recognition The amplified processing power of Tesla Dojo in turn significantly bolsters the training capabilities of its full self-driving advanced driver-assistance system propelling it toward greater efficacy Tesla isnt merely an automobile manufacturer; its transforming into an automotive technology powerhouse essentially a supercomputer on wheels Beyond integrating its native supercomputer into vehicles the companys strategic developments pave the way for licensing its advanced machine learning algorithms to third parties This shift enhances Teslas core business and unlocks lucrative opportunities for the EV maker in diverse markets Realizing the utmost potential of its supercomputer capabilities compels Tesla to accumulate substantial data and log extensive driving miles This initiative accentuates the need for Tesla to elevate its car sales volume emphasizing the critical role of enhancing affordability across its vehicle lineup This unified strategy underscores the companys grander visionnot confined to mere car production but aiming to establish itself as a pivotal force in the evolving realm of automotive technology and machine learning The following charts upward trajectory will intensify as Tesla aims to make its cars more accessible catering to the mass market This strategic move will concurrently enhance the supercomputers capabilities in training FSD systems Reaching the mass market also hinges on Tesla rapidly expanding its supercharger stations which have exhibited robust growth averaging 325% year over year for the past five quarters Therefore this expansion has outpaced the impressive average car delivery growth of 439% over the same period Source: Teslas Third-Quarter 2023 Disclosure In its third-quarter disclosures Tesla revealed a significant milestone: the company doubled the capacity of its supercomputer and successfully assembled 10000 GPU clusters of H100s The Tesla Dojo system is specifically optimized for video training demanding substantially higher computing power than large language models due to the elevated computer-to-memory bandwidth required for training through visual recognition While quantification remains challenging at this juncture implementing Dojo implies that each vehicle sold could contribute significantly more to the companys valuation contingent on the success of FSD initiatives Finally introducing Dojo and ongoing software development and capacity expansion initiatives will keep capital expenditures at elevated levels While this exerts downward pressure on free cash flow Tesla sees it as a strategic trade-off willingly accepting this temporary setback to unlock higher value in the future Tesla is recalling over 16 million EVs in China addressing concerns related to assisted driving functions and door-locking systems through remote over-the-air software updates While the recalls will not have an immediate major direct impact on Teslas business fundamentals they may affect the companys stance on its high-profile lawsuits related to crashes on autopilot affected by them This is the second time that Tesla has made such a large number of recalls Previously the company also recalled 2 million vehicles in the US over the autopilot system The companys recalls have become extensive recently as the EV maker is progressing fast in its FSD vision which requires a lot of computing and algorithm technology that is still in the trial-and-error phase In 2023 Teslas recall instances (including investigations of vehicles) based on several vehicles stood at 28 million and the company started 2024 with 16 million recalls in China Hence this suggests its journey toward FSD will be bumpy involving recalls ongoing lawsuits and investment to make the technology safer and more marketable In a recent development BYD overtook Tesla in its fourth-quarter sales numbers BYD sold 526409 EVs while TSLA logged 484507 Thus BYDs rise as one of the top EV makers signifies the companys competitive strength and Chinas fast adoption of EVs BYD has swiftly gained traction in the EV market with its cost-effective electric cars presenting a potential threat to Tesla in China While not a significant concern BYDs absence in the US market where substantial tariffs and other obstacles could nullify its price advantage mitigates potential challenges for Tesla Source: Bloomberg However as BYD expands its market presence beyond the US it could emerge as a formidable competitor Moreover its not just BYDs ascent that Tesla needs to consider; Chinas increasing influence on car exports also poses a potential challenge for the electric car giant China spearheaded becoming one of the largest exporters of passenger cars (see chart below) China is close to catching up with the two largest car-exporting countries Japan and Germany Tesla may need to work on growing its market outside the US and widening the addressable market as Chinas threat looms and may have to play with price points longer than many estimates Source: The Economist Teslas non-core segment includes energy generation storage services and others This segment contributed 16% to total revenue during the third quarter up from 129% a year earlier The segment has been growing at a 607% average year-over-year rate for the last five quarters Moreover the non-core segments gross margin improved by 754 basis points compared to the year-ago quarter demonstrating the segments potential to be a significant profit contributor to Teslas business Tesla has surpassed its 2023 guidance of delivering 18 million cars As monetary tightening and inflationary pressures ease alleviating macro headwinds its sales growth is expected to persist and align with its targeted 50% CAGR Although the initial deliveries of the Cybertruck commenced in November 2023 this model will contribute a relatively smaller portion to total revenue for the next couple years Musk has indicated the company may take 12 to 18 months to achieve volume production and positive cash flow with the Cybertruck which is a plausible expectation Finally Tesla is poised to maintain a capex-heavy approach in the coming quarters channeling investments into AI supercomputers and other technological improvement projects The ongoing trend of declining prices may persist punctuated by some volatility between quarters primarily driven by an assertive expansion strategy aimed at capturing a broader market and addressing competition particularly from BYD in China Teslas strategy to lower vehicle prices marks a calculated move toward expanding market reach and technological leadership in the EV sector Despite reduced margins this approach aligns with Teslas vision of making EVs more accessible and advancing AI-driven automotive technology The Tesla Dojo supercomputers role in this strategy highlights a shift from just car production to becoming a leader in automotive technology and machine learning Finally challenges like increased capex and market competition notably from BYD are part of Teslas broader plan for future growth and technological supremacy This article first appeared on GuruFocus Related Quotes"

the 10 stocks whose price targets were recently trimmed by analysts If you want to see more such stocks on the list go directly to Wall Street Analysts Just Trimmed Price Targets for These 5 Stocks Equity markets in Asia demonstrated widespread gains on January 19 mirroring the positive trend in Nasdaq 100 futures propelled by the optimistic outlook of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) The surge in semiconductor stocks contributed to the upward momentum of MSCI Incs Asia Pacific index for the second consecutive day TSMC in particular experienced a remarkable increase of over 6% in Taiwan while its American depository receipts saw an impressive surge of nearly 10% reaching the highest closing level since February 2022 The noteworthy performance of TSMC has become a focal point acting as a catalyst for heightened expectations of a global recovery within the semiconductor sector The positive momentum in Asia reflects the broader sentiment in equity markets driven by the resilience and growth potential perceived in key industry players Traders sentiments are undergoing shifts with a notable reduction in bets on a Federal Reserve rate cut anticipated in March This adjustment in expectations aligns with the evolving economic landscape and signals a degree of confidence in the prevailing economic conditions Redmond Wong Chief China Strategist provided insights into the outlook for the worlds second-largest economy shedding light on government policies and their implications for the stock markets These discussions underscore the importance of staying informed about global economic dynamics and geopolitical factors that influence market trends As markets continue to respond to changing conditions the performance of semiconductor stocks such as TSMC serves as a barometer for broader economic recovery sentiments Investors and analysts will closely monitor developments in the semiconductor sector and gauge their impact on global markets in the coming days According to Reuters the most recent economic indicators point towards a positive trajectory for the US economy as of January 18 with notable developments in jobless claims and the housing market Weekly jobless claims have reached a 16-month low falling by 16000 to 187000 showcasing a robust labor market The decline unexpected by economists hints at sustained job growth in January and contributes to an optimistic economic outlook potentially complicating expectations for a Federal Reserve interest rate cut in March The strong performance is attributed to the resilience of the labor market where companies are demonstrating reluctance to lay off workers amidst challenges in finding skilled labor particularly after the COVID-19 pandemic Though some volatility in claims data is expected during the turn of the year the overall trend aligns with a tight labor market In the housing sector single-family housing starts experienced an 86% decline in December attributed in part to adverse weather conditions However the year-on-year increase of 158% indicates sustained demand fueled by a shortage of existing homes for sale Building permits for single-family homes rose by 17% to the highest level since May 2022 reflecting positive sentiment among homebuilders and responding to declining mortgage rates While the housing market shows signs of resilience and increased demand for new construction challenges persist particularly in addressing the inventory shortage The gap between housing starts and completion rates and the inventory gap in the market underscore the need for additional supply to alleviate the housing affordability crisis Overall these economic indicators provide a multifaceted view of the US economys current state with both the labor market and the housing sector contributing to a generally positive narrative Investors and analysts will closely monitor these trends for insights into economic resilience and potential policy implications On the

including operating leasing automotive gross margin would project to 1571% pointing to a ~60 bp sequential decline from Q3’s 1633% AUTHOR CALCULATIONS AUTHOR CALCULATIONS A sequential decline in automotive margin likely spells another sequential decline for operating margins though there is increasing evidence that operating margins might be approaching a bottom in Q4 We highlighted in late August via a competitive analysis framework that we believe Tesla’s Q3 operating margins can decline to a level between Honda and VW (HMC VWAGY) or between 78% to 96% However if operating margins were to reach a level closer to — or below General Motors (GM) — that could be a sign they’re close to the bottom This highlights the broader concern for investors in that Tesla has not provided any parameters nor guidance to assess how low margins may go YCharts YCharts Q3’s actual operating margin came in below that level at 76% landing between Honda’s 85% and VW’s 62% while still sitting above GM’s 68% margin With automotive gross margin estimated at ~157% company-wide gross margin is expected to hover around 175% assuming a ~180 bp benefit from regulatory credits and positive impact from Energy Storage and Services Assuming a ~10% QoQ increase in operating expenses about in line with historical trends Q4’s operating margin is projected to be ~72% for a ~40 bp sequential decline At that level the spread between Tesla’s operating margin and GM’s would be less than 40 bp adding evidence that operating margins are approaching a bottom Aggressive price cuts look to be easing a tailwind for ASP inflection while declining lithium and Li-ion battery prices would add production cost reduction a second tailwind for margins It is imperative for the bull case that operating margins show sequential improvement in Q1 should it fall to the low 7% range in Q4 This is crucial for earnings estimates to begin seeing upwards revisions once more as forward earnings estimates have fallen significantly over the past six months: Q1’s trajectory from pointing to over 20% YoY growth to now suggesting a low single-digit YoY decline raises red flags for Q2’s growth forecast even after a 2100 bp revision lower Weaker than expected margins in Q4 and/or Q1 could quickly see Q2’s adjusted EPS figure revised lower for another YoY decline The bull case would need to have concrete evidence of margins bottoming in Q4/Q1 in order to avoid multiple quarters with YoY declines for EPS Tesla has already cut prices twice in January by (3%) to (6%) on the Model 3 and two Model Y variants in China followed by (4%) to (8%) cuts on Model Y variants across Europe This raises the risk that ASPs fall much further than COGS in Q1 driving a sequential decline in margins and adding more uncertainty to when and where margins will bottom CEO Elon Musk emphasized in Q2 that Tesla is focusing on volume growth at the detriment of margins based on his view that unlocking full autonomy will lead to a substantial increase in the value of each vehicle and therefore for Tesla: “it does make sense to sacrifice margins in favor of making more vehicles because we think in the not too distant future they will have a dramatic valuation increase” CFO Vaibhav Taneja reiterated this in Q3 saying Tesla is “focused on reducing costs maximizing delivery volumes and continuing making investments in the future” Q4’s production of 494989 took FY23’s total production to 185 million vehicles while deliveries of 484507 took the full year’s total to 181 million vehicles — this represented delivery growth of 38% YoY and production growth of 35% YoY This focus on volume growth via price cuts comes as Tesla is increasingly at risk of losing its title as the world’s largest BEV manufacturer on an annual basis after losing the title on a quarterly basis this quarter to BYD Company (BYDDF BYDDY) BYD has extended its lead against Tesla in China especially so in Q4 proving that it can’t be ignored as a fierce competitor on the global stage BEV sales for BYD increased 22% QoQ in Q4 to reach 526409 vehicles almost 9% higher than Tesla’s total BYD had nearly matched Tesla’s deliveries in Q3 as both held ~18% of the global BEV market that quarter and BYD’s rapid growth allowed it to take the throne in Q4 Annually BYD’s BEV sales came in at 157 million +73% YoY putting it on track to challenge Tesla’s annual volumes in 2024 Many of the FAANGs are in the final throes of very mature long-term uptrend patterns some of which started in 2009 Many FAANGs are either at all-time highs or just shy of them; however Tesla trades roughly 50% lower than its 2021 highs which signals relative weakness compared to other FAANGs TRADINGVIEW TRADINGVIEW It’s worth noting the head and shoulders pattern that is close to confirming This is the red count above which implies that if Tesla breaks below $203 then the lower target will be sub-$100 as we likely press below the January 2023 lows If Tesla is going to have any chance at a sharp uptrend it would need to break above $264 and $280 in a vertical manner If this happens we can start discussing the possibility of $345 - $400 This is the green count in the chart and it has a low probability of manifesting The problem with this scenario is that no FAANG supports this type of move This would be a 60% - 80% move higher in Tesla Most FAANGs look like they have topped or have one more minor swing higher before topping Even the strongest FAANGs are suggesting a final push higher that doesn’t fit with the above green count Meta Platforms (META) being one of the stronger FAANGs only has room for a 4% - 10% move higher before completing a mature 5 wave pattern off the January low completes Nvidia (NVDA) being the strongest FAANG only has room for a 5% - 18% move at most before it becomes a better buy at lower levels Therefore neither the fundamentals nor the technicals support this type of large move higher in Tesla which makes the red count more likely at this time The main story for Tesla Inc through 2023 and now entering 2024 has been when and where margins will find a bottom Margins have declined significantly as Tesla prioritized growing delivery volumes via aggressive price cuts – automotive gross margin has fallen nearly 1400 bps in six quarters while operating margin has pulled back to the mid-7% range The two are both projected to slip again in Q4 as price cuts are expected to offset any incremental margin benefits from lowering vehicle production costs This rather rapid decline in margins is having a direct impact on forward earnings estimates with Tesla now expected to report a single-digit YoY decline in fiscal Q1 and almost zero growth in fiscal Q2 compared to prior views for >20% YoY growth Operating margins are nearing a level where we believe it will find a bottom while more constructive pricing action through the rest of 2024 and/or continued improvements in lowering production costs will also help aid margin recovery Tech Insider Network Equity Analyst Damien Robbins contributed to this analysis Editors Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major US exchange Please be aware of the risks associated with these stocks We offer tech sector coverage that combines fundamentals and technicals After recommending a stock we provide entries and exits Our audited 3-year results of 47% prove we are a top-performing tech portfolio This compares to popular tech ETFs at negative 46% and the Nasdaq at 19% We are the only retail team featured regularly in Tier 1 media such as Fox CNBC TD Ameritrade and more Our services include an automated hedge portfolio of 10+ positions broad market analysis real-time trade alerts PLUS a weekly webinar every Thursday at 4:30 pm Eastern Learn more This article was written by Beth Kindig is the CEO and lead technology analyst for the I/O fund and has ten years of experience as a professional in the tech industry She is a regular speaker at tech conferences and on financial news programs such as: Fox Business TDAmeritrade CoinDesk NPR Bloomberg TV Asia Motley Fool podcast This Week in Startups and more discussing her stock analysis She is known for making bold calls on tech stocks Analyst’s Disclosure: I/we have no stock option or similar derivative position in any of the companies mentioned but may initiate a beneficial Long position through a purchase of the stock or the purchase of call options or similar derivatives in TSLA over the next 72 hours I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Seeking Alphas Disclosure: Past performance is no guarantee of future results No recommendation or advice is being given as to whether any investment is suitable for a particular investor Any views or opinions expressed above may not reflect those of Seeking Alpha as a whole Seeking Alpha is not a licensed securities dealer broker or US investment adviser or investment bank Our analysts are third party authors that include both professional investors and individual investors who may not be licensed or certified by any institute or regulatory body"

The second asked Will Nio Be a Trillion-Dollar Stock by 2050? That’s pretty heady stuff I definitely wouldn’t want to miss out on such massive profits Based on its current share price of $607 were the first headline to come true that would be a 259% compound annual growth rate If I invested $1000 that would be $10000 in a decade from now a true 10-bagger If the second headline were to happen the present value calculator suggests Nio would need a market capitalization of $84 billion today to reach the $1 trillion mark It’s currently $10 billion With BYD (OTCMKTS:BYDDY) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) controlling 36% of China’s battery-electric vehicle market as of September 2023 it seemed they’re the better bet Nio’s share of the BEV market was 23% At this point a Hail Mary pass is in order However if you’re convinced Nio will be the best sub-$10 stock you’ve ever bought in your lifetime of investing do yourself a favor and explore using options to get the deed done Here’s why The 1000% gain in NIO stock mentioned in the intro would increase its shares from $607 to $6070 But that’s over a decade Assuming it gets halfway there by 2029 that brings us to a more reasonable target of $30 Nio’s share price traded at $30 as recently as January 2022 24 months ago And 12 months before that it was over $60 the 2034 target Looking at Barchartcom’s option prices I see the furthest-out expiration date is Jan 16/2026 24 months from now The highest strike price is $20 The current ask price on the call is $087 a down payment of 44% on Nio’s stock I’m not an expert in options but that seems a little high given the improbability of its stock reaching that mark in two years Dialing it back to Jan 17 2025 a $30 strike is available with an ask of $012 a down payment of just 04% There’s a reason for this discount: you’ve got 12 fewer months to ride a resurgence in Nio’s fortunes But the price is right Furthermore the delta is 007198 You can double your money on the call by selling it when and if the share price reaches $774 before next January That’s a 28% gain over the next 10-12 months That’s doable If for some reason good news shines down upon Nio in 2024 and its share price increases by more than 28% all the better and if it goes in the toilet you’ve spent the equivalent of a cheap bottle of wine You keep buying cheap calls with 1-2 years to expiry hoping to get lucky at some point But if you buy 100 shares at $607 a share that’s $607 out of pocket instead of $12 And neither is a guarantee In the trailing 12 months ended Sept 30 Nio had a loss of 214 billion Chinese yuan ($302 billion) on revenue of 546 billion Chinese yuan ($770 billion) That’s 39 cents in losses for every dollar of sales Or as The Motley Fool’s Leo Sun put it in his article from the intro about Nio becoming a trillion-dollar stock its vehicle margin had fallen to 11% in Q3 2023 from a peak of 201% In Q3 2023 Tesla’s automotive gross margin was down considerably to 187% from 279% in Q3 2022 That’s the difference between Tesla’s quarterly operating profit of $176 billion in the third quarter and Nio’s $664 million operating loss For it to have broken even in Q3 2023 it needed 6 billion in vehicle sales [$664 million divided by 11%] more than double its actual sales in the quarter Even if they were 279% in Q3 2023 (Tesla’s Q3 2022 gross margin) they would have needed nearly $1 billion more vehicle sales just to break even So looking at it from this perspective I’m not sure there’s a pathway to profitability in its immediate future Perhaps when EVs become cool again Until then NIO stock seems like a dead bet walking On the date of publication Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer subject to the InvestorPlacecom Publishing Guidelines Will Ashworth has written about investments full-time since 2008 Publications where he’s appeared include InvestorPlace The Motley Fool Canada Investopedia Kiplinger and several others in both the US and Canada He particularly enjoys creating model portfolios that stand the test of time He lives in Halifax Nova Scotia Consumer Discretionary Automotive Electric Vehicles Article printed from InvestorPlace Media https://investorplacecom/2024/01/uh-oh-why-nio-stock-looks-like-a-no-go-for-2024-and-beyond/ ©2024 InvestorPlace Media LLC Stocks to Buy Stocks to Buy Todays Market Stocks to Buy Todays Market Stocks to Buy Crypto & Blockchain Stocks to Buy Financial Market Data powered by FinancialContent Services Inc All rights reserved Nasdaq quotes delayed at least 15 minutes all others at least 20 minutes Copyright © 2024 InvestorPlace Media LLC All rights reserved 1125 N Charles St Baltimore MD 21201 Not Yet a Premium Subscriber?

Inc was struck down by a Delaware judge after a shareholder challenged it as excessive a ruling that would take a giant bite out of Musk’s wealth and put the fate of his companies in question That is if the ruling survives a likely appeal The decision Tuesday which amounts to his first major loss in court means that more than five years after the electric carmaker’s co-founder was granted the largest executive compensation plan in history Tesla’s board will have to start over and come up with a new proposal Musk never attempted to exercise his options since they’d been challenged in Delaware Chancery Court Tesla’s share price slid about 3% in after-hours trading on the news Musk has repeatedly urged Tesla’s board to arrange another massive stock award for him years after he sold a significant chunk of his shares in the company to acquire Twitter The billionaire has said he needs a bigger stake in Tesla to maintain control of the electric-car maker and expand further into artificial intelligence Read More: Inside Elon Musk’s Struggle for the Future of AI The ruling leaves the future of Musk’s fortune in limbo Worth some $511 billion the options were one of his most valuable assets Without them his net worth would drop to $1543 billion making him the third-richest person in the world after spending most of the past couple of years as No 1 according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index Evan Chesler Musk’s New York-based lawyer didn’t immediately respond to an email and a call seeking comment late Tuesday on the decision Following a trial that ended more than a year ago Delaware Chancery Court Chief Judge Kathaleen St J McCormick sided with an investor who complained Tesla directors didn’t make proper disclosures about the 2018 executive compensation package and the performance benchmarks required of Musk She also found that conflicts of interest marred the board’s consideration of the pay plan “In the final analysis Musk launched a self-driving process recalibrating the speed and direction along the way as he saw fit” the judge wrote in a 200-page ruling “The process arrived at an unfair price And through this litigation the plaintiff requests a recall” Musk 52 has topped Bloomberg’s wealth list thanks to his stake in Tesla the world’s most valuable auto company The stock options from his compensation plan have vested in increments over the past few years as performance targets were achieved but he hasn’t exercised any of the options regulatory filings show The billionaire was quick to react to the ruling on his social media platform X formerly known as Twitter He recommended “incorporating in Nevada or Texas if you prefer shareholders to decide matters” Never incorporate your company in the state of Delaware Musk who prides himself on snubbing corporate norms has usually prevailed in court battles including a shareholder suit over his acquisition of renewable-power provider SolarCity In the compensation case lawyers for Tesla shareholder Richard Tornetta argued board members failed to exercise independence as they drew up the pay package for the company’s chief executive officer and allowed him to improperly engineer the details of his pay plan to his liking Musk dictated the “framework and financial terms which remained fundamentally unchanged” throughout the board’s approval process Tornetta’s lawyers argued in briefs In her decision McCormick noted that Musk acknowledged he was basically “negotiating against myself” in the back-and-forth over his pay “The most striking omission from the process is the absence of any evidence of adversarial negotiations between the board and Musk concerning the size of the grant” the judge wrote The decision was delayed in part by the judge’s back surgery last year Musk’s defense failed to explain why the “historically unprecedented compensation plan” was necessary to motivate the CEO to achieve “transformative growth” Musk had no intention of leaving Tesla and his ownership stake was sufficient motivation to keep him focused on growth the judge said “Swept up by the rhetoric of ‘all upside’ or perhaps starry eyed by Musk’s superstar appeal the board never asked the $558 billion question: Was the plan even necessary for Tesla to retain Musk and achieve its goals?” she wrote During an earnings call last week Musk was persistent in his pursuit for a bigger stake in Tesla portraying the issue as all about his command of the carmaker rather than money “I don’t want to control it but if I have so little influence at the company at this stage I could be voted out by some random shareholder advisory firm” he said Read More: Elon Musk Has Lost Sight of What Matters Tesla’s CEO called out proxy advisers Glass Lewis and Institutional Shareholder Services—he jokingly referred to the latter as the extremist group ISIS—and claimed they were infiltrated by “activists” with “strange ideas” Greg Varallo one of Tornetta’s lawyers hailed the undoing of “the absurdly outsized pay package for Musk” He added in an email that the decision wipes out the share-dilution effect Tesla shareholders suffered from this “gargantuan” plan It remains unclear whether Musk will appeal Tuesday’s ruling or Tesla’s board will draw up a new pay package Musk has spent years—and pledged a large part of his wealth—in pursuit of his ambitions to go to Mars through SpaceX which has become the world’s second-most valuable startup and a juggernaut in the commercial space industry He vowed to use options from the 2018 package to fund the Mars colonization if it was upheld “Colonizing Mars is an expensive endeavor” the judge wrote “Musk believes he has a moral obligation to direct his wealth toward that goal and Musk views his compensation from Tesla as a means of bankrolling that mission” Read More: What Elon Musk Really Believes In a post on Twitter in 2018 he said “about half my money is intended to help problems on Earth & half to help establish a self-sustaining city on Mars to ensure continuation of life (of all species) in case Earth gets hit by a meteor like the dinosaurs or WW3 happens & we destroy

78,"Tesla trumps BYD in China sales efficiency with real-time strategy","1/4/2024","https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-trumps-byd-china-sales-042009170.html","SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Teslas strategy in China of real-time aggressive management of its sales staff is giving its stores an edge over dealerships offering BYD and other brands in the worlds largest auto market according to three people with knowledge of the matter The US company in the fourth quarter lost its crown as the worlds biggest electric vehicle seller to Chinas BYD but during the first 10 months of 2023 both companies grew their share of a slowing and highly competitive Chinese EV market Tesla sold more than 1500 EVs in each of its Chinese stores on average in the first 10 months of 2023 up from 1300 in 2022 data from China Merchants Bank International (CMBI) showed BYD in comparison sold under 600 cars per store in the same 2023 period including plug-in hybrids similar to its 2022 performance although overall it sold far more EVs than Tesla given its best-selling models cost half as much and it has 11 times as many local distributors Tesla may have more throughput per store but their growth is limited especially when compared with BYD said Bill Russo CEO of Shanghai-based advisory firm Automobility Teslas China EV market share grew to 12% in the first 10 months of 2023 up from 10% in 2022 while BYDs share rose to 27% from 21% over the same period as its lower-end rivals stumbled according to data from Automobility and the China Passenger Car Association Teslas solid sales performance in China its second-biggest market provides a rare bright spot for the EV maker which has warned of the impact of high interest rates on car buyers in other key markets like the US and slowed plans to construct a factory in Mexico The automaker which pioneered a direct sales model worldwide monitors its 2800 sales staff across its 314 stores in China on an hourly basis assessing how effective and efficient they are in persuading potential consumers to visit stores arrange test drives and place orders the three people said They declined to be identified because such information about its China sales strategy which has not been previously reported is deemed confidential Tesla did not respond to a request for comment The people said this real-time collection of data informs the companys pricing strategy which allows it to influence demand for some model versions and resulted in seven price hikes and three cuts in China last year The company can then make cost-effective production plans based on raw material prices and supplies It manages its staff similarly to Chinese food delivery giant Meituan which measures delivery times by the minute and second one of the people said Tesla salespeople seen to have failed to be active enough have been let go the same day the person added The company incentivises its staff by offering a base salary higher than EV rivals and allowing the best performers to earn up to 30000 yuan ($420356) a month including bonuses drawing workers from industries such as English tutoring and insurance known for aggressive sales tactics the people said OTHER SALES MODELS BYD takes a more conventional approach to dealerships with its 3400 stores and sells plug-in hybrids alongside battery EVs It promised dealers up to 2 billion yuan ($27952 million) in rewards to reach a 3 million unit global sales target in 2023 BYD did not respond to a request to provide further details Yale Zhang managing director at Shanghai-based consultancy Automotive Foresight said Teslas success with its cost-effective and efficient direct sales model was not easily copied given its leadership in products technology and reputation The US automakers smaller EV rival Xpeng has been rejigging its sales strategy after initially following Tesla into launching direct sales networks But as Teslas model lineup ages it remains unclear whether it will be able to sustain its selling efficiency especially as it enters lower-tier cities and towns where Chinese brands have a bigger presence with dealers Zhang said In 2022 Tesla closed a Beijing store that had been its flagship showroom in China It also shut four stores in Guangzhou in the final quarter of 2023 It has been expanding in second-tier cities like Chengdu and Tianjin where per-store vehicle sales average 163 per month according to CMBI higher than that in first-tier and third-tier cities Tesla opened about 30 new stores in second-tier cities in 2023 a nearly 20% increase STIFFENING COMPETITION While Tesla has pulled ahead of rivals in sales efficiency analysts have cautioned it faces growing headwinds amid stiffening competition Boasting about efficiency is a way of building up a smokescreen to explain away the fact that theyre not growing at the rate of some of their competitors Automobilitys Russo said Any attempt by Tesla to catch up with BYD in overall sales will be affected by production capacity constraints at its Shanghai factory its biggest globally that is capable of making 11 million cars a year Tesla has signalled it wants to expand the plant but the plan still hinges on approvals from Chinese regulators reluctant to add new EV production facilities amid a capacity glut The company plans to expand its Berlin factory and build a new plant in Mexico But BYD has been far more aggressive having built EV factories in nine cities in China with an annual capacity of more than 4 million units and adding plants overseas Teslas global capacity was 2 million vehicles a year its global production chief Tom Zhu said last March CMBI analysts predict the growing gap with BYD could force Tesla to further focus on margin improvement in 2024 with price hikes on revamped models and additional expansion into lower-tier Chinese cities even as its rivals scramble to price their new EVs lower ($1 = 71368 Chinese yuan renminbi) (Reporting by Zhang Yan and Brenda

81,"None","1/9/2024","https://seekingalpha.com/article/4662034-tesla-stock-much-more-than-just-car-company","Justin Sullivan I initiated coverage of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) in March 2023 with a buy-rated article titled Tesla: Electrifying The Earth Tesla has outperformed the S&P by 10% since then I followed that up with two articles one about price cuts and another about Teslas ecosystem Since the ecosystem article Tesla has outperformed the S&P by 34% My most recent Tesla coverage was a Q2 earnings review which I downgraded Tesla to hold and Tesla has underperformed the S&P since Im re-upgrading Tesla to Buy in this article in which I make the case that Tesla is much more than just an auto company The bear case is clear: margin compression high rates geopolitical concerns and a slowing growth rate On top of that the Q3 earnings call was met with criticism and a sharp selloff While the financials certainly werent positive - a $006 miss on EPS and missing revenue by nearly $800m - the bear case is overblown and overwhelmingly focused on the short term Lets discuss some tailwinds for Tesla stock and the three major factors that could drive Tesla to become the worlds most valuable company Tesla management believes in the long term This is their greatest strength Wall Street necessarily believes in the short term This is their greatest weakness When this dynamic exists in markets quite substantial mispricing can occur While I wouldnt characterize Tesla as mispriced currently individual investors must maintain a long-term perspective on the company This discrepancy in time horizons leads to major volatility in Tesla stock Short-term margin compression should be of little concern because it is aligned with the long-term strategy of the company This is the argument that I made in a previous article titled Price Cuts Are Good For Tesla The core of that argument is that if price cuts allow management to pursue their business strategy which they do then it is a good strategy to cut prices That business strategy is to accelerate the transition to sustainable energy Tesla has continued growing production deliveries the Tesla Energy business and its Supercharger network Price cuts resulted in margin compression and slower-than-expected revenue growth YTD through Q3 of 2023 Partly responsible for price cuts were rate hikes and increasing financing costs Management rightfully believes that monthly cost is one of the foremost factors in consumers car-buying decisions so cutting prices was critical to keep the total cost of ownership down Price cuts were important to continue ramping deliveries which exceeded production volume in Q3 For both Q4 and full year 2023 production exceeded deliveries with both showing ongoing growth Business Wire Key to this delivery data is that BYD (OTCPK:BYDDF) overtook Tesla as the global leader in EV sales BYD has its sights set on becoming more relevant outside of China The key difference between Teslas and BYDs business models currently is that BYD offers much lower-priced models This certainly plays a part in their rapid sales increase which when matched with impressive production capacity makes this a very foreseeable outcome in hindsight Important to note though is that BYD overtook Tesla only for Q4 For the full-year 2023 Tesla is still the lead Tesla recently began working on a new production process to manufacture an affordable EV at scale though While this could still be years away Tesla will eventually have a product that rivals BYDs pricing and could regain the title of global sales leader at that time if not before Bloomberg Focusing specifically on the US market tells a different story though For one BYD does not sell its vehicles in the US market due to prohibitively expensive import tariffs The US has the largest economy with the strongest consumer and Tesla is utterly dominant with more sales than all other competitors combined: Electrekco While it isnt great that BYD dethroned Tesla its clear that Tesla is still the US leader in EVs This may erode over time as legacy automakers offer more EV models but Tesla will enjoy this dominance for years to come The first-mover advantage is quite clear Lets turn back now to a comment I made earlier about Teslas new manufacturing process This process dubbed unboxed uses new technology and could upend auto manufacturing Its hard to overstate the marvel of Teslas manufacturing process The most important innovation in Teslas manufacturing aside from the extensive use of robots is the Giga Press The Giga Press is a huge die-casting machine that facilitates gigacasting a process that creates large single-piece molds for various auto components The Giga Press revolutionized auto manufacturing and has even caught the attention of Toyota (TM) who is the clear leader in manufacturing quality General Motors (GM) has even gone so far as to acquire one of the leading Giga Press suppliers Heres how Reuters reporter Kevin Krolicki explains the benefits of Gigacasting: Fewer parts lower costs and a simplified production line have contributed to Teslas industry-leading profitability analysts have said For Tesla the use of a single component in the rear of the Model Y - its best-selling model - allowed it to cut related costs by 40% the company has said In the Model 3 by using a single piece from the front and rear of the vehicle Tesla was able to remove 600 robots from assembly Elon Musk has said It can also cut a vehicles weight – an important consideration for EVs where the battery pack alone can weigh more than 700 kg And it has the potential to reduce waste and greenhouse emissions from a plant True to Teslas history of innovation they arent stopping there Reuters recently reported on the Giga Press 20 and the complementary unboxed manufacturing process This is speculated to enable the mass production of an affordable EV possibly the Model 2 which will cost less than $30k The Giga Press 20 could allow Tesla to replace up to 400 individual components with one single mold and reduce the time to market for new models to 12-18 months Legacy automakers can take anywhere from 3-4 years to release a new model While Gigacasting at the scale of the Giga Press 20 was traditionally seen as too costly 3D printing models and testing on a much smaller scale has allowed Tesla to prototype for far cheaper and avoid a lot of costly mistakes Although the Giga Press 10 proved to revolutionize auto manufacturing there are drawbacks to this design Accidents can be far more costly if they deal damage throughout the single-die mold Further the use of structural battery packs can entirely total a car if the underbody damage also damages the batteries Elon Musk has stated that Tesla designed crash absorption rails that can be cut off and repaired to preserve the packs As an aside another important update on the mass market EV came in Walter Isaacsons recently released biography of Elon Musk: So in May 2023 he decided to change the initial build location for the next-generation cars and Robotaxis to Austin where his own workspace and that of his top engineers would be right next to the new high-speed ultra-automated assembly line Throughout the summer of 2023 he spent hours each week working with his team to design each station on the line finding ways to shave milliseconds off each step and process As he had in the past with both Tesla cars and SpaceX rockets he knew there was something just as important as the design of the project: the design of the manufacturing systems that would build the products at high volume The vehicle will not be produced in Mexico as was the previously held belief As if the story couldnt get better we can now expect the next-gen vehicle to be made in America Its still yet to be seen if this next step in Gigacasting will prove successful in the long run though and its something that investors need to pay close attention to If successful this will once again revolutionize auto manufacturing and enable Tesla to market a low-cost EV at scale The results will speak for themselves but success in this venture will certainly get Tesla closer to being the worlds most valuable business Manufacturing efficiency is a key characteristic of leading car companies though The next piece of the Tesla puzzle is that they have quickly become the industry standard in EV charging With the expansive Supercharger network and increasing adoption of the NACS standard Tesla has a major opportunity in EV charging Tesla earns money when Superchargers are used Naturally revenue will increase as usage increases This will benefit immensely from the NACS standard quickly becoming the industry standard for EV charging ports Legacy automakers that have adopted the NACS standard have all but formally announced that they will rely on the Supercharger network for their EV charging infrastructure The network itself is by far the most extensive with a current installed base of 50000 units 11000 of them new in 2023 according to this Tesla post on X Meanwhile analysts predict the supercharger network could become a $10b/year business by 2030 A more ambitious estimate proclaims this is up to a $100b business for Tesla in the dominant case which is increasingly likely as NACS adoption ramps A key assumption used here is that EVs will make up 8% of total driving miles in 2030 With 8% miles share and a few other assumptions the Supercharger network could grow to be an incredible asset for Tesla In my opinion the $100b valuation of Superchargers by 2030 is reasonable because I believe EVs will comprise significantly more than 8% of all miles driven in 2030 However the assumption that the Supercharger network will run on 100% solar energy that is completely free for Tesla is less believable These two considerations roughly balance out in my mind so I will agree with a $100b valuation or over 1/8th of the current market cap of Tesla Thats ignoring auto sales leasing insurance energy storage Optimus and robotaxis Tesla hasnt stopped there with Superchargers though They also recently announced a second deal to sell non-Tesla branded Superchargers to a large chain of gas stations This announcement comes on the heels of the $100m deal with BP and the public proclamation that this will be a new business practice they pursue The most recent update to the Supercharger network is the start of the V4 station rollout V4 stations feature a 3-foot increase in cable length important for Cybertruck and non-Tesla EV charging faster charging (from 250 kW/180 miles of range in 15 minutes to 350 kW/250 miles of range in 15 minutes) V4 Superchargers also have better cooling technology to prevent overheating and come equipped with Magic Dock the CCS standard for non-Tesla EVs From the competition standpoint Tesla dominates For one Electrify America has 3729 fast chargers currently installed but they are backed by Volkswagen which recently adopted the NACS standard ChargePoint (CHPT) is undergoing a leadership transition and has 22000 DC ports installed EVgo (EVGO) meanwhile has 945 fast charging stations IONITY a joint venture between various major automakers (2 of which have adopted NACS) has 3306 fast charging stations scattered throughout Europe Finally Blink Charging (BLNK) has 85000 charging ports installed but doesnt specify which are fast chargers Teslas 50000 Superchargers make them a market leader in fast-charging infrastructure The final piece of Tesla that differentiates it from other car companies is Dojo Dojo is a supercomputer that Tesla built to train FSD and Optimus and subsequently run FSD and Optimus inference at scale You can find a primer on Dojo here Dojo is critical to Tesla becoming the worlds most valuable company By now you should know that Teslas autonomous driving software FSD Full-Self Driving runs entirely on AI The only other leading approach is that of lasers and sensors monitoring the surrounding environment and driving accordingly Using AI is an ambitious approach since well be entrusting algorithms to make real-time decisions with cars something that could be catastrophic FSD will have to be extremely fine-tuned so that it doesnt hallucinate like ChatGPT sometimes does Overall an AI model is only as good as the data its trained on This is Teslas unique competitive advantage in AI All Tesla vehicles come equipped with numerous cameras that capture real-time driving data to feed the model These algorithms are also trained to capture interesting events when the human driver performs an action that the AI model wouldnt have These interesting events are fed back to Tesla HQ where they can be reviewed and incorporated into additional training algorithms While FSD is still considered Level 2 autonomy meaning it requires active human supervision it will be a strong growth engine for the company as the Tesla fleet continues to grow and the algorithms learn more The better the data the better the model The better the model the better the performance The better the performance the more trust consumers will have and the faster it will grow revenues FSD will be a major asset for Tesla in the future This is not to mention that autonomous driving once fully commercialized should be significantly safer than human driving Tesla will benefit from this as insurance costs will come down and the total cost of Tesla ownership will drop in tandem With cheaper insurance lower rates lower manufacturing costs and more consumer trust Tesla will dominate both the EV and autonomous driving industries The Dojo Supercomputer is built with the capacity to train the FSD model AI models require significantly more hardware and networking requirements in training than they do in inference As FSD shifts further from training to inference Tesla will have significantly more compute capacity than needed While they have left open the option to make this compute available to outside customers (similar to a cloud provider) they are still focused on training FSD and Optimus with Dojo Both of these will take up all the bandwidth Tesla can get for the foreseeable future but there is some likelihood that Tesla could offer a product similar to NVIDIA DRIVE in the future as well While NVIDIA (NVDA) is the clear king of full-stack AI solutions their autonomous driving proposition likely wont be as competitive as Teslas FSD will have a wealth of training on real-world proprietary data and be proven to succeed at scale in the Tesla ecosystem Also if FSD does get full autonomy and regulatory approvals there will be much more trust in Dojo than in DRIVE Of course there is immense execution risk here Its possible that FSD simply never crosses the finish line into level 4 or 5 full autonomy Regardless Tesla has found a way to monetize a workable level 3 product so in worst case scenario we will remain stagnant at level 3 Im upgrading Tesla to buy partly because I expect markets to begin a bull run in 2024 I cant predict how much well run but I do think we end 24 in the green Aside from markets performing generally well my valuation model suggests Tesla is undervalued In my initial model I correctly predicted this years slight drop in net income (though I predicted ~$102b in net income vs ~$107b actual) I also priced in net income dropping in 2024 and 2025 and used a terminal earnings multiple of 30 to round out a margin of safety valuation of $175-$190/share I consider anything below $190/share my margin of safety price Using TTM net income and slightly more aggressive growth figures (flat/no growth from 2024-2026 15% earnings growth from 2027-2030 and 10% earnings growth from 2031-2033) and a terminal P/E of 30 I estimate Teslas intrinsic value to be $245-$260 Therefore the current trading range within the $230s allows investors to buy Tesla right around my intrinsic value estimate Keep in mind that these numbers are extremely conservative considering Teslas growth prospects I expect Tesla to significantly outperform this model but I like to be brutally conservative in my valuation estimates to build in the inherent uncertainty of the real world Therefore I rate Tesla a Buy at current levels While Tesla is far from Apple at current levels I believe Teslas future growth prospects significantly overshadow the others in the Magnificent 7 Tesla is disrupting the legacy auto manufacturing industry is the de-facto standard in EV charging design and built their own supercomputer to make autonomous driving a reality Historically betting against Elon Musk has been a supremely bad bet I dont see this changing in the future so investors who can tolerate Teslas

Tesla owners have run into trouble amid freezing temperatures That alone is staggering – but the total owed is what’s really left people shocked According to the screenshot which shows an email received from Tesla the balance due is just $237 Like ourselves you were probably expecting it to cost hundreds of dollars to charge an EV regularly over a month First time i’ve had a bill within the last 12 months this sucks pictwittercom/OSGdu1QbcN But a quick look at their X profile gives you a pretty big clue as to why they likely only paid a few dollars to charge their EV over the past year Their cover photo is of a Tesla Powerwall which is essentially a massive battery you can buy and loop into your home’s power to store charge It’s at its most useful when paired with solar panels to create a potentially self-sufficient power loop This not only means that the solar panels will power your home they can also store excess charge in your Powerwall which can then be used to keep your Tesla topped up when you plug it in While this sounds like a dream scenario it requires a pretty high investment to set up between the panels the battery and the Tesla EV itself There are environmental factors to take into consideration too @Tesla_GTownTX appears to be based in the Texas area which normally gets lots of sunshine to bank plenty of power but the ongoing cold snap will have slowed that right down “First time I’ve had a bill within the last 12 months This sucks” the X user jokingly captioned their post People were quick to respond with plenty of jokes including a Tiger King meme where Joe Exotic says: “I am never going to financially recover from this” “That’s horrible My condolences” one user replied “Damn my dude post a GoFund Me the community will rally around you I’m sure” another joked Why the Cybertruck may not actually have been faster than Porsche 911 while towing This is why an owner put a solar roof on their Model Y after Tesla wouldn’t Instagram Facebook Twitter Likedin Copyrights ©2024 SB Media Holding Limited"

it was the perfect storm said Charles Elson founding director of the Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance Its a seminal case The case and Musks subsequent reaction raise several questions about the future of corporate board and executive relationships and whether Delaware will remain as the de facto home for big businesses Key to the Delaware courts decision was Musks relationship with board members with McCormick writing in her ruling that Musk had extensive ties with the people who were negotiating for Tesla on the package including members of management who were beholden to Musk among them General Counsel Todd Maron his former divorce attorney A recent Wall Street Journal report included some inflammatory allegations about how far those board relationships bled into Musks personal life Put simply neither the Compensation Committee nor the Board acted in the best interests of the Company when negotiating Musks compensation plan In fact there is barely any evidence of negotiations at all she wrote Elson said the rules regarding director and committee independence were always a little loose often just simply asking if directors are employees or consultants In this instance McCormick looked at independence in a much more nuanced way than typically Delaware has done Elson said Weve been moving in that direction but she got us there Theres going to be much more concern about real independence on the board and the process by which theres negotiation he said It will certainly force boards to be more independent in reality and to really be more careful with the process by which they reach compensation Elson said one of the issues in this instance was that due to Musks outsized pay package other CEOs in and outside of his peer group were able to make demands based on it He now expects that practice to stop as that kind of grant will not happen because of fear of that kind of challenge Total compensation for S&P 500 CEOs has steadily risen in recent years hitting a mean of $154 million in 2023 according to data from The Conference Board and data analytics firm ESGAGUE But even as those figures have risen Musks compensation would be an outlier among outliers said Matteo Tonello managing director at The Conference Board However Tonello noted that even with the rise in total compensation successful challenges on say-on-pay votes have declined Furthermore he said even after a successful say-on-pay vote the likelihood that a compensation package would be challenged in court is even lower In Teslas 2018 CEO compensation package the board awarded Musk a dozen tranches of stock options that would finish vesting in 2022 based on several milestones including stock price increases Between the beginning of 2018 and the end of 2022 Tesla shares soared almost 500% as Musk promised to turn Tesla into not just a dominant EV brand but a robotaxi company and solar juggernaut among other things The S&P 500 gained 44% over that stretch while the Nasdaq rose 52% Former SEC Chairman Jay Clayton said on CNBCs Squawk Box this week that while it was an outsized unique pay package that at the time seemed nearly impossible shareholders did also benefit from Teslas remarkable rise Judging with hindsight youve got to be really really careful Clayton said Thats why Delaware has lasted so long because process protects judgments from 20/20 hindsight and substance is important Musks high-profile campaign to move companies out of Delaware adds to mounting challenges from other states in recent years to dent Delawares reputation as the first choice for incorporation Musks post suggesting Tesla would move from Delaware was well received by Texas Governor Greg Abbott on X who has looked to challenge Delawares position as the preeminent business court in the US Last June Abbott signed a law that would establish business courts in the state to deal with complex commercial disputes Those courts will open in September Former US Attorney General William Barr also called for companies to move away from Delaware in a November WSJ op-ed claiming that the states courts are embracing ESG which rejects shareholder value as corporate laws lodestar In exchange Barr suggested companies consider Texas Georgia Utah or Wyoming all of which now have their own designated business court Walter Isaacson the former CNN CEO who wrote Musks biography said on Squawk Box on Monday that if the Delaware Supreme Court doesnt overrule this decision its going to hurt Delawarebecause people will say Wait you mean five years after something happens eight years after something happens youll go back and undo it? While Isaacson said he understands why people are upset at Musk I cant see how you take the guys compensation five years after [it was] granted and say the deal that 75% of stockholders made just revoke that and take the money away Both Elson and Tonello are skeptical about any Delaware exodus stemming from this decision Delaware has been the primary state of incorporation in the United States for several decades due to a business-friendly corporate law and a specialized court that can decide on corporate disputes expeditiously and without a jury This has led to an extensive body of case law that is appreciated even by large institutional shareholders Tonello said Even when shareholder approval is not required by organizational documents a board of directors of a publicly traded company most likely would want to seek shareholder approval of a critical organizational decision such as reincorporating in another state The decision could in turn trigger a shareholder lawsuit Elson noted that while there are several states now vying for companies not incorporating in Delaware its nothing new as North Carolina North Dakota Nevada Michigan and others in the past have tried to do Delawares continued advantage comes down to a few factors Elson said including a superb corporate law statute a deep bench with corporate law expertise and a body of law in this area that far surpasses any other state But perhaps most importantly Elson said is that there is no hometown advantage There isnt much else going on in Delaware other than corporate regulation and so its viewed by investors and managers as neutral In 2022 the Delaware courts ruled in favor of Musk in a shareholder lawsuit over Teslas $26 billion acquisition of SolarCity Tesla shareholders alleged the companys acquisition of the solar installer amounted to a bailout pushed through by Musk who sat on both company boards at the time The shareholders also alleged that Musk controlled the board of Tesla even though he appeared to recuse himself from some deal negotiations concerning SolarCity Had he lost Musk could have had to pay upwards of $2 billion Whether you like or dislike an opinion it will be smartly thought out and not biased towards one group or another he said They tend to call them as they see them Got a confidential news tip?

‘gigafactory’","2/21/2024","https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/feb/21/german-town-votes-against-tesla-plans-to-expand-gigafactory-carmake-industrial-action-sweden","Bosses promise to go back to drawing board while carmaker faces industrial action from another union in Sweden The people of a small German town where Elon Musk has built a Tesla factory have thrown a spanner in the works by rejecting plans to expand the complex The majority of residents of Grünheide in Brandenburg an hour’s drive south-east of Berlin voted against proposals to build new infrastructure intended to improve access to the site and allow easier transport of the finished vehicles including a freight depot and warehouses A kindergarten for employees’ children was also part of the plans which propose expanding the 300-hectare (740-acre) factory site by 170 hectares and felling about 100 hectares of pine forest in the process Voter turnout was 76% with 3499 people voting against the plans 1882 in favour The referendum is not legally binding but should “serve as an orientation” for local decision-makers and Tesla bosses who have lobbied hard for the “gigafactory” The mayor of Grünheide Arne Christiani and bosses of the carmaker said the vote result would now prompt them to return to the drawing board Plans for the original plant were first announced by Musk in November 2019 Vehicle production began in March 2022 with the first electric cars rolling off the conveyor belt almost immediately Central to objections from the start led by a local citizens’ initiative is the estimated 18m cubic metres of groundwater required by the plant to produce between 300000 and 500000 cars a year The Brandenburg region has been beset by drought for several years Tesla has repeatedly pledged to keep water use to a minimum and to recycle its water rigorously But local people say they fear in particular the contamination of drinking water if groundwater levels drop too low The citizens’ initiative which is backed by ecologists point out that part of the planned area of expansion is in a water protection area Christiani an independent told the German broadcaster RBB that he regretted the referendum’s outcome and blamed negative publicity for the result “Seemingly it has not been possible to convey to people that further important infrastructure projects such as a new B-road or a railway station forecourt [need the Tesla expansion] Now the municipality has the considerable task of trying to find solutions to this” Alexander Schirp the managing director of the Berlin-Brandenburg business association (UVB) also expressed his disappointment saying: “The Tesla investment is a lucky break for Grünheide and the whole of the state of Brandenburg “We think that rather than the risks involved it should be the chances this investment brings with it which should be the main focus and that includes environmental concerns” The gigafactory the first Tesla operation of its kind in Europe employs about 12500 workers In a statement after the announcement of the referendum result Tesla described its expansion plans as “a big win for the community” adding that it would “seek dialogue with all participants to decide on further steps” The company said its goal was to “enable a significant transfer of the HGV-traffic on to rail as well as generally ensuring a speedy expansion of existing infrastructure around the factory” Tesla added that the increase in warehouse capacity would help to increase the efficiency of delivering its cars The company had to stop production for about two weeks recently because of supply chain delays caused by attacks by Houthi rebels on commercial shipping in the Red Sea Last month a strike by Tesla workers in Sweden over collective bargaining rights became the country’s longest-running stoppage in nearly 80 years The strike by members of the IF Metall trade union is being portrayed as the largest attempt to save Sweden’s union model from global labour practices in decades IF Metall has more than 300000 members across various industries in Sweden According to the National Mediation Office about a third of Tesla workers in the country have taken part in the strike since it began on 27 October resulting in the loss of an estimated 1936 days of Swedish labour The industrial action has attracted multiple secondary or sympathy strikes by unions representing among others postal workers dock workers electricians and painters It has been described as “insane” by Musk and prompted Tesla to launch legal action In neighbouring Denmark Norway and Finland Tesla cars have been blocked at ports On Wednesday the Swedish trade union Seko also announced sympathy measures saying it would stop maintenance repairs and service of Tesla charging stations and block new connections preparation and planning Seko’s president Gabriella Lavecchia said: “IF Metall’s fight is also our fight By refusing to comply with the rules of the game here in Sweden Tesla is trying to gain competitive advantages by giving the workers worse wages and conditions than they would have with a collective agreement It is of course completely unacceptable “The fight that IF Metall is now taking is important for the entire Swedish collective agreement model That is why we have chosen to issue another sympathy notice and increase the pressure on Tesla”"

Try the BYD Seagull Want a luxury SUV that can float in water? Thats the BYD U8 Premium Edition Want something more luxurious? Chery another Chinese carmaker launched a sexy EV sports car with scissor doors called the iCar which costs between $21800 and $58000 Chinas ability to expand its suite of offerings comes down to cost Of course the US has higher labor costs but China has also taken great pains to own the EV supply chain Legacy carmakers are still searching around the world to source the raw materials and parts they need a project the Chinese government has been working on for over a decade In fact many of these companies are selling their products to American firms: Tesla buys batteries from BYD for example That doesnt mean Chinese car companies arent facing challenges While the USs strategy (or lack thereof) has left us without enough chargers or the right kind of inventory China has the opposite problem It has too many EVs too many EV makers and a flagging domestic economy China EV Inc needs to expand to new markets The future of the auto industry hangs on whether it can start to do that before the rest of the world can catch up The year Musk tittered at the idea of Chinese EVs overtaking Tesla the country produced only 5000 electric cars But Beijings plan to dominate the global EV space was already well underway The Chinese Communist Party started out by setting the goal of having EVs make up 25% of all cars sold in China by 2025 and showered money on companies with anything even resembling a plan to contribute to that goal At the same time the government set about marshaling all the raw materials Chinese companies would need for EV batteries and drivetrains creating a domestic ecosystem for suppliers In this way its industrial policy for EVs copied past plans to dominate steel and solar panels — flood the market with supply until Chinese manufacturers were the only game in town But in 2016 the CCP changed course The grant money for EV research and development petered out and the government announced that by 2027 it would phase out subsidies that lowered the price of electric cars for consumers Beijing also instituted policies that opened the door for foreign carmakers to invest more in Chinas domestic industry and move manufacturing there The result was pure carnage for Chinas domestic EV industry Companies that depended on Beijing for subsidies began to implode and small players got pushed out of the market But the chaos ended up strengthening the countrys auto sector ensuring that the most competitive carmakers gained market share What emerged started to look more like a more mature industry — one with the capacity to manufacture world-class products Last year China became the worlds largest auto exporter None of this means the road ahead is any easier for the victors of Beijings EV wars Chinese automakers now have to deal with slower domestic demand as the Chinese economy enters a protracted phase of slower growth At the same time they know that their growth and success are central to the vision of Chinas technological landscape that its leader Xi Jinping has Slowing down is not an option The sector is expected to add capacity for 5 million more cars (most of them EVs) by 2025 Domestic sales are projected to reach only 37 million in that same period Sales for standout startups such as Nio Li Auto and XPeng are already coming in lower than expected BYD alone has built enough capacity to manufacture 4 million cars in China In 2023 it sold 3 million cars total All these cars need somewhere to go and for China EV Inc the more profitable option is to move them west — first to Europe where trade barriers are easier to overcome (for now) and eventually to the US That is why brands such as BYD Chery and SAIC are all in discussions with the Mexican government to expand operations there They need a toehold in North America to even begin conquering the US market In the meantime the US government is trying to spend an EV-parts ecosystem into existence in part by handing out grants from the Energy Department to domestic companies working on battery technologies No country wants to lose its automotive sector so in Brussels and Washington the rise of Chinas national champions has become a thorny topic between international-trade interlocutors In public forums Chinese trade apparatchiks have talked a good game about culling excess capacity to assuage the fears of their counterparts But at the same time Beijing has put out an 18-point plan to counter trade restrictions and push Chinese EVs out to the world None of this is really up for negotiation To dominate the global market Chinese automakers have to find ways to slip around the various barriers Western nations have put up To crack Europe BYD has announced plans to build a factory in Hungary Cracking the US is more complex It has more trade barrier protection from a China Auto Inc onslaught but it may not work forever Take for instance Americas taxes on Chinese EV imports The Trump administration smacked a 25% tariff on Chinese EVs bringing the total levy for their entrance to the US up to 275% To avoid the tariffs brands like BYD Chery and SAIC are all in discussions with the Mexican government to expand operations there Most likely the way Chinese companies would be able to participate in the US EV market would be by investing in the Mexican auto-parts sector Mary Lovely an economist and senior fellow at the Peterson Institute told me Parts that come from Mexico would be considered North American-made and subjected to lighter restrictions under the US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement EVs fully built in China would also not be eligible for a $7500 tax rebate for consumers created under President Joe Bidens Inflation Reduction Act They would be eligible though if they were built in Mexico and met specific battery-sourcing requirements For some stakeholders the barriers arent high enough US consumers have shown that if the price is low enough Made in America takes a backseat Thats why the United Auto Workers union is already so worried about Chinese cars that it has asked the White House to raise tariffs even more The Biden administration has said its seriously considering such a move This auto industry has become caught up in the existential question that is bedeviling societies all over the world — is globalization worth it? In this case: What do we care about more preserving the auto industry or giving consumers a variety of cheap EVs to choose from? We want to maintain an auto industry in the US — thats essential for jobs national security and for other sectors of the economy Lovely said But then the question is how much protection do you need recognizing that its not a free lunch This is why people dont like economists We keep reminding people none of this is free There is no telling how this will all shake out Sure Chinese EV makers are lean and mean but theyve never had to deal with international markets before Beijing is used to dealing with foreign brands entering its market not the other way around For most of Chinas rise it has operated in a cooperative world Now its operating in a world where its most important trading partners no longer trust Beijing EVs collect so much data that policymakers have started to frame this debate as one not just about trade but also about national security Thats a harder debate for China to win In the US the race to counter China by building a cheaper EV is on Tesla could pull ahead if delivers on its promise to get its $25000 car out by 2025 But the company has a history of delayed product launches an ongoing price war impairing cash flow and an erratic X-distracted CEO to deal with Big Auto is contending with a more muscular United Auto Workers more skittish shareholders and management that has done nothing but fall behind That said Americas legacy automakers have experience fighting for their survival and winning Whatever happens what is guaranteed is a transformation of the auto industry Linette Lopez is a senior correspondent at Business Insider Through our Discourse journalism Business Insider seeks to explore and illuminate the day’s most fascinating issues and ideas Our writers provide thought-provoking perspectives informed by analysis reporting and expertise Read more Discourse stories here Related stories More from Transportation Jump to"

And maybe even out into 2025? Thats what gets priced into these stocks So if you take a look here this is whats changed in earnings estimates over the last 30 days So this is not expectations for next year necessarily directly it is what has changed in the last 30 days You see really I think the takeaway here Seana youre looking at it Theres only three companies that really saw big changes And that to me is one of the prevailing takeaways here NVIDIA Amazon Meta the big three winners of this earnings season You can see Alphabet actually had its estimates up a little bit But we were talking about this off air and discussing what do we learn from this And I think its the three companies there And then if you look at year-to-date performance in these stocks you probably have to give Microsoft a little bit of credit Microsoft is up about 8% So a little bit over the market So maybe well call it 3 and 1/2 But to me the prevailing takeaway that weve seen in earnings projections movements is maybe were not talking about the Magnificent Seven Maybe its the Fantastic Four or the 3 and 1/2 I dont know But it seems like were no longer in this seven tech stock phase And its certainly narrowed BRAD SMITH: The triple threat Yeah SEANA SMITH: Triple threat That was a good one OK I was trying to I was sitting over here trying to come up with something quick You beat me to it But Josh I think also for investors is what this means for the broader market Zooming out even more talking about how this is factoring into S&P projections for year end Weve seen a number of analysts even this week with Barclays out this morning upping their target even more JOSH SCHAFER: And in most of these strategists that are coming out and saying they expect the S&P 500 to rise higher so Barclays coming out and saying that they think its going to go to 5300 Theyre boosting their target from 4800 The main driver of that is big tech So theyre saying they think the economy is going to hold up well which is of course important because big tech also needs the economy to do well But then theyre also highlighting that they think that big tech is going to be the big outperformer here And they said in this release here in their research they were highlighting overall how much more big tech is worth in the earnings story than the rest of the S&P 500 and really the rest of big tech If you were to remove big tech Im looking at their projections for the full year 2024 right now Youre talking about the rest of the S&P 500 being at like $177 worth of earnings Instead of when you add in big tech you get $46 worth of earnings in that So its a significant increase when youre adding in big tech and adding in those high expectations Thats whats driving these targets higher right now SEANA SMITH: It seems like nothing stopping-- what is it?

always been a contentious investment On the one hand TSLA is arguably the most recognizable name in the industry that is widely expected to become one of the biggest in the coming years and decades amidst the ongoing green transformation On the other many have been pointing out for years that Tesla is a car company and not a big tech firm and that it should be valued as one with at least one analyst making a shockingly low 2025 Tesla stock prediction for TSLA in 2024 – $2353 The debate appears more relevant in 2024 than ever before as the broad EV market has been on a decline for well over a year with many even claiming that the bubble has burst by late January yet February brought an unexpected reprieve compelling many to again consider buying Tesla stock rather than shorting it While Tesla has been struggling in terms of stock market performance in the last 52 weeks – it declined 291% – and particularly in the last 6 months – having fallen 1637% in the time frame Still while the company is overall down compared to its share value one year ago Tesla stock graph shows periods of significant growth along with periods of decline in stark contrast to many of TSLA’s competitors The latest 30 days of trading have however sent Elon Musk’s EV maker 461% into the green with the uptrend seemingly stabilizing in the last full market week The latest full day – Tuesday February 27 – brought the uptrend to a halt at least for the time being as Tesla shares closed 017% in the green at $19973 Still the rally is not yet large enough to negate TSLA stock’s 2024 decline and the EV maker remains 1960% down year-to-date (YTD) It remains to be seen whether the recent uptick represents the end of a value buying opportunity for Tesla shares or if it is a deep breath before the plunge While much has been said about the slowdown in demand that the EV industry has been facing – a slowdown significant enough that certain traditional vehicle makers like Ford (NYSE: F) have scaled down production and ambitious big tech companies like Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) have reportedly scrapped their automotive plans – the fact remains that Tesla has been offering strong delivery figures despite the tough year In fact TSLA’s deliveries report for the entire 2023 showcased a strong growth in production and the firm shipped as many as 18 million vehicles during the year – 500000 more than in 2022 – indicating that there is a lot of room to grow for the company despite the significant headwinds The broader EV market has also seen two significant rallies starting in late January In the US Lucid (NASDAQ: LCID) led an industry resurgence after it announced several crucial partnerships Though the Saudi-owned company is back in the red Tesla managed to continue riding the rally The recent performance of the Chinese EV market could also be a factor – if looked at as an indicator for what may come to the global electric vehicle industry – as most of its notable companies like BYD (SHE: 002594) Xpeng Inc (NYSE: XPEV) rose approximately 5% in the last 30 days while Li Auto (NASDAQ: LI) surged as much as 60% in February alone What the current “EV winter” brought to light more than anything else is just how bullish most experts are when it comes to the industry’s long-term prospects This is most evident when one looks at the 12-month price targets for companies that have faced significantly more serious issues than Tesla in recent months – Nio (NYSE: NIO) with a forecast 70% upside and Lucid with 30% In this relatively short time frame the forecasts for Elon Musk’s EV maker are also cautiously optimistic with TSLA stock’s average target forecasting a 952% upside – which becomes even more notable when the effects of the extremely bearish $23 forecast on the average figure are taken into account Given the ratings for this relative short term it hardly comes as a surprise that the answers to the question of what Tesla stock will be worth in 2030 are generally rather bullish Late in January and despite many exclaiming that the EV bubble has burst at the time David Barron – a manager of a $13 billion investment fund – opined that Tesla Motors is likely to rise 550% in the coming 6 years and set his Tesla stock price target at $1200 – not accounting a possible Tesla stock split that might happen in so many years Baron explained that his very bullish Tesla stock price prediction for 2030 stems from the company’s generally strong brand and a history of success In this context the current slowdown can be viewed more as a temporary setback than a harbinger of downturns to come Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood is another major Tesla bull and her prediction for the EV maker’s rise is not only more significant than Baron’s but foresees a quicker surge In fact Ark’s 2027 Tesla stock price target stands at an impressive $2000 per share While the figure might appear too high at first glance Wood has previously been right when she predicted a 1000% 5-year rise for the company – a prediction that discounting the actual Tesla stock value effects stock splits have had in the meantime came true in 2021 All things considered right now appears like a decent time to buy TSLA shares but whether you should buy Tesla stock today will largely depend on your personal risk tolerance and faith in Elon Musk’s EV maker While the company has its fair shares of bulls – and bulls that have been right with past predictions – there are many who recommend caution when it comes to Tesla shares While the $23 Tesla stock price prediction is on the extreme end others have loudly proclaimed that they will not come close to the EV company unless it sees an even greater price drop Perhaps the most prominent of these is Gurgavin Chandoke – an event-driven technology-focused trader who frequently shares his opinions and strategies on X – who stated he would not buy Tesla shares unless they fell to approximately $100 I AM STILL NOT A BUYER OF TESLA HERE AFTER THIS 40% CRASHTESLA NEEDS TO DROP ANOTHER 50% + TO GET ME INTERESTED$TSLA pictwittercom/D44gw0efXm Indeed while the returns on buying Tesla stock today could become immense if the company’s biggest bulls are even partially correct and there is no clear answer to the question of what Tesla stock will be worth in 2030 risks remain high Not only are EVs still considered luxury goods in a market unfavorable for such products due to the inflation and interest rate-driven cost of living crisis but even in its own playing field Tesla Motors has been overtaken in terms of deliveries by one

Richard Torenetta a resident of Pennsylvania sued Musk and other Tesla directors in 2018 over Musk’s pay package At the time he held just nine shares of the company Torenetta was the drummer for the heavy metal band Dawn of Correction between 2005 and 2007 The band released a full-length studio album ‘Dead Hand Control’ in 2007 and performed in music festivals Subsequently Torenetta who holds a degree in industrial design went on to work in the marketing department at an online real estate marketing service according to a report by the New York Post On a social media platform he described himself as a “marketer inventor custom fabricator car guy family man and drummer” and claimed that he “designed and built an illuminated headpiece for onstage drumming performances” the report added It remains unclear if Torenetta still owns those nine shares of Tesla or has bought more shares over the years In the past five years the company’s share prices have jumped by 800% the New York Post said Why did Torenetta sue? Torenetta claimed that Musk’s pay package was unfair According to the Reuters report the package gives Musk stock grants worth around 1% of Tesla’s equity each time the company achieved one of 12 tranches of escalating operational and financial goals Torenetta said “Shareholders were not told how easily the goals would be achieved when they voted on the package” the report added In its defence Tesla’s board of directors argued that the pay package was required to ensure that Musk continued to dedicate his attention to the company The Guardian reported that “Antonio Gracias a Tesla director from 2007 to 2021 called the package ‘a great deal for shareholders’ because he said it led to the company’s extraordinary success” Torenetta however said the pay was not necessary to incentivise Musk to help Tesla succeed as the billionaire already owned around 22% of the company’s stock What did the court say? In her ruling Judge Kathaleen McCormick wrote that the pay package’s share-based compensation was negotiated by directors who appeared beholden to Musk according to Reuters “Swept up by the rhetoric of ‘all upside’ or perhaps starry eyed by Musk’s superstar appeal the board never asked the $558 billion question: Was the plan even necessary for Tesla to retain Musk and achieve its goals?” she wrote Judge McCormick also noted that Tesla’s current board of directors lacks independence as it includes Kimbal Musk Elon Musk’s brother and James Murdoch son of media tycoon Rupert Murdoch who have close relationships with Musk (With inputs from Reuters) The US is monitoring the arrest of Indian opposition leader Arvind Kejriwal and urges a fair legal process Germany also expressed concern over the arrest causing India to protest Delhi CM and AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal was arrested on corruption charges a month before national elections The US and Germany both emphasize the importance of a fair and impartial trial for Kejriwal"
103,"Tesla investors should think twice about Musk’s plan to reincorporate in Texas","2/3/2024","https://www.marketwatch.com/story/tesla-investors-should-think-twice-about-elon-musks-plan-to-reincorporate-in-texas-87f46be7","Tesla Inc investors need to carefully consider Elon Musk’s possible forthcoming proposal to reincorporate the electric-vehicle maker in Texas a business-friendly state that may not be as focused on the rights of shareholders as Delaware The Tesla TSLA +571% chief executive said Thursday on X formerly known as Twitter that he plans to “immediately hold a shareholder vote to transfer state of incorporation to Texas” Musk has soured on Delaware where the majority of US corporations are incorporated after the chancellor of the Delaware Chancery Court issued a ruling in a shareholder lawsuit Tuesday that voided his $56 billion pay package For more: Nullification of Elon Musk’s pay package could be a wake-up call for corporate boards “People come to Delaware for a very important reason it is considered a neutral jurisdiction It intelligently decides corporate disputes and has the best judges in the country to revolve corporate disputes” said Charles Elson founding director of the Edgar S Woolard Jr Chair in Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware “There is no home-court advantage in Delaware” And that appears to be specifically the point now for Musk and possibly for many other US executives as well Companies have been moving to Texas from states perceived as less business-friendly like California and some are considering reincorporating there Texas has now even created its own business courts which will begin hearing cases in September on “certain types of complex commercial disputes” “More than 10% of the Fortune 500 is headquartered in Texas — 55 of the 2023 list” said Brad Foster a Dallas-based partner at Haynes Boone’s corporate-governance practice group “The majority have long been incorporated in Delaware but there is competition Texas wants to be at the front of that” And it appears that Texas could end up being more friendly to businesses and CEOs rather than shareholders “Texas has modern business statutes in terms of the legal requirements for corporations The fiduciary duties for officers and directors those are substantially similar to Delaware’s” Foster said “In both states you owe the same duties But in Texas the duties are owed to the corporation only so that’s one difference as opposed to fiduciary duties that may run to minority shareholders or implied duties Whereas Texas has more straightforward duties that are owed directly to the corporation” Also read: Can Elon Musk do ‘whatever he wants’? Why moving Tesla out of Delaware may spook investors Elson said that shareholders should really look at Musk’s motivation for wanting to move the company before they vote on a possible reincorporation if a vote does come up “A pro-shareholder decision in Delaware is a good reason to move to another jurisdiction?” he asked One key element of Delaware Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick’s ruling was her finding that Musk controlled Tesla’s board at least in the instance of creating his massive compensation package — the largest ever in corporate America — and that the process itself was flawed The ruling has also brought up a huge debate around the concept of “pay for performance” with many agreeing that Musk deserved to be rewarded for having met such oversized seemingly unreachable goals at Tesla “This was a gigantic number but when I first looked at it the targets were just astronomical I don’t know of any company that has hit such targets” said David Larcker professor of accounting emeritus at Stanford Graduate Business School and senior faculty at the Rock Center of Corporate Governance “So at some point as a shareholder would you be willing to give up some ownership or experience some dilution for the chance of an astronomical payoff?” As McCormick noted in her opinion “each market-capitalization milestone increase of $50 billion required Tesla to grow in size roughly equal to the market capitalizations of each of Tesla Ford and GM as of early 2018” But she did not agree with the price With Musk “self-driving the process” the process arrived at an unfair price she wrote Putting aide the debate on whether Musk was paid too much the more important aspect is the state of Tesla’s board then and now The board at the time of Musk’s comp package was — and still is today even with some changes — viewed as rubber-stamping all of Musk’s demands They do not appear to provide any checks and balances that are required of a board of directors whose fiduciary duty in Delaware includes acting in good faith to do what each director believes is “in the best interests of the corporation and its stockholders collectively” As Elson notes the “raison d’etre of the Delaware Chancery Court is to protect shareholder capital” And if Tesla directors are too beholden or loyal to Musk can they really be the best checks and balances of the CEO in charge of that shareholder capital? If Musk is able to persuade enough Tesla shareholders to move to reincorporate in Texas it’s not clear what kind of protection or rights shareholders will have going forward The Texas business courts won’t be up and running until September so there is no case law to determine what kind of rulings could come out of them But it seems quite feasible that Musk as an important and possibly the loudest employer in Texas will have a big voice in a big state — and that voice right now seems focused on looking after No 1 Affiliate of Saudi sovereign wealth fund will buy $1 billion of a new series of convertible preferred stock via private placement Therese Poletti writes the Tech Tales column for MarketWatch Follow her on Twitter @tpoletti Therese Poletti writes the Tech Tales column for MarketWatch Follow her on Twitter @tpoletti Visit a quote page and your recently viewed tickers will be displayed here"

Canaccord Genuity Managing Director George Gianarikas joins Yahoo Finance Live to weigh in on what investors should consider ahead of Tesla’s earnings report “Last year Tesla had an issue with margins Gianarikas states citing price cuts as a core factor Gianarikas insists “it’s a really really important [earnings] call for determining Teslas future earnings as far out as 2025 and 2026 For more expert insight and the latest market action click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live Editors note: This article was written by Eyek Ntekim SEANA SMITH: Thanks so much for joining us So George lets talk a little bit about what we could likely hear from Tesla lots of focus on EV demand the fact that that is slowing Are some of those fears a bit overblown? GEORGE GIANARIKAS: It could be So first thanks for having me on Look last year Tesla as you alluded to in your previous segment had an issue with margins and thats because they cut prices several times throughout the year actually starting in late 22 to combat what we think was just an impact on demand from an increase in interest rates So they cut prices basically to keep that monthly payment the same because most people who buy cars have a monthly payment and dont pay cash up front So what we saw for Tesla was an impact to margins Gross margins which they promised were probably going to have a line in the sand in the first quarter of 23 kept going down throughout the year So when we look at what the company will talk about for 2024 its a really really important call because for us it means two things First whats Teslas path to earnings in 24 25 and 26? And next year or this year I should say well probably see a slight increase in earnings depending on what they say about margins and units And the second thing is to combat this narrative thats been really accelerating over the last several months that EV demand is terrible People dont want EVs anymore We think its a symptom of a few things most likely that dont have anything to do necessarily with the EVs EVs just happen to be higher in price And so when interest rates go up and they impact the price of that monthly payment youre probably going to see an impact to the higher-priced vehicles which in general are EVs And by the way a lot of the EV offerings in the market today stink Theyre not as good as Teslas or Rivians for example They dont hold water to what those two companies are bringing to the market Related Quotes"

He is referencing Tesla’s AI-powered automatic wipers which had inconsistent performance Like most premium vehicles today Tesla has an automatic wiper system that automatically matches the speed of the wipers to the intensity of the rain or snow However unlike most other automakers Tesla doesn’t use a rain sensor for its system Instead the automaker is using its Autopilot cameras to feed its computer vision neural net to determine the speed for the wipers It has been deployed in Tesla vehicles since 2018 but many owners have been complaining that it is not as accurate as other systems using rain sensors Tesla’s auto wipers often start when there’s no precipitation or their speed don’t match the actual intensity of the precipitation Over the last few years CEO Elon Musk has been talking about Tesla improving on the system with the release a new “Deep Rain” neural net I wonder how many man hours have been spent trying to fix a problem Tesla created by eliminating a cheap IR rain sensor Tesla could easily add one but it refuses sort of like adding a camera to the nose of the 3/S/X/Y or radar for cross traffic detection I strongly suspect if Elon was removed from Tesla tomorrow within 9 months we would see Tesla add a few things to its vehicles that they currently lack that make them inferior to the rest of the automotive industry It’s even more annoying now that Tesla forces you to use the wipers in Auto or turn them on manually if you want to use cruise control or any other AP/FSD features I hope one day Tesla adds back parking sensors too as they actually worked reliably while the camera based distance estimates are horrendously inaccurate I know he is just joking but he has a point Tesla’s auto wipers have been subpar compared to systems using rain sensors at best – and completely useless at worst Personally I have to shut the auto wipers off every other time especially in the winter because they either don’t activate fast enough when the precipitation starts or they go crazy when they don’t have to If those are powered by neural nets it’s hard to understand how Tesla can solve this AI problem but we should believe that it will solve the much bigger software problem of self-driving? Again I know Zaman is joking here but it’s still interesting that an AI expert in the know (he was at Tesla as recently as last year) is pointing it out Even if it’s just to troll FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links More Subscribe to Electrek on YouTube for exclusive videos and subscribe to the podcast Tesla is a transportation and energy company It… Fred is the Editor in Chief and Main Writer at Electrek You can send tips on Twitter (DMs open) or via email: fred@9to5maccom Through Zalkoncom you can check out Fred’s portfolio and get monthly green stock investment ideas Get interesting investment ideas by Fred Lambert ChargePoint Home WiFi Enabled Electric Vehicle (EV) Charger"

(Upgrade)","1/26/2024","https://seekingalpha.com/article/4665267-tesla-may-decline-further-but-thereby-create-a-long-term-opportunity-upgrade","Xiaolu Chu Xiaolu Chu After years of being a permabear on Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) and repeatedly saying its not a technology company I have finally seen the forest for the trees My most popular article on Seeking Alpha (can be read here) was written on May 6th 2022 and I discussed why I felt TSLA was overvalued by 8526% Many investors called me crazy while others sent me private messages asking to have a public debate on the topic At that time shares of TSLA traded at $29567 and fell to roughly $11271 by the end of 2022 which was a decline of -6188% Since then TSLA has been growing on me and my outlook has gone from bearish to neutral This is the first time I truly see TSLA as more than an automotive company and I am seeing the forest for the trees The day after Q4 earnings was difficult for TSLA bulls as shares finished down -1213% after an earnings call that many investors werent thrilled about including Dan Ives who considered it a trainwreck I cant time bottoms and shares of TSLA could certainly decline further but I am seeing a long-term opportunity Several weeks ago I started utilizing capital generated from writing covered calls on other positions to purchase shares of TSLA and I am now buying with fresh capital Technically I was always a shareholder because my wife owns TSLA but now its official and this isnt a trade for me I will follow TSLA as low as it goes to build out a position because for the first time I think TSLA has the potential to become the largest company in the S&P 500 (SP500) by 2030 Please keep in mind that I do think TSLA will decline further and no matter how low TSLA goes it wont impact me so dont purchase TSLA just because I am starting to build a position Seeking Alpha Seeking Alpha I started out being very bearish on TSLA because of the valuation and the fact that 100% of their gross profit was being generated from the automobile business I didnt feel that it was fair for TSLA to have a larger valuation than tech companies such as Meta Platforms (META) producing tens of billions in additional profits As shares declined I became neutral on TSLA as the valuation became more reasonable and the other lines of business started contributing to the bottom line I discussed in my most recent article (can be read here) While I am still not sold on some aspects of the bull thesis there are four aspects that have made me turn bullish on TSLA as a long-term position I fully expect shares to continue selling off but I cant predict bottoms so I will be building a position throughout this downturn In this article I will discuss why I am now bullish on TSLA as a long-term opportunity Just to clarify when I say long term I am looking forward to 5-10 years Seeking Alpha Seeking Alpha I want to address the risks first as there are many risks to my investment thesis For my investment thesis to materialize CEO Elon Musk and the team at TSLA need to execute flawlessly Today TSLA is still a car company as the automotive segment accounted for 8517% of TSLAs 2023 revenue and 9077% of TSLAs 2023 gross profit TSLAs margins have been under pressure due to several price reductions throughout 2023 which caused the automotive segment to operate at an 1885% gross profit margin in Q4 compared to 2592% in Q1 2023 If TSLA continues to squeeze margins to play the volume game they risk generating less profitability when they are still expanding their manufacturing footprint On the earnings call Mr Taneja stated that TSLAs volume growth will be lower in 2024 if margins are squeezed further with less forward vehicle sale growth; this could cause TSLA to miss EPS estimates Tesla Tesla The next risk is breaking into the sub $25000 market with TSLAs next-generation vehicle TSLA still sells premium vehicles and while prices have declined and less expensive models have been introduced they are still expensive for the average household If TSLA has issues bringing a sub $25000 vehicle to market they will be missing out on a tremendous segment of the auto industry which could impact their future growth TSLA is also a victim of macroeconomic factors that are outside of their control Elon said it on the conference call himself indicating that if rates dont decline quickly in 2024 it could impact not just margins but the ability of Americans to purchase TSLA vehicles There is demand for the products but if the payment doesnt fit into the monthly budget it is a deterrent because the ability to afford a TSLA isnt there Rates play a substantial role in the monthly payment and if rates stay higher for longer it could impact TSLAs top and bottom-line growth prospects I know TSLA bulls dont want to hear this but not every person wants to drive an EV and not every person wants to drive a TSLA I am a perfect example as my wife and I purchased a new vehicle in the spring of 2023 and it wasnt an EV or a TSLA For better or worse CEO Musk is a polarizing figure and some of his comments on X could cause people to purchase a competitors vehicle out of spite The other risks are that much of the future bull case especially the points presented in Ark Invests research may not soon materialize Full Self-Driving (FSD) may not be monetizable in 2024 and even if a full working version is ready to be deployed you will need government regulation to be passed to utilize it fully In my opinion until it becomes legalized its not ready for mass-market consumers I think something many bulls forget is that even if FSD is optimized it could be years until you can actually turn it on and take a nap The Robotaxi premise is also further away than many expect in my opinion The first hurdle is regulations being passed for FSD; then the 2nd hurdle is people actually opting in Dont forget federal legislation is just one aspect as individual states could pass specific laws that prohibit FSD in certain jurisdictions The final risk to my investment thesis is the valuation From a numbers perspective TSLA is expensive compared to the rest of the Magnificent Seven TSLA generates the least cash from operations out of the Magnificent Seven and the least free cash flow (FCF) TSLA also trades at the largest price to FCF valuation and the gap could expand after the rest of the group reports earnings over the next two weeks From a valuation perspective TSLA has a lot of risk Steven Fiorillo Seeking Alpha Steven Fiorillo Seeking Alpha I know that so far I still sound like a permabear but quite frankly the risks are real I know that I cant time the bottom and I know that there are many risks that could cause shares of TSLA to decline further before shareholders see better days I prefer to go into every investment with my eyes wide open and right now the opportunity cost outweighs the investment thesis risks for me I wont lose sleep if my investment declines in value because I want to buy additional shares at lower prices The three largest companies in the S&P are Apple (AAPL) Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL) For TSLA to overtake GOOGL as the third largest company its market cap would need to increase by $134 billion or by 23384% GOOGL has generated $29713 billion in revenue $16676 billion in gross profit and $6673 billion in net income over the trailing twelve months (TTM) compared to TSLA generating $9677 billion in revenue $1766 billion in gross profit and $15 billion in net income for their 2023 fiscal year In my opinion TSLA would need to generate around GOOGLs current levels of profitability to be valued in the $2 trillion neighborhood I think TSLA can get there and surpass these numbers but its not going to be overnight and it could take 5-10 years to accomplish this My bull case revolves around four aspects Optimus Bot FSD Ride hailing and the sub $25000 vehicle Starting with Optimus there are roughly 142 million homes in the United States 8437 million white-collar jobs and 636 million blue-collar jobs I agree with Elon that the Bot could be the biggest product and larger than the car business at TSLA Over the next decade I believe that the Bot will be able to replace a significant number of blue- and white-collar jobs and it will be a race to purchase them Ill use FedEx (FDX) and United Parcel Service (UPS) as examples By implementing the Bot for loading and unloading trucks and trailers at the warehouse they can mitigate workmans comp claims which could correlate to lowered insurance premiums in the future They would also need less staff and lower their payroll expenses Depending on how long Optimus can run it could replace 2 shifts per day maybe more depending on charging or how it replenishes energy Now extrapolate this to Amazon (AMZN) Walmart (WMT) Target (TGT) and every other company Outside of manual labor tasks artificial intelligence could get to a place where it replaces white-collar jobs over the next decade When you combine AI with the Bot the Bot could potentially work a back-office service position for 16+ hours per day Outside of work there is a commercial use in the household Humans love efficiency and reducing the amount of time spent on remedial tasks I believe that if the Bot can do laundry clean the kitchen and bathroom and cut the lawn it will see mass adoption It wont occur tomorrow but for $350 per month I could see penetration into the household market occurring I dont believe that the Bot will be a one-time purchase and there will be a monthly recurring charge when the Bot is hooked into the TSLA network and it is constantly updating and learning from each task that every other Bot is performing If the Bot is $22000 and the learning plan is $3999 per month at a 10% penetration rate across white-collar jobs blue-collar jobs and households the Bot would generate $63875 billion in sales and $116 billion in monthly reoccurring revenue Eventually I could see a 10% penetration occurring and maybe a higher percentage If TSLA can get a 17% penetration they will generate over $1 trillion in Bot sales and $197 billion in monthly reoccurring revenue at $3999 per month If they achieve between 10-17% penetration across these markets they could generate between $1393 billion and $2369 billion in annual revenue from a learning plan Keep in mind that this is just looking at the US and that this can be extrapolated with as the Bot is introduced to other markets such as Mexico China and India The possibilities are limitless and I do think that the Bot business will be bigger than the automobile business in the future Steven Fiorillo Steven Fiorillo The next business segments I am bullish on are FSD the $25k car and ride-hailing In 2023 there were roughly 119 million EVs sold in the US I am looking at FSD as a direct-to-consumer play through TSLA direct and a licensing play TSLA can be the brain powering its competitors vehicles making them significantly more valuable Its inevitable that we get to a point where autonomous driving is a reality If TSLA could work out a licensing agreement with Volkswagen (OTCPK:VWAGY) (OTCPK:VLKAF) (OTCPK:VWAPY) Ford (F) and General Motors (GM) it could mean billions or tens of billions in reoccurring revenue on an annual basis TSLA is further ahead of everyone else so it would make sense for these companies to work out a licensing agreement for any EV that wants to opt into the TSLA FSD network I think as FSD matures and actually comes to market we will see more talk about this As far as the Robotaxis I dont agree that the true value will be from individuals opting into a Robotaxi network while they arent using their vehicle I have always said the two things that will get me to purchase a TSLA are when I can either charge it in 2 minutes or take a nap while it drives me around What I will not be doing is allowing anyone else to ride around in my TSLA and I bet there are others who feel the same way I think that the $25k car has two purposes The first is to break into the mass consumer market and break away from being a luxury brand The second is for TSLA to build a full Robotaxi fleet and rival Uber Technologies (UBER) UBER generated $3595 billion in revenue and $1165 billion in gross profit in the TTM I think that TSLA will repurpose some of its engineering team to build a ridesharing network to rival Uber They already have the in-house team to build it with the FSD network so there will not be added expenses The other aspect is that TSLA can set aside a percentage of their produced sub $25k vehicles for this business at cost Seeking Alpha Seeking Alpha Currently there are 31 analysts expecting $475 of EPS in 2025 and 12 analysts expecting $565 of EPS in 2026 TSLA is trading at 4377 times 2025 earnings and 3681 times 2026 earnings There are 3 analysts calling for 1041 of EPS in 2030 which places TSLA at 1997 times 2030 earnings In the next 7 years there could be so many advances from FSD to the Bot that $1041 of EPS may be drastically low There are also other catalysts including the charging network and energy business but to be honest I am less convinced that these will be as big as the other areas I outlined This is the first time I have truly seen TSLA as more than an automotive company Right now I am not excited about the energy business as it only accounts for 588% of TSLAs 2023 gross profit TSLA has demonstrated that it can scale its manufacturing capacity at an extraordinary pace while substantially increasing its throughput The narrative isnt great in the current environment and shares of TSLA could easily be retraced to the $ 150s or lower I cant predict bottoms so I am building out a position as shares fall This is a stock that I now want to hold for the long term because over the next decade I believe the combination of its automotive business the Bit FSD and a ride-hailing company could make it the most valuable company in the market This article was written by Analyst’s Disclosure: I/we have a beneficial long position in the shares of TSLA AAPL AMZN GOOGL META either

The cost of a Tesla Solar Roof can be prohibitive depending on the size of your roof how much power your home needs and the condition of your current roof Installing a 1257 kW Tesla Solar Roof costs an average of $154000 including roof replacements costs and two Tesla Powerwalls This is the price before incentives Size (in square feet) Number of Floors kW Energy Storage Total Est Cost 1000Single story6311 Powerwall$87635 2000Two-story12572 Powerwalls$154000 3000Three-story18833 Powerwalls$222000 Tesla Solar Roofs include a combination of solar glass tiles and corrosion- and weather-resistant steel tiles The amount of solar versus regular tiles needed for a roof can vary depending on your energy needs roof design and roof size but 35% solar tiles is a good estimate (That’s three or four solar tiles for every six or seven steel tiles) In addition at least one Powerwall is required with a Tesla Solar Roof installation A Tesla Powerwall battery costs a minimum of $11500 for a single unit though the price per unit goes down as you add more to your order In addition to the tiles other roofing materials (vent covers and ridge caps) and Powerwall your Tesla Solar Roof cost will include a Tesla Solar Inverter and the roof installation labor which can vary depending on where you live and whether your current roof needs to be replaced The more energy you need your Tesla Solar Roof to generate the higher your total expense will be Why? A home requiring more energy will require a higher ratio of glass solar tiles to non-solar steel tiles In general the more stories your home has the more difficult installation can be Expect higher labor costs associated with a taller structure In addition taller larger homes typically require more energy so you may need a larger percentage of your roof to consist of the more expensive glass solar tiles and you may need to purchase more Tesla Powerwall batteries The size of your roof directly impacts the cost of converting it to solar As you’d expect larger roofs will have higher material and labor costs (and the cost to remove the existing roof may also cost more) The square footage of your home may also be an indicator of energy usage For larger homes with more occupants you’ll need a higher ratio of solar glass tiles to regular roofing tiles Tesla requires a Tesla Powerwall with every Solar Roof installation The energy capacity of a single Powerwall is 135 kWh Tesla will analyze your home and energy consumption to determine if you’ll likely need additional Powerwalls at an additional cost Several factors can impact how much you spend on a Tesla Solar Roof including: Tesla will complete an on-site assessment before finalizing your quote for a Tesla Solar Roof During this assessment Tesla looks for several “complexity factors” including the mounting planes pitch and obstructions of your roof For instance American Home Contractors one of Tesla’s Certified Installers says that a traditional 6/12 roof pitch would come with typical pricing Steeper roofs—such as those with an 8/12+ pitch or a 16/12+ pitch will be more expensive to install Here’s how roof pitch can impact average costs before incentives: Tesla Solar Roof Installation6/12 pitch (standard)8/12 pitch (steep)16/12 pitch (very steep) 1000 square feet 631 kW 1 Powerwall$87600$88500$89300 2000 square feet 1257 kW 2 Powerwalls$154000$156600$158300 3000 square feet 1883 kW 3 Powerwalls$222000$224800$227300 In general the more complex—and the larger—your roof the more it will cost to install a Tesla Solar Roof Theoretically you might not have to pay to replace your roof before installing a Tesla Solar Roof Tesla says it will install its solar roofs on top of some single-layer roofs In most cases however you’ll need to have your roof removed In all our Tesla Solar Roof cost calculations in this guide we’ve assumed the existing roof is being removed so this cost is already built into our estimates On average replacing a roof costs $11500 The removal itself is generally $1 to $5 per square foot You’ll need to get a permit when installing a Tesla Solar Roof The cost of a building permit varies by municipality so check with your local codes to see what permits are required and how much they’ll cost Note: Tesla handles the permitting process for you Right now the federal government is offering a 30% solar investment tax credit This non-refundable tax credit applies to the installation of a Tesla Solar Roof If you spend $154000 on a new solar roof in 2023 you would qualify for a $46200 tax credit when filing your return in 2024 You may qualify for additional rebates tax credits and incentives through your state city or utility district Check out our guide to solar tax credits by state to determine how much you can save Note: The federal tax credit is non-refundable If the credit is larger than your overall tax liability you will not receive additional cash For instance the latest data from the IRS (2020) shows that the average federal income tax liability was $16615 meaning that the credit would not exceed that amount for the hypothetical household However households installing a Tesla Solar Roof are likely to make more than the average taxpayer—and be taxed at a higher rate due to America’s progressive tax system Depending on the current infrastructure of your home you may need to invest in additional electrical upgrades during installation You can ask about such upgrades during the on-site assessment and determine whether you should hire a local electrician to handle the work The cost of a Tesla Solar Roof can be quite prohibitive for the average homeowner Much like when you purchase a Tesla EV you have the option of applying for financing directly through Tesla Applying for financing requires a credit check like any traditional loan and it’s only available to homeowners in the following states: Alternatively you can seek solar financing as you would for any other home renovation project like through a large personal loan a home equity loan or a home equity line of credit (HELOC) Advertisement THIS IS AN ADVERTISEMENT AND NOT EDITORIAL CONTENT Please note that we do receive compensation for any

information and savings numbers depicted above are for demonstration purposes only and your results may vary Seeking To Go Green? Consider Equipping Your Home With Solar Panels The Tesla Solar Roof installation process is straightforward though it can take some time at each step Tesla details the following steps on its website: On average the whole process ranges from six to eight months The cost of a Tesla Solar Roof is a tremendous out-of-pocket expense but theoretically you’ll save money down the line because of reduced utility costs So what are the benefits long-term and are there still costs to consider? The top benefit of installing any type of solar power is your reduced reliance on electricity produced through coal and natural gas As we continue to experience climate change it will take moves like this—from individual consumers governments and corporations—to reduce humankind’s impact on the environment Another benefit: The Tesla Solar Roof gives you energy independence With the Tesla Powerwall battery that stores excess energy you can effectively go off the grid—and maintain power even when everyone else in your area is experiencing an outage (Power outages are expected to be more common as climate change produces more significant weather events) Financially speaking the Tesla Solar Roof provides a few benefits Like solar panels they do reduce your utility bills and you may also earn money toward bills through net metering in which you sell excess energy back to the grid In some states you may also be eligible for solar renewable energy credits (SRECs) Finally solar panels can increase your home’s value by more than 4% according to a recent Zillow study Though there’s no data to support it a Tesla Solar Roof may offer even more perceived value to prospective home buyers since they are visually more appealing Given the high upfront cost of a Tesla Solar Roof it’s likely that many homeowners will choose to finance their installation This could mean ongoing monthly payments for decades In addition Tesla recommends routinely hiring a local professional roof cleaner to maintain your Tesla Solar Roof On average professional roof cleaning costs $765 Advertisement THIS IS AN ADVERTISEMENT AND NOT EDITORIAL CONTENT Please note that we do receive compensation for any products you buy or sign up to via this advertisement and that compensation impacts the ranking and placement of any offers listed herein We do not present information about every offer available The information and savings numbers depicted above are for demonstration purposes only and your results may vary Compare Quotes From Top-rated Solar Panel Installers Free No-commitment Estimates Find a Solar Panel Installer Compare Quotes From Top-rated Solar Panel Installers Free No-commitment Estimates Tesla’s Solar Roof is known for its durability and longevity with a comprehensive 25-year module product and weatherization warranty Tesla has made significant progress in renewable energy with its Solar Roof and solar panel options These choices provide homeowners with access to solar power but they have differences in design installation and usage The Tesla Solar Roof combines solar power and roofing material with the more traditional and efficient Tesla solar panels The Solar Roof by Tesla is built to mimic the appearance of conventional roofing materials like slate or asphalt shingles but with solar cells seamlessly integrated into the tiles These solar cells are discreetly embedded within the roofing tiles making them less noticeable than standard solar panels Tesla also guarantees that the solar roof is resilient and can endure severe weather conditions like high winds rain and hail In addition Tesla offers a range of styles and colors to cater to different styles allowing homeowners to customize their roofs according to their preferences Unlike the Solar Roof’s integrated design Tesla solar panels are more noticeable since they are mounted on top of the existing roof featuring a sleek and low-profile design They are generally considered a cost-effective choice with pricing varying depending on factors like the system’s size and the installation’s complexity These panels are engineered to efficiently convert sunlight into electricity allowing customers to select the system size based on their energy requirements Alongside solar panels Tesla often offers Powerwall a home battery storage solution that enables homeowners to store surplus energy for later use or during power outages Tesla Solar Panels are considerably more affordable than a Tesla Solar Roof Outfitting a home with 816 kW Tesla Solar Panels costs $26900 before incentives on average A home with a 631 kW Tesla Solar Roof costs $87600 on average That’s 325 times as expensive Why do Tesla Solar Roofs cost so much more? The technology is less widely adopted the installation is more involved (it’s a full roof replacement) and you must purchase at least one Tesla Powerwall The tradeoff: Tesla Solar Roofs are much sleeker To the untrained eye it just looks like a typical high-quality roof Note: While you can save money with Tesla Solar Panels you can save even more money by considering other companies entirely Some of the best solar companies include options priced well below Tesla Solar Panels Advertisement THIS IS AN ADVERTISEMENT AND NOT EDITORIAL CONTENT Please note that we do receive compensation for any products you buy or sign up to via this advertisement and that compensation impacts the ranking and placement of any offers listed herein We do not present information about every offer available The information and savings numbers depicted above are for demonstration purposes only and your results may vary Compare Quotes From Top-rated Solar Panel Installers Select a State To Get Started With Your No Commitment Free Estimate Find a Solar Panel Installer Compare Quotes From Top-rated Solar Panel Installers Select a State To Get Started With Your No Commitment Free Estimate Tesla also offers a warranty for solar roof tiles that extends up to 25 years aligning with warranties for power generation and weatherproofing so you can expect your solar roof to last around that long To help keep your solar roof working as long as possible be sure to keep up with maintenance and address any issues ASAP Going solar is certainly worth it It’s great for the environment increases the value of your home reduces your utility bills and minimizes your reliance on the grid But is the Tesla Solar Roof worth it? That depends on your preferences Most people would probably prefer to save a significant chunk of change by installing solar panels instead but if you like the sleek unassuming look afforded by the Tesla Solar Roof (and were planning to replace your entire roof soon anyway) it could be worth the investment Another pro of the Tesla Solar Roof: Because each glass solar tile is 72 W it’s much more customizable to your home’s specific energy needs Best Solar Companies By StateAlabamaAlaskaArizonaArkansasCaliforniaColoradoConnecticutDelawareFloridaGeorgiaHawaiiIdahoIllinoisIndianaIowaKansasKentuckyLouisianaMaineMarylandMassachusettsMichiganMissouriMontanaNebraskaNevadaNew HampshireNew JerseyNew MexicoNew YorkNorth CarolinaNorth DakotaOhioOregonPennsylvaniaRhode IslandSouth CarolinaSouth DakotaTennesseeTexasUtahVermontVirginiaWashingtonWest VirginiaWisconsinWyoming Best Solar Companies By State You cannot install your own Tesla Solar Roof When you purchase a Tesla Solar Roof through Tesla a Tesla crew will handle the install; it’s included in the price If you live in an area where Tesla does not directly provide the service Tesla will connect you with a Tesla Certified Installer which purchases your roof and installs it for you In general solar panel systems increase the value of your home by just over 4% While there’s no specific data about the Tesla Solar Roof it’s likely that it would also boost your home’s value—maybe by even more since the system is sleeker and less noticeable atop your home The actual installation of a Tesla Solar Roof takes five to seven business days on average but the full process—which includes a site visit permit process utility sign-off and a PTO (permission to operate from your electric utility)—can take six to eight months The Tesla Solar Roof has a 10% to 20% efficiency rating give or take That means that 10% to 20% of sunlight that hits the solar panel gets converted into electricity A Tesla Solar Roof’s solar glass tile has a maximum output of 72 watts How much electricity your Tesla Solar Roof generates depends on the number of solar tiles on your roof But because the power output of each panel is so small it’s much easier to customize a Tesla Solar Roof to your exact needs compared to Tesla Solar Panels where each new panel adds more than 400 W Tesla offers a “Go Off-Grid” option within the mobile app that allows you to disconnect your Powerwall from the grid This allows you to simulate your system’s energy independence during power outages Timothy has written about personal finance including detailed home renovation and repair cost guides since 2017 His work covers everything from plumbing and roofing to solar and pest control Find his work on sites like Angi USA Today and The Penny Hoarder In addition to being a contributing editor for Forbes Corinne is a dynamic digital professional specializing in copywriting copy editing and content strategy With over eight years of experience at Bed Bath and Beyond she has gained invaluable knowledge and expertise on everything related to the home In her current role as SEO Editor Corinne oversees the SEO content strategy for sites such as Bed Bath and Beyond Bed Bath and Beyond Canada buybuy BABY and Harmon Face Values"

One of the hallmarks of the race to develop autonomous vehicles has been wildly optimistic predictions about when they’ll be ready for daily use The landscape is positively littered with missed deadlines In 2015 Baidu senior VP Wang Jing said the tech company would be selling self-driving cars to Chinese customers by 2020 In 2016 then-Lyft president John Zimmer claimed that “a majority” of the trips taking place on its ride-sharing network would be in fully driverless cars “within five years” That same year Business Insider said that 10 million autonomous vehicles would be on the road by 2020 GM said it would mass produce driverless cars without steering wheels or pedals by 2019 Ford slightly more conservative predicted it would do the same in 2021 And in a perfect encapsulation of mid-2010s autonomy hype Intel in 2017 predicted a $7 trillion industry — more than double what the global auto industry does now — around autonomy by 2050 Of course no one has been more bullish than Tesla CEO Elon Musk who has turned making wrong predictions about the readiness of autonomous vehicles into an art form Of course no one has been more bullish than Tesla CEO Elon Musk who has turned making wrong predictions about the readiness of autonomous vehicles into an art form “By the middle of next year we’ll have over a million Tesla cars on the road with full self-driving hardware” Musk said in 2019 Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) feature would be so reliable the driver could “go to sleep” Teslas with the company’s FSD software are not autonomous and drivers would be well advised to not sleep in their cars Sure there are some self-driving cars on the roads today They’re in San Francisco Phoenix Los Angeles Hamburg and Beijing among other cities They’re operated by some of the biggest most well-capitalized companies in the world You can even ride in some of them But they’re stuck Not stuck in the sense that a Tesla Cybertruck gets stuck in less than an inch of snow But confined within geofenced service areas held back by their own technological shortcomings opposed by labor unions and supporters of more reliable modes of transportation and restricted from driving on certain roads or in certain weather conditions “The autonomous vehicle industry — particularly the companies developing and testing robotaxis — has gotten away for too long with selling a vision of the future that they should know perfectly well is never going to come to pass” Sam Anthony co-founder and CTO of Perceptive Automata a now-defunct AV company wrote in his newsletter in 2022 We assumed the robots would be able to drive as freely as we do After all we built a world in which we humans can — and do — drive anywhere all the time So why did we get it so wrong? Before we examine why the industry collectively whiffed the rollout of driverless cars it’s instructive to look at why these predictions were made in the first place Why set these goal posts if they never really mattered? Of course the answer is money By promising that driverless cars were “just around the corner” and on the cusp of taking over our roads companies were able to rack in hundreds of billions of dollars to fund their experiments The amount of money flowing into the autonomous vehicle space also had the knock-on effect of convincing regulators to take a lax approach when it comes to self-driving cars AV boosters warned that too many rules would “stifle innovation” and jeopardize future gains whether that was safety or job creation And it turns out that regulators were very receptive to those arguments The federal government — whether under Obama Trump or Biden — has done very little to stand in the way of companies testing their tech on public roads A bill in Congress that would accelerate the rollout of cars with steering wheels and pedals has stalled over disagreements about liability but you wouldn’t know it looking at these fundraising hauls Some states like California have done their best to spin up some sort of regulatory playbook But most were eager to attract companies under the belief that driverless cars were the future And who wants to stand in the way of the future? For nearly a decade AV operators were able to raise money almost without restriction For nearly a decade AV operators were able to raise money almost without restriction They did it through normal fundraising channels or by tying themselves to big tech and car companies Cruise Automation was acquired by General Motors Ford invested $1 billion in Argo AI Google always slightly ahead of the rest spun out its self-driving car project as Waymo Amazon bought Zoox Hyundai allied itself with Motional Some have estimated over $160 billion has flowed into the industry over the past dozen or so years And after the pandemic the companies that weren’t able to cozy up to big automakers or tech giants found a new way to quickly raise cash: SPACs Traditional IPOs were slow and special acquisition companies were quick so dozens of mobility-focused startups went public by merging with these so-called “blank check” companies in order to access more money faster And despite a number of setbacks like crashes and lawsuits and investigations the cash kept coming in It wasn’t until 2021 when the industry pulled in $125 billion led by GM’s Cruise raising a massive $275 billion that funding for AV companies peaked The predictions about the imminent arrival of safe reliable self-driving technology helped speed the flow of money And once those predictions failed to materialize the money started to dry up Why did the predictions fail? The technology while incredibly effective at getting us most of the way there stumbled as it got closer to the finish line In the AV world this is called the “long tail of 9s” It’s the idea that you can get a vehicle that is 999 percent as good as a human driver but you never actually get to 100 percent And that’s because of edge cases these unpredictable events that flummox even human drivers When training an AI program on driving you can predict a lot of what to expect but you can’t predict everything And when those edge cases eventually emerge the car can make mistakes — sometimes with tragic consequences When training an AI program on driving you can predict a lot of what to expect but you can’t predict everything Take the example of Cruise In October of last year a woman was hit by a human driver while crossing the street in San Francisco The impact sent her flying into the path of a driverless Cruise vehicle which immediately braked after also striking her The Cruise vehicle then attempted to pull over to the side of the road not realizing the woman was still trapped beneath the vehicle injuring her further in the process One of the first things Cruise did in the wake of the incident was to recall all 950 vehicles it had on the road in the US This took the form of an over-the-air software update to the collision detection subsystem so the vehicle remains stationary during certain crash incidents rather than pulling over to the side of the road Cruise encountered an edge case and it quickly issued a correction for it But how many more edge cases are lurking in the shadows? And how many more people will be injured — or even killed — before these cars are seen as more reliable? Waymo has been on the forefront of trying to convince the public and regulators that its vehicles are as safe if not safer than humans It’s released a number of studies and statistical analyses in recent years that it says proves its vehicles get in fewer crashes cause less damage and improve overall safety on the roads But for every Waymo there’s an Elon Musk whose misleading predictions about the imminent readiness of self-driving cars muddy the waters for everyone else who knows that the reality is much further away than previously thought Waymo also assumes legal liability for crashes involving its vehicles — something Tesla has so far refused to do But Waymo isn’t driving the public’s perception of self-driving cars; Tesla is Broken promises and failed predictions are what’s fueling the growing skepticism about self-driving cars in the public which as the years plod by gets more and more turned off by the idea of relinquishing control of their vehicles to a robot Without passengers there’s no business But without safe reliable technology there’s no future for autonomous vehicles / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products weve tested sent to your inbox daily The Verge is a vox media network © 2024 Vox Media LLC All Rights Reserved"

Try These Three Bearish Option Trades","2/14/2024","https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/stocks/TSLA-Q/pressreleases/24066717/market-crash-got-you-down-try-these-three-bearish-option-trades/","With the market taking a turn for the worse yesterday we’re going to look at how to find bearish options trade ideas using the Bear Put Spread Screener A bear put spread is a vertical spread that aims to profit from a stock declining in price It has a bearish directional bias as hinted in the name Unlike the bear call spread it suffers from time decay so traders need to be correct on the direction of the underlying and also the timing A bear put spread is created through buying an out-of-the-money put and selling a further out-of-the-money put The maximum profit is equal to the distance between the strikes less the premium paid The loss is limited to the premium paid Let’s take a look at Barchart’s Bear Put Spread Screener for today: Let’s strengthen the screener by filtering for stocks with a Sell rating Some interesting trades here with impressive Max Profit Percentage Let’s take a look at the first item in the table – a bear put spread on Tesla (TSLA) TSLA Bear Put Spread Example Using the April 19 expiry this trade involves buying the $185 put and selling the $140 put The price for the trade is $1243 which means the trader would pay $1243 to enter the trade This is also the maximum loss The maximum gain be calculated by taking the width between the strikes and subtracting the premium paid: 35 – 1243 x 100 = $3257 The breakeven price for the trade is equal to the long put strike less the premium In this case that gives us a breakeven price of $17257 Let’s look at the second example using Boeing (BA) The Barchart Technical Opinion rating is a 100% Sell and ranks in the Top 1% of all short term signal directions Long term indicators fully support a continuation of the trend Boeing Bear Put Spread Example The BA example is also using the April 19 expiry and involves buying the $205 strike put and selling the $180 strike put The cost of the trade is $737 which is also the maximum loss with the maximum possible gain being $1763 The maximum gain would occur if BA stock fell below $180 on the expiration date The breakeven price is $19763 The Barchart Technical Opinion rating is a 56% Sell with a Strengthening short term outlook on maintaining the current direction Long term indicators fully support a continuation of the trend Let’s look at another example this time on Morgan Stanley (MS) Morgan Stanley Bear Put Spread Example The MS example from the screener is using the April 19 expiry and involves buying the $85 strike put and selling the $75 strike put The cost of the trade is $301 which is also the maximum loss with the maximum possible gain being $699 The maximum gain would occur if MS stock fell below $75 on the expiration date The Barchart Technical Opinion rating is an 8% Sell with a Weakening short term outlook on maintaining the current direction Mitigating Risk Thankfully bear put spreads are risk defined trades so they have some build in risk management The maximum loss is always limited to the premium paid so we always know the worst-case scenario For each trade consider setting a stop loss of 30% of the max loss Please remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment This article is for education purposes only and not a trade recommendation Remember to always do your own due diligence and consult your financial advisor before making any investment decisions Provided Content: Content provided by Barchart The Globe and Mail was not involved and material was not reviewed prior to publication How much is Tesla Inc stock worth?

That’s the difference IMO employees should get a discount or atleast on options” So what are your thoughts?

Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: There was a time when an electric Tesla pickup something designed to go head-to-head against America’s most popular products the Ford F-150 and Chevrolet Silverado seemed just the thing to take Tesla truly mainstream Then in 2019 Elon Musk unveiled the Tesla Cybertruck a bare metal box on wheels It’s the furthest thing from mainstream This truck has attracted ardent fans and even more ardent critics But it has good towing and hauling capabilities even though it sacrifices some usability to its literally edgy design For some customers the sacrifice is undoubtably worth it But it may be more of a question about whether Ford and GM really need to worry If it’s a contest for eyeballs they do Even when I parked a rented Tesla Cybertruck next to a hot-pink McLaren supercar in a shopping center parking lot in California the people in the McLaren couldn’t stop talking about the Cybertruck Everywhere I went the huge shiny silver truck was a crowd magnet drawing young people who’d been waiting to see one in real life and others usually older who had no idea what this thing even was The Tesla Cybertruck looks like nothing else on the road And its size – it’s not quite as long as a Ford F-150 but somehow looks even bigger – is even more eye-catching Of course once the Cybertruck has been on the market a while its draw will subside There’s a lot to like about the Cybertruck but it also embodies a disturbing level of individual arrogance in hard unforgiving steel Concerns for the safety of others on the road and even the practical needs of its own users appear to have been placed second to a design and engineering directive spearheaded by Tesla chief executive Elon Musk As Walter Isaacson’s recent biography of Musk makes clear it was Musk’s fixation on this structure created from the same steel SpaceX uses for rockets that resulted in the rectilinear mass of naked metal that I was driving through the southern California hills It was the most enjoyable electric truck I’ve driven yet I’ve driven nearly all the other electric trucks currently on the market such as Ford’s and Rivian’s and I don’t expect any will surpass the Cybertruck in its sports-car like performance Ordinarily not a priority in a pickup It’s got powerful acceleration and steering that feels quick responsive and nimble With its punchy acceleration quick steering and custom-designed Goodyear truck tires it reminded me a bit of driving the Lamborghini Huracán Sterrato a high-performance sports car fitted with off-road tires and raised suspension But the Cybertruck is of course bigger and more than twice as heavy Even a mildly firm press on the accelerator left everyone else quickly behind With its drive-by-wire steering system a slight turn of its small rectangular steering wheel yielded tight turns at lower speeds but at higher speeds it wasn’t hard to keep the truck in its lane Four-wheel steering allows it to turn around in a smaller area than one might expect Tesla did not provide CNN with a Cybertruck to test Instead we rented one for over $1000 for the day through Turo the peer-to-peer vehicle rental service (Turo doesn’t set the rates vehicle owners do and Cybertruck rates have come down somewhat since then) My Turo host walked me through the Cybertruck’s various very weird – by non-Tesla standards – controls The turn signals are controlled using steering wheel buttons rather than a stalk (Again this is similar to a Lamborghini or Ferrari) To put the truck in drive or reverse I swiped up and down on a truck icon on the center screen (In case the screen ever goes blank there is a row of gear selector buttons on the ceiling just above the windshield) And I had to dig a bit on the touchscreen to find the control for the Cybertruck’s one gigantic windshield wiper Once I’d driven the truck an hour or so though everything seemed logical It does have a windshield-mounted rear-view mirror but troublingly it’s entirely useless most of the time With the bed cover closed there is nothing to see out the back window Many modern SUVs have rearview mirrors that double as a video screen showing a view from a camera mounted in the back Tesla could have used a similar system but no In the Cybertruck the rear video view is displayed in a small rectangle in the truck’s center screen It’s there all the time while you drive This may seem like a minor﻿ detail but it says a lot about how Tesla thinks about vehicle controls The only reason to have the rearview video display inside the rearview mirror is because that’s where drivers are used to looking Similarly the only reason to have a turn signal stalk is that’s what people are used to For better or worse Tesla does not care what you’re used to There are indications this attitude contributes to higher crash rates but if Tesla were inventing a vehicle from scratch the strange choices would be totally sensible Then there’s the Cybertruck’s crazy shape Other companies have been making pickup trucks for well more than a century and there are reasons they’re not usually shaped like wedges In this case the Cybertruck is hindered by an apparent needless desire to be different In the Cybertruck if you load up the cargo bed then decide you want to reach something in the front something close to the back window you’ll need to start unpacking There’s no reaching over the side of the bed to get at it The side wall is just too high Unlike other large trucks the Cybertruck also gives you nowhere to put your foot to help you reach over the cargo bed’s side other than the back tire which could be slick with mud and dirt There’s not even much room to stand on the back bumper The” frunk” or front trunk is also a fairly useless afterthought compared to the one on in the Ford F-150 Lightning Ford’s is just bigger to start with and it has loads of power outlets making it a genuinely functional workspace The Cybertruck’s is handy as maybe a place to sit There is a fair-sized storage bin though For now at least the Cybertruck isn’t in the same price range as the Lightning either The Foundation Series truck I drove cost over $100000 It will be next year before Tesla has said it will start producing trucks costing around $60000 Most concerning though is the manufacturing quality The interior is fairly nice if spartan but that’s the easy part especially since Tesla does away with most switches The hard part is making a body from stainless steel especially one with mostly straight edges that don’t hide misalignments In most cars and trucks body panel alignments are a purely cosmetic concern It doesn’t look good when there are big uneven gaps between different sections of the body But most vehicles aren’t made from thick hard-edged stainless steel At the front corners of our Cybertruck there were gaps big enough to see daylight through and hard edges stuck out from the body I worried if this truck hit a pedestrian or if someone slipped while climbing over the bed side that the unyielding metal could cause real harm It’s not actually knife-edged of course but hitting soft flesh with enough force it seems like it could rip through skin I emailed Tesla to ask if the automaker had any concerns about this but I haven’t received a response Tesla has not responded to CNN inquiries in years This is not a truck that customers will buy in big numbers and not just because Tesla isn’t making them in big numbers yet It’s fun and it’s interesting but for those who just want to get the job done there’s not much reason to buy this instead of something more normal and functional It doesn’t seem like it will do anything – or at least anything that matters – much better than a Ford F-150 Lightning or a Chevrolet Silverado EV and it will definitely be worse in some important ways If you want to draw a crowd though this is your ride At least while the novelty lasts Most stock

153,"Forget Nvidia: These 3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Have Up to 203% Upside According to Select Wall Street","2/27/2024","https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/stocks/TSLA-Q/pressreleases/24368591/forget-nvidia-these-3-artificial-intelligence-ai-stocks-have-up-to-203-upside-according-to-select-wall-street-analysts/","Over the past three decades theres always been a next-big-thing trend to captivate investors attention For the moment nothing is causing more excitement within the investing community than the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution AI utilizes software and systems to oversee tasks that would normally be handled by humans What makes AI special is the incorporation of machine learning which is what allows software and systems to evolve and become smarter over time With practical application across virtually all sectors and industries artificial intelligence is expected to add more than $15 trillion to global gross domestic product (GDP) by the turn of the decade according to researchers at PwC Image source: Getty Images The astronomical dollar figures attached to AI solutions arent lost on Wall Street or its analysts Most analysts anticipate continued upside in AI stocks over the next year -- and that includes leading megacap stock Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) According to analyst Ananda Baruah of Loop Capital shares of Nvidia can catapult to $1200 which would imply 52% upside from where the stock closed on Feb 23 2024 This would effectively tack on $1 trillion in market cap and potentially make Nvidia the largest publicly traded company in the world Baruahs optimism likely stems from Nvidias dominant position as the infrastructure backbone of the AI movement The companys A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) may account for as much as 90% of the share of GPUs used in high-compute data centers in 2024 With demand clearly outpacing supply and Nvidia enjoying a boatload of near-term pricing power its been able to easily surpass Wall Streets consensus sales and profit forecasts However Nvidia is also set to face numerous headwinds this year As I outlined recently itll be contending with growing external competition from the likes of Advanced Micro Devices and Intel as well as internal competition Nvidias two largest customers Meta Platforms and Microsoft are developing AI-fueled data-center chips of their own Whats more theres the real possibility Nvidia could cannibalize its own gross margin as A100 and H100 GPU production ramps If GPU scarcity wanes the pricing power thats been primarily responsible for powering Nvidias data-center sales higher could shift into reverse Even though Baruah at Loop Capital believes Nvidias stock could deliver a 52% return from where it closed last week three other AI stocks offer higher upside according to select Wall Street analysts Image source: Getty Images The first artificial intelligence stock that at least one Wall Street analyst believes can outpace Nvidia to the upside is China-based Baidu(NASDAQ: BIDU) According to Fawne Jiang at Benchmark Baidu stock can reach $210 per share which would imply upside of 89% relative to where it closed on February 23 Most investors are familiar with Baidu because of its dominant internet search engine in China In January Baidu accounted for 61% of internet search in the worlds No 2 economy by GDP With few exceptions Baidu has been responsible for between 60% and 85% of Chinas internet search share over the past nine years This makes it a logical go-to for advertisers which has helped it maintain strong ad-pricing power However Baidus future is very much dependent on the success of AI The companys AI Cloud and world-leading autonomous ride-hailing service Apollo Go have delivered consistently superior growth rates when compared to the companys foundational internet search segment In particular generative AI solutions offer businesses a means to tailor their ads to the wants and needs of specific users Jiangs price target of $210 isnt outrageous either Given Baidus historic double-digit growth rate its $278 billion in cash cash equivalents and restricted cash (as of Sept 30) and its remarkably low forward-year earnings multiple of just 10 non-online marketing revenue could realistically push Baidus stock to $210 Another AI stock that may have investors completely forgetting about Nvidia is Mobileye Global(NASDAQ: MBLY) a developer of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving solutions Analyst Itay Michaeli of Citigroup believes Mobileye Global stock can more than triple to $72 per share Next-generation vehicles are incorporating technology like never before Mobileyes SuperVision is currently its most-advanced ADAS offering Though it still requires the full attention (and potential intervention) of a driver SuperVision is a hands-off solution that can handle lane changes accelerating and decelerating and provide evasive maneuver assistance and point-to-point automated navigation of an autonomous vehicle As cars become smarter Mobileyes solutions are bound to become more popular Something else working in Mobileyes favor is that the company was profitable on the basis of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) during the fourth quarter Mobileye landed $74 billion in future orders in 2023 and also has $121 billion in cash and cash equivalents at the ready as of Dec 30 2023 Not only should the company have little trouble sustaining a double-digit growth rate during long-winded periods of US economic growth but it has the capital needed to continue innovating While Mobileye Global has developed undeniably exciting technology and majority shareholder Intel would be thrilled to see its share price soar the growing possibility of a recession taking shape in the not-too-distant future makes a $72 price target a tough sell in 2024 The third AI stock that offers even more upside than Nvidia at least based on the prognostication of one Wall Street analyst is electric vehicle (EV) maker Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives recently reiterated his belief that Teslas stock can reach $315 per share which would represent 64% upside from where shares ended on Feb 23 AI solutions are critical to the EVs Tesla sells and leases The companys Autopilot software relies on cameras sensors and other solutions to cull data from the cars surroundings which are needed to make split-second driving decisions Tesla has ridden its first-mover advantages in the EV space to become North Americas leading EV manufacturer The company produced just shy of 185 million EVs in 2023 while delivering its fourth consecutive year of GAAP profits But unlike Baidu which has a very reasonable high-water price target the lofty perch Dan Ives price target sits atop appears unreachable due to mounting headwinds for Tesla The company has slashed prices for Models 3 S X and Y on more than a half-dozen occasions since the start of 2023 These cuts are in response to weakening EV demand fierce competition and rising inventory levels as Teslas production expands Although Tesla is selling more vehicles its operating margin has been more than halved to 82% in a little over a year Teslas ambitions to become more than a car company have fallen flat too Growth in the companys Energy Generation and Storage segment has stalled on a sequential quarterly basis while Services gross margin came in below 3% in Q4 Tesla is almost entirely reliant on selling and leasing EVs to generate a profit This is a problem considering that Tesla trades at north of 60 times consensus earnings in 2024 in an industry known for single-digit

157,"‘At what point do you decide Tesla is bigger than Musk?’ The time may be right for Elon Musk to step down as CEO suggest experts","2/3/2024","https://fortune.com/2024/02/03/elon-musk-tesla-ceo-board-directors-corporate-governance/","Whisper it but the time may have finally come for Tesla’s board to nudge Elon Musk towards stepping down as CEO experts suggest Advocates argue that the visionary entrepreneur should relinquish day-to-day operations allowing him to zero in on his forte—innovating new products It’s an approach he’s already adopted at his social media platform X where Linda Yaccarino is in charge of running the company while Musk focuses on driving innovation By doing so he would take himself out of the firing line during a challenging juncture when Tesla’s growth is starting to falter and its stock price has languished—in part due to a flawed governance culture for which he is responsible Read more: Elon Musk took drugs with Tesla board members: Report “When you have a founder at the helm it’s both a gift and a curse because visionaries rarely make great CEOs” says Corestone Capital chairman and CEO Will McDonough The wealth manager argues Tesla needs to find someone like Google’s Eric Schmidt or Facebook’s Sheryl Sandberg who can professionally manage the company under the overarching strategic direction of Musk Zack Kirkhorn described by the Wall Street Journal as the “executive who keeps Tesla rolling” might have been exactly that individual But the highly respected finance chief abruptly departed in August with no explanation given Thus far the only individual to work with him noiselessly over a long period is SpaceX president Gwynne Shotwell Normally the idea of replacing Musk as CEO might sound foolhardy given he is the most influential entrepreneur of his generation someone blessed with an uncanny drive to succeed an ability to recruit the best talent to his cause and a gift for predicting what trends will shape society But he also comes with a lot of sharp edges that make it challenging to run a publicly traded megacap like Tesla A 200-page court opinion from a Delaware judge this week sheds light on Musk’s degree of consideration for governance The document reveals how he crafted his own $56 billion compensation package in 2018 as Tesla’s directors dared not reject it Randall Peterson a professor at the London Business School whose research centers on CEO personalities and boardroom dynamics told Fortune the ruling was a “pretty damning critique” of Musk’s board and believes Tesla would be better off with him in a supporting role where he could devote himself to creating new products “Could they find some kind of accommodation that keeps Elon in the atmosphere but takes him out of day-to-day management of the rest of Tesla?” says Peterson who co-authored a 2022 book on dysfunctional boards “If they can come to that then they’re in business If not it’s a huge risk” Last year Musk went on the record saying he did not care whether his investors lost money because he might promote unsubstantiated conspiracy theories In November he then told Bob Iger to “go f*** yourself” after the Disney CEO pulled his advertising over concerns his brand might not be safe on X “He’s a compliance officer’s nightmare because he shoots from the hip” McDonough tells Fortune Musk also ruffled feathers after he decided to negotiate in public over his upcoming pay package saying he will no longer develop artificial intelligence within Tesla unless the board ensures he can gain a 25% blocking minority—essentially a power to veto certain decisions of shareholders This demand came even though Musk seamlessly moved onto the third part of his Master Plan this March without arguably accomplishing any of the four main targets laid out in the second one While there is some sympathy given he watched his non-profit OpenAI become a commercial appendage of Microsoft the petulant attitude and unvarnished attempt to blackmail his directors only served to undermine his case “The way he phrased it is dangerous because it’s holding the board hostage” says Philippe Houchois a veteran auto analyst with investment bank Jefferies “If you start building something inside the company you cannot just threaten to take it out” Contemplating a Tesla in which he is not CEO seems impossible in part because he has been the public face of Tesla for years and the stock price has in part been juiced by his visionary leadership But Wall Street isn’t helping Musk’s case any longer either While Tesla enjoyed a stellar pandemic year the share has dropped 20% since the start of 2021 while the Nasdaq 100 has gained 35% during the same period Other companies like Nvidia Microsoft and Meta have marked all-time highs in recent days by comparison “There have been a number of investment decisions made in the last two years that have put Tesla off track and that is the issue for the board” says Jefferies analyst Houchois “At what point do you decide Tesla is bigger than Musk?” The entrepreneur has repeatedly claimed he never wanted to be CEO and hoped to step back and serve as chief product architect once the initial problems manufacturing the Model 3 were solved during the critical launch over six years ago Tesla director James Murdoch even testified that a successor had been identified Now the board has a unique chance to reassert its authority ease the burden on the 52-year-old and overhaul its acute governance shortcomings before Tesla suffers its next courtroom defeat The chief editor of EV-friendly media website Electrek who himself voted as Tesla shareholder in favor of Musk’s $56 billion pay package argued this was the time for the charismatic yet mercurial CEO to step down to advance his vision as a product architect “You know who first thought of that plan?” he wrote on

Remember Musk has not exercised the option meaning he hasn’t purchased the shares The shares subject of the option are priced at a discount to current market value which value he has grown during his CEO tenure with products that have been profitable to the company Unwinding the package therefore would not be difficult since the options remain unexercised but ideally the compensation will have to be replaced with something else In calling the package an “unfathomable sum” Judge Kathaleen McCormick claimed that it was unfair to shareholders and brought to question the independence of Tesla’s board Did someone say board independence? Next week we will delve into the composition of the Tesla board and why this motley group of individuals have been the unrelenting focus of activist investors Email:[email protected]Twitter:@carolmusyoka"

161,"Does Elon Musk Deserve His Billions?","2/7/2024","https://nationalinterest.org/blog/reboot/does-elon-musk-deserve-his-billions-209185","While charismatic leaders like Elon Musk receive the lion’s share of attention many of us would surely prefer to have a boss who is less grandiose and more modest in their leadership style Maybe the Tesla directors who agreed to pay Elon Musk US$56 billion were just feeling generous Or maybe as the judge who canceled this “unfathomable” deal suggested they really were “starry-eyed” and swayed by Musk’s “superstar appeal” In her ruling Kathaleen McCormick said those who decided to give Musk the biggest pay cheque in corporate history could have been “swept up by the rhetoric” surrounding one of the world’s best-known CEOs Certainly Musk – and his style of leadership – seems to be constantly in the spotlight The German sociologist Max Weber (1864-1920) might have described his leadership style as “charismatic” Weber saw charisma as the possession of a particular type of authority which stemmed from admirers attributing extraordinary qualities to a single person He said such leaders whether they worked in politics or industry appeared to have a “gift of grace” (from the Greek origins of the word “charisma”) – a special something which sets them apart and allows them to create change in a way that would be impossible for lesser mortals My research suggests that charismatic leadership seems to be enjoying a renaissance having fallen out of fashion over the past two decades Charismatic leaders used to be everywhere They seemed to be the ideal of big business in the West from the late 1970s until the turn of the century In the US for example Lee Iacocca was often credited as being the savior of Chrysler for making the car manufacturer profitable after it had been on the verge of bankruptcy Similarly Jack Welch as CEO of General Electric was famous for his management style and merciless cost-cutting which preceded extraordinary growth at the company founded by Thomas Edison and JP Morgan In the UK the likes of Richard Branson and Alan Sugar were celebrated as characterful innovators who made large amounts of money But a series of business scandals during the early 2000s – such as the collapse of Enron and telecommunications giant WorldCom – saw charismatic leadership start to fall out of favor This trend was accelerated by the global financial crisis in 2008 and a growing awareness about climate change and gender inequality – issues which seemed to call for new more responsible and democratic styles of leadership So the charisma-based model of management went out of fashion replaced by leadership styles described as “authentic” (leaders who are true to themselves) or “shared” when leadership is a deliberately collective endeavor The CEOs of the most famous global companies ten years ago such as ExxonMobil and Walmart were not household names But today the bosses of corporations such as Meta Amazon and Tesla are world-famous So why the change? Partly this came about after the economic boom following the 2008 global financial crisis saw tech firms rapidly increase in value – success that was often credited to the founder Figures such as Jeff Bezos and Sam Altman came to be perceived as entrepreneurial heroes rather than “mere” CEOs increasing their prominence and public profiles Another factor comes from living in a time of crisis The Harvard sociologist Rakesh Khurana warned back in 2002 that the adulation enjoyed by some charismatic CEOs as “saviors” distracts us from other people’s contribution to a particular company’s success The search for Khurana’s “savior” figures seems to offer a simple escape route from worries over climate change war and economic turbulence When Musk fantasizes about saving humankind by colonizing space and the disgraced crypto entrepreneur Sam Bankman-Fried proposes the eradication of world poverty they present themselves as redemptive figures to audiences beyond their investors and employees Furthermore in a world increasingly reliant on algorithms business has become somewhat dehumanized People may be yearning for leadership with a (super)human face None of this means however that charismatic leaders will attain the same degree of dominance they did in the 1980s and ’90s If the charismatic leader is making a comeback it is a comeback on a more crowded stage They may be popular in certain circles but so too is the leader as a champion of diversity or ethics or human relationships While charismatic leaders receive the lion’s share of attention many of us would surely prefer to have a boss who is less grandiose and more modest in their leadership style That could be someone like Mary Barra at General Motors or Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen at Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk Or it could be one of the countless leaders whose names do not appear in the media nearly every day As a recent biography of Musk shows the Tesla boss holds history-defining influence via his business interests in a social media platform satellite technology and cars So perhaps the big question is how we can best moderate the enormous concentration of power accumulated by some charismatic leaders Cutting US$56 billion from an enormous personal fortune might be a step in the right direction Sverre Spoelstra is Associate professor Copenhagen Business School Lund University This article was first published by The Conversation Image Credit: Shutterstock © Copyright 2024 Center for the National Interest All Rights Reserved"

market adjustment pay increases this month to many of its factory workers across the US according to notices posted at the companys vehicle assembly plant in Fremont California Bloomberg first reported on the posters An employee in Fremont confirmed that the 2024 pay rate information was distributed at the site and that increases were recently implemented by the company The person asked not to be named citing a lack of permission to speak with the media CNBC reported last month that Tesla workers at the companys battery plant in Sparks Nevada learned their hourly rates would be going up in January The hikes for hourly workers in Nevada represented about 10% increases depending on position and not including bonuses that some employees would be able to earn The fresh pay increases follow an announcement by the United Auto Workers that it would aim to organize at least one Tesla plant after major wins at the big three Detroit automakers The UAW is circulating an authorization card online and is gathering names and signatures of Tesla workers to gauge their interest in forming a union Under Shawn Fains leadership the UAW seeks recognition of the union by the company or a vote when it secures about 70% of workers at a factory Tesla is now following in the footsteps of Toyota Hyundai Volkswagen and almost every other car company in raising wages in the wake of our historic victory at the Big Three as non-union autoworkers everywhere are starting to stand up for themselves Fain said in a statement emailed to CNBC by a spokesperson As great as these raises are they still fall far short of what the companies can afford and what autoworkers are worth The union didnt say how many Tesla workers have signed the authorization card so far Teslas director of people operations and programs didnt immediately respond to a request for comment Tesla CEO Elon Musk has long clashed with unions At the 2023 New York Times DealBook Summit in November he said I disagree with the idea of unions and claimed they create a lords and peasants sort of thing The National Labor Relations Board has found that Tesla violated federal labor laws on more than one occasion In 2018 for example Musk tweeted that workers at the Tesla plant in Fremont would lose stock options if they unionized A federal appeals court ruled that his tweet amounted to an unlawful threat President Joe Biden previously said he supported efforts to organize workers at plants that didnt yet recognize unions That group includes Tesla and Toyota Tesla has faced challenges with unions in Europe as well including strikes and boycotts last year involving service workers The New York Times reported that at least 15 unions have joined IF Metall in strikes to try to force Tesla to negotiate a collective bargaining agreement to set wages and benefits that reflect industrywide norms in Sweden The Associated Press reported that large pension funds in Scandinavia have asked Tesla to reconsider its approach to working with unions and collective agreements Tesla shares closed down 29% on Thursday following reports of the US pay increases and news that the automaker would suspend production for

or captivates - investors more than Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) The believers always find a rationale to buy shares skeptics the reverse Among the top stocks in the world by market capitalization Tesla has been shedding value for a month a selloff precipitated by a fourth quarter earnings miss followed by a forecast of slower growth in 2024 that disappointed analysts Believers spot a buying opportunity Skeptics fret its the beginning of the end Both thoughts may be at least a bit misguided In the fourth quarter earnings call from last Thursday Jan 24 CEO Elon Musk referred to the company as being between two growth waves Were focused on making sure that our next growth wave driven by next-gen vehicle energy storage full self-driving other projects is executed as well as possible Musk said on the call Teslas next-gen vehicle slated to be built in the automakers Austin gigafactory will be called the Model 2 with a starting price of around $25000 making it one of the most affordable battery electric vehicles (BEVs) on the market Whether it actually costs as little as $25000 remains to be seen Musk and Tesla often promising more than they deliver The Model 2 project slated to begin production in the second half of next year is important more because of its manufacturing process than its impact on the BEV market So-called gigacasting technology aspires to replace the conventional welding of metal parts into a unibody - used by virtually all assembly plants - with a new and innovative aluminum casting process that yields fewer and larger components that then are joined to create the body The potential cost savings are said to be significant Model 2s relatively modest price assumes that gigacasting will work at scale and result in massive economies as promised Musk knows this wont be simple or easy That will be a challenging production ramp Like as I can emphasize well be sleeping on the line practically In fact not practically We will be Musk said in the earnings call Musk has already conceded that automating assembly lines and reducing costly human labor is far more difficult than he once imagined Yet if Tesla succeeds with gigacasting every other automaker will feel the financial pressure to match Though Tesla is known as a top global producer of BEVs the automakers technological prowess in software is underappreciated outside the auto industry where rivals are racing to catch up Tesla is a pioneer of centralized vehicle computing a key facilitator of over-the-air (OTA) software updates - all of which amount to the software-defined car the industrys latest buzzphrase In the not-too-distant future automakers will increasingly offer certain vehicle features by subscription which can be added or deleted OTA thereby creating additional revenue opportunities beyond the original sale or lease Teslas latest self-driving software FSD12 could be enabled via OTA At the moment the current FSD11 self-driving package costs up to $15000 FSD12 is undergoing beta testing by Tesla employees and a select small group of customers Early reviews are positive though not without some complaints The rollout of FSD12 is significant in that Tesla has switched from a system of human-written computer code as the basis of self-driving to an artificial intelligence or machine-learning system Using millions of visual images drawn from real-life driving in Tesla vehicles the automakers Dojo supercomputer trains FSD12 Musk has envisioned a world filled with autonomous Tesla vehicles - lacking steering wheels and other controls - earning money for their owners as robotaxis That day isnt yet nigh - though Teslas latest switch to AI may prove to be another step in that direction as well as a reason for certain motorists enamored of self-driving to buy a vehicle with FSD12 A Goldman Sachs analyst already estimates that FSD could be worth a few billion annually in revenue and possibly much more in the years ahead The third critical pillar on which Teslas financial performance rests is its 4680 lithium-ion battery which replaces its previous battery was first revealed in September 2020 and has been rolling out since The number refers to the 46 mm by 80 mm cylindrical size which is becoming an industry standard and is used by other manufacturers such as Chinas BYD The new design is integral to Teslas Cybertruck powertrain On the Q4 earnings call Musk called the Cybertruck our best product ever and a head turner Tesla Cybertruck now in production (Tesla) Tesla Cybertruck now in production (Tesla) According to the Chinese battery company Evlithium Teslas 4680 has higher power density higher energy density better thermal performance and lower cost than the cells it replaces According to Evlithium: A Tesla Model 3 with a 75-kilowatt-hour battery pack using traditional cells has a range of about 350 miles (560 kilometers) and a weight of about 4000 pounds (1800 kilograms) A Tesla Model 3 with a 75-kilowatt-hour battery pack using 4680 cells could have a range of about 406 miles (653 kilometers) and a weight of about 3600 pounds (1630 kilograms) Additionally the company says the batteries would be significantly cheaper One of the biggest difficulties with advanced batteries is the manufacturing process Very small imperfections can result in overheating power degradation and unsuitability for vehicle use In the latest earnings call Tesla executives said the ramp-up phase of battery production - critical to meet demand for Cybertruck - is going well Not surprisingly Seeking Alpha assigns TSLA stock an F grade for valuation the share price far beyond what would be indicated by nearly any metric especially its price in relation to profitability Yet there the company stands with a market capitalization of $607 billion plenty of cash and very little debt Theres a reason why the word unicorn is used to describe such enterprises The substantial cohort of Tesla/Musk enthusiasts appears as robust and lively as ever They can be grouchy as well - but not usually because some quarterly financial target or other is missed Potential investors should keep their eyes on Model 2 Cybertruck FSD and batteries These are the stories that have the potential to drive consumers to purchase Tesla models Dont expect the stock performance to display a conventional relationship with financial performance; it never has and theres little reason to expect one now For the moment I own TSLA and join the consensus of analysts who rate the company a Hold at its current price This article was written by Analyst’s Disclosure: I/we have a beneficial long position in the shares of TSLA either through stock ownership options or other derivatives I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha) I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Seeking Alphas Disclosure: Past performance is no guarantee of future results No recommendation or advice is being given as to whether any investment is suitable for a particular investor Any views or opinions expressed above may not reflect those of Seeking Alpha as a whole Seeking Alpha is not a licensed securities dealer broker or US investment adviser or investment bank Our analysts are third party authors that include both professional investors and individual investors who may not be licensed or certified by any institute or regulatory body"

Let’s discuss… Jan 5 2024 Tesla Inc (TSLA) is conducting a recall of 16 million vehicles in China with the aim of rectifying issues emanating from its Autopilot driver assistance system and mitigating the potential for collisions This comes on the heels of two similar recalls actioned by Tesla in the United States last month The automaker embarked on a mass-scale recall exceeding 2 million vehicles to insert new protective measures into its Autopilot advanced driver-assistance system in accordance with safety concerns raised by federal regulators TSLA’s most recent quarter saw Tesla’s market control drop to 50% a significant decrease from the 62% grip it held during the first quarter In spite of instigating a price battle to bolster its position amidst fierce competition within the electric vehicle segment several other auto manufacturers have resorted to drastic price reductions to fight against the challenging demand landscape brought on by rampant inflation and escalating lending costs In November 2023 HSBC Global initiated coverage with a “reduce” rating and a $146 price target On the bearish side HSBC analysts wrote “Significant delays or developments that show lack of technological and/or regulatory feasibility for a commercial launch of these projects pose a significant risk for Tesla” Furthermore TSLA finds itself under mounting pressure due to an expanding worker strike in Sweden coupled with labor stress in the United States In addition considering its elevated valuation alternative players within the industry may prove to be more prudent investments when anticipating the technology surge in 2024 Analyzing some of its key performance indicators could offer meaningful insights Examining Tesla Inc’s Financial Trends from 2021 to 2023 In analyzing the trailing-12-month net income of TSLA there is a clear trend of an overall increase albeit with slight fluctuations from March 2021 to September 2023 based on the provided data Noteworthy changes are as follows: The growth rate measuring the first value against the last value in the series indicates an overall substantial increase demonstrating an approximately 842% rise ($114 billion to $1076 billion) Despite minor fluctuations this data represents a dramatic upward trend in Tesla’s Net Income over the span of two and a half years This trend particularly the most recent decrease in Net Income should be a crucial focal point moving forward Further data and analysis would be needed to predict whether this represents a temporary setback or a shift in Tesla Inc’s financial health 10 STOCKS TO SELL NOW! The Gross Margin trend of TSLA over the observed period shows a general growth with some fluctuations Overall the reported Gross Margin shows a growth rate of -24% from the first quarter 2021 to third quarter 2023 Despite the fluctuations it’s important to note the considerable growth witnessed up until mid 2022 before the downward trend The Return on Assets (ROA) of TSLA has displayed a fluctuating trend with overall growth in recent years based on the provided series of data Below provides a more detailed view: However the following year saw a reverse in this growing trend: In summary the ROA of Tesla Inc showed an ascending trend from March 2021 to December 2022 climbing from 24% to a peak of 172% suggesting an increase of approximately 617% However the trend reversed in 2023 with a consistent drop in the ROA down to 122% as of the end of September 2023 This current stance represents an approximately 408% growth from the initial value in March 2021 The data presents the Asset Turnover trends of TSLA spanning from March 2021 through September 2023 The overall trend demonstrates constant fluctuations However the value never dipped below the starting point of 076 Unsurprisingly these fluctuations reveal the dynamic nature of the company’s efficiency in using its assets to generate sales Despite minor drops Tesla Inc seems to have improved its ability to utilize its assets over the analyzed period Emphasis on recent data indicates a drop in asset turnover which suggests the need for further analysis to understand the reasons behind it Tesla Inc’s Volatile Share Prices: A Decreasing Trend from July 2023 to January 2024 Upon assessment of the data provided the share price of Tesla Inc (TSLA) manifests an overall decreasing trend from July 2023 to January 2024 The fluctuations suggest a sequence of rises and falls however a generally notable deceleration in price through time is pronounced The data reveals the following: With reference to the growth rate it is not constant during this period changing with the price’s fluctuations The growth rate essentially experienced significant troughs and crests throughout the second half of 2023 and the start of 2024 An evident peak in the growth rate is noticeable around mid-September 2023 whereas a principal dip occurred at the beginning of November 2023 The variable growth rates and decreasing overall price trend suggest volatility and depreciation in the value of shares for Tesla Inc (TSLA) during this period The data seems to mirror the typical unpredictability of the stock markets oscillating due to miscellaneous market economic and company-specific factors causing instability in share prices Here is a chart of TSLA’s price over the past 180 days Analyzing Tesla’s Quality Momentum and Growth Trends with POWR Ratings TSLA has an overall D rating translating to a Sell in our POWR Ratings system It is ranked #39 out of the 59 stocks in the Auto & Vehicle Manufacturers category Based on the featured POWR Ratings the three most noteworthy dimensions for Tesla Inc (TSLA) throughout the period under review appear to be Quality Momentum and Growth Let’s take a closer look at these dimensions: Quality: According to the ratings Tesla’s Quality consistently ranked highest among the six dimensions even though it exhibited a slight downward trend The ratings started at 93 in July 2023 and finished at 87 in January 2024 Thus despite a decrease in numerical value Quality maintained the top spot indicating that the quality of Tesla’s earnings and business operations remained relatively high Momentum: Momentum also emerged as an important dimension based on the given POWR Ratings Though it experienced a significant drop from 67 in July 2023 to 32 in January 2024 Momentum sustained fairly strong ratings until towards the end of the period suggesting Tesla’s price change pace over time was largely favorable Growth: Growth was the third significant dimension evidenced by the consistent decline in its ratings In July 2023 Growth stood at 54 and by January 2024 it had plummeted to 10 This persistent downward trajectory signals a steady reduction in Tesla’s growth prospects over this period In summary Quality was the highest-rated dimension for Tesla Inc evidenced by its consistently top-ranking values Momentum also carried significant weight despite a considerable decline over time The most notable trend was reported within the Growth dimension which showed an unequivocal decrease during the observation period How does Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stack Up Against its Peers?

Heres What You Need To Know (NASDAQ:TSLA)","2/13/2024","https://seekingalpha.com/article/4669777-tesla-buy-the-dip-heres-what-you-need-to-know-rating-downgrade","FREDERIC J BROWN/AFP via Getty Images FREDERIC J BROWN/AFP via Getty Images After a stellar 2023 where Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock soared doubling in value at one point before settling 53% higher by years end 2024 has brought a harsh reality check The stock has plunged over 24% fueled by disappointing Q4 earnings and revenue that fell short of expectations This performance has shaken investors causing them to question Teslas continued presence in the Magnificent 7 group of high-flying tech stocks Concerns are amplified by a looming electric vehicle (EV) price war that threatens profit margins and the rising competition from cheaper Chinese electric vehicles that could chip away at Teslas market share Price Development (Seeking Alpha) Price Development (Seeking Alpha) Back in October I covered Tesla brimming with optimism about their industry-leading margins and market share resilience amidst the price war Since then things havent exactly panned out that way as the stock has taken a 26% nosedive leaving a bitter taste for some investors Yet with the price drop Teslas overall risk profile becomes more attractive So lets revisit the companys situation and my updated vision for its future trajectory 2023 witnessed a remarkable feat for EVs: Teslas Model Y ascended to the throne of global best-seller with over 12 million models delivered silencing doubts about their practicality and desirability In the US overall EVs crossed the 1 million sales mark solidifying their presence with a 75% share and representing a crucial step towards electrification However the narrative takes a slight turn when examining growth trends The heady days of 50% YoY growth witnessed between June 2022 and 2023 are fading casting a shadow of doubt on the ambitious target of 50% EV sales by 2030 The growth has fallen to 35% YoY in November 2023 Several factors are contributing to this slowdown: Its crucial to remember that this slowdown doesnt negate the significant progress made EV adoption is still in its early stages and fluctuations are to be expected The industry must address issues like pricing expand affordable options and invest in charging infrastructure to maintain momentum and navigate these temporary hurdles Naturally the slowing industry growth and falling prices per vehicle amidst stiff competition from BYD Company (OTCPK:BYDDF) Ford (F) BMW (OTCPK:BMWYY) and Mercedes-Benz (OTCPK:MBGAF) have had an impact on Teslas Q4 earnings The company reported only 3% YoY revenue growth delivering $2516 billion Financial Summary (TSLA IR) Financial Summary (TSLA IR) Bloomberg reports a surprising shift in price dynamics: Teslas top-selling EVs the Model 3 and Model Y boast starting prices lower than the average transaction price for other cars in the US This means their entry-level variants could be more affordable than many gasoline-powered options The key driver is the $38990 (before taxes and fees) starting price for the base rear-wheel-drive Model 3 This represents an $8700 saving compared to the national average for new cars and trucks Even compared to other EVs its impressive – their average transaction price in the US currently sits around $52000: While Teslas recent price cuts may cost the company $12 billion annually they represent a bold gamble aiming for price parity with traditional gas-powered cars and trucks This move though impacting short-term profits could significantly drive future demand for EVs ultimately positioning Tesla as a dominant player in the clean energy market However the immediate effect is evident in a 612 basis point YoY drop in gross margin currently sitting at 176% This signifies a trade-off: immediate financial sacrifice for potentially exponential market growth in the long run Gross Margin (Seeking Alpha) Gross Margin (Seeking Alpha) As a result the EPS in Q4 has fallen by 40% to $071 taking a significant hit While the price war may grab headlines the real story lies in Teslas impressive cost reductions Despite the early challenges of ramping up Cybertruck production the cost of goods sold per vehicle has shrunk to just above $36000 marking a sequential decline Even as they approach the natural limits of cost reduction for existing models Tesla shows no signs of slowing down actively pursuing further efficiencies across all stages of production from raw materials to final delivery However predicting future auto gross margins remains a complex endeavor Numerous factors beyond their control such as fluctuating tariffs and local incentives add significant uncertainty to the equation COGS per Vehicle (TSLA IR) COGS per Vehicle (TSLA IR) While 2023 offered impressive growth Tesla seems cautiously optimistic about 2024 Vehicle volume growth rate may fall significantly as the company focuses on launching its next-generation car at Gigafactory Texas This marks a transition period between the global expansion of the Model 3/Y platform and the companys next big bet Despite claiming very far along development of a low-cost vehicle Tesla remains tight-lipped about specifics leaving investors anxious The lack of details on pricing strategy and expected profit margins further fuels the uncertainty contributing to the ongoing stock price decline However its not all doom and gloom Despite these challenges Teslas market share continues to rise in both the US & Canada and China defying pressure from Chinese competitors While Europe shows signs of plateauing the strong presence in key markets provides some cushion Overall 2024 presents a mixed bag for Tesla While navigating a crucial transition period with limited guidance adds anxiety the companys existing momentum and continued market share gains offer some hope The success of the next-generation car and future strategic decisions will ultimately determine the years true outcome TSLA Market Share (TSLA IR) TSLA Market Share (TSLA IR) Teslas growth story extends beyond vehicles: the energy storage segment delivered explosive YoY growth surging from 65 GWh in 2022 to nearly 15 GWh in 2023 a triple-digit increase This momentum isnt expected to slow down Looking ahead Tesla anticipates faster growth in energy storage than the automotive business fueled by the ongoing ramp-up of the massive 40 GWh Megafactory in Lathrop Energy Storage Deployments (TSLA IR) Energy Storage Deployments (TSLA IR) While traditionally focused on vehicles Teslas Services & Other segment is quietly emerging as a significant growth engine Last year saw it transform from a $500 million loss in 2019 to a $500 million profit in 2023 showcasing a remarkable turnaround This momentum seems unstoppable with triple-digit growth rates projected for the future In fact I wouldnt be surprised if this segment evolves into the next major growth driver rivaling even the automotive business Although Tesla spearheaded the electric vehicle revolution its path forward is no longer a paved highway Several hurdles loom on the horizon demanding attention and strategic responses: Teslas stock has embodied the wild swings of market enthusiasm and fear The past three years saw valuations fluctuate from 30x to a staggering 340x earnings reflecting dramatic shifts in growth expectations While achieving its first positive net income in 2020 Teslas subsequent EPS growth has slowed: Unsurprisingly such volatile growth translates to volatile stock prices Currently trading at 6031x its blended P/E while lower than its historical high the future picture remains murky Analyst forecasts polled by S&P Global paint a mixed picture: These diverse expectations suggest 2024 might be a transitional year marked by a peaking price war and uncertainties in the EV market Assuming a reasonable 27%-28% average annual EPS growth in subsequent years Teslas valuation presents several perspectives: Considering ongoing headwinds and managements limited guidance the current valuation seems stretched despite trading lower than its historical peak While Tesla could still deliver a 15% annual return if it surpasses current EPS growth expectations especially in 2024 I believe better investment opportunities exist in the market today Given the uncertainties and lack of clear direction I am downgrading Tesla stock to hold until a more promising path emerges Return Potential (Fast Graphs) Return Potential (Fast Graphs) Tesla reigned supreme in 2023 with the Model Y claiming global EV best-seller status and EVs crossing 1 million sales in the US However the initial surge in EV sales with 50% YoY growth seen in June 2023 has slowed to 35% by November 2023 raising concerns about achieving the ambitious target of 50% new vehicle EV sales by 2030 a goal set by the US government Fuel price drops affordability hurdles and inventory buildup are putting the brakes on growth But this slowdown doesnt negate the progress made The industry needs to address pricing expand affordable options and invest in charging infrastructure to maintain momentum Teslas Q4 reflects the slowdown with lower revenue growth and falling per-vehicle prices However a bold gamble emerged: starting prices for Model 3 and Y are now lower than the average US car price potentially driving future demand This aggressive move comes at a cost with gross margin dropping significantly While short-term profits suffer Teslas impressive cost reductions across production stages offer hope for long-term success However predicting future profitability remains challenging due to external factors 2024 shows cautious optimism with a focus on launching the next-generation car Lack of details on pricing and profitability fuels investor anxiety contributing to the stock price decline Despite the challenges Teslas market share continues to rise offering some solace The companys future hinges on successfully navigating the transition period and executing its next big bet The success of the new car and future strategic decisions will ultimately determine Teslas fate Although Teslas current valuation sits beneath its historically high range limited visibility on future EPS growth prompts me to downgrade the stock to hold Other

$15 million to settle a civil lawsuit alleging the company mishandled hazardous waste materials at facilities throughout the state of California for years The fee is negligible for Tesla which reported net income of $793 billion during the fourth-quarter of 2023 Tesla did not respond to a request for comment District attorneys representing the people of 25 California counties had filed their lawsuit The People of the State of California v Tesla Inc earlier in the week in a state court in San Joaquin County In their complaint the district attorneys alleged that Tesla had: intentionally disposed of and intentionally caused the disposal of hazardous waste at places that were not authorized nor appropriately equipped to handle that material which included everything from spent lead acid batteries to paint and lubricants used in auto repairs and manufacturing The suit also alleged that Tesla frequently failed to properly label containers of hazardous materials that it generated used or stored at its facilities and failed to train employees in proper handling of hazardous waste The settlement fee of $15 million includes $13 million in civil penalties and $200000 to reimburse the costs of the investigation according to a press statement issued by San Francisco District Attorney Brooke Jenkins In addition to the settlement fee Tesla will need to comply with a detailed injunction for five years according to the statement Tesla will need to prove proper training of employees and will need to hire a third party to conduct annual waste audits of its trash containers at ten percent of its facilities each year to meet the injunctive requirements according to the statement The audits will continue for five years and involve inspections of Teslas trash containers for hazardous waste the statement from Jenkins said While Tesla has a stated mission to accelerate the worlds transition to sustainable energy the company and its CEO have been called out for environmental hypocrisy through the years For example the Political Economy Research Institute ranks Tesla 89th on its list of Toxic 100 air polluters based on the most recent available data from 2021 Musks frequent use of a private jet for travel as well as greenhouse gas emissions associated with it are tracked by independent researcher Jack Sweeney via his social media accounts including ElonMusksJet on Threads In 2022 Tesla paid a $275000 penalty to the EPA after the agency found it violated air toxic emission standards during a three-year period in Fremont California which is home

Americas+1 212 318 2000 EMEA+44 20 7330 7500 Asia Pacific+65 6212 1000 By Jennifer Kay Elon Musk now has some guidelines for moving Tesla Inc‘s incorporation to Texas from Delaware thanks to a Tuesday decision in a lawsuit finding that TripAdvisor Inc can reincorporate in Nevada That’s if he can follow the procedures laid out by Vice Chancellor J Travis Laster of the Delaware Court of Chancery TripAdvisor may move its incorporation a plan challenged by investors who said it benefited company directors—including Greg Maffei chairman of TripAdvisor’s parent company—at the expense of shareholders But Laster said the travel review and book site still has to face the investors’ lawsuit as monetary damages could be warranted It’s an opinion expected to influence how easily Tesla and corporations can exit Delaware for other states where laws offer more insulation from litigation for officers and directors Delaware has been the country’s premier venue for corporate litigation with nearly 70% of Fortune 500 companies calling the state home Musk vowed to move Tesla to Texas after repeated losses in Chancery Court “The roadmap for Musk is what you see in this opinion—he can go if he wants but may have to pay an exit tax” said Brian Quinn a Boston College law professor focused on corporate law The TripAdvisor case entered the spotlight last month after the Chancery Court’s chief judge Kathaleen St Jude McCormick voided Musk’s $56 billion Tesla pay package as unfair to shareholders Musk has cited the TripAdvisor case in his criticism of Delaware courts The tech leader has threatened to move publicly held Tesla’s incorporation to Texas and has already started to move the incorporations of his other privately held companies—SpaceX and Neuralink—out of Delaware While Laster wouldn’t stop TripAdvisor from leaving Delaware saying an injunction was “off the table” he said the investor litigation challenging the company’s planned relocation as rife with self-interest could proceed Nevada offers laws that better shield company directors—including Greg Maffei chairman of TripAdvisor’s parent company—from shareholder lawsuits A “monetary award could be crafted” to compensate the investors who sued should the court ultimately rule against TripAdvisor down the line Laster said Laster also said the litigation rights provided to shareholders by Nevada law “are inferably less than what Delaware provides” calling into question the fairness of the move Musk responded to McCormick’s ruling against him by venting on social media writing: “Never incorporate your company in the state of Delaware” It’s also the state where Musk surrendered in his fight to back out of his $44 billion offer to buy the social media platform Twitter Inc which Musk subsequently took private renamed X and reincorporated in Nevada Nevada does things differently than Delaware but it’s debatable that it’s inherently anti-shareholder It’s “potentially unsettling” that Laster’s opinion suggested Nevada law could be worse for shareholders said Jill Fisch a University of Pennsylvania law professor who teaches about corporate law and litigation “If you’re a Delaware judge you probably think that but why wouldn’t it work the other way?” she said States vary in terms of how much protections they offer to shareholder and there’s no clear way for shareholders to determine which state is better for them when a corporation or board wants to move she said “Characterizing this as potentially self-dealing and conferring a material benefit on the directors that seems to be the big step that Vice Chancellor Laster is making here” Fisch said The decision largely denying TripAdvisor’s motion to dismiss sets some guidelines for Delaware-incorporated companies such as Tesla where a controlling stockholder such as Musk wants to leave Delaware for another state offering officers and directors more protection from shareholder lawsuits “You need a truly disinterested special committee and you need a disinterested shareholder vote and you’ve got to commit to the fact that you’re not going to move unless you get both of those things up front” Fisch said Musk could still be tripped up in his attempt to move Tesla to Texas said Carliss Chatman who teaches corporate law at Southern Methodist University’s Dedman School of Law In the lawsuit over his Tesla pay package McCormick found conflicts of interest marred the board’s consideration of the pay deal Musk has repeatedly urged Tesla’s board to arrange another massive stock award for him years after he sold a significant chunk of his shares in the company to acquire the social-media company once-known as Twitter The billionaire has said he needs a large Tesla stake to maintain control of the carmaker and expand further into artificial intelligence Some experts have questioned whether Musk’s focus on Tesla will be weakened without another super-sized pay package “If he really wants to move to Texas it’s fine He just needs to abstain from voting on some things which I don’t think he’s going to do” she said “He also needs to not pressure people which he’s probably not going to do” Laster known for making groundbreaking rulings that often side against billionaire shareholders successfully avoided making Delaware into a kind of “Hotel California” where companies can incorporate but never leave said University of Iowa law professor Robert Miller who has written about the development of Delaware corporate law The company can leave Delaware whenever it wants “but the controller is liable for any harm arising from unfairness” Miller said “And Laster even has a smart way of measuring that—the declining value of the company as shown by market prices in an efficient market” —With assistance

As a group HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment with high oil prices and elevated interest rates could TSLA face a similar situation as it did in 2022 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months - or will it see a recovery? We currently remain marginally positive on Tesla stock with a $210 price estimate which is about 5% ahead of the market price We continue to believe that Tesla will remain a big beneficiary of the long-term transition to cleaner transportation and energy generation given its well-oiled supply chain superior battery and drive train tech and its lead with software and self-driving technology Tesla is also looking to manufacture a mass-market vehicle which is likely to be a compact crossover starting sometime toward the end of 2025 and this could help drive growth in the long run In the near term Tesla could benefit from the recent launch of a mildly refreshed version of its Model 3 and the introduction of its Cybertruck pickup truck Tesla also began a limited amount of advertising in the second half of 2023 - something that the company has largely avoided since its incorporation See our analysis on Tesla Valuation: Is TSLA Stock Expensive Or Cheap? for more details on Tesla’s valuation and how it compares with peers For more information on Tesla’s business model and revenue trends check out our dashboard on Tesla Revenue: How Does TSLA Make Money?

What do they do? And how does that affect your investments? Proxy Advisors: Who They Are and What They Do In the proxy document that precedes every annual meeting investors usually encounter a raft of proposals made by independent shareholders aiming to improve transparency around how a company does business and manages risk Proxy advisors help fund managers and other institutional investors decide how to vote on these shareholder resolutions ISS and Glass Lewis the market leaders control over 90% of the proxy advisory market so their recommendations do matter There are thousands of companies with hundreds of thousands of resolutions to be voted on Proxy advisors are an important part of the governance system in public markets They allow managers to focus on the most important voting issues and to use proxy advisors’ recommendations to make decisions on more routine matters So does that mean key issues at companies are decided by proxy advisors not shareholders? In short no Proxy Advisors Advise Fund Managers Decide Here’s the Evidence If managers were “outsourcing shareholder voting decisions” to proxy advisors as Musk claims then they would make similar decisions Morningstar found otherwise Morningstar’s proxy-voting research demonstrates that the opposite is true—asset managers’ votes on environmental social and governance proposals have become less correlated over the past few years So how do asset managers vote on governance and sustainability issues? The answer is that proxy advisors advise and managers decide There are a few reasons why we can say this so categorically First most asset managers have their own tailor-made policies for proxy voting engagement and ESG integration These policies have varying degrees of specificity on how the manager may vote on various ESG issues The issue is complicated by the differing practices of each firm Depending on the firm the voting decision-maker can vary—sometimes it’s the portfolio manager sometimes a stewardship specialist and in some contentious cases a senior-level committee will decide Also the degree of freedom given to voting decision-makers at each firm to make case-by-case decisions also varies Overall there is a wide range of influencing factors and decision-makers that result in managers making different decisions on the same proxy-voting issues So are managers simply copy-and-pasting proxy advisors’ voting recommendations? The data shows that the opposite is true A 2015 study by Proxy Insight indicated that over 70% of asset managers use their own bespoke policy rather than the standard policy of a proxy advisor (known as a benchmark policy) A more recent study in April 2023 published by the Financial Reporting Council a UK regulator indicated that the figure hasn’t changed much According to that research 75% of institutional investors use proxy advisor recommendations tailored to their bespoke voting policy instead of the benchmark policy Morningstar’s research reveals similar findings We analyzed managers’ voting decisions on key ESG resolutions at US companies (We define key resolutions as shareholder proposals supported by at least 40% of a company’s independent shareholders) Asset managers make very different decisions on ESG topics Looking at the Big Three index managers for example we found that BlackRock and State Street supported over half of 227 key resolutions at US companies in the last three proxy-voting years (51% and 65% of their fund votes respectively) Vanguard’s support for these resolutions was around half that of its Big Three peers over the same period (28%) Looking only at the most recent year the differences are even more stark: 66% of State Street’s fund votes on key ESG resolutions were cast in support of them compared with 37% at BlackRock and just 9% at Vanguard These clear differences in approach are why we frequently emphasize the need for investors to assess their manager’s stance on social and environmental issues That way investors can ensure that their manager’s engagement and voting efforts are well-aligned with their own values and priorities A Growing Role for Proxy Advisors in the Future Notably BlackRock State Street and Vanguard are all rolling out proxy-voting choices to more of their clients this year (Some also call this “pass-through voting”) This means a growing number of investors will have the option to select a voting policy that reflects their own ESG priorities or to continue to rely on the asset manager’s discretion Investors will only be allowed to select a policy they prefer rather than request specific voting decisions on the resolutions at each company’s shareholder meeting But these policy options allow investors to express broader voting preferences on key themes like board appointments or ESG shareholder resolutions and the policies are mostly written by proxy advisors So the role of proxy advisors looks set to keep growing with an even greater emphasis on investor preferences than before All in all it’s never been more important to assess what your ESG priorities are as an investor and take steps to ensure that your views are represented Elon Musk isn’t happy Elon Musk the CEO and 13% shareholder of Tesla TSLA is petitioning the company’s board to grant him more voting power over the electric vehicle maker according to a recent article in The Wall Street Journal Just for context Musk sold a chunk of Tesla stock to fund his takeover of Twitter A conventional reading of the matter would be to say if Musk wanted greater control of Tesla then he perhaps shouldn’t have sold quite so much stock But there never was anything conventional about Elon Musk His aim is to ward off the “activists that basically infiltrate those organizations and have strange ideas about what should be done” “Those organizations” are proxy advisors which provide research and voting recommendations about the resolutions that shareholders vote on at company meetings For more about proxy voting read this But little is understood about the proxy advisory business which is led by the firms ISS and Glass Lewis (Morningstar Sustainalytics also offers voting recommendations through its ESG Voting Policy Overlay service) Musk tweeted: ISS and Glass Lewis have strongly refuted claims like these which arise frequently Morningstar researchers have also looked closely at this topic As the proxy season gets going this article seeks to answer three important questions: Who are the proxy advisors?

In the proxy document that precedes every annual meeting investors usually encounter a raft of proposals made by independent shareholders aiming to improve transparency around how a company does business and manages risk Proxy advisors help fund managers and other institutional investors decide how to vote on these shareholder resolutions ISS and Glass Lewis the market leaders control over 90% of the proxy advisory market so their recommendations do matter There are thousands of companies with hundreds of thousands of resolutions to be voted on Proxy advisors are an important part of the governance system in public markets They allow managers to focus on the most important voting issues and to use proxy advisors’ recommendations to make decisions on more routine matters So does that mean key issues at companies are decided by proxy advisors not shareholders? In short no If managers were “outsourcing shareholder voting decisions” to proxy advisors as Musk claims then they would make similar decisions Morningstar found otherwise Morningstar’s proxy-voting research demonstrates that the opposite is true—asset managers’ votes on environmental social and governance proposals have become less correlated over the past few years So how do asset managers vote on governance and sustainability issues? The answer is that proxy advisors advise and managers decide There are a few reasons why we can say this so categorically First most asset managers have their own tailor-made policies for proxy voting engagement and ESG integration These policies have varying degrees of specificity on how the manager may vote on various ESG issues The issue is complicated by the differing practices of each firm Depending on the firm the voting decision-maker can vary—sometimes it’s the portfolio manager sometimes a stewardship specialist and in some contentious cases a senior-level committee will decide Also the degree of freedom given to voting decision-makers at each firm to make case-by-case decisions also varies Overall there is a wide range of influencing factors and decision-makers that result in managers making different decisions on the same proxy-voting issues So are managers simply copy-and-pasting proxy advisors’ voting recommendations?

Is it really coming? I mean like thats a little credulous I dont know PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: He says it is But just to rewind a little bit 2017 right this is what? Five years ago we heard-- we saw this thing roll out at an event And then havent heard much since until 2022 when Musk said at the Giga Rodeo-- when they opened up the Austin factory-- that its coming Its going to come in 2023 right? And they reopened reservations And well talk about that But basically now we see Musk tweeting late last night it is coming Theyve basically production design is complete Theyre going to unveil the car later this year like you said Josh and then planning for sales next year Now said again a 0 to 60 time less than a second Kind of insane stuff here But again we heard this last-- we heard this two years ago We heard it five years ago Is it actually going to come out Deposit holders some have put down $50000 no interest right? Thats refundable Im sorry $5000 refundable Other people have put down $250000 for the Foundation series to get that car so JULIE HYMAN: Well I hope they get it eventually right? I mean this reminds me of the Cybertruck a little bit as well which did well It sort of come out PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Yeah Yeah JULIE HYMAN: Right I mean-- PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Eventually right right JULIE HYMAN: Yeah Its interesting timing because of course BYD came out with its own supercar earlier this week Is that a coincidence that were now getting an update on the Roadster? PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Well I wrote a piece on it Its going to come out just in the next few moments But basically yes I kind of allude to the fact that its interesting that these tweets came out late last night Only we talked about BYDs U9 supercar right? Its going to cost $230000 around the same price as potentially the Tesla Roadster Scissor doors four motors-- all these pretty cool stats But only a couple of months ago NIO also said that their EP9 hypercar was going to cost $3 million US 1000 horsepower interchangeable batteries all this sort of stuff These-- the Chinese supercar makers are sort of coming on strong here And it seems like maybe Musk kind of had to cough up more details because he felt the need to because these cars are going to come on the road later this year-- the Chinese cars so in China but not necessarily in the US But still competition nonetheless JULIE HYMAN: Right if youre a Chinese buyer are you going to wait for the Tesla Roadster or are you going to buy one of these other ones? PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: I want to quickly just say something real quick Yes it is a $5000 deposit not a $50000 deposit for-- JULIE HYMAN: Oh thats a lot lower But still-- PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Just wanted to correct JULIE HYMAN: Nothing JOSH LIPTON: I mean its interesting Pras because listen I think thats a beautiful car The lines on that car are beautiful to me But I would say like 200000 when you find yourself competing with like a Lamborghini and Ferrari thats a small market I mean ultimately that doesnt move the needle for Tesla or the EV market right? I mean what have we talked about so much on the show? Whats one way to reignite growth here? Its not the 200000 car And again gorgeous car but ultimately you need lower priced EVs right? PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Yeah I think these are just halo cars that bring people in like they have the Optimus robot in some stores to bring people in Same with the Cybertruck its a lot of the marquee Tesla stores to bring people in So thats like some of the thing that kind of draws you in But youre going to buy the Model Y or the Model 3 Maybe the X-- or the S as your actual car Quickly I want to re again clarify that its a $5000 deposit But then within 10 days you got to cough-- cough up more 45000 for a 50000 full deposit-- JULIE HYMAN: So it is effectively a $50000 deposit-- PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: --yeah for a car JULIE HYMAN: --that people have put down PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Yes And the car when it came-- 2017 it was said to be a $200000 MSRP and 250k for that Founders Edition Sorry about that I want to get that clear JULIE HYMAN: Thats OK Well see-- I mean its not even out yet So theres a lot of confusion I guess PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Yeah why do we care right? It doesnt matter Its going to change tomorrow who knows right? Well see JOSH LIPTON: Wait for the tweet Related Quotes"

215,"Why did Tim Cooks pay package hold up in court while Elons failed?","2/8/2024","https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-did-tim-cook-pay-222112357.html","Just a week after Elon Musk’s $55 billion Tesla payday was struck down by a Delaware judge a New York court dismissed a challenge to Apple CEO Tim Cook’s compensation package which clocked in at under $100 million Some coincidence At face value the two cases seem to have a lot in common Both were shareholder suits waged against some of the highest-paid superstar tech CEOs in the world And both were filed amid a backdrop of increased public scrutiny over executive compensation in recent years which is near all-time highs across S&P 500 companies But for all their similarities from a legal standpoint the two cases are apples and oranges—and Cook was always going to stand a better chance of holding on to his paycheck Elon Musk’s $55 billion compensation package at Tesla made headlines last month after Delaware chancellor Kathaleen McCormick ruled in favor of a shareholder who argued that Tesla was paying its CEO an unfairly high amount with the moonshot grant Plaintiff Richard Tornetta argued that because Musk wields so much power at Tesla and maintains close relationships with his board members the supposedly independent board of directors’ vote approving his massive pay scheme was anything but “Chancellor McCormick found that the process for setting Elon Musk’s pay was essentially controlled by Elon Musk” said Tulane University law professor Ann M Lipton in an interview with Fortune “The board didn’t engage in any kind of pushback or real bargaining” In response Musk has threatened to relocate Tesla from Delaware (where almost 70% of Fortune 500 companies are incorporated) to Texas where a more favorable political climate could leave him less exposed to these types of challenges While the Musk case was focused on a broad more abstract legal question related to the Tesla board of directors’ degree of independence the Cook case resolved yesterday was much simpler “The question before Delaware [in the Musk case] was simply ‘Was the pay substantively unfair?’ whereas the question in the Tim Cook case was solely ‘Was the proxy statement misleading?’” said Lipton The Teamsters’ pension fund sued Apple last year arguing that the company had misled investors by misrepresenting Cook’s 2021 and 2022 pay in its proxy statements and paying him more than it had initially proposed Because Cook and other Apple executives are primarily paid in equity known as RSUs the company enlists financial models to estimate what Cook’s actual pay will be for shareholders’ approval each year (For CEOs being compensated primarily with stock isn’t uncommon Mark Zuckerberg famously earns just $1 in annual salary but he’s made billions through Meta stock grants included in his compensation package The Economic Policy Institute found in a report last year that stock-related pay accounts for over 80% of CEO compensation) The pension fund that sued Cook argued that Apple misrepresented its CEO’s actual compensation package by downplaying the value of his equity Cook and other Apple executives netted over $90 million in compensation for 2021 and 2022 higher than the $775 million estimate the company initially asked shareholders to vote on for approval (Both of those figures are well below Cook’s current annual compensation; at his own request the Apple CEO took a 40% pay cut last year That change was approved by shareholders and the Apple board’s compensation committee which counts former Vice President Al Gore as one of its members) The plaintiffs claimed that Apple used an unusual financial model to artificially deflate Cook’s pay estimate and also buried the compensation tables in a drab gray section of the proxy statement where shareholders would be less likely to notice it before casting their Say-on-Pay votes The court didn’t buy it “What happened with Tim Cook is very common in public companies” said Marc Hodak partner at executive compensation consultancy Farient Advisors “They award performance shares based on the face value of the stock And each of those performance share units has a market value that’s higher than the face value stock at the time of grant” One key difference between the two cases was the size of the contested pay package Musk’s $55 billion award from Tesla was part of the largest compensation plan in corporate history While Cook’s $100 million annual pay is by no means a small sum it’s on par with his peers In fact Apple uses a group of its competitors including Meta Netflix Visa and Cisco to benchmark its executives’ compensation (Notably it added Tesla to that peer group last year) “I don’t have any question that the size and scale of [Musk’s] pay package was a driver both in terms of the litigation and the decision that we saw” said Hodak “[$55 billion] is automatically going to attract an unusual amount of scrutiny” Taken together these two cases do seem to hint at a broader trend toward greater scrutiny of bloated CEO pay—but Lipton advised against reading the tea leaves prematurely “Elon Musk is beating this drum that everyone should leave Delaware to suggest that somehow this is a trend” said Lipton “I think this is an Elon Musk problem That Tim Cook thing it was a different law It was a different argument” Representatives from Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment This story was originally featured on Fortunecom Related Quotes"

222,"Tesla Q4 Preview: Growth Stalling Margins Eroding And Too Expensive (NASDAQ:TSLA)","1/16/2024","https://seekingalpha.com/article/4663199-tesla-stock-q4-earnings-preview-growth-stalling-margins-eroding-expensive-downgrade-sell","Win McNamee As usual I always start with the performance assessment for my prior coverage My earlier stance on Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) was a Buy And I am disappointed to say I got this one quite wrong Since publication of my last article the stock has returned -1842% (ouch) compared to the S&P 500s +404%; a negative alpha of 2246%: Performance since Hunting Alphas last article on Tesla (Seeking Alpha) I believe I made two serious errors and one error of misjudgment The first serious error was that I got carried away by the grand aspirations of Tesla by placing too much emphasis on the mega-growth prospects of the industrial robots business and full self-driving (FSD) It is important to remember that I must act as a realistic investor and not get too carried away by the grand visions of an entrepreneur great as though he may be Therefore whilst it is true that Teslas investments do have great multiplier potential it is too far out for the market to appreciate that possibility right now And according to my investing philosophy the market is the ultimate truth especially since I am a minority shareholder who is largely at the mercy of the other market participants to realize a return on my investments The second serious error was considering valuations by only looking at the historical trading multiples of Tesla For a fast-growing company the steady-state valuation band changes often and this is something I failed to take into account when assessing Teslas valuation leading to a dangerous conclusion The last error of misjudgment was also a risk I identified for my thesis which unfortunately played out: My thesis assumes no further microeconomic-related pricing cuts for Tesla - Hunting Alphas bull thesis risk in the last coverage of Tesla This has not played out And I missed sharing an opportunity to revise my expectations and review my thesis earlier Going forward I will be sharing stance updates in a pinned comment for more timely updates in case of key developments I am now bearish on Tesla as I think it will underperform the S&P 500 (SPY) (SPX) I dont think the upcoming Q4 FY23 earnings release on Jan 24 2024 will present any meaningful upset to these trends: Automotive Sales (USD mn) (Company Filings Authors Analysis) Automotive sales comprise of almost 80% of the overall revenue mix The last 4 quarters show a tapering off around the $20 billion mark Automotive Sales YoY (Company Filings Authors Analysis) YoY growth rates have been decelerating since Q1 FY22 and it was especially sharp in Q3 FY23 at 45% YoY TTM YoY Revenue Growth (Tesla Q3 FY23 Investor Presentation) Tesla showed this comparison of TTM YoY revenue growth rates in their Q3 FY23 investor presentation What is noteworthy is the divergence between Tesla and the broader auto industry since Q2 FY22; Tesla has been seeing a continued deceleration (of course some amount of this is reasonable as it started off at a much higher base) whilst the auto industrys revenue growth has been accelerating since then I do acknowledge that so far Tesla is still growing much faster than the rest of the auto industry However the gap is clearly reducing I dont see any catalyst for meaningful revenue growth re-acceleration in the near term as Tesla does not have any new product launches soon except for the Cybertruck which management indicated would still take till 2025 to meaningfully ramp up and become cash-flow positive CEO Elon Musk did not offer any timeline for the launch timing of the lower-priced cars in the Q3 FY23 earnings call Contrary to what I expected Tesla has continued to cut prices across all its models in the US (47% revenue mix) and in 7 out of 9 models in China (22% revenue mix) Here are some illustrations of pricing movements for key models in the US and China: Model Y LR Prices (USD) (Tesla Website Authors Analysis) Model 3 SR Prices (USD) (Tesla Website Authors Analysis) Model Y SR Prices (CNY) (Tesla Website Authors Analysis) Note that Model 3/Model Y make up more than 95% of overall deliveries These pricing cuts have further weighed down on automotive sales gross profit margins as they declined to 157% in Q3 FY23: Automotive Sales Gross Profit Margin (Company Filings Authors Analysis) Tesla has been reducing their automotive cost of sales and indicated that there is further scope for reductions here: Automotive Cost of Revenues Per Vehicle Delivered (USD) (Company Filings Authors Analysis) However these efforts are not nearly enough to offset the lower sale prices leading to continued declines in unit gross profits: Automotive Gross Profit per vehicle delivered (Company Filings Authors Analysis) Over the last 6 quarters automotive gross profits at a unit level have declined by almost 53% from $17865 to $8431 EBIT Margin (Company Filings Authors Analysis) Overall this has led to a steep degradation in the EBIT margin profile of the stock CEO Musk noted that their pricing cut decisions are prompted by rising interest rates and the pressure that place on maintaining affordability of their cars given a high proportion of people buying cars with loans: I just cant emphasize this enough that the vast majority of people buying a car is about the monthly payment And as interest rates rise the proportion of that monthly payment that is interest increases naturally So thats -- if interest rates remain high or if they go even higher its that much harder to -- for people to buy the car They simply cant afford it - CEO Elon Musk in the Q3 FY23 earnings call Does this mean potential rate cuts in 2024 may lead to price hikes in Teslas cars? I highly doubt it for 2 key reasons: Now Teslas margin contraction due to cutting prices in order to offset higher financing costs for car purchases makes sense However note that other automotive companies are not seeing a similar decline in their margins profile: Operating Margin Comparisons (Tesla Q3 FY23 Investor Presentation) Teslas 1-yr fwd PE Among the Magnificent 7 (Capital IQ Authors Analysis) The Magnificent 7 includes Tesla (TSLA) Amazon (AMZN) Microsoft (MSFT) Apple (AAPL) NVIDIA (NVDA) Alphabet (GOOGL) (GOOG) and Meta (META) Lets acknowledge Teslas massive growth optionalities in full self-driving (currently still in development) Optimus (currently still in development) and Energy Generation & Storage (currently still small at 67% overall revenue mix 91% of overall gross profit mix) So the valuation band may be more comparable to the Magnificent 7 rather than traditional automakers Even when viewing the valuations from this perspective Teslas 626x 1-yr fwd PE is still at a hefty 122% premium to the median 282x PE of other members in the Magnificent 7 If this is your first time reading a Hunting Alpha article using Technical Analysis you may want to read this post which explains how and why I read the charts the way I do utilizing principles of Flow Location and Trap TSLA/SPX500 Relative Technical Analysis (TradingView Authors Analysis) From a technical analysis perspective of TSLA relative to the S&P 500 (SPY) (SPX) I note that the last impulse move has been bearish and the ratio prices have reacted off a breakdown retest area I see there is space for further downside toward the bottom of the potential range I anticipate immediate further progress downwards or a momentary spike in the form of a second failed retest of the resistance before a resumption down A move down would correspond with underperformance of Tesla relative to the S&P 500 I believe the higher valuations provide a good deal of margin of safety in the bearish outlook for the stock Although I deem it to be unlikely any price hikes in vehicle models coupled with strong consumer sentiment for spending on durable goods such as cars would be a key risk for my thesis In fact data from the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment surveys reveals that high prices are by far the major reason for poor buying conditions in vehicles; more important than high interest rates: University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Surveys (University of Michigan) This is another reason why I would be very surprised if management rolls back their pricing cuts policy Also considering the lack of new model releases I dont expect sales growth to accelerate materially in the upcoming Q4 FY23 earnings release My earlier assessment of Tesla was wrong particularly due to 2 serious mistakes; (i) getting carried away by narratives of long-term multiplier growth potential without adequate visibility and (ii) not taking into account structural changes in the valuations band in a company that is far from reaching a maturity stage Now my revised stance on Tesla is bearish as I note stalling automotive sales (which is still the major revenue driver) without any major product launches or meaningful scaleups on the horizon the increased risk of continued price cuts leading to structural margin profile deterioration and a hefty valuation far above the norm for a Magnificent 7 stock My research suggests that Q4 FY23 is unlikely to lead to any surprises that would break the current trend of weak automotive sales and pricing policies But of course I would be waiting for any contrary evidence in the results release next week and will provide an update if necessary Stance: Sell Strong Buy: Expect the company to outperform the S&P 500 on a total shareholder return basis with higher-than-usual confidence Buy: Expect the company to outperform the S&P 500 on a total shareholder return basis Neutral/hold: Expect the company to perform in line with the S&P 500 on a total shareholder return basis Sell: Expect the company to underperform the S&P 500 on a total shareholder return basis Strong Sell: Expect the company to underperform the S&P 500 on a total shareholder return basis with higher-than-usual confidence The typical time horizon for my view is multiple quarters to around a year It is not set in stone However I will share updates on my changes in stance in a pinned comment to this article and may also publish a new article discussing the reasons for the change in view This article was written by Analyst’s Disclosure: I/we have no stock option or similar derivative position in any of the companies mentioned and no plans to initiate any such positions within the next 72 hours I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha) I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Seeking Alphas Disclosure: Past performance is no guarantee of future results No recommendation or advice is being given as to whether any investment is suitable for a particular investor Any views or opinions expressed above may not reflect those of Seeking Alpha as a whole Seeking Alpha is not a licensed securities dealer broker or US investment adviser or investment bank Our analysts are third party authors that include both professional investors and individual investors who may not be licensed or certified by any institute or regulatory body"

Musk quipped I dont think its particularly attractive the technology is not very strong And BYD as a company has pretty severe problems in their home turf in China I think their focus is and rightly should be on making sure they dont die in China BYD did not get wiped out Instead BYD dethroned Tesla in the fourth quarter as the top EV maker selling more battery-powered vehicles than its US rival Their goal was to be Chinas largest auto manufacturer and put China manufacturing on the map Taylor Ogan CEO of Snow Bull Capital said of BYDs long-standing ambition So how did the Chinese company which began by making phone batteries become an electric car giant? While BYD is now known as an electric car giant its tentacles stretch into many areas from batteries to mining and semiconductors which is a large reason behind its success Chemist Wang Chuanfu founded BYD in 1995 in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen Chinas massive tech hub It was founded with 20 employees and 25 million Chinese yuan of capital or $351994 at todays exchange rate In 1996 BYD began manufacturing lithium-ion batteries the type that are in our modern day smartphones This coincided with the growth of mobile phones BYD went onto supply its batteries to Motorola and Nokia in 2000 and 2002 respectively two of the mobile phone industrys juggernaughts at the time In 2002 BYD listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange riding the wave of its success in lithium-ion batteries It wasnt until 2003 that BYD acquired a small automaker called Xian Qinchuan Automobile Two years later it launched its first car called the F3 which was a combustion model And then in 2008 it launched the F3DM its first foray into electric vehicles The F3DM was a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle That same year Warren Buffetts Berkshire Hathaway made what was at the time a $230 million investment in BYD This gave a boost to BYDs electric car ambitions BYD continued to push into the EV space and this is where its history as a battery maker came into play In 2020 the company launched the Blade battery which many argued helped spark BYDs growth in EVs It is an LFP or lithium iron phosphate battery At the time according to Ogan many battery makers were moving away from LFP batteries due to perceptions that they had poor energy density ie they were too heavy for the amount of energy they were able to provide But BYD touted the Blade as a breakthrough that provided good energy density and high levels of safety It committed to putting this in its Han a sporty sedan which was released in 2020 and seen as a rival to Teslas Model S BYD then put the Blade in subsequent models it released The energy density at the cell level and the pack level were actually higher than what BYD initially unveiled Everyone was blown away Ogan said BYD sold 130970 pure battery electric vehicles in 2020 Last year the company sold 157 million battery EVs The breakthrough with the Blade underlines why BYD has found success in EVs — strategic investments and the fact that it has more businesses than just cars BYD cut their teeth being a supplier in the high tech space building up resiliency by supplying batteries to hard to please companies like Apple Tu Le of Sino Auto Insights told CNBC Wang Chuanfu then had the wherewithal to acquire a broken down local Chinese automotive brand and was able to focus on innovating on battery tech enough so that it can sell to other automakers If that wasnt enough they were head down grinding continually improving the design engineering and quality of its own stable of vehicles We didnt know this at the time but everything its done over the last 15-20 years set it up to surpass Tesla in Q4 23 At the start BYD did not jump straight into pure EVs The company still sold hybrid cars which Alvin Liu analyst at Canalys said was key to BYDs initial success In the early stages of the Chinese EV market BYD chose to simultaneously launch Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV) This strategy allowed BYD to win the market when charging infrastructure was not well-established and users were not very clear about the advantages of EVs Liu told CNBC PHEVs characteristics like high economic efficiency and not having range anxiety played a significant role in helping BYD to win the market Liu said BYD postioned itself in the mid-range market where there were fewer competitors in China which helped propel its growth BYD has done well on branding according to Liu creating differetn sub-brands to tackle different price points in the market One such example is BYDs mid-to-high-end EV brand Denza As well as BYDs own tactics its rise has been helped by the Chinese governments huge support of the countrys EV sector Over the past few years Beijing has offered subsidies to incentivize buyers of electric cars and offered state support to the industry These measures began around 2009 at the time BYD was looking to ramp up its EV push Rhodium Group estimates that BYD received approximately $43 billion in state support between 2015 and 2020 BYD is a highly innovative and adaptive company but its rise has been inextricably linked to Beijings protection and support Gregor Sebastian senior analyst at Rhodium told CNBC Without Beijings backing BYD wouldnt be the global powerhouse it is today Over time the company has enjoyed below-market equity and debt financing allowing it to scale up production and R&D activities After dominating Chinas EV market BYD is now epanding aggressively overseas It sells cars in a number of countries from the United Arab Emirates to Thailand and the UK In southeast Asia BYD has a 43% market share in electric vehicles But BYDs interntional expansion is not just about selling cars it involves manufacturing and materials too BYD said in December it would open its first European manufacturing plant in Hungary And the company is also looking to buy lithium mining assets in Brazil Lithium is a key component of BYDs batteries However with global expansion comes scrutiny from governments who are concerned about the subisides that Chinese carmakers have received In September the European Commission the executive arm of the European Union launched an investigation into subsidies given to electric vehicle makers in China Meanwhile the US is trying to boost its own domestic EV sector through the Inflation Reduction Act with an aim of keeping out Chinese competitors Initiatives like the IRA and the EU anti-subsidy probe aim to impede Chinas progress in these markets Rhodiums Sebastian said To ensure sustained growth BYD is proactively addressing these political hurdles as seen in its recent investment in an EV plant in Hungary underscoring its commitment to global expansion The battle between Tesla and BYD — the worlds two biggest EV makers — is set to continue Sino Auto Insights Le said he beleives that BYD still hasnt reached max potential Most automotive companies for the longest time didnt take them seriously Thats where part of their journey mirrors Teslas because people didnt take Tesla seriously in the early days either Le said As for Tesla the company is facing stiffer competition in 2024 with Chinese competitors launching more models and traditional automakers trying to catch up in the EV race Daniel Roeska senior research analyst at Bernstein Research told CNBC that there isnt a big driver of sales volumes in Teslas car portfolio in the coming months BYD on the other hand could see faster growth BYD quite to the contrary is really pushing the pedal to the metal … by accelerating growth in Europe and other overseas markets And so there is a lot more growth in the BYD story in the next 12 to 24 months for sure Roeska said Teslas Musk has recognized that he shouldnt have taken BYD lightly In a comment posted in X in response to a video of his 2011 Bloomberg interview Musk said: That was many years ago Their cars are highly competitive these days Got a confidential news tip?

Corporate law doesn’t prohibit “supersized” compensation for “superstar” executives but it does impose specific procedural checks and balances Stated differently in Canada provided it is the result of a robust process led by truly independent directors advised by external experts and assuming meaningful disclosure to shareholders a supersized compensation plan granted to a superstar CEO should if challenged find judicial approval In brief the Plan granted Musk options to increase his Tesla ownership by approximately 6% (from 219% to a maximum of 283%) if and only if he increased Tesla’s market capitalization from approximately $50 billion to $650 billion while also achieving operational milestones tied to Tesla’s top-line (revenue) or bottom-line (adjusted EBITDA) growth[2] The Plan’s total maximum potential value to Musk was US$558 billion Chancellor McCormick noted the Plan was “the “largest potential compensation opportunity ever observed in public markets by multiple orders of magnitude—250 times larger than the contemporaneous median peer compensation plan and over 33 times larger than the plan’s closest comparison” Tesla’s directors highlighted the Plan’s objective was to “achieve transformative growth and that Tesla accomplished this by securing Musk’s continued leadership” They further underscored that Musk’s equity stake would only increase by 6% should he realize $600 billion of growth in shareholder value[3] Ultimately however and notwithstanding the Court’s acceptance “that Musk was uniquely motivated by ambitious goals and that Tesla desperately needed Musk to succeed in its next stage of development” the Court ruled Tesla’s directors had breached their fiduciary duties by awarding the Plan The Court-ordered remedy: rescission of the Plan such that Musk was disentitled to the entirety of the equity he had earned under it But what is critical to appreciate is the Court’s ruling doesn’t condemn the Plan based on its terms in and of themselves Rather Chancellor McCormick rescinded the Plan primarily for deficiencies identified in (1) the independence of the committee tasked with formulating the Plan (the Committee) (2) the process around the Committee’s development of the Plan and (3) Tesla’s disclosure to shareholders regarding the foregoing In total with appropriate modifications to these process points the Plan could have survived judicial scrutiny Musk has also recently indicated that he intends to appeal the decision Where exactly did the Committee and the Plan go wrong? The Court seized on several issues and as such the judgement makes instructive if not entertaining reading Regarding the Committee’s composition the Court’s primary concern was numerous indicia its members lacked independence ie appropriate objectivity and autonomy vis-à-vis Musk The Court cited both business dealings outside the company and cross-investments amongst Committee members and Musk as well as longstanding personal relationships evidenced by such things as attendance at family birthday parties and joint family vacations Another “compromising factor” identified by the Court was the off-market and “outsized” director compensation being received by two of the Committee members Relatedly the “primary” intermediary between the Committee and Musk was Tesla’s General Counsel who was Musk’s former divorce attorney The Court described him as a man whose “admiration for Musk moved him to tears during his deposition” The Court underscored that on “whose side he viewed himself” during the negotiation was unclear” Regarding the Committee’s development of the terms of the Plan a key concern of the Court was that the process was insufficiently “adversarial” The Court highlighted several admissions during Committee members’ testimony that they did not see themselves as being “on different sides of things” with Musk that they viewed the process as “cooperative” rather than “contested” and that they had not engaged in “positional negotiation” This was aggravated by the fact that the Plan as ultimately approved was very close to that initially proposed by Musk that the Committee had not won any significant concessions from Musk and that where the Plan had been downsized it had essentially resulted from Musk “negotiating against himself” The Court identified several additional deficiencies with the Committee’s process One was inadequate Committee control over timing and preparation Although the Plan had been developed over nine months the Court saw most work as occurring in “short bursts” dictated by Musk and around which the Committee was given insufficient time to prepare Another was that notwithstanding that benchmarking is the “foundation” of a compensation analysis the Committee had not conducted a benchmarking analysis Nor had the Committee asked its advisors to either challenge the Plan or present alternatives to it The Court also highlighted that several of the Plan’s preliminary performance milestones already appeared highly likely to be met[4] Finally the Court faulted the Committee for failing to address two interrelated questions First did adequate incentives for Musk already exist? The Court called this the “$558 billion question” and answered that given his existing 219% equity stake Musk already had “every incentive to push Tesla to levels of transformative growth” in that he “stood to gain over $10 billion for every $50 billion in market capitalization increase” Second whether the Plan was necessary to retain Musk ie was there danger Musk would depart without it? The Court did not see any Musk’s own testimony “throughout the litigation” was that he had “no intention of leaving Tesla” The Committee had expressed concerns that a risk faced by Tesla was Musk dedicating insufficient time to the company due to distractions posed by his other significant business ventures However the Court criticized the Plan as “not conditioned on Musk devoting any set amount of time to Tesla because the board never proposed such a term” Regarding Tesla’s disclosure of the foregoing in advance of the shareholder vote that approved the Plan the Court held the vote was not fully informed as a result of deficiencies in the proxy circular sent by Tesla to shareholders specifically for “inaccurately describing key directors as independent and misleadingly omitting details about the process” What was required according to the Court was an “accurate full and fair characterization” of the Committee members’ standing vis-à-vis Musk as well as the process by which the Plan was developed However the circular did not disclose any of the “members’ actual or potential conflicts with respect to Musk” Nor did the circular disclose several aspects of the Plan’s negotiation the Court viewed as material in the circumstances including “the level of control that Musk exercised over the process” Lastly the circular did not disclose that under Tesla’s own projections the company “would achieve three of the revenue milestones and all of the adjusted EBITDA milestones in 2020” And so what are the key lessons of Tornetta v Musk et al for compensation committees in Canada? Once again a principal takeaway is that corporate law doesn’t prohibit “supersized” compensation for “superstar” executives but it does require that procedural checks and balances are respected We highlight the following: Lastly the importance of attention to the foregoing is amplified where the executive could reasonably be described as “superstar” and/or the compensation package as “supersized” In special circumstances stratospheric compensation may be justifiable but expect a commensurate level of scrutiny of the process undertaken by the directors that awarded the package Chancellor McCormick’s judgement is no doubt making the rounds throughout boardrooms across North America and elsewhere However a few additional caveats and comments are warranted in the Canadian context The reality is that the Canadian business community is dwarfed by that of the US such that it can be more difficult here to entirely avoid overlapping business or personal interests among senior executives and directors Also questions regarding director independence including what may or may not qualify as potential conflicts of interests have received scant judicial guidance by Canadian courts further complicating the situation Finally we do not entirely agree with the Court’s analysis regarding the requisite level of “adversarial” and “positional” bargaining during the negotiation of an executive compensation plan Yes the committee should be independent and negotiations should be arm’s length but this does not mean that the process should be hostile as opposed to cooperative and collaborative Negotiations over executive compensation are not the same as negotiations over an arm’s length merger It must also be recalled that directors are ultimately in pursuit of an appropriately structured “win/win” pay package for senior executives and the company and that the success of the company going forward will in good part depend on management and the board working well together for the benefit of all stakeholders [1] CA No 2018-0408-KSJM Post-Trial Opinion (January 30 2024) [2] The Plan also featured a five-year holding period an M&A adjustment and a 12-tranche structure For a tranche to vest Tesla’s market capitalization had to increase by $50 billion and Tesla had to achieve either an adjusted EBITDA target or a revenue target in four consecutive fiscal quarters [3] Or as the Tesla directors put it the Plan was “all upside” for the Tesla stockholders who “risked nothing” but stood to gain $600 billion for only 6% The options were valued at $26 billion at the time of grant [4] Tesla’s 2017 Projections showed revenue growth of $696B and adjusted EBITDA growth of $144B in 2020 Under the July 2017 Projections Tesla would achieve three of the revenue milestones and all of the adjusted EBITDA milestones in 2020 *** Grant McGlaughlin is co-leader of the Private Equity Group and practices in the areas of mergers and acquisitions private equity corporate finance governance and sensitive and complex transactions He provides superior service and expert legal advice to public and private issuers underwriters and private equity funds in a broad range of industries including mining and natural resources technology and industrial *** Richard Steinberg’s practice is focused on mergers and acquisitions and corporate finance Richard advises targets buyers and investors in both solicited and unsolicited transactions with a particular expertise in cross-border transactions Richard’s corporate finance practice is focused on structured and cross-border financings with extensive experience acting for both underwriters and issuers Richard is the former Chair of Fasken’s *** Paul Blyschack"

As Tesla grows and matures the company will get more aggressive about split points So you would expect another split to occur well before TSLA hits $900 Given the details of the two previous splits a two-for-one exchange when the share price exceeds $350 would make sense The common end-goal of holding share prices low through splits is to improve the stocks liquidity and accessibility A stocks liquidity relates to how easily it can be bought and sold This is a function of demand; if many investors are willing to buy selling investors can liquidate their shares quickly For exchange-traded stocks like TSLA accessibility is driven primarily by the share price Few retail investors for example can afford a single share of Berkshire-Hathaway (BRKA) which costs more than $600000 But many individuals can afford say $100 or $200 for a piece of Tesla Tesla hasnt targeted a $100 share price yet but that could change as the company matures If that were the goal today Tesla could make it happen with a two-for-one split in 2024 Stop chasing shadows in the market Forbes expert analysts have pinpointed the 12 superstars poised to ignite returns in 2024 Dont miss out—download 12 Best Stocks To Buy For 2024 and claim your front-row seat to the coming boom So what would happen if Tesla split its stock this year? Lets touch on the short-term and long-term implications Stock split plans generate buzz which can drive share prices up in the short-term Unfortunately share price gains driven by buzz alone often dont last especially for volatile stocks like Tesla As an example Tesla announced its 2022 split in March Shareholders approved the split in August and the transaction was implemented later that month Between March and August Teslas share price rose fell and recovered—finishing out August with a slight gain Should that volatility repeat when Tesla announces its next split there will be opportunity for the savviest short-term traders Looking beyond the immediate term there is some empirical evidence that split stocks tend to outperform the market for one to three years following the change This is largely due to investor perception vs fundamental business improvements so it can be fleeting Tesla did perform well in the three years following the 2020 split but has lagged the market since its 2022 split Longer-term Tesla should benefit from holding its share price low But that benefit only applies if the business continues delivering acceptable shareholder returns To that end Tesla is entering an interesting period in its evolution The company has lowered its prices in recent years to stimulate demand Thats putting pressure on margins and profitability just as Teslas EV competition is on the rise CEO Elon Musk personally creates another layer of challenge for the company While Musk is credited with masterminding Teslas growth to date he has a history of creating negative headlines and distractions Most recently reports have surfaced alleging illegal drug use by Musk and Tesla board members With those moving pieces in play a stock split isnt going to make or break Tesla long term More important will be the companys ability to manage through increased competition lower margins and the drug-use scandal in 2024 I dont see Tesla stock splitting this year The share price is about 30% lower now than it was after the 2022 split That negates any argument about keeping the share price affordable since the stock has done that on its own If TSLA were expected to rise some 75% to the mid-$300s this year the story would be different In that case youd see Tesla on lists of the best stocks for 2024 and split conversations would be ongoing Unfortunately most analysts arent predicting that kind of growth According to Yahoo Finance the TSLA price targets range from $2257 to $32006 The average is $19273 which represents a slight decrease from the current share price of $19995 Teslas outlook could change for the better if the company’s newly launched Cybertruck makes a big splash Tesla began delivering the new model in November 2023 with a starting price point of $81000 The truck is reported to have a towing capacity of 11000 pounds and a range of 340 miles per charge Tesla also has growing opportunity in its energy generation and storage business which quadrupled its sales in 2023 That growth doesnt exactly position Tesla among the best energy stocks but its a nice source of revenue diversification Tesla has split its stock twice in company history While some believe the EV-maker is due for a third split in 2024 that probably wont happen unless the share price rises significantly from where it is now The brain trust at Forbes has run the numbers conducted the research and done the analysis to come up with some of the best places for you to make money in 2024 Download one of Forbes most popular and widely anticipated reports 12 Best Stocks To Buy for 2024"

265,"Tesla Sales In California Down 10% In 4th Quarter","2/5/2024","https://cleantechnica.com/2024/02/05/tesla-sales-in-california-down-10-percent-in-fourth-quarter/","Reuters reports that registrations of Tesla vehicles in California dropped 10 percent in the last quarter of 2023 That is the first time sales of Tesla automobiles have fallen in the Golden State which is ground zero for the EV revolution in the United States in the past three years The last time it happened was in the third quarter of 2020 when the Covid pandemic was roiling markets worldwide California typically accounts for about 10 percent of all Tesla vehicles sold worldwide which makes it one of the most important markets for the company A total of 47592 Tesla vehicles were registered in California in the fourth quarter compared with 52782 a year earlier according to data from California New Car Dealers Association Globally Tesla saw its sales hit another record in the fourth quarter after the company cut prices CEO Elon Musk has blamed high interest rates for raising monthly payments and in turn hurting demand for Tesla cars and forcing Tesla to slash prices Analysts said Musk may have alienated many potential buyers with his actions and comments including his endorsement of antisemitic comments on X and his support of the Republican Party He later said he is “far from being antisemitic” “83% of Americans connect Musk with Tesla and that’s a problem for Tesla considering that Musk’s reputation is much weaker than Tesla’s” Shahar Silbershatz CEO of market research firm Caliber told Reuters He added that his firm has seen a decline in the reputation and the consideration rates for Tesla since Musk has acquired X formerly Twitter more than a year ago Tesla’s price cuts also hit the market value of Tesla cars already on the road which may dissuade some potential customers and discourage current owners from purchasing another Tesla Guidehouse Insights analyst Sam Abuelsamid said “The poor residuals have probably left a lot of owners underwater on existing loans” he said Ongoing layoffs at tech companies located in California also may have weighed on consumer sentiment both analysts said Competition is also growing from Chevrolet Hyundai Mercedes-Benz and BMW which all increased their EV market share in California last year During the full year of 2023 Tesla increased vehicle sales by 246% but lost market share in the electric car segment by 105 percentage points It now is “only” responsible for 605 percent of EVs registered in California The word on everyone’s lips today is “hybrid” Sales of hybrid vehicles are now 133 percent of new car sales in California up for 87 percent in 2022 The market share of battery electric vehicles in the state fell to 211 percent in the fourth quarter from 223% in the prior three month period Suddenly people like Mary Barra CEO of General Motors are talking about building more hybrid vehicles that have tried and true gasoline engines onboard to power a car when the battery gets depleted The issue is really charging infrastructure Despite years of trying by companies like Electrify America ChargePoint EVgo Blink and others people remain reluctant to purchase an electric car if they are unsure about how to charge it Having that gas engine under the hood alleviates those concerns It also addresses other weaknesses that battery electric cars face such as reduced range and difficulty charging in cold temperatures Are hybrids a stop gap halfway measure? Of course they are But the Chevy Volt was an excellent automobile that allowed people to drive on electrons instead of molecules most of the time When it came time to drive the family to Disneyland however it could take to the interstate just like a normal car without the worry of finding charging locations along the route General Motors did what it does best — introduce a new model then smooth and improve it as part of a second generation makeover and then just when it has all the kinks worked out kill it The GM Voltec system developed for the Volt didn’t just disappear when that car went out of production It is on the shelf ready to go and could be applied to many GM models — particularly the Canyon midsize pickup truck and many SUV models — with relative ease Is that what Barra and her minions have in mind? Somewhere Akio Toyodo is snickering up his sleeve as he watches the pendulum swing back towards his beloved “self charging” hybrid cars Many other car company executives are applauding themselves for building cars on platforms that can accommodate a variety of powertrain options from only combustion engines to hybrids to plug in hybrids to full battery electric The problem with that approach is that it prevents designers from taking full advantage of the packaging requirements for electric cars that allow more room inside for people and things because there is no need fit a big clunky gas engine and a ten speed automatic transmission inside the bodywork The advantage is that manufacturers can rapidly adjust their product mix to meet the the demands of the marketplace Right now those demands are trending away from purely electric cars and toward cars that combine the advantages of piston power and electric motors Tesla of course cannot take advantage of that shift in the market if there is one because it has never built cars with combustion engines and never will In the book The Last Hurrah Edwin O’Connor tells the story of Frank Skeffington a powerful Irish mayor of an Eastern US city whose political empire reaches a pinnacle and then comes to an end quite abruptly Most readers assume the book is a fictionalized account of the life and times of James Michael Curley who was the mayor of Boston from 1914 to 1955 Like Skeffington Curley was a rogue a scoundrel and a master politician who ruled his empire with an iron fist and a velvet glove At the conclusion of the book the protagonist is at a post election party where speeches and whiskey are flowing But despite all the back slapping and bonhomie Skeffington is keeping an eye on the vote totals by precinct as they are posted He notices some of the numbers are not what he expected and while his supporters continue celebrating he watches as his empire crumbles into dust Is it too much of a stretch to ask if something similar might be happening to Tesla? The numbers from California may be just a glitch — a temporary disturbance in the force — or they could be the first signs of a shift that could signal the undoing of Tesla and its high profile leader One could construct an argument that the EV revolution has moved too far too fast and a period of retrenchment is now upon us one in which hybrids are asked to prepare the way for the second phase of the EV revolution sometime around 2030 when the charging infrastructure is fully developed to the point where it can support millions of electric cars charging every day Perhaps on that distant horizon batteries will have improved to the point where they can charge faster weigh less take up less space and perform better in cold weather than the batteries we have today The question is whether all those improvements will happen at all if the transition to battery electric cars takes a detour somewhere along the way Who will pay for all those chargers if there are not enough electric cars using them? Who will pay to improve batteries if the world of transportation turns away from battery powered vehicles? CleanTechnica readers may find these questions silly or even inane Of course Tesla is going to go from success to success Of course the EV revolution is going to continue But there are warning lights flashing for the transition to electric cars Just because it needs to happen to tame the worst effects of global overheating doesn’t guarantee it will happen — at least not on the time schedule many of us assumed it would We ignore such warning signs at our peril Steve writes about the interface between technology and sustainability from his home in Florida or anywhere else The Force may lead him He is proud to be woke and doesnt really give a damn why the glass broke He believes passionately in what Socrates said 3000 years ago: The secret to change is to focus all of your energy not on fighting the old but on building the new You can follow him on Substack and LinkedIn but not on Fakebook or any social media platforms controlled by narcissistic yahoos Steve Hanley has 5450 posts and counting See all posts by Steve Hanley"

BRIAN SOZZI: I was looking for a really bad pun like Teslas stock downshifts to neutral But you dont really shift in a Tesla right? Its just an electric vehicle Nonetheless here are three reasons why Tesla stock is still tanking Let me fire these off here really Performance for Tesla has just not been good You look at that last earnings report earnings have been softer than expected for six straight quarters So the Street is getting concerned about the companys performance Number two Wall Street profit estimates on Tesla are actually starting to fall If you go over to Yahoo Finance you click on the Analysis section on the left rail you can see some of the earnings trends for Tesla over in recent days Over the past 30 days 2024 EPS estimates for Tesla have fallen for this year by about $072 Now keep in mind Tesla shares are still valued about 56 times forward earnings Not a good scenario when you see earnings estimates declining and your price is still priced for perfection or a growth stock And then lastly I have questions about Elon Musk here the human being The Wall Street Journal dropped its second story over the weekend digging into his potential or reported drug use Who else is running in his sphere? And I think this has begun to weigh on sentiment around Tesla So you have all that And then really a nifty chart I think is also relevant to the Tesla story here as well It comes from the folks over at Car Gurus And you can see the continued downtrend in used Tesla prices for various reasons whether it is quality concerns or people just dont want these things They have range anxiety Whatever it is prices for Tesla continue to fall which I would argue is putting pressure to even-- for Tesla to continue to lower prices on its newer vehicles which puts pressure on profits and potentially sets it up for a seventh straight disappointing quarter when it reports three months from now BRAD SMITH: Well the other issue too is that you have the issue of so many of the rental car companies that are now putting some of their EVs back into the market too So that hits on the Tesla selling proposition for a brand new one that somebody can say all right just for me to test out this EV landscape right now why dont I just get into a used one for a fraction of the cost? BRIAN SOZZI: You can pick them on those Toyota hybrids I know youre big-- youre a big fan I really got a lot of pushback on my Toyota boring call but-- BRAD SMITH: Im just saying they got the Lexus division SEANA SMITH: Well you work from the market I didnt think it was that much cooler than what Toyota was offering BRIAN SOZZI: Sorry Taylor The former president delivered a rambling performance as his legal battles heat up Carl De Souza / Getty ImagesPrince Harry’s party days with Sean “Diddy” Combs could be coming back to haunt him after it emerged that he was named in court documents filed against the rapper who is facing a litany of shocking sexual assault allegations in a case being brought by one of his former producers Rodney JonesFederal law enforcement raided two of Diddy’s properties on Monday as part of an investigation into sex trafficking allegationsWhile Harry is not accused of any wrongdoing bein Traylor hit the sun and surf The Prince and Princess of Wales have now shared a new statement to thank the public for the support and well wishes since she shared the news A Toronto woman refused to give up the key to her husband’s Rolls-Royce at gunpoint Saturday telling carjackers they were using a toy gun The woman told Global News thieves then removed the bullets to prove it was real As Sean O’Shea reports the car was stolen after the woman was thrown from the car and she was left with painful bruises When trying curb ultra-processed foods finding minimally processed grocery-store snacks might be challenging A nutritionist shares what he buys Family members said the 21-year-old suffered brain injuries and bruising throughout her body NEW YORK (AP) — A New York appeals court on Monday agreed to hold off collection of former President Donald Trump’s more than $454 million civil fraud judgment if he puts up $175 million within 10 days If he does it will stop the clock on collection and prevent the state from seizing the presumptive Republican presidential nominees assets while he appeals The appeals court also halted other aspects of a trial judges ruling that had barred Trump and his sons Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr (Bloomberg) -- Donald Trump’s business empire was supposed to be in peril like never before on Monday Instead it turned into the single-greatest day on record for the former president’s wealth Most Read from BloombergTrump Vows to Pay Fraud Trial Bond Cut by 68% to $175 MillionTrump’s Net Worth Hits $65 Billion Making Him One of World’s 500 Richest PeopleAfter Exposing Realtors Eliminate the Mortgage Interest DeductionUS CEOs Extend China Stay on Last-Minute Invite to Meet XiMahathir Sons The Duchess of York 64 was recently diagnosed with skin cancer after battling breast cancer “The Daily Show” host tears into the former president’s claim ― and shows why the case matters The Frida star showed off the teens photography skills by sharing a snapshot from their trip to the beach New York Times reporter and CNN political analyst Maggie Haberman joins CNN’s Kaitlan Collins to detail her takeaways from former President Donald Trump’s latest legal developments As some celebrities issued apologies to Kate Middleton people are demanding Kim Kardashian follow suit The former president appeared before a New York judge in an unsuccessful push to delay his hush money trial or dismiss the charges Hannah McKay/File Photo/ReutersFriends of Prince William and Princess Kate Middleton have told The Daily Beast that they would not welcome the “drama” a visit by Prince Harry would entail and said Kate and William are focused on protecting their privacy as she receives treatment for and recovers from cancerThe comments add to a sense that while Harry and Meghan Markle appear keen to paint themselves as eager to reconcile with the royals after over two years of very public attacks on them—indee The president has been going after his presumptive 2024 opponent with a little more venom than usual The collection launches March 25 President Biden poked fun at former President Trump for boasting about winning two golf trophies at his own golf club’s awards Sunday “Congratulations Donald Quite the accomplishment” Biden wrote on X the platform formerly known as Twitter Biden attached a screenshot of Trump’s post earlier in the night on Truth Social “It is my great… The rapper was caught off guard when her whole boob fell out of her top on stage"

269,"Tesla Inc (TSLA) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It","2/9/2024","https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-inc-tsla-trending-stock-140010134.html","Tesla (TSLA) has recently been on Zackscoms list of the most searched stocks Therefore you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stocks performance in the near future Shares of this electric car maker have returned -166% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composites +51% change The Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry to which Tesla belongs has lost 163% over this period Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term? Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a companys business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision Revisions to Earnings Estimates Here at Zacks we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a companys future earnings over anything else Thats because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account When earnings estimates for a company go up the fair value for its stock goes up as well And when a stocks fair value is higher than its current market price investors tend to buy the stock resulting in its price moving upward Because of this empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements Tesla is expected to post earnings of $069 per share for the current quarter representing a year-over-year change of -188% Over the last 30 days the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -271% For the current fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $330 points to a change of +58% from the prior year Over the last 30 days this estimate has changed -163% For the next fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $420 indicates a change of +275% from what Tesla is expected to report a year ago Over the past month the estimate has changed -197% Having a strong externally audited track record our proprietary stock rating tool the Zacks Rank offers a more conclusive picture of a stocks price direction in the near term since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate along with three other factors related to earnings estimates Tesla is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) The chart below shows the evolution of the companys forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate: 12 Month EPS Projected Revenue Growth Even though a companys earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues Its almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods Therefore knowing a companys potential revenue growth is crucial For Tesla the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $2588 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +11% For the current and next fiscal years $11205 billion and $13357 billion estimates indicate +158% and +192% changes respectively Last Reported Results and Surprise History Tesla reported revenues of $2517 billion in the last reported quarter representing a year-over-year change of +35% EPS of $071 for the same period compares with $119 a year ago Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2594 billion the reported revenues represent a surprise of -297% The EPS surprise was -533% Over the last four quarters Tesla surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period Valuation Without considering a stocks valuation no investment decision can be efficient In predicting a stocks future price performance its crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the companys growth prospects While comparing the current values of a companys valuation multiples such as price-to-earnings (P/E) price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF) with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued overvalued or undervalued comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stocks price As part of the Zacks Style Scores system the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on) making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued rightly valued or temporarily undervalued Tesla is graded D on this front indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade Conclusion The facts discussed here and much other information on Zackscom might help determine whether or not its worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Tesla However its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Why Its Not Time to Hit the Breaks on TSLA Stock Just Yet","1/28/2024","https://investorplace.com/market360/2024/01/hold-on-why-its-not-time-to-hit-the-breaks-on-tsla-stock-just-yet/","Countdown to Luke Lango’s “2nd Trillion-Dollar AI Trade” The US govt just unlocked an $8 trillion market to move in a new direction See how it could unleash 6000% potential upside Theres no need to ditch TSLA stock following this slide Advertisement Source: Arina P Habich / Shutterstockcom As you may know Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock was trending lower ahead of this week’s quarterly earnings release But instead of shares surging back upon the unveiling of positive surprises/”less bad” results the market reacted negatively to the company’s latest financials and to updates to guidance provided by CEO Elon Musk Still even as shares have experienced a post-earnings sell-off and said sell-off could morph into a continued slide in the near-term that’s not necessarily a reason to bail on this EV winnerAs I’ll explain below there is a path back to higher prices based upon more positive news/developments also recently revealed On Jan 24 Tesla announced earnings for the quarter ending Dec 31 2023 For the quarter revenue came in at $251 billion representing a 3% increase from the prior year’s quarter Non-GAAP earnings per share came in at 71 cents down 40% year-over-year These numbers came in slightly below sell-side forecasts but that’s not the main reason TSLA stock tanked to the tune of 121% the first trading day following the earnings report Rather this double-digit sell-off resulted from discouraging guidance from CEO Musk As Barron’s reported Jan 25 Musk stated that vehicle volume growth “may be notably lower” in 2024 compared to 2023 For reference Tesla increased its vehicle delivery volume by 38% last year Even as the market has expected a growth slowdown Musk’s concurring rather than assuaging of growth concerns was not what the market wanted to hear Although there could be a silver lining (lower expectations about growth may mean Tesla feels less pressure to cut vehicle prices in order to meet delivery guidance) it’s still very possible that this slowdown in demand growth is coupled with further weakness with margins/profitability Admittedly with TSLA stock sporting a rich forward earnings multiple (548) It goes without saying that the prospect of slowing growth is not a good sign As you know while the market may pay up for growth it’s apt to punish growth stocks that enter a slowdown period With this in mind I wouldn’t rule out the possibility that the TSLA slide carries on The extent of the potential share decline is uncertain Positives such as the expected lowering of interest rates later this year could help soften the blow Instead of making a full retreat to the stock’s late 2022 multi-year low (a little over $100 per share) a move back down to $150 or $125 per share Yet while even this price forecast suggests that the best course of action is to sell/avoid now this may not fully be the case Sure if you’ve yet to buy taking your time is likely a wise move If you currently own TSLA however the catalysts I hinted at above (including one connected to interest rates) should give you good reason to stay put in your positions Similar to what played out between late 2022 and early 2023 between now and later this year Tesla could go back to full charge once again If interest rates do indeed start coming down that’s great news for the company not just the stock Lower rates could help fuel a rebound in EV demand growth Along with his downbeat remarks about 2024 Musk also hinted that a growth re-acceleration could kick off starting in 2025 According to a Reuters exclusive 2025 may also be the year Tesla launches its much-awaited mass market EV model The launch of this vehicle for now codenamed “Redwood” could help the company get back into high-growth mode With such promising potential catalysts on the horizon

Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a companys business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision Earnings Estimate Revisions Here at Zacks we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a companys future earnings over anything else Thats because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account When earnings estimates for a company go up the fair value for its stock goes up as well And when a stocks fair value is higher than its current market price investors tend to buy the stock resulting in its price moving upward Because of this empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements Tesla is expected to post earnings of $073 per share for the current quarter representing a year-over-year change of -387% Over the last 30 days the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged The consensus earnings estimate of $316 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -224% This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days For the next fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $389 indicates a change of +23% from what Tesla is expected to report a year ago Over the past month the estimate has changed -11% With an impressive externally audited track record our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stocks near-term price performance as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate along with three other factors related to earnings estimates has resulted in a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) for Tesla The chart below shows the evolution of the companys forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate: 12 Month EPS Revenue Growth Forecast Even though a companys earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues Its almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods Therefore knowing a companys potential revenue growth is crucial In the case of Tesla the consensus sales estimate of $2578 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +6% The $9752 billion and $11775 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +197% and +207% respectively Last Reported Results and Surprise History Tesla reported revenues of $2335 billion in the last reported quarter representing a year-over-year change of +88% EPS of $066 for the same period compares with $105 a year ago Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2438 billion the reported revenues represent a surprise of -423% The EPS surprise was -833% Over the last four quarters Tesla surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period Valuation Without considering a stocks valuation no investment decision can be efficient In predicting a stocks future price performance its crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the companys growth prospects Comparing the current value of a companys valuation multiples such as its price-to-earnings (P/E) price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF) to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued overvalued or undervalued whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system) which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on) is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued rightly valued or temporarily undervalued Tesla is graded F on this front indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade Bottom Line The facts discussed here and much other information on Zackscom might help determine whether or not its worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Tesla However its Zacks Rank #5 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

300,"Elon Musk 13G Filing Explained: Did Elon Musk Buy More Tesla Shares?","2/15/2024","https://dataconomy.com/2024/02/15/elon-musk-13g-filing-explained/","Elon Musk 13G filings are significant events for investors to track as they indicate substantial ownership changes by the influential CEO of Tesla and other tech companies These filings not only reveal Musk’s investment moves but can also significantly impact market dynamics Musk who recently sent a new filing to the SEC caused a sudden movement in Tesla stocks So did Elon Musk really buy new Tesla stocks? What does this filing mean to investors? What is the reason for the sudden rise in stocks? Here’s a breakdown of what you need to know about Elon Musk 13G filings When an investor acquires over 5% of a publicly traded company’s shares they must file a Schedule 13G with the SEC within 10 days The 13G form discloses the investor’s identity their share purchase size ownership percentage and a statement of investment intent (passive or activist) Elon Musk has a history of using 13G filings when taking sizable ownership positions in companies Elon Musk’s significant investments are often seen as bullish indicators signaling to investors that he sees value and potential in the company This investor confidence can spark additional interest in the stock pushing share prices up However uncertainty about Musk’s long-term goals especially if a filing initially indicates a passive investment intent can lead to market fluctuations Additionally other investors often follow Musk’s moves buying the same stocks and further amplifying the filing’s effect on the market In February 2024 Tesla issued a 13G revealing Musk’s 205% ownership stake as of December 31 2023 Despite his existing large ownership position this triggered a small jump in stock price Previously in a May 2023 filing Musk’s ownership stood at around 13% The recent filing gained significance due to a Delaware judge’s ruling regarding a void compensation plan that affected Musk’s stock options Investors considered the potential impact of this decision on Musk’s future share ownership and control of the company But what does Elon Musk 13G filing mean for the investors? Sawyer Merritt explains: Elon didnt buy any shares He owns the same amount of Tesla as he did when his 13G filing came out a year ago Elon currently owns ~129% of Tesla outright which amounts to 411 million shares The reported 205% ownership figure includes 304 million stock options that Elon has… https://tco/BnSOef6lDK — Sawyer Merritt (@SawyerMerritt) February 14 2024 To provide context it’s worth briefly outlining recent amendments to SEC rules around 13G filings that impact all investors: Elon Musk’s investments carry significant weight An increase in his ownership of a company can indicate his bullish outlook and increase demand for the stock triggering a price surge The opposite can be true as well so keeping track of these filings is essential Uncertainty is a driving force in the market If Musk’s filing signals passive ownership but there’s doubt about his long-term intentions fluctuations become likely due to speculation as investors try to predict his next move Many investors look to Elon Musk for investment cues So Musk’s moves tend to be mirrored amplifying the market’s reaction to his filings So Elon Musk 13G filings bring both potential opportunities for profit given market reactions and substantial risk since volatility and other investors’ decisions can make price prediction difficult Yet it is safe to say that Elon Musk did not purchase new Tesla shares as the Elon Musk 13G filing is just an indicator of how many shares he already owns Investing carries inherent risks Always do your research and consult with a financial advisor before making any investment decisions A Schedule 13G is a form the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) requires when an investor (individual or group) buys more than 5% of a public company’s stock It’s meant to keep things transparent letting other shareholders and the public know who these big investors are and how much of the company they own Investors have 10 days to file the 13G after buying those shares The 13G filing tells everyone the investor’s name how many shares they bought what percentage of the company they now own and whether they plan to be a passive investor (just owning the stock) or if they want to change how the company runs (which might mean another form called a 13D later) Featured image credit: Austin Ramsey/Unsplash"

Street took a break from rally on Monday with all three major indexes dipping slightly Elon Musk is moving SpaceX after a Delaware judge voided his $55 billion Tesla compensation package Experts dont believe there will be a mass migration out of Delaware because of Musks rhetoric Musks criticism of the judge and Delawares legal system has been dismissed as unfounded Elon Musk has had it with Delaware — but dont expect other corporations to flee the business-friendly state too Musk announced last week SpaceX was relocating from Delaware to Texas along with this warning: If your company is still incorporated in Delaware I recommend moving to another state as soon as possible The move came after a Delaware judge struck down Musks $55 billion Tesla compensation package last month after a shareholder argued in a lawsuit the pay plan was excessive Musk quickly took to X to blame the outcome of the case on the location of Teslas incorporation declaring: Never incorporate your company in the state of Delaware But heres the thing — corporations love Delaware In 2022 over 68% of Fortune 500 companies were incorporated in the state while 79% of US IPOs were registered there Its known as a low-tax and favorable home for businesses with a history of case law that makes the legal landscape more predictable for corporations There will be neither a stampede nor a trickle Lawrence Cunningham an expert on corporate governance and board member of Markel Group and Constellation Software told Fortune of what to expect after Musks warnings There will always be frustrated and delighted customers in Delaware All of this is both familiar and desirable Musk also specifically went after the judge who ruled to void his pay package Kathleen McCormick calling her an activist and politician in an X post It wasnt Musks first brush up with Delaware or even McCormick who also thwarted the billionaire in 2022 when he tried to back out of his $44 billion Twitter purchase But like his complaints against the state legal experts The Washington Post spoke with dismissed his criticisms of McCormick too describing her as a tough but fair jurist who has won the respect of the

courts told the outlet They get wrapped up and star-struck Not McCormick She is clear-eyed as ever and willing to take the slings and arrows that she knows will come with making a tough ruling The legal experts also told the Post her ruling on the pay package was well-reasoned in line with precedent and unlikely to spook other business leaders I dont expect a mass migration of firms from Delaware Michal Barzuza a professor at the University of Virginia who researches corporate law and governance told the Post Uncharted waters are not lawyers favorite places to swim generally speaking No general counsel in their right mind is going to recommend that the company wing it in a state with very little case law John Coates a law and economics professor at Harvard told Fortune it wasnt even the first time theres been angry calls for businesses to leave the state Over the past 100 years Delaware has periodically irritated one or two executives by enforcing the law and even led some prominent lawyers to call for companies to move elsewhere from time to time Coates said So despite Musks latest crusade against the state it seems unlikely many other Delaware-based corporations will

Sectors","2/4/2024","https://www.tekedia.com/teslas-bitcoin-strategy-is-bold-with-implications-for-ev-and-cryptocurrency-sectors/","DD MM YYYY CATEGORIES PAGES DD MM YYYY FACEBOOK TWITTER GOOGLE+ RSS FACEBOOK TWITTER GOOGLE+ RSS CATEGORIES PAGES Tesla the world’s leading electric vehicle manufacturer has recently announced that it has invested $15 billion in Bitcoin the most popular cryptocurrency and that it plans to accept Bitcoin as a payment method for its products in the near future This move has sent shockwaves across both the automotive and the crypto industries as it signals a major endorsement of Bitcoin’s potential and value by one of the most innovative and influential companies in the world But Tesla’s Bitcoin strategy is not just about making a profit or diversifying its portfolio It is also about aligning its vision and mission with the principles and values of the cryptocurrency community such as decentralization transparency security and sustainability Tekedia Mini-MBA edition 14 (June 3 – Sept 2 2024) begins registrations; get massive discounts with early registration here Tekedia AI in Business Masterclass opens registrations here Join Tekedia Capital Syndicate and invest in Africa’s finest startups here By embracing Bitcoin Tesla is not only tapping into a new and growing market of crypto enthusiasts but also fostering a culture of innovation and collaboration that can benefit both the electric vehicle and the cryptocurrency sectors One of the possible benefits of Tesla’s Bitcoin strategy is that it can stimulate more research and development on how to integrate blockchain technology the underlying infrastructure of cryptocurrencies with electric vehicles Blockchain technology can offer various advantages for electric vehicles such as enabling peer-to-peer energy trading enhancing vehicle-to-grid communication improving battery management and facilitating smart charging For example a blockchain-based platform could allow electric vehicle owners to sell their excess energy to other users or to the grid creating a decentralized and efficient energy market Alternatively a blockchain-based system could enable electric vehicles to communicate with each other and with charging stations optimizing their energy consumption and reducing their carbon footprint Another possible benefit of Tesla’s Bitcoin strategy is that it can encourage more cooperation and partnership between the electric vehicle and the cryptocurrency sectors Both sectors share a common goal of disrupting the status quo and creating a more sustainable and inclusive future for humanity By working together they can leverage their respective strengths and resources and overcome their challenges and limitations For instance the electric vehicle sector can provide the cryptocurrency sector with more renewable and clean energy sources which are essential for reducing the environmental impact of crypto mining Conversely the cryptocurrency sector can provide the electric vehicle sector with more secure and transparent payment methods which are crucial for enhancing customer trust and satisfaction Tesla’s Bitcoin strategy is a bold and visionary move that may have far-reaching implications for both the electric vehicle and the cryptocurrency sectors By adopting Bitcoin as a legitimate and valuable asset Tesla is not only increasing its profitability and competitiveness but also inspiring more innovation and collaboration between two of the most dynamic and promising industries of the 21st century Tesla the electric vehicle and clean energy company has announced that it did not sell any of its Bitcoin holdings in the fourth quarter of 2023 This is a significant update as Tesla had previously invested $15 billion in the cryptocurrency in February 2021 and sold 10% of its stake in the first quarter of 2021 Tesla’s CEO Elon Musk has been a vocal supporter of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies often tweeting about them and influencing their prices However he has also faced criticism for his environmental impact as Bitcoin mining consumes a lot of electricity and generates greenhouse gas emissions In May 2021 Musk announced that Tesla would stop accepting Bitcoin as a payment method for its products citing environmental concerns He later said that Tesla would resume accepting Bitcoin when there is more renewable energy used for mining Tesla’s decision to hold on to its Bitcoin in Q4 2023 indicates that the company is confident in the long-term value and potential of the cryptocurrency despite its volatility and regulatory uncertainty It also suggests that Tesla is satisfied with the progress made by the Bitcoin community in reducing its carbon footprint and increasing its energy efficiency According to a recent report by the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance the share of renewable energy sources in the global Bitcoin mining mix increased from 39% in April 2020 to 56% in October 2021 Tesla’s Bitcoin holdings are estimated to be worth around $24 billion as of January 2024 based on the current market price of around $48000 per coin This represents a substantial increase from the initial investment of $15 billion which was worth around $19000 per coin at the time Tesla’s Bitcoin investment has also outperformed its core business of selling electric vehicles as the company reported a net income of $16 billion for the full year 2023 Tesla’s announcement has been well received by the #Bitcoin community as it shows that one of the most influential and innovative companies in the world is still bullish on the cryptocurrency and its future It also sets an example for other corporations and institutions that may be interested in investing in or adopting Bitcoin as a store of value a medium of exchange or a hedge against inflation Tesla’s Bitcoin strategy may also inspire more innovation and collaboration between the electric vehicle and cryptocurrency sectors as both share a common vision of creating a more sustainable and decentralized world Save my name email and website in this browser for the next time I comment Δ © 2024 Tekedia All rights reserved Term &

When Elon Musk is told that $56 billion as a pay package is unfair This at least was the finding by Delaware Court of Chancery by Judge Kathaleen McCormick regarding the spellbinding 2018 compensation package for the planet’s wealthiest human being McCormick and Musk already have inked some judicial history The same judge presided over the Twitter suit against Musk that eventually resulted in him parting with $44 billion to acquire the company that is now sliding into merry decay as the platform X In her sharp ruling daring to “boldly go where no man has gone before” let alone a Delaware court McCormick observed that Tesla a company of Musk’s own creation “bore the burden of proving that the compensation plan was fair and they failed to meet their burden” The question of fairness first arose in 2019 when Tesla shareholder Richard Tornetta filed a suit challenging the validity of the 2018 performance-based equity compensation plan the largest of its type in the history of public markets Tornetta’s primary contention was that Musk was hardly showing much devotion to the carmaker his duties and interests spread as it were across a number of other corporate entities: SpaceX OpenAI Neuralink and the Boring Company Tornetta’s legal team argued that the 2018 package did nothing to focus the billionaire’s interest on Tesla and it followed the interests of its shareholders The agreement for instance made no mention of any such requirements as time allocation “Indeed” reads the lawsuit “Musk testified that since the Grant’s approval he has spent a little more than half his time on Tesla matters and has dedicated substantial time and attention to various other endeavors” The judgment acknowledges that any decision by the board of directors on what to pay a company CEO “is the quintessential business determination subject to great judicial deference” Delaware law however recognised “unique risks inherent in a corporation’s transactions with its controlling stockholder” When it came to dealing with “conflicted-controller transactions” the “presumptive standard review…is entire fairness” Here the defendants proved “unable to prove that the stockholder vote was fully informed because the proxy statement inaccurately described key directors as independent and misleadingly omitted details about the process” Even by the judge’s own reasoning the task left to the defendants was an “unenviable” one and “too tall an order” For the court there were critical problems with the process leading to the approval of the compensation plan The judgment paints a picture of Musk essentially negotiating with himself through devotees flunkeys and friends The adversarial atmosphere was never present; the “controlled mindset” all-powerful The theme of the entrepreneurial God King holding his courtiers in thrall streaks McCormick’s observations Musk for instance maintained “extensive ties with the persons tasked with negotiating on Tesla’s behalf” The chair of the compensation committee Ira Ehrenpreis had known Musk well for 15 years Another member of the same committee Antonio Gracias had an enduring two-decade business relationship with Musk “as well as the sort of personal relationship that had him vacationing with Musk’s family on a regular basis” The entanglements do not stop there There is General Counsel Todd Maron the main negotiating link between the committee and Musk Maron had acted as divorce attorney for Musk and admired him so much he was “moved…to tears during his deposition” With a flawed process things did not get much better with the negotiated price Again the defendants argued that for Tesla to continue to grow Musk’s continued leadership was indispensable Keeping Musk as the main helmsman meant a rise in stockholder value In one estimate offering Musk a chance to increase his ownership of Tesla from 219% to 283% would mean “6% for $600 billion of growth in stockholder value” Such arguments did not convince McCormick Musk already owned 219% of the company when the plan was approved He had every incentive to push the company “to levels of transformative growth” seeing what he stood to gain from it: “$10 billion for every $50 billion in market capitalization increase” The arrangements also came with no conditions on how much time Musk would devote to Tesla “Swept up by the rhetoric of ‘all upside’ or perhaps starry-eyed by Musk’s superstar appeal the board never asked the $558 billion question: Was the plan even necessary for Tesla to retain Musk and achieve its goals?” The answer: plainly not Such observations would have stung and made good the judge’s promise to go where no previous Delaware court had dared tread Here was a punchy assessment about the comfortable clique-ridden tribalism of corporate non-governance Musk riled and ruffled took to the platform X (formerly Twitter) to vent “Never incorporate your company in the state of Delaware” were his words of advice By no means does this end matter Musk is hardly going to be out of pocket nor is he going to leave the company from which he continues to handsomely profit from via stocks he owns Fairness operates in otherworldly dimensions here A new compensation package according to the judge will have to be worked out with Tornetta An appeal is also possible “The judge’s ruling should be a wakeup call (for Tesla shareholders) that things have gotten out of hand” remarks Andrew Poreda who also invests in Tesla through exchange-traded funds In this overgrown corporate jungle it is questionable whether things were ever really in hand If youre interested in writing for International Policy Digest - please send us an email via submissions@intpolicydigestorg We are using cookies to give you the best experience on our website You can find out more about which cookies we are using or switch them off in settings This website uses cookies so that we can provide you with the best user experience possible Cookie information is stored in your browser and performs functions such as recognising you when you return to our website and helping our team to understand which sections of the website you find most interesting and useful Strictly Necessary Cookie should be enabled at all times so that we can save your preferences for cookie settings If you disable this cookie we will not be able to save your preferences This means that every time you visit this website you will need to enable or disable cookies again More information about our Cookie Policy"

326,"Tesla Volvo Car pause output as Red Sea shipping crisis deepens","1/12/2024","https://finance.yahoo.com/news/exclusive-tesla-berlin-suspend-most-202020861.html","By Victoria Waldersee Anna Ringstrom and Marie Mannes BERLIN/STOCKHOLM (Reuters) -Automakers Tesla and Geely-owned Volvo Car said they were suspending some production in Europe due to a shortage of components the first clear sign that attacks on shipping in the Red Sea are hitting manufacturers in the region The United States and Britain launched a series of strikes on Yemen on Thursday aimed at the Iran-backed Houthi militia whose attacks on international shipping have disrupted one of the worlds most important shipping routes Container shipping rates jumped further this week as concerns grew that vessels carrying everything from clothes to phones and car batteries will have to avoid the Suez Canal the fastest route between Asia and Europe for longer than expected The biggest supply chain upheaval since the COVID-19 pandemic risks derailing the global economic recovery while higher freight and oil prices could reignite inflation The canal accounts for about 12% of global container traffic Late on Thursday Tesla told Reuters it will suspend most car production at its factory near Berlin from Jan 29 to Feb 11 citing a lack of components after many ships were re-routed around the southern tip of Africa The armed conflicts in the Red Sea and the associated shifts in transport routes between Europe and Asia via the Cape of Good Hope are having an impact on production in Gruenheide a Tesla statement said The considerably longer transportation times are creating a gap in supply chains It did not say what components were delayed arriving at the factory where it assembles electric vehicles for sale in Europe Volvo Car which is majority-owned by Chinas Geely said it will pause output at its plant in Ghent in Belgium for three days next week due to a delayed delivery of gearboxes Some tanker operators have ceased traversing the Red Sea following the US and British air strikes on Yemens Houthis as regional conflict stemming from Israels war in Gaza widens Adding to the logistical headaches hampering trade low water levels due to drought have reduced crossings of the Panama Canal another key maritime trade route FALL-OUT Shipping giants such as Maersk and Hapag-Lloyd have been sending their vessels on the longer more expensive journeys around Africa Last Friday Maersk said it expects the re-routing which adds about 10 days and around $1 million in extra fuel to a journey from Asia to Northern Europe to last for the foreseeable future Both companies on Friday welcomed moves to improve security for shipping in the region but did not say if Thursdays strikes would make a difference Many companies including Geely Chinas second-largest automaker by sales Swedish home furnishing company IKEA and British clothes retailer Next have warned of potential delays to deliveries of goods US retailers Target and Tractor Supply are also facing delays Target faces some delays on items from India and Pakistan which are big apparel suppliers though most imported merchandise comes across the Pacific and is not affected a source said Colin Yankee chief supply chain officer at Tractor Supply said there were delays of two to more than 20 days on some products although spring merchandise is mostly in or will be soon With the Panama Canal restricting daily trips extended transit times and costs with moving around Africa and the International Longshoremens Association contract expiring in Fall of 2024 we see the potential for volume that was moving from Asia to the US East Coast to shift to the US West Coast throughout the year he said by email Some retailers are stocking up before Chinas Lunar New Year holiday and seeking air or rail alternatives in a scramble to avoid empty shelves in the northern hemisphere spring If the Red Sea disruption lasts another two to three weeks I expect to see product shortages on shelves in April and May said Seth Frederickson vice president of Product Management at FourKites Other automakers could also suffer shortages from the Red Sea conflict said Sam Fiorani of AutoForecast Solutions which tracks automotive supply chains and production It cant be believed that theyre alone only the first to reflect the issue Tesla shares fell 37% in New York trade and Volvo Car fell 28% in Stockholm Stellantis said it has seen almost no impact on manufacturing and has used air freight in limited instances BMW Volkswagen and Renault said on Friday production was not affected But EU carmakers rely heavily on Asia for EV supplies The region accounted for 67% of EU imports of components for EV batteries in the 12 months to Sept 30 and just over two thirds of lithium ion batteries shipments according to S&P Market Intelligence data Carmakers and analysts in Europe have warned in recent months that EV sales were not growing as fast as hoped with some companies cutting prices in an attempt to boost demand (Reporting by Victoria Waldersee in Berlin and Anna Ringstrom and Marie Mannes in Stockholm; Additional

after Tesla announced price cuts for its Model 3 and Model Y cars in China The company has reduced prices for its cars aggressively in China over the past year or so undercutting local competitor BYD

affected by disruptions in the Red Sea after the Iran-backed Houthis group launched attacks on ships traversing the key route wreaking havoc on global trade and drawing international criticism As a

330,"Tesla Is It Time To Hit The Investment Brakes On This Stock? (NASDAQ:TSLA)","1/18/2024","https://seekingalpha.com/article/4663610-tesla-is-it-time-to-hit-investment-brakes-on-tsla-stock","sshepard/iStock Unreleased via Getty Images sshepard/iStock Unreleased via Getty Images There are a lot of good things to say about Tesla They single-handedly brought electric vehicles (EVs) into the mainstream Elon Musk took a huge chance and won on Tesla The car industry went from questioning the legitimacy of electric to it being mandated from state to state Its been more than 20 years since its founding and more than 13 years since its IPO Many are unaware but Elon was not the original founder of Tesla but did invest in 2004 From its founding to present day there were plenty of leadership changes financial close calls and innovations But there are more and more challenges facing the EV market as a whole; early adopters are running out EVs are dying in the cold and consumer tastes are turning towards hybrids In the face of these challenges Tesla has taken action they have cut pricing on their models globally as has been widely reported They have signed agreements with other automakers like Honda GM Ford and many others to use their NACS charging standard going forward This standardization will only help spur demand for EVs across all brands Tesla has also had a great deal of success with their Energy Storage Business For those who may not be familiar the energy generation and storage business sells and installs solar panels for homes and energy storage products for commercial residential and electric utility power grids Sales growth from this business segment has been impressive but a very small part of their overall revenue As of the 3rd quarter of 2023 it represented just over 6% of total revenue Now with all of the good that Tesla has done lets look at some of the real world challenges they face Supply of early adopters are diminishing The early adopters-the ones flush with cash and on the look out to signal to everyone that they are on the cutting edge-are drying up The market is transitioning to people that value practical and lower costs The idea for the graph below relates to the book “Crossing the Chasm” by Geoffrey Moore It talks about the challenges faced when transitioning from early adopters and innovators to the majority of people that are more practical in their outlook One of the big challenges Tesla and other EV makers are going to face is the pricing of these EVs The 2023 Tesla Model 3 is the cheapest Tesla car currently available The base rear-wheel drive (RWD) model has a starting price of $40240 MSRP Now lets compare that to other car models that are more “affordable” as rated by Autotrader: We can see there is a big pricing difference Why does price matter? Technology Adoption lifecycle (Mediumcom) Technology Adoption lifecycle (Mediumcom) Well you can see the income difference in Early Adopters and the general public when you look at the incomes of people who have purchased Teslas so far and the rest of the population Currently the average household income of new Tesla owners is $150000 and “as a comparison the real median household income in the United States in 2022 was $74580”: Hedges & Company If EV makers want to target the rest of the population they need to make their cars cheaper Not just cheaper to buy but cheaper to keep on the road There have been a few articles online mentioning huge battery replacement costs Battery replacements can be ridiculously expensive and scary! Prices can range from anywhere between $5000 to $20000 to replace a battery as has been reported by CarBuzz Now this all depends on make and model but when I look online they all seem to come on the higher end of these estimates and some ridiculously more! The same article went on to say that Nissan Leaf’s battery replacements should be around $5500 to replace but some owners are reporting closer to $19000 Also one Tesla owner faced a $15799 repair bill in 2020 after his Model 3 required a new battery The battery itself cost $13500 and the other $200000 went towards labor All these reports and articles can be easily found online by prospective customers The Canadian website Drivingca recently wrote about one driver that was quoted 50000 CAD or close to 38000 USD in todays exchange rates to replace a battery in this 2017 Hyundai! What sane consumer would buy a used EV for $25000 knowing when they are out of warranty they may face a similar cost to replace just the battery? In America federal law mandates that manufacturers offer at least eight years or 100000 mile warranties on EV batteries but what do you do when it runs out? After a warranty expires you have to pay for the replacement yourself! If a consumer needs to pay $20000 for a replacement battery after only 100000 miles that will scare away a lot of price-conscious customers We know they are price conscious since they are looking at used EVs General reliability issues can be an issue with EVs On top of this as reported by Reuters a 2023 Consumer Reports found new EVs had 79% more problems than traditional gasoline-powered cars “Even with monumental shifts in the auto marketplace what matters most to consumers remains the same: finding safe reliable cars” said Marta L Tellado CEO of Consumer Reports and this latest 2023 report The Consumer Reports goes on to say: “The growing pains that have been plaguing EVs are still apparent in CR’s latest survey Electric cars electric SUVs and electric pickups all rank among the least-reliable vehicle categories Tesla Motors the market leader in EV sales continues to have issues with body hardware paint and trim and climate system on its models but are not as problematic for motor charging and battery At number 14 Tesla is the second-highest ranked domestic automaker in CR’s brand rankings The Model 3 and Model Y have average reliability while all the other Tesla models–the S and X–are all below average” Secondary market for EVs is bleak As one Fortune Magazine article headline read recently “No one wants to buy used EVs and they’re piling up in weed-infested graveyards” Why do I bring up used EVs well if you can’t sell your old EV when you want to then youre going to hesitate to buy a new EV in the first place A recent article from Forbes highlights dropping demand over the last year for used cars in general and EVs in particular; “used EV prices are down 337 percent while the average used combustion car price is only down 51 percent” These price drops can be corroborated with the time spent trying to sell used EVs Used EVs take the longest to sell right now while they were one of the quickest categories to sell just 1 year ago When car dealers know they are going to sit on certain cars for longer like EVs they are forced to offer less for those cars Used car sales data (iSeeCars) Used car sales data (iSeeCars) Survey reveals consumer preference for hybrid cars over pure EVs A few years ago there was a surge of battery plant investment announcements from automakers It was like every automaker was either investing billions of dollars or euros into a battery plants or they were signing cooperative agreements with rivals to build new plants or tech As the surge of early adopters is coming to an end the rest of the market seems to be hesitant on fully electric EVs If you talk to most people you know they like the idea of EVs a very progressing choice almost like what we were promised in the TV show The Jetsons But when you ask those same people why they have not gotten one yet you will often hear: too expensive don’t want my life to revolve around me charging my car fear if they actually go on a road trip they won’t have a place to charge it These are all reasonable objections A lot of these concerns have been echoed in an AP article recently and in other news articles as well The AP article goes on to mention that many feel hybrids have many of the same advantages of EVs but alleviate many of their concerns regarding charging resale market long trips and so on With more and more people openly preferring hybrids over fully electric EVs I think Tesla will have their margins squeezed Tesla valuation concerns With all the traditional automakers offering some kind of fully electric EV and offering hybrid versions of their standard gasoline cars I don’t see how Tesla can keep on growing at phenomenal rates You can see from the table below that their growth is slowing down Data from ZackscomData from Zackscom Data from Zackscom Data from Zackscom You can see in the table above recent quarterly sales from Tesla When you look at the quarterly data it looks like sales for Tesla have already started to plateau If this is the case maybe Tesla has already entered the mature company phase You can see that revenue is stable and if you just add up the last 4 quarters it comes out to 96 billion in revenue that would make it only a 17% increase from last year When we look at valuing Tesla common formula like Justified P/E P/S and P/B don’t work since they all need a dividend to be paid We are going to need to approach this valuation by comparing ratios and deciding how long their super-fast growth rates can continue I do believe Tesla under the leadership of Musk can be one of the fastest-growing car companies in the future; but will it be growing 2x as fast as its comparable competitors? I don’t think it can grow 2x as fast into perpetuity that just defies economics when you have similar products and plenty of competition Lets not forget that Tesla is only electric people are pushing for hybrids When I was looking at the sales growth data from just 2 years ago I was expecting to add a few years of above average growth to my forecast and then discount the value back to the present but it looks like Tesla has already hit normal market growth Zackscom and YahooFinance!Data from Zackscom Zackscom and YahooFinance! Data from Zackscom For my estimate of yearly sales the revenue over the last few quarters has been stable I might as well just add the last 4 quarters and assume this is what the total will be for 2023 This may seem like a simple approach but my numbers here are not to develop a precise income per share estimate but rather to see if Tesla is reasonably valued under or overvalued or grossly under or overvalued When I look at the numbers I’m starting to think Tesla is grossly overvalued Its hard to envision a case for super-fast growth anymore with early adopters running out and consumers becoming more conscious of issues (problems) that arise with pure EV ownership Even when you compare Tesla’s valuation to Toyota and Honda which have similar 3-5 year earnings growth estimates Tesla is vastly more expensive At the end of the day whether youre selling rubber tires computers or cars that are basically large computers running on rubber tires; its all about earnings and the future growth of those earnings Conclusion I dont see the case for Tesla’s current valuation and I don’t see the case for Tesla’s continued supercharged growth The competition in the car market for EVs is only increasing and consumer sentiment is only shifting toward hybrids If you take a look at the valuations of traditional car companies using P/S the average P/S is 04 and the highest P/S comes from Toyota at 093 I split the difference between the average and Toyota and picked 07 You can see just from P/S how much more expensive Tesla is When it comes to reliability even this week-after a large snowstorm in the Midwest-we get a headline from Fox that reads “Chicago-area Tesla charging stations lined with dead cars in freezing cold” Don’t get me wrong I’m not a detractor of Elon Musk’s vision I will be the first in line to buy an IPO of Starlink or SpaceX if they ever come to market Tesla has also made some quality cars like the one written about in this motor1com article which has surpassed 12 million miles; yes miles not kilometers But as you read this article pay attention to some of a “small” details: Most people in the west don’t have time to orientate their lives around their cars charging schedule; we are busy enough as it is This is why I don’t recommend a purchase of Tesla stock I see too many headwinds affecting their sales growth and stock price This article was written by Analyst’s Disclosure: I/we have no stock option or similar derivative position in any of the companies mentioned and no plans to initiate any such positions within the next 72 hours I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha) I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Seeking Alphas Disclosure: Past performance is no guarantee of future results No recommendation or advice is being given as to whether any investment is suitable for a particular investor Any views or opinions expressed above may not reflect those of Seeking Alpha as a whole Seeking Alpha is not a licensed securities dealer broker or US investment adviser or investment bank Our analysts are third party authors that include both professional investors and individual investors who may not be licensed or certified by any institute or regulatory body"

Not quite While now is not an ideal time to initiate or add to a position a stronger opportunity to do so could arrive later this year To find out why let’s take a closer look and see what’s the best move with Tesla before the Q4 2023 earnings report hits the street Post-market on Jan 24 Tesla will release results for Q4 and the full year 2023 With the EV maker releasing its delivery numbers for the respective periods at the start of this month the market has a general idea of how Tesla’s top line will come in For the quarter and year deliveries came in at 484507 and 1808 million vehicles respectively For the full year deliveries increased 38% compared to 2023 Yet while that may sound promising for the earning release keep in mind that all eyes will be on the earnings themselves along with guidance updates A big reason for the rising bearishness about TSLA stock right now are concerns about the impact of the company’s continued slashing of vehicle prices on margins and profitability With this it makes sense that 12 out of 18 analysts have made downward revisions to their Q4 earnings forecasts in the past 90 days Given the current mood of the market for EV stocks instead of the market reacting positively to bold statements from CEO Elon Musk investors are more likely to focus on one/several negative aspects of the release using them as justification to sell Beyond it being not definite that TSLA stock will tumble or tank post-earnings it’s hard to pinpoint the extent in which shares could reverse course if concerns about slowing growth and a further margin squeeze keep on building The market’s overall direction will of course play a role as well Investors remain bullish about a “Fed pivot” or a lowering of interest rates by the Federal Reserve later this year However excitement about this cooled down earlier this month and could cool down again If that happens it could hurt the valuations of growth stocks like TSLA However there is a silver lining is Tesla slides another 25% 30% even 50% from here At lower price levels the stock (richly priced today at 667 times forward earnings) could sink down to a more-than-reasonable valuation From there after riding out today’s challenge the company and its shares could make a tremendous comeback In the near-term as economic conditions normalize and growth for Tesla could re-accelerate A renewed “EV boom” may also help Tesla improve its margins On a longer time frame assuming two milestones are achieved there is TSLA to experience another period of turbocharged price appreciation The two key milestones for Tesla are the bringing of autonomous driving capability and a low-priced vehicle to market There is still high uncertainty over whether the company can deliver on its autonomous driving promises but considering its track record I wouldn’t say this possible catalyst is completely off the table Being able to sell this feature would bode well for market shares as well as margins/profitability Bringing the low-priced Model 2 to market might enable Tesla to increase its share of the overall automotive market The resultant impact on growth/profitability could in turn justify a move back to the stock’s split-adjusted all-time high (over $400 per share) and beyond While I wouldn’t fight the trend long-time TSLA stock investors do not need to bail If you’ve looking to add exposure keep an eye out and be ready to pounce following a severe sell-off On the date of publication Thomas Niel did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer subject to the InvestorPlacecom Publishing Guidelines Thomas Niel contributor for InvestorPlacecom has been writing single-stock analysis for web-based publications since 2016 Consumer Discretionary Automotive Electric Vehicles Article printed from InvestorPlace Media https://investorplacecom/2024/01/tesla-earnings-preview-is-it-time-to-accelerate-or-pump-the-brakes-on-tsla-stock/ ©2024 InvestorPlace Media LLC Stocks to Buy Stocks to Buy Todays Market Stocks to Buy Todays Market Stocks to Buy Crypto & Blockchain Stocks to Buy Financial Market Data powered by FinancialContent Services Inc All rights reserved Nasdaq quotes delayed at least 15 minutes all others at least 20 minutes Copyright © 2024 InvestorPlace Media LLC All rights reserved 1125 N Charles St Baltimore MD 21201 Not Yet a Premium Subscriber?

Lango’s “2nd Trillion-Dollar AI Trade” The US govt just unlocked an $8 trillion market to move in a new direction See how it could unleash 6000% potential upside The EV market leader could yet again disprove its skeptics in 2024 Advertisement Source: Arina P Habich / Shutterstockcom Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock ended 2023 on a high note The EV market leader reported record vehicle deliveries for the year (1808 million) representing a 38% increase compared to 2022 The stock ended the year up by triple-digits That was fantastic news for those who bought in when sentiment was at its most bearish last winter For TSLA’s longtime skeptics this is a horrendous turn of events Contrary to bearish predictions this high-flying stock remained unaffected by factors like inflation interest rates and competition Despite challenges Tesla may prove its skeptics wrong in the new year However whether that means you should buy and hang tight today is another question entirely Tesla stock remains far from its past all-time high As you may recall during the height of “EV stock mania” in 2021 TSLA reached prices north of $400 per share In hindsight one can argue that shares went up too far too fast two years ago That said thanks to several catalysts TSLA stock could make a big leap back towards near its high-water mark For one if the much-awaited pivot on interest rates by the Federal Reserve ends up taking shape this year this may have a tremendous impact on re-accelerating electric vehicle demand growth in the US Also over in China the world’s largest EV market and home to Tesla’s largest production facility government stimulus efforts could indirectly boost EV demand Demand has been affected by China’s weak post-Covid recovery A demand resurgence may help counter a key headwind for Tesla (rising local competition) That’s not all The hitting of new milestones with its autonomous driving technology is something else that would drive further gains for TSLA So too would any progress with Tesla’s efforts to bring a low-priced EV to market as InvestorPlace’s Thomas Niel argued last month Several factors could make 2024 a strong year for TSLA stock Proceed with caution More share volatility could come soon TSLA ended 2023 on a high note because of the market’s strong performance Stocks especially growth stocks rallied during November and December thanks to optimism about the aforementioned possible “Fed pivot” However doubts about when this pivot will happen (or even if it will happen at all this year) could be creeping back up This could result in a rocky stock market and another short-term move lower for TSLA Beyond negative price moves driven by the broad market’s movements/macro news concerns about Tesla itself may also drive a sharp pullback for shares For instance as I discussed last week negative news about the Cybertruck could dampen bullishness for TSLA When Tesla next releases earnings on Jan 24 investors may look to certain aspects of the earnings report (such as further margin declines or less-stellar full-year sales outlook) as excuses to bail on the stock With all this in mind in contrast to last year TSLA’s price performance could experience a rough start Tesla’s long-term prospects remain fairly bright Morgan Stanley analysts suggest diversifying into self-driving technology licensing and high-margin products/services for potential earnings growth of 27% between now and 2030 If this bull case pans out shares still have considerable room to run This suggests holding onto a TSLA position if it’s currently in your portfolio It also suggests eventually adding some to your portfolio if you don’t already own it but bear in mind there’s no rush to do so In short as much could knock it lower before it surges even higher wait for weakness before initiating/adding to a TSLA stock position TSLA stock earns a B rating in Portfolio Grader On the date of publication neither Louis Navellier nor the InvestorPlace

market research firm Canalys expects EVs will have made up around 40 percent of those exports Beijing has poured billions of dollars and immense resources into EV manufacturing and BYD—which stands for “Build Your Dreams”—has been one of its foremost champions “The government in China went all in on EVs” said Erica Downs an expert in Chinese energy markets at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy “This was an industry that they wanted to develop and they made sure that they had the different building blocks needed for success in place—so there were subsidies to EV manufacturers; there were subsidies to EV buyers; and they’ve been working on making sure there is adequate charging infrastructure” That strategy has long rattled Washington and Brussels where tech competition with Beijing dominates foreign-policy concerns and policymakers fear that an influx of Chinese-made vehicles could strain their domestic markets To curb China’s technological advancement in strategic sectors such as semiconductors and artificial intelligence Washington has imposed export controls and unveiled new legislation such as the Inflation Reduction Act aimed at strengthening domestic capabilities and attracting more manufacturing to US shores Under the Biden administration boosting the US EV sector has been a key prong of that strategy Worried about China’s EV exports Washington is reportedly mulling hiking up tariffs on Chinese EVs the Wall Street Journal reported in December; they already face a 25 percent tariff “There’s real concern in the United States about having Chinese EVs come into the market and dominate and put domestic producers at a disadvantage” Downs said Similar fears have also swept the European Union which launched an investigation into Chinese EV subsidies last fall as concerns grew over Beijing’s EV ambitions Over the last three years Beijing’s global EV exports have soared by a stunning 851 percent—with the bulk of the cars going to Europe Brussels’s probe which is still ongoing could result in additional tariffs on Chinese exports “Global markets are now flooded with cheaper Chinese electric cars” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen declared when the probe was first announced “And their price is kept artificially low by huge state subsidies” Beijing has two key advantages in its quest to lead the global EV race One is the sheer size of its own sector: China is home to the world’s biggest automotive market by both manufacturing output and annual sales The industry is only set to grow with the country’s domestic production projected to soar to 35 million vehicles by 2025 according to the US Commerce Department Eager to harness this market even Tesla has spent billions of dollars building a “gigafactory” in Shanghai where it produced more than half of its cars in 2022 Other legacy companies such as Volkswagen and Volvo have also made major investments and even entered into joint ventures with Chinese counterparts which in turn has helped China enhance its own carmaking chops “You have to be there to capture the market It’s very hard to decouple” said Xiaomeng Lu a director in the Eurasia Group’s geotechnology practice “It just defies logic for them not to be there and I think that’s why this particular sector is kind of the glue among the European companies American companies and the Chinese market” The second advantage is China’s grip on global battery supply chains After a decades-long push Beijing overwhelmingly commands the supply chains for the critical minerals powering EV batteries and other clean energy technologies including graphite lithium and cobalt That dominance is particularly pronounced with rare earths the powerful elements underpinning offshore wind turbines missile guidance systems and much more In the rare-earth sector 85 percent of processing and 92 percent of magnet production are currently controlled by China “Right now Europe and the United States aren’t even in the game when it comes to rare earths battery cell manufacturing rare-earth mining and refining” said Tu Le the managing director of the consultancy Sino Auto Insights BYD is a prime example of how Chinese companies have leveraged these dynamics to gain an important edge Before emerging as an EV giant the Chinese firm was primarily a battery manufacturer and it still makes its own batteries—a background that has given it a deep expertise and major leg up in the global EV market “They have a real competitive advantage there” said Colin McKerracher the head of transport and automotive analysis at BloombergNEF “Not only do they have a cost advantage from the vertical integration that they have by both making the batteries and the vehicles but they are also making better batteries than a lot of the other groups out there just in terms of cost and in terms of performance and safety” And while market power and rare-earth dominance both constitute levers that China could pull to make life difficult for Western companies its own slumping economy means it would take a significant emergency for Beijing to break that glass “The Chinese economy is weaker so I think really exerting force would probably alienate countries that they’re really trying to build bridges with” Le said The interconnectedness of the global automotive supply chain also means that it’s hard to cut off access without unpredictable global knock-on effects that could hurt everyone “I think [the Chinese] realize that if they take out the big hammer they’re going to hit themselves in the foot” said Lu of the Eurasia Group The big question now facing BYD is one that eventually comes for all successful Chinese firms: Can it parlay its domestic success into global dominance? The company has already made inroads in cost-sensitive markets such as India and Southeast Asia and will look to expand further if it isn’t stymied by Western protectionism and concerns around Chinese tech A battle with Tesla is shaping up here as well—both companies are seeking manufacturing expansions around the world with BYD announcing new factories in Hungary and Brazil while Tesla has announced a new facility in Mexico and is reportedly mulling an India expansion Things could get more complicated if countries are forced to pick sides “Even if there are major tariff barriers erected in developed-country markets BYD’s product portfolio means that it can expand significantly in developing-country markets where its supply chain vertical integration gives it some major cost advantages” said Paul Triolo a China analyst and tech policy lead at the Albright Stonebridge Group Tesla’s heavy dependence on China paradoxically could end up evening the scales “There’s risk with having 52 percent of my manufacturing come from one place” said Le of Sino Auto Insights “Maybe that balances out or zeroes out the growth that BYD has outside of China” For now however experts say the immediate geopolitical impact of BYD’s latest achievement will largely be limited to a major public relations victory for China The electric car race is somewhat analogous to the smartphone industry with Apple and South Korea’s Samsung duking it out at the top and everyone else trying to catch up “I don’t think there’s any real risk here for US competitiveness The US has Tesla; China has BYD They’re the two leading EV companies in the world” McKerracher said “They are so far ahead of everyone else that it’s not like either of those are being left behind” Rishi Iyengar is a reporter at Foreign Policy Twitter: @Iyengarish Christina Lu is a reporter at Foreign Policy Twitter: @christinafei Commenting on this and other recent articles is just one benefit of a Foreign Policy subscription Already a subscriber?

346,"None","1/9/2024","https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-lowers-range-estimates-u-154352348.html","By Norihiko Shirouzu (Reuters) -Tesla has lowered driving-range estimates across its lineup of electric vehicles as a new US government vehicle-testing regulation takes effect with the goal of ensuring that automakers accurately reflect real-world performance Tesla has historically issued range estimates that overstate what its cars can deliver prompting widespread complaints from customers according to some automotive testing experts and a Reuters investigation last year Reuters reported in July that the automaker about a decade ago rigged the algorithm that controls in-dash range estimates in Tesla vehicles to give rosy projections of how far owners can drive before needing to recharge The story also found the automaker created a secret team in 2022 to suppress thousands of driving-range complaints and cancel owners range-related service appointments Tesla later disclosed in an October regulatory filing that federal investigators had subpoenaed the automaker for information involving its vehicles driving range Driving range has been a key selling point for Tesla vehicles and other electric models in the United States where consumers cite a lack of public charging infrastructure as a primary reason for avoiding battery-powered cars Tesla has recently lowered the driving range estimates for variants of its model X S Y and 3 vehicles according to a Reuters review of marketing pages on its website compared with archived versions of the same pages and range estimates for 2023 models on a US government site Teslas website now estimates the range of a Model Y Long Range for instance at 310 miles while the governments fuel economy site maintained by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) still lists the same vehicles range at 330 miles Tesla dropped the range estimate for the performance variant of the Model Y a small crossover SUV from 303 miles to 285 miles the Reuters review showed The new rules require automakers to test electric vehicles (EVs) for driving range and fuel efficiency in their default driving mode - the one the car uses when a driver first turns it on Many modern vehicles including Teslas have an array of driving modes that allow for tuning the vehicle to maximize either efficiency or power If a car doesnt have a default or standard driving mode then the EPA requires an automaker to test the vehicle in its best-case and worst-case modes for efficiency and average the results according to an EPA letter to automakers in July 2022 describing test rule changes that take effect for 2024 models Telsa does not specify a model year in the marketing pages on its website that list estimated ranges for its models Tesla offers driving modes ranging from Chill mode for efficiency and better range to Drag Strip Mode in higher performance models to boost acceleration according to 2023 Tesla owners manuals posted online Under tips to maximize range in its Model Y owners manual Tesla advises drivers to consider using Chill Mode Telsa did not respond to requests for comment on the range-estimate reductions the new EPA rule or whether it has previously used Chill Mode or any efficiency-geared setting during its testing to determine driving range The EPA which regulates automakers advertised fuel-economy and driving-range estimates did not answer questions from Reuters about the rationale for its testing rule how it affected Tesla or other automakers and whether the agency had certified Teslas new range estimates EPA spokesperson Nick Conger said in a statement that automakers routinely adjust efficiency estimates with a new model year when vehicle changes or updates to test procedures provide new data Reuters could not determine if Tesla lowered range estimates on every variant of every model Automakers conduct their own tests to determine range and fuel-efficiency estimates for advertising purposes but they must follow EPA guidelines The EPA retests a certain number of vehicles to verify the manufacturers figures Tesla is by far the top seller of electric vehicles in the United States Other major automakers producing multiple electric models include Ford General Motors and Hyundai Spokespeople for Ford and GM said the new EPA rules will not require them to change range estimates for any electric model GM said its testing regimen complied with the new regulations before they took effect Hyundai did not respond to a request for comment Some of Teslas downward revisions were slight such as the change from a 333-mile estimated range to 326 miles for its Model X Plaid variant a high-performance version of the luxury SUV Other changes were more dramatic such as the lowering of the estimate for the Model S Plaid a luxury sport sedan from 396 miles of range to 359 miles according to a comparison of Teslas current website and an archived version of the same page from a few days ago Automotive experts who have tested Teslas range estimates and found them inflated said the reduction of the estimates was a necessary change Automotive website Edmunds said the vast majority of electric vehicles it has tested performed better than their advertised ranges - with Tesla being the exception All of the eight Tesla vehicles we have tested failed to match their EPA estimate Edmunds editor-in-chief Alistair Weaver said in a statement He called Teslas reduced estimates an important step in providing car shoppers with a more accurate reflection of how far their vehicle will travel on a single charge” Seattle-based EV analytics firm Recurrent said it noticed last November that the dashboard range estimate in a Model 3 Long Range it was monitoring had been reduced to 333 miles from the previous estimate of 358 miles That matches the current difference between the Tesla websites estimate for that model and the estimate on the EPA site Recurrent Chief Executive Scott Case called the automakers revisions a step in the right direction for Tesla owners Previous estimates he said have historically been 30% or more optimistic than the vehicles real-world range Alex Knizek manager of automotive testing at Consumer Reports applauded the new EPA rule change for providing a more standardized way of measuring range It all comes down to making the numbers more comparable across different cars from different producers which goes back to making the information more reliable for consumers when shopping for a vehicle he said (Reporting by Norihiko Shirouzu; additional reporting by Joseph White; editing by Brian Thevenot To keep up with the fast-paced world of auto industry news sign up for the Auto File newsletter) Related Quotes"

Schedule a FREE consultation to see if you qualify for tax relief When Berkshire Hathaway first had the chance to invest in the electric vehicle company Tesla back in 2008 Tesla was only valued at $200 million with an uncertain future Musk recently posted that while Berkshire Hathaway’s portfolio has grown significantly since 1994 “[Buffett] could have just invested in Tesla at $200M market cap when he had the opportunity to do so” It’s possible Musk feels slighted by the fact that his company is doing so well and that Berkshire Hathaway could have cashed in on that success — the volatile CEO has been known to flash his ego around Today Tesla is worth almost $620 billion But Berkshire Hathaway isn’t hurting either — shares in the company have increased 375% since 2008 as well Investors Business Daily speculated that Musk currently the second-richest person in the world with a net worth of $177 billion is hurt by Buffett’s investment in what can be construed as Tesla’s biggest competitors in the electric vehicle market BYD and General Motors Berkshire Hathaway owns 12% of BYD and nearly 4% of GM though it did sell more than 42 million shares of BYD last month (it still owns 118% of the shares) And while Musk’s complaint may seem personal he’s not wrong that investing in his company would have made Buffett a pretty penny A $200 million investment in Tesla at the end of 2008 would be valued at around $620 billion today or an astonishing 309824% gain Check Out: I’m a Financial Advisor: I’d Invest My First $5000 in These 6 Stocks Buffett’s investing approach could be deemed old-fashioned in that he prioritizes “investments in businesses with both long-lasting favorable economic characteristics and trustworthy managers” as he shared in a recent shareholder letter As such you won’t see Buffett jumping on the latest stock trend or hot new IPO Yet some analysts consider his approach to tech stocks an “aversion” suggesting he might have missed out on some big money by hewing only to those companies that have fit into his narrow standards Despite this tendency of his he did surprise investors by purchasing Apple stock and as of 2022 the company made up 40% of Berkshire Hathaway’s equity portfolio Perhaps the most well-known misses that Buffett still regrets are not getting in early on the now massively valued companies Amazon and Google (the latter held under parent company Alphabet Inc) Buffett’s partner at Berkshire Hathaway Charlie Munger has praised Amazon founder Jeff Bezos as a “miracle worker” and claimed to feel like a “horse’s ass” for not seeing Google’s potential Buffett weighed in saying “We blew it” Not all of Buffett’s mistakes have been misses — one of his bigger regrets was investing in the four largest airlines: United American Southwest and Delta Airlines which were worth a collective $4 billion or more pre-pandemic The pandemic tanked stocks in these companies and Buffett sold off the company’s shares in these airlines These shares’ drops in value contributed to Berkshire Hathaway seeing a nearly $50 billion loss in the first quarter of 2020 Another area of regret for Buffett was investing in IBM Perhaps spurred on by his negative reputation for not investing in tech in 2011 Berkshire Hathaway invested in IBM which at that time seemed like it would go the distance with name recognition and the numbers to back it up Unfortunately by 2015 shareholders were already displeased with IBM’s performance in their portfolios and by 2017 Buffett had to admit his mistake He still saw IBM as a strong company but it wasn’t keeping up with the necessary technological change that would keep its shares strong Buffett ultimately sold shares in the company Even with these mishaps Buffett’s failures have still netted him and his shareholders more money than some people’s successes He’s crying as the saying goes all the way to the bank More From GOBankingRates 7 Best New Dollar Tree Items That Are Worth Every Penny You Can Get These 3 Debts Canceled Forever 8 Signs Youll Retire Wealthy 4 Reasons You Should Be Getting Your Paycheck Early According to An Expert This article originally appeared on GOBankingRatescom: Warren Buffett Passed on Tesla — See His Other Investing Misses Over the Years"

When Elon Musk is told that US$56 billion as a pay package is unfair This at least was the finding by Delaware Court of Chancery by Judge Kathaleen McCormick regarding the spellbinding 2018 compensation package for the planet’s wealthiest human being McCormick and Musk already have inked some judicial history The same judge presided over the Twitter suit against Musk that eventually resulted in him parting with US$44 billion to acquire the company that is now sliding into merry decay as the platform X In her sharp ruling daring to “boldly go where no man has gone before” let alone a Delaware court McCormick observed that Tesla a company of Musk’s own creation “bore the burden of proving that the compensation plan was fair and they failed to meet their burden” The question of fairness first arose in 2019 when Tesla shareholder Richard Tornetta filed a suit challenging the validity of the 2018 performance-based equity compensation plan the largest of its type in the history of public markets Tornetta’s primary contention was that Musk was hardly showing much devotion to the carmaker his duties and interests spread as it were across a number of other corporate entities: SpaceX OpenAI Neuralink and the Boring Company Tornetta’s legal team argued that the 2018 package did nothing to focus the billionaire’s interest on Tesla and it followed the interests of its shareholders The agreement for instance made no mention of any such requirements as time allocation “Indeed” reads the lawsuit “Musk testified that since the Grant’s approval he has spent a little more than half his time on Tesla matters and has dedicated substantial time and attention to various other endeavours” The judgment acknowledges that any decision by the board of directors on what to pay a company CEO “is the quintessential business determination subject to great judicial deference” Delaware law however recognised “unique risks inherent in a corporation’s transactions with its controlling stockholder” When it came to dealing with “conflicted-controller transactions” the “presumptive standard review … is entire fairness” Here the defendants proved “unable to prove that the stockholder vote was fully informed because the proxy statement inaccurately described key directors as independent and misleadingly omitted details about the process” Even by the judge’s own reasoning the task left to the defendants was an “unenviable” one and “too tall an order” For the court there were critical problems with the process leading to the approval of the compensation plan The judgment paints a picture of Musk essentially negotiating with himself through devotees flunkeys and friends The adversarial atmosphere was never present; the “controlled mindset” all powerful The theme of the entrepreneurial God King holding his courtiers in thrall streaks McCormick’s observations Musk for instance maintained “extensive ties with the persons tasked with negotiating on Tesla’s behalf” The chair of the compensation committee Ira Ehrenpreis had known Musk well for 15 years Another member of the same committee Antonio Gracias had an enduring two-decade business relationship with Musk “as well as the sort of personal relationship that had him vacationing with Musk’s family on a regular basis” The entanglements do not stop there There is General Counsel Todd Maron the main negotiating link between the committee and Musk Maron had acted as divorce attorney for Musk and admired him so much he was “moved … to tears during his deposition” With a flawed process things did not get much better with the negotiated price Again the defendants argued that for Tesla to continue to grow Musk’s continued leadership was indispensable Keeping Musk as the main helmsman meant a rise in stockholder value In one estimate offering Musk a chance to increase his ownership of Tesla from 219% to 283% would mean “6% for (US)$600 billion of growth in stockholder value” Such arguments did not convince McCormick Musk already owned 219% of the company when the plan was approved He had every incentive to push the company “to levels of transformative growth” seeing what he stood to gain from it: “(US)$10 billion for every (US)$50 billion in market capitalization increase” The arrangements also came with no conditions on how much time Musk would devote to Tesla “Swept up by the rhetoric of ‘all upside’ or perhaps starry eyed by Musk’s superstar appeal the board never asked the (US)$558 billion question: Was the plan even necessary to retain Musk and achieve its goals?” The answer: plainly not Such observations would have stung and made good the judge’s promise to go where no previous Delaware court had dared tread Here was a punchy assessment about the comfortable clique-ridden tribalism of corporate non-governance Musk riled and ruffled took to the platform X (formerly Twitter) to vent “Never incorporate your company in the state of Delaware” were his words of advice By no means does this end matter Musk is hardly going to be out of pocket nor is he going to leave the company from which he continues to handsomely profit from via stocks he owns Fairness operates in otherworldly dimensions here A new compensation package according to the judge will have to be worked out with Tornetta An appeal is also possible “The judge’s ruling should be a wakeup call (for Tesla shareholders) that things have gotten out of hand” remarks Andrew Poreda who also invests in Tesla through exchange-traded funds In this overgrown corporate jungle it is questionable whether things were ever really in hand Binoy Kampmark was a Commonwealth Scholar at Selwyn College Cambridge He lectures at RMIT University Melbourne Email: [email protected] Your email address will not be published Required fields are marked * Comment * Name * Email * Website By Sushant Sareen If bombing by fighter aircraft and drones covert targeted killing operations and hit-and-run raids on jihadist bases Many European leaders are well aware that the ONLY negotiation demanded by the Russian invaders is the complete capitulation by… A very exhaustive account Should I ever decide to convert to Islam I know who to consult Understandable reaction?

Right","2/5/2024","https://investorplace.com/2024/02/tsla-stock-analysis-teslas-long-term-future-is-still-bright-but-todays-timing-is-not-right/","Countdown to Luke Lango’s “2nd Trillion-Dollar AI Trade” The US govt just unlocked an $8 trillion market to move in a new direction See how it could unleash 6000% potential upside Tesla’s latest conference call has investors spooked Advertisement Source: Arina P Habich / Shutterstockcom Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock has had a rough start to the year after reporting its Q4 and full year 2023 financial results My initial Tesla stock analysis suggests Wall Street was particularly disappointed with Tesla’s lack of clarity regarding the company’s plan for the future Tesla is currently navigating through a challenging macroeconomic environment Rising interest rates have damaged the automotive market especially in Asia Pacific The company also projects vehicle deliveries to slow in 2024 with price cuts to impact vehicle gross margins While Wall Street is wary about Tesla’s outlook for 2024 the long term story remains intact Tesla has been one of the most important car companies of the last decade They’ve been a pioneer in the global adoption of EVs and are the second largest manufacturer in the world They’ve pioneered a vehicle segment that was traditionally ignored by large automotive manufacturers The company hit a major inflection point becoming profitable on a TTM basis back in 2020 This was after they nearly faced bankruptcy a few years prior Many investors continue to see Tesla as only a car company but that is merely not the case Tesla currently generates a majority of its operating profit from EVs This will likely be the case for the next few years However when you look out further you can see the potential for Tesla’s revenue and operating profit to increase in areas like artificial intelligence and energy storage In FY23 Tesla’s energy storage deployments increased 125% YOY to 147 GWh This is impressive when you consider the impact that supply chain constraints and higher interest rates had on the energy storage and solar market Precedence Market Research estimates the energy storage market to reach $435 billion by 2030 growing at an 84% CAGR I think Wall Street is significantly undervaluing the business and its long term potential beyond the end of this decade Management also expects growth in energy storage deployments to outpace the automotive business in FY24 Tesla is currently rolling out V12 of FSD using neural networks and deep learning models to influence vehicle controls Our current Tesla stock analysis says the advent of AI will be a huge growth driver for Tesla and an autonomous taxi network could add hundreds of billions in market cap to the company In the 2023 fiscal year Tesla grew its top line revenue by nearly 20% despite macroeconomic uncertainties A series of price cuts served as a mechanism to boost both delivery and revenue growth The only problem is that it has significantly affected Tesla’s vehicle gross margins Tesla’s gross margins in FY23 came in at 182% compared to 256% in FY22 Higher interest rates severed the automotive market and price cuts was a strategic move to strengthen their position in the marketplace This move slightly paid off as price cuts on the Model 3/Y boosted delivery growth in 2023 Tesla’s Model Y also became the world’s best selling vehicle in 2023 selling 123 million units Tesla is clearly playing the long game as the company aims to increase economies of scale through 2030 Vehicle gross margins are also expected to be below 20% through 2024 While this is a small bump along the road Tesla’s ability to increase operating leverage could accelerate profitability in the next few years Tesla has been one of the best growth stories on Wall Street in the last few years The stock was a pandemic darling as the company flipped to profitability and surged 740% in 2020 They have continued to see strong double digit growth but their growth rate is starting to slow down They have made strategic moves in 2023 which will make a lot more sense in hindsight Tesla P/E has been cut in half from the end of 2023 There are certainly a number of reasons to be skeptical in 2024 which include vehicle deliveries gross margins and profitability Investors might want to consider waiting to see how 2024

Chanos posted on X I know this is Elon but you do realize how outrageous this is right? What say you $TSLA board? Chanos seemed to bristle at the idea of Teslas CEO deliberately withholding new products to the detriment of his company and shareholders unless his stake or voting rights are doubled He suggested Musk might be angling for Tesla to buy X from him using stock Musk also indicated that owning roughly $90 billion of Tesla stock isnt a strong enough incentive for him to perform He noted that Fidelity and other providers of index funds and mutual funds which hold Tesla on behalf of millions of individual investors own big stakes in his company but dont have to run it Does he really not understand how index/mutual funds work…?! Chanos asked Chanos is best known for spotting fraud and successfully betting against Enron and Wirecard His firm held bearish puts on Tesla stock as the end of September SEC filings show He recently announced the closure of his main short-focused hedge funds after years of poor performance In a Pensions & Investments interview in December Chanos compared Tesla to IBM Xerox Polaroid AOL and other tech businesses that enjoyed intense hype but were ultimately usurped by rivals Tesla stock is down nearly 50% from its November 2021 peak but its still up nearly 10-fold in just over four years giving the EV maker an almost $700 billion market capitalization that ranks it among the worlds most-valuable companies When it comes to Tesla hes the narrative Chanos said about Musk describing his company as the it girl of this market cycle with a stock built on hopes and dreams Read next Indices Commodities Currencies Stocks Jump to"
380,"Tesla Stock: Continuing The Short Bet (NASDAQ:TSLA)","1/17/2024","https://seekingalpha.com/article/4663303-tesla-continuing-the-short-bet-as-bull-thesis-depends-too-much-on-ai-and-robotics","nattapon1975/iStock via Getty Images nattapon1975/iStock via Getty Images I started a short bet against Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) in July when shares were around $280 I have described it in two previous Seeking Alpha articles an initial one where I talked about the rationale and the investment thesis and a second article where I gave an update on how it was going at the end of October last year I was up around 120% in October but those gains have been reduced to 80% as Tesla shares have performed relatively well in November and December The start of the new year is a good opportunity to re-evaluate my investment thesis I want to be very clear: I do not doubt that company fundamentals are solid and that Tesla has good long-term prospects The problem is the valuation Tesla’s market cap surpasses the 10 largest global auto manufacturers (by 2023 unit sales) but it is not even one of them BYD (OTCPK:BYDDF OTCPK:BYDDY) sold more EVs than Tesla in Q4 2023 and it is already among those 10 Not surprisingly the bull thesis for Tesla more and more depends on Tesla being not just a car company Elon Musk recently posted this on X: Source: X Source: X This is a bold statement In Q3 2023 84% of revenue was in the automotive segment So far Tesla has not delivered an AI or robotics product and there is no timeline for when it intends to deliver one If you look at autonomous driving and FSD it is – in my view – not even clear what the product and the business model would be beyond adding a feature to a car It seems to me that just a few days earlier Elon Musk had made it clear what the purpose of the promotion was: Source: X Source: X I think Tesla is a car company and as a car company Tesla will do reasonably well in 2024 but not well enough to justify a P/E ratio of around 100 (based on the $053 GAAP profit in Q3 2023) Because of the price reductions in 2023 revenue growth in Q3 was just 9% and GAAP profit was even 44% lower than a year ago Teslas profit margins are now in line with other auto manufacturers Car deliveries were still up by 38% in 2023 but it looks like this will come down too in 2024 putting an end to the 50% per year growth aspirations The energy business while solid cannot compensate So this leaves autonomous driving robotaxis and the Optimus robot as drivers for the valuation We can expect enormous hype around those things but it is far from assured that we will see products delivered anytime soon I think risks are skewed to the downside in 2024 Based on this rationale I intend to continue the short bet and have even decided to increase my stake There is no doubt that Tesla is growing But is it growing enough to warrant the high valuation? Elon Musk said that unit sales will grow by around 50% per year It should be more than 50% in some years and less in other years so the guidance allows for flexibility Tesla reached its goal to deliver 18 million vehicles in 2023 with a record 484507 deliveries in Q3 bringing the total deliveries for the year to 1808581 a YoY growth rate of around 38% QoQ growth looks less impressive after 435059 deliveries in Q3 and 466140 in Q2 Q3 deliveries were lower due to maintenance shutdowns so the Q2 number is the one we should look at here for a QoQ comparison While the YoY 38% growth looks impressive by itself it is not much better than what Volkswagen Group (OTCPK:VWAGY) achieved a car company that certainly had its share of bad press in 2023 Volkswagen Group increased BEV deliveries in 2023 by 347% to 572500 There is no guidance from Tesla yet on 2024 deliveries and this will probably be one of the most discussed topics in the upcoming 2023 earnings call It is hard to see (at least for me) where growth in the range of 30-50% is going to come from in 2024 The Model Y is the current sales driver but the model is becoming dated (it is from 2019) and up against a variety of newer models from other manufacturers According to Bloomberg more than 100 new EV models will come on the market in China alone this year Cybertruck sales will be negligible There are rumors that a Model Y revamp is planned for 2024 but we have no confirmation from Tesla and accordingly no timeline If the revamp is planned volume production will unlikely happen before the second half of the year The most obvious growth driver would be a new Model 2 but that one is very unlikely to come in 2024 Last quarter BYD overtook Tesla as the largest seller of fully electric vehicles BYD still sells most of its cars in China While Tesla is doing well in China BYD is much larger there Volkswagen Group and Stellantis (STLA) outsell Tesla in Europe with their EVs This development is overshadowed by the popularity of the Model Y Across all brands and models Volkswagen Group has more than 21% market share in Europe and Tesla only has 12% Tesla still rules the EV market in the US with around 55% market share But is this because Telsa is so strong or the legacy automakers especially General Motors (GM) and Ford (F) are relatively weak? In Q4 2023 GM’s EV share was just 31% and Ford (F) was not much higher at 53% According to Forbes the Swiss bank UBS forecasts EV sales growth between only 10% and 15% in Western Europe and the US in 2024 It is hard to see how Tesla although the only real global player in the EV market will achieve a growth rate close to 50% or even repeat the 38% growth in 2023 under such a scenario The Cybertruck has now been released sort of at least It will not do much though for the delivery numbers and the top line in 2024 and it will be a negative on the bottom line at least until 2025 The big pre-release questions on the Cybertruck have been answered disappointingly especially since the price has gone up significantly (which was expected) and the range has come down (which was unexpected) On the positive side investors seem to be quite forgiving of Tesla and the share price did not suffer much So in some ways I was wrong here The disappointing Cybertruck release did not push the share price down In the long term Tesla may still make this a success story – but it will probably not matter in 2024 The Cybertruck did not even feature in the latest quarterly production and delivery number: how many vehicles the company built and delivered in Q3 2023 is hidden in the “Other Models” category As I have said in my previous articles the transition to electricity is to a large extent not market-driven but caused by government policies to meet a climate emergency Tesla selling only electric vehicles has been and continues to be a major beneficiary of various kinds of government subsidies and this is the case in all three of its three large markets the US China and Europe However those policies are costly and are subject to change In my view 2023 might have been the peak-subsidy year This is not good news for Tesla Just a few examples - each one by itself will have a limited impact but together they will create significant headwinds for Tesla to grow deliveries: Tesla’s operating margins in Q3 2023 were 755% the lowest since 2020 and more than two percentage points down QoQ The company has prioritized volume growth over revenue and profit margins to increase demand This has brought Tesla to the point where the starting price of a Model 3 or Model Y is less than the average price of a car in the US It has also brought profitability in line with where mass-market auto manufacturers are Toyota (TM) had a profit margin of 116% in its last quarter Volkswagen Group which does not say it is a cost leader and has a cost savings program worth several billion euros running still came to 69% in Q3 2023 One interesting data point regarding Tesla’s margins in Q3 2023 is that operating margins were coming down faster (from 172% to 76% YoY) than gross profit margins (from 251% to 179% YoY) meaning Tesla’s cost base is increasing This does not support the claim that Tesla has structural cost advantages compared to other auto manufacturers An alternative explanation would be that Tesla’s cost base is a result of the small model line-up Despite the claim from Elon Musk that Tesla is an AI/robotics company that appears to many to be a car company research and development expenses are still low compared to other auto manufacturers despite the substantial recent increases R&D expenses in Q3 were 11 billion US dollars up 58% YoY and around 49% of revenue By comparison BMW (OTCPK:BAMXF) (OTCPK:BMWYY) sold 23 million cars in 2023 which is not that far from Tesla However the ratio of R&D expenses to revenue (excluding the financial services segment) was significantly higher at 62% Audi sold 19 million cars in 2023 so almost the same as Tesla The R&D ratio in Q1-Q3 was even higher at 73% And those two companies have no aspirations to be more than car companies Despite the higher R&D cost their profit margins are above Tesla with BMW around 10% and Audi around 9% My point here is that – in my view – it will be difficult for Tesla to meaningfully increase its profit margins in 2024 Given the slow-down in EV demand growth the increasing competition and the lack of new models on Tesla’s side it does not look like Tesla will be able to increase prices It even started the year in China with further price reductions While lower raw material costs could provide tailwinds new model development factory ramp-ups the Cybertruck ramp-up Dojo etc will probably increase costs Considering this it is no wonder that Elon Musk and Tesla bulls tell us that Tesla is more than just a car company Of course there is the possibility that FSD robotaxis and robotics will drive revenue and profits in the future Elon Musk has always been good at convincing us that the future will be much better than we imagine While he has not delivered everything he has promised in the past he has delivered a lot But not everybody believes this anymore when it comes to autonomous driving Over the last few years he has predicted every year that fully autonomous cars would arrive very soon For Tesla to truly achieve fully autonomous driving as the company and Musk have promised it must take responsibility for the system Currently the driver must supervise the system at all times There is no indication that this will happen anytime soon although Tesla would like to keep calling it Full Self Driving Capability Recently the company said in court that should be allowed to call the software Full Self Driving although it is not that because it has used the name for so long that the California Department of Motor Vehicles has accepted the brand name Therefore it should not be allowed to sue Tesla now for false advertising Musk has previously said that FSD will be coming out of beta with the v12 update but we do not know what that will mean Source: X Source: X The main difference with the Version 12 update is likely that vehicle control is handled by neural networks rather than hard-coded by engineers as was the case in the past There is one thing I will be watching for Being a completely different system it should now also behave completely differently – instead of the incremental improvements we have seen previously I am very interested to see how this plays out once we have more information and data Maybe there will be a breakthrough and my investment thesis will prove wrong We will see but currently I like my odds Since I live in Austria and am a retail investor going short directly on a US stock is difficult I decided to go for Put options with a duration of 4 to 6 months and plan to continuously roll over the options to the next 4 to 6 months at about the midpoint of the duration so every 2 to 3 months This comes with costs so I do not want to do it too often I have done it twice now since I started in July last year The Put options limit my losses if things do not go well but there is still the possibility of a total loss I decided to go for options not quite in the money but with a strike price not more than 10% below the share price This limits the loss rate but on the flip side also the leverage of the options The options I currently hold have a strike price of $240 and expire in June 2024 I intend to keep them until sometime in March I reinvest gains but also reduce the reinvestment in case of a loss when I switch over I am now up around 80%; it was plus 120% last October but Tesla shares have recovered somewhat in November and December The decision to use Put options means the timeframe for the thesis to play out is relatively short Continuously switching to a longer duration mitigates that risk to some extent but does not completely solve it Tesla stock can be driven greatly by sentiment and the excitement of future possibilities alone Anything that drives up the stock for just a few months can reduce the value of the options significantly That can happen quickly even if the options strategy is designed carefully Besides sentiment there is the possibility of a real breakthrough in autonomous driving or robotics Just because Elon Musk has not yet delivered on his grand promises does not mean he will never deliver Positive developments in other areas like the energy storage business or battery technology could have the same effect Therefore I am allocating only a small part of my portfolio to this short bet I see it not as an investment but as an interesting experiment Teslas current business model is to manufacture and sell cars with an additional energy storage business More than 80% of revenue is in the automotive segment In the context of that business model the current share price can only be justified if Tesla delivers the combination of continued high growth and profit margins above industry peers This will be hard to achieve in 2024 but Tesla is valued higher than the 10 largest car manufacturers globally combined Accordingly we are seeing the bull investment thesis shift to the premise that Tesla is not just a car manufacturer but an AI and robotics company However Tesla has so far not delivered a product in any of those two areas and there is no timeline for when it intends to deliver one Therefore I think that risk for investors is skewed to the downside in 2024 and I intend to continue the short bet I started half a year ago Editors Note: This article discusses one or more securities

Tesla’s price-to-book ratio of 1219 (calculated by taking total assets – liabilities preferred stock and intangible assets) is at its lowest level since early 2020 The last time TSLA’s p/b was this low TSLA exploded from $35 to more than $400 per share Pure-EV competitors to Tesla are collapsing For example Nio Rivian and Lucid are more than 90% off their all-time highs Earlier this week news broke that China is planning to unveil a massive stimulus package to boost the country’s struggling economy In addition the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) will allow banks to hold smaller cash reserves Should the stimulus effort be successful it will be a big boost for Tesla whose second-largest market is China Tesla is turning into a cash cow with nearly $30 billion cash on hand With so much dry powder Tesla’s board has the flexibility to buy back shares of TSLA or inject more cash into the business to ramp up production As Tesla faces a stock decline for four consecutive quarters recent data suggests a potential opportunity for investors Historical analysis reveals that every time Tesla experienced a 5% or more gap down to a 6-month low shares roared back in the next 30 days Finally an attractive valuation and cash hoard bode well for the EV king Since 2000 our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&Ps +62 average gain per year Amazingly they soared with average gains of +464% +495% and +552% per year Today you can access their live picks without cost or obligation See Stocks Free >> Media Contact Zacks Investment Research 800-767-3771 ext 9339 support@zackscom https://wwwzackscom Past performance is no guarantee of future results Inherent in any investment is the potential for loss This material is being provided for informational purposes only and nothing herein constitutes investment legal accounting or tax advice or a recommendation to buy sell or hold a security No recommendation or advice is being given as to whether any investment is suitable for a particular investor It should not be assumed that any investments in securities companies sectors or markets identified and described were or will be profitable All information is current as of the date of herein and is subject to change without notice Any views or opinions expressed may not reflect those of the firm as a whole Zacks Investment Research does not engage in investment banking market making or asset management activities of any securities These returns are from hypothetical portfolios consisting of stocks with Zacks Rank = 1 that were rebalanced monthly with zero transaction costs These are not the returns of actual portfolios of stocks The S&P 500 is an unmanaged index Visit https://wwwzackscom/performance for information about the performance numbers displayed in this press release Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Read on to find out For Q4 2023 Tesla reported revenues of $2517B and non-GAAP EPS of $071 missing consensus estimates on both top and bottom lines: Seeking Alpha Seeking Alpha In Q4 Teslas total revenue growth slowed further to just ~3% y/y (vs 9% in Q3 2023) and GAAP gross margins declined to 176% (vs 179% in Q3 2023) [below managements guardrail of 20%] reflecting the negative impact of price cuts While lower vehicle ASPs and a shift in mix towards Model 3/Y continued hurting revenues and gross profit margins during the quarter Teslas operating margins rose to 82% (vs 76% in Q3 2023) resulting in better-than-expected quarterly free cash flow of $206B in Q4 Tesla Q4 2023 Earnings DeckTesla Q4 2023 Earnings Deck Tesla Q4 2023 Earnings Deck Tesla Q4 2023 Earnings Deck During Q4 2023 Tesla delivered a record ~484K units (up 195% y/y) at an average selling price of $445K [down $600 vs Q3 2023; and lower than the average price of a new car in the US] For the year Tesla met managements production target of 18M vehicles exiting the year with an annualized production run rate of ~2M vehicles While we will discuss Teslas business outlook for 2024 in just a bit I would like to point out that Cybertruck has moved out of pilot production to production with Tesla pegging current production capacity at 125K+ units per year and leadership maintaining a positive view on this product and its ongoing ramp Tesla Q4 2023 Earnings DeckTesla Q4 2023 Earnings Deck Tesla Q4 2023 Earnings Deck Tesla Q4 2023 Earnings Deck Throughout 2023 Teslas top-line growth rates have decelerated rapidly amid a series of price cuts from the EV giant And according to its leaderships commentary Tesla is likely to experience slower sales growth until the launch of its next-gen vehicle (emphasis added): Our company is currently between two major growth waves: the first one began with the global expansion of the Model 3/Y platform and the next one we believe will be initiated by the global expansion of the next-generation vehicle platform In 2024 our vehicle volume growth rate may be notably lower than the growth rate achieved in 2023 as our teams work on the launch of the next-generation vehicle at Gigafactory Texas Source: Teslas Q4 2023 Earnings Deck While Tesla has issued no vehicle production guide for 2024 the notably lower growth outlook implies >0% y/y growth from a base of 18M vehicles Given Teslas annualized vehicles sales production rate was at ~2M in Q4 2023 I believe 2024 sales target must be at least ~2M vehicles With CEO Elon Musk saying Tesla could start production of the next-gen vehicle in the second half of 2025 I think we will likely have to wait until 2026/27 for the next-gen vehicle to enter meaningful production and then a year or so to ramp up big time Hence the next wave of rapid top-line growth at Teslas auto business could realistically be 2-3+ years away Now Teslas Energy Storage business is going strong and it will likely continue to grow at a healthy clip Unfortunately it is not big enough to move the needle And futuristic projects like FSD and Optimus are unlikely to pay off in the next couple of years Therefore I think Tesla is set for a prolonged period of tepid growth Furthermore Teslas dangerous recession playbook to chase unit volumes even at the cost of margins has already resulted in significant margin deterioration And managements outlook on margins remains scary (emphasis added): We dont know We dont have a crystal ball so its difficult for us to predict this with precision If the interest rates come down quickly I think margins will be good And if they dont come down quickly they wont be that good Yeah Its always important to remember that the vast majority of people buying a car is about the monthly payment Its not that people dont want We have tons of -- we have lots of people who want to buy our car but simply cannot afford it And as interest rates drop and that monthly payment drops then theyre able to afford it and they buy the car Its pretty straightforward and there are no tricks around to get around this - Elon Musk Tesla CEO In the event of a soft landing interest rates are likely to remain elevated ie Teslas vehicle demand and margins stay suppressed Conversely in the event of a hard landing interest rates may go down quickly (improving affordability); however auto demand will likely fall in that environment (as consumers tend to postpone or cancel big ticket purchases in uncertain economic environments) potentially forcing Tesla into even more price cuts ie continued margin suppression As a Tesla shareholder I really hope Musk & Co could cut costs fast enough to improve margins; however I wouldnt bet on near-term margin expansion at Tesla With all of this said Tesla delivered record revenues and free cash flows in 2023 despite facing a very challenging business rate environment (caused by higher interest rates) Now lets learn something from history When high-flying growth companies experience a growth cliff and operating margin pressures their stocks tend to get crushed! Just look at pandemic darlings like Zoom (ZM) and Roku (ROKU): Data by YCharts Given Teslas financial performance it could face a similar fate To be clear I am not comparing Teslas business to Zoom or Roku; all I am doing here is highlighting the similarities in their financial performance In the investing world a large chunk of money managers tend to think in quarters due to performance targets and these people dont have time to wait around for a business to find its next leg of growth regardless of its past achievements YCharts YCharts With slower growth and margin pressures Tesla will lose many growth-oriented shareholders and given its lofty valuation [>50x forward P/E] value-oriented investors wont touch Tesla! Hence I think Teslas shareholders could have to undergo a world of pain in the next 12-24 months [especially in the event of a hard landing] In my previous update I shared the following technical view on TSLA: Upon re-drawing the lines with recent local tops and local bottoms on the weekly chart I think we can make the case that Tesla is still trading within a symmetrical triangle pattern Since triangles can break in either direction Tesla looks primed for a big breakout or breakdown WeBull Desktop As I see it a break above $265-270 could send Tesla to $300 in quick order and potentially to the $360-400+ range [new all-time highs] over the next 6-12 months On the flip side if Tesla suffers yet another rejection here a breakdown below the $215-230 range could send TSLA stock into a tailspin that culminates in the low-to-mid $100s From the two potential paths we discussed Tesla has clearly picked the bearish one breaking below the ~$215 level just before earnings and then collapsing down to ~$180 in a jiffy right after Whats next? With Teslas murky growth and margin outlook I cant see serious investors lining up to energetically buy the dip right here right now While Tesla stock is Oversold on the daily chart (RSI < 30) and a technical bounce cant be ruled out after such a rapid move lower crashes happen from oversold levels and Tesla is potentially forming a bearish death cross pattern with 50-DMA getting close to undercutting the 200-DMA to the downside Author WeBull Desktop Author WeBull Desktop If we do end up getting a death cross I would expect selling pressure in Tesla to pick up significantly in the near-term despite oversold conditions The symmetrical triangle has clearly broken down and I think TSLA stock has entered a tailspin to the downside which may ultimately culminate in our target box for the triangle ie the low to mid $100s I expect this sort of price action in a soft-softish landing for the economy - wherein Teslas business chugs along just fine Author WeBull Desktop Author WeBull Desktop Now if we were to experience a severe hard landing in the economy over the next 6-12 months Teslas financial performance will likely deteriorate even further and then the range of negative outcomes could be much wider In my view Teslas stock could still complete the reverse gamma squeeze we discussed in late-2022 by ending up in the mid-double digits This idea sounds ridiculous but if TSLA can gamma squeeze to the upside it can reverse gamma squeeze to the downside Now I believe most Tesla bears will agree with this take and most Tesla bulls will refute it However prudent investors must always keep an open mind and prepare for negative outcomes Based on fundamentals and technicals I view Teslas near-term risk/reward as skewed to the downside But we must still look at long-term risk/reward to reach an informed investing decision So lets consider Tesla from a slightly different more longer-term lens In 2023 Tesla produced 18M vehicles and exited the year with an annualized production run rate of 2M vehicles! And unlike most of its EV competitors (legacy auto and pure EV startups) Tesla is making billions of dollars in free cash flow making electric vehicles Tesla Q4 2023 Earnings Deck Tesla Q4 2023 Earnings Deck Tesla Q4 2023 Earnings Deck Tesla Q4 2023 Earnings Deck Like Teslas management I dont know how much of its serviceable-addressable-market Tesla has already captured in its automotive business However I the growth runway for Tesla is very very long The worlds transition to renewable energy is inevitable and so is electrification of the auto market As of 2023 EVs make up 9% of total auto sales globally and this number will continue to rise for several years to come Tesla Q4 2023 Earnings Call Transcript Tesla Q4 2023 Earnings Call Transcript Tesla Q4 2023 Earnings Call Transcript Tesla Q4 2023 Earnings Call Transcript Hence Tesla may not grow rapidly over the next couple of years but this incredible growth story has many more chapters to come Furthermore Teslas Energy Storage business has incredible momentum and an even longer growth runway ahead of itself As I shared earlier in this note Teslas services (& other) revenue is becoming a meaningful piece of the business and this segment should continue to record strong growth as Teslas fleet size increases and in general growth of the EV market [remember all major auto manufacturers are adopting Teslas charging standard with Tesla opening up its supercharging network to other auto OEMs] In addition to these tangible businesses Tesla is also developing ambitious futuristic projects like FSD (full self-driving) Optimus (humanoid robot) Dojo (AI chips) etc While the outcome of these ambitious projects is uncertain and success is far from guaranteed Tesla could potentially generate hundreds of billions of dollars per year if all or some of these projects were to work out Let me share some napkin math on the potential of FSD as a recurring revenue business for Tesla: Again this is just some napkin math but it shows how FSD could be an absolute game changer for Tesla During Q4 earnings call Musk shared some interesting updates on the progress being made on this front (emphasis added): For full self-driving weve released Version 12 which is a complete architectural rewrite compared to prior versions This is end-to-end artificial intelligence So another bit nets basically photons in and controls out and it really is quite a profound difference This is currently just with employees and a few customers but we will be rolling out to all customers in the US who request full self-driving in the weeks to come Thats over 400000 vehicles in North America So this is the first-time AI is being used not just for object perception but for path planning and vehicle controls We replaced 330000 lines of C++ code with neural nets Its really quite remarkable Yeah sort of as a side note I think Tesla is probably the most efficient company in the world for AI inference Out of necessity weve actually had to be extremely good at getting the most out of hardware because Hardware 3 at this point is several years old So I think were quite far ahead of any other company in the world in terms of AI and inference efficiency which is going to be a very important metric in the future in many arenas - Elon Musk Tesla CEO While I remain skeptical about Tesla achieving full autonomy with FSD in the next couple of years I am confident that Tesla is leading the race for autonomous vehicles having watched several Tesla owner videos showing intervention-free rides Honestly I think Tesla FSD is closer to full autonomy than most people believe it is at this stage Tesla Q4 2023 Earnings Call Transcript Tesla Q4 2023 Earnings Call Transcript Now I understand that FSD could need a few more years to reach full autonomy and it may fail to do so That said ignoring Teslas FSD would be a grave mistake While I dont factor in any revenues from FSD into my valuation model to instill a margin of safety there our steady-state free cash flow (FCF) margin assumption is based on Tesla building a sizeable AI/software business For now I am not considering Optimus and other projects like Dojo into my modeling If those projects pay off I will be happy to have received them as free embedded options for buying/owning Tesla stock! While Tesla is set to experience slower growth and continued margin pressures for the next couple of years we must continue to take a long-term view of the business to determine its fair value As such I am sticking with our long-term growth and steady-state margins assumptions TQI Valuation Model (Free to use at TQIGorg) TQI Valuation Model (Free to use at TQIGorg) On the back of a ~30% decline in early 2024 Tesla has lost a lot of the froth in its stock which is now trading quite close to its fair value Please note TQIs fair value estimate for Tesla has moved from ~$180 to ~$174 in light of Q4 earnings Assuming a base case exit multiple of ~25x P/FCF I see Tesla stock going from ~$180 to ~$422 per share over the next five years at ~18% CAGR TQI Valuation Model (Free to use at TQIGorg) TQI Valuation Model (Free to use at TQIGorg) Considering Teslas uncertain business outlook recent financial performance and technicals; I view Teslas near-term risk/reward as skewed to the downside However as a long-term investor I see Tesla exceeding my investment hurdle rate of 15% over the next five years In my view investors with a 1-2 year investment horizon should continue to avoid Tesla On the other hand I like the idea of restarting accumulation for investors willing to look beyond a couple of years due to Teslas favorable long-term risk/reward At my investing group we like to operate with a 5+ year time horizon which is why we will restart slow staggered accumulation in TSLA stock at our next bi-weekly deployment To be clear we understand that Tesla could drop more than 50% from current levels in the event of a hard landing The plan is to dollar-cost average for the next couple of years even if Tesla keeps spiraling lower during this low-growth period for the EV giant Key Takeaway: Due to a significant shift in long-term risk/reward I now rate Tesla a modest Buy at ~$180 per share with a strong preference for slow staggered buying over the next 12-24 months Offer ends 1/31/2024 Sign up now!

ROTH Capital Partners Senior Research Analyst Craig Irwin and Columbia Law School Professor Eric Talley join Yahoo Finance Live to weigh in on Musk’s relationship with Teslas stock as the EV environment faces challenges The EV giant’s competitive edge according to Irwin has “eroded” due to minimal technological innovation and various other factors Irwin sees the Tesla stock as a “hopes and dreams stock” Furthermore Talley views Musk’s “antics” as a “distraction” that could have been avoided if Musk had followed advice from the company’s board Musk is Tesla insists Irwin who does not see any possibility of Musk being removed as CEO For more expert insight and the latest market action click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live Editors note: This article was written by Eyek Ntekim - Can investors still look at Tesla as something to look at long term as perhaps some of their competitive edge starting to wean away when you look at whats happening with EV demand? CRAIG IRWIN: Oh my God I mean BYDs already overtaking them So the competitive edge is being severely eroded And theres a hopes and dreams stock People dont really look as much at the fact that its really about the cars The people that are along this and trying to accumulate shares even though its going down Were looking at AI and robotics But his robots are state of the art for 2014 And AI Musk is threatening to put it in another company So I have a hard time with the stock I think theres a lot of exciting things going on in EVs and Musk deserves tremendous credit for basically creating the market There was a lot of pushback from others But the trajectory here is tricky for Tesla It needs as much attention from Mr Musk as possible He is a highly talented executive and I wholeheartedly agree with him pushing back on the SEC trying to delete days off his calendar when he needs that time - Certainly Eric would love to bring you back in here As you think about the legal aspects of all the different arguments that Elon Musk has to make in any of these appearances or any of his defenses What is perhaps the most pressing one that he will need to make to ensure that hes still able to balance time between X and Twitter and balance time over at Tesla as Craig was talking about earlier? ERIC TALLEY Well a couple of things First of all I think the antics about Elon Musk deciding when its appropriate for him to come in front of the SEC and when its not that has actually proven to be more of a distraction than another four hours worth of a deposition And quite frankly this opinion never would have occurred had Elon Musk followed through with his entire teams plans to show up on September 15th at which point they just decided to not show up And so I think part of the challenge for Musk is just making sure that these are pretty simple rules of the road to play by I know that he believes himself to be somewhat exceptional within them But this is not going to be a very large issue Probably still wont be a very large issue I think Tesla is the more interesting issue by a long shot and its not just a car company remember its also a solar roof company And its also a battery company and its also a technology company And theres a big question about where that next growth area is going to be Part of the reason for the large compensation package at least ostensibly was to keep Mr Musk on task and creative and putting all new growth opportunities inside Tesla Is that going to change now depending on the outcome of this case? Does that bring about more possible litigation if Mr Musk is perceived as funneling new ideas out of Tesla and into some of his other companies? - So Craig to Erics point there when you think of Musk and his leadership obviously impossible to separate it from Tesla here But even some Musk fans and some Tesla Bulls really starting to get frustrated here Do you see ever a position where Tesla would do better without having him as CEO? CRAIG IRWIN: No I think Musk is essential for the valuation Hes essential for the equity following of retail investors and hes been the visionary You talk to senior executives out at Tesla senior engineers out of Tesla and they say Musk is absolutely impossible to please He is unstoppable He will not take no for an answer And thats how hes getting these tremendous results years faster than anyone else in the industry Hes a very demanding CEO and extremely intelligent about the way he looks at some of these fundamental problems that people just assume are unsolvable or that the conventional solutions the right solution Musk is Tesla that is the challenge here over the next many years How do you backfill him? I think if Musk was gone for Tesla the valuation would change radically in a very short period of time Related Quotes"

Let’s take a closer look: What happened? The move comes after a Delaware judge in January voided the CEO’s $56 billion pay package for Tesla — the largest salary in corporate America The Delaware judge Kathaleen McCormick in her ruling deemed the compensation granted by the EV maker’s board “an unfathomable sum” that was unfair to shareholders McCormick was ruling on a lawsuit from a Tesla investor named Richard Tornetta Tornetta in 2018 calling Musk’s pay package ‘unfair’ sued Musk and several Tesla directors While Tornetta himself held just nine Tesla shares the deal was also criticised by major pension fund California State Teachers’ Retirement System (CalSTRS) and proxy advisory firms who viewed it as far too generous BBC quoted McCormick as saying that the Tesla board of directors were “perhaps starry eyed” over his “superstar appeal” and did not fully inform shareholders “Swept up by the rhetoric of ‘all upside’ or perhaps starry eyed by Musk’s superstar appeal the board never asked the $558 billion question: Was the plan even necessary for Tesla to retain Musk and achieve its goals?” McCormick wrote “The incredible size of the biggest compensation plan ever - an unfathomable sum - seems to have been calibrated to help Musk achieve what he believed would make ‘a good future for humanity’” wrote McCormick in her 201-page opinion As per CNBC Tesla’s eight-person board comprises Musk his brother Kimbal chairwoman Robyn Denholm and ex-Tesla technology chief JB Straubel McCormick wrote that many of the directors on Tesla’s board lacked independence because of their close personal ties with the CEO Two of Tesla’s current directors showed a lack of independence in the pay decision she added McCormick has ordered the Tesla shareholder who challenged the pay plan to work with Musk’s legal team on an order implementing the decision “Good day for the good guys” Greg Varallo an attorney for Tornetta said Tesla directors argued during the trial that the company was paying to ensure one of the world’s most dynamic entrepreneurs continued to dedicate his attention to the electric vehicle maker Antonio Gracias a Tesla director from 2007 to 2021 called the package “a great deal for shareholders” Tornetta’s lawyers argued the Tesla board never told shareholders the goals were easier to achieve than the company was acknowledging and that internal projections showed Musk was quickly going to qualify for large portions of the pay package The plaintiff’s legal team also argued the board had a duty to offer a smaller pay package or look for another CEO and that they should have required Musk to work full-time at Tesla instead of allowing him to focus on side projects like SpaceX and X Kristin Hull founder of Tesla investor Nia Impact Capital described the board as beholden to Musk a problem she said is common at other big technology companies “This is the bro-show” she said of the situation The pay package granted stock option awards for approximately 304 million shares that Musk can buy at about $2333 each well below $19159 where it closed on Tuesday Musk earned all 12 tranches of stock option awards as Tesla hit escalating financial and operational goals Musk has not exercised any of the options and once he does he is required to hold the shares for five years before selling according to McCormick He was not guaranteed any salary Tesla’s value ballooned to briefly top $1 trillion in 2021 from $50 billion when the package was negotiated Amit Batish at Equilar an executive pay research firm estimated in 2022 that Musk’s package was around six times larger than the combined pay of the 200 highest-paid executives in 2021 Musk after the decision held a poll on X to determine where SpaceX should be incorporated “The public vote is unequivocally in favor of Texas! Tesla will move immediately to hold a shareholder vote to transfer state of incorporation to Texas” Musk wrote According to BBC Tesla earlier moved its corporate headquarters to Texas in August 2021 What happens next? Elon Musk and the Tornetta on Tuesday asked the judge to pause her ruling until an appeal is resolved Varallo the shareholder’s attorney told Reuters the two sides will agree to a stay if they can reach a deal on an appeal bond The letter is the first indication that Musk intends to appeal the ruling to the Delaware Supreme Court “I’d give you very high odds on that” Varallo told CNBC Experts say Musk is extremely likely to challenge the ruling Kobi Kastiel a law professor at Tel Aviv University told CNBC “Given the high stakes involved it is likely that Tesla will appeal the decision” Kastiel said in an email The ruling comes as Tesla prepares another round of compensation negotiations with the CEO Musk said in a post on X this month that he was uncomfortable leading Tesla unless he had 25 per cent of the voting control The billionaire owned around 13 per cent of the company at the time and he said negotiations would not start until McCormick had ruled “Given the way she describes the board process - through the testimony of the directors - there is no way that his most recent demand for 25 per cent can get approved” Brian Quinn a professor at Boston College Law School said “It’s dead on arrival” Kastiel agreed In the absence of a successful appeal “any new compensation arrangement with him will have to be assessed” in light of McCormick’s decision Kastiel told CNBC Ross Gerber president and CEO at Gerber Kawasaki Wealth & Investment Management and a Tesla investor told Reuters the ruling showed the company needed to replace at least three directors with independent board members before it can negotiate a new pay package for Musk “Essentially the entire corporate structure of Tesla has been deemed like not appropriate for a public company” Gerber said But Kastiel said that’s easier said than done — particularly when a CEO like Musk is involved “As long as the CEO is perceived as a star and the company depends on the CEO’s vision and leadership even nominally independent directors — those without strong ties to the CEO — will have difficulty monitoring the CEO’s conduct” Kastiel told C_NBC_ “Plaintiffs may have a better chance of advancing their claims by potentially leveraging the Tornetta findings to argue that the majority of the Tesla board is not independent of Musk” he said “To mitigate this risk Tesla will need to significantly enhance the independence of its board and nominate new independent directors who do not have strong ties to Musk” Musk’s brain-chip implant company Neuralink also changed its location of incorporation from Delaware to Nevada last week With inputs from agencies Find us on YouTube is on YouTube Copyright @ 2024 Firstpost - All Rights Reserved"

small","2/3/2024","https://www.newindianexpress.com/business/2024/Feb/03/tesla-recalling-nearly-22m-vehicles-for-software-update-to-fix-warning-lights-that-are-too-small","DETROIT: Tesla is recalling nearly all of the vehicles it has sold in the US because some warning lights on the instrument panel are too small The recall of nearly 22 million vehicles announced Friday by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is a sign of stepped-up scrutiny of the electric vehicle maker The agency also said it has upgraded a 2023 investigation into Tesla steering problems to an engineering analysis a step closer to a recall Documents posted Friday by the agency say the warning light recall will be done with an online software update It covers the 2012 through 2023 Model S the 2016 through 2023 Model X the 2017 through 2023 Model 3 the 2019 through 2024 Model Y and the 2024 Cybertruck The agency says that the brake park and antilock brake warning lights have a smaller font size than required by federal safety standards That can make critical safety information hard to read increasing the risk of a crash Tesla has already started releasing the software update and owners will be notified by letter starting March 30 NHTSA says it found the problem in a routine safety compliance audit on Jan 8 Tesla has identified three warranty claims potentially related to the problem but has no reports of crashes or injuries Shares of Tesla Inc which have been in a downward trend since July and slumped after the company’s fourth quarter earnings report last week fell another 27% in early trading Friday to levels not seen since May of last year In December NHTSA pressured Tesla into recalling more than 2 million vehicles to update software and fix a defective system that’s supposed to ensure drivers are paying attention when using Autopilot Documents said the update will increase warnings and alerts to drivers The recall came after a two-year investigation by NHTSA into a series of crashes that happened while the Autopilot partially automated driving system was in use Some were deadly The agency says its investigation found Autopilot’s method of making sure that drivers are paying attention can be inadequate and can lead to “foreseeable misuse of the system” The added controls and alerts will “further encourage the driver to adhere to their continuous driving responsibility” the documents said But safety experts said that while the recall is a good step it still makes the driver responsible and doesn’t fix the underlying problem that Autopilot isn’t reacting to stopped vehicles They say that Tesla’s driver monitoring system that relies on detecting hands on the steering wheel doesn’t stop drivers from checking out Tesla says on its website that its Autopilot and “Full Self-Driving” systems cannot drive the vehicles and that human drivers must be ready to intervene at all times In February of last year NHTSA also pressed Tesla to recall nearly 363000 vehicles with its “Full Self-Driving” system because it can misbehave around intersections and doesn’t always follow speed limits The recall was part of part of a larger investigation into Tesla’s automated driving systems It raised questions about CEO Elon Musk’s claims that he can prove to regulators that cars equipped with “Full Self-Driving” are safer than humans and that humans almost never have to touch the controls Musk at one point had promised that a fleet of autonomous robotaxis would be in use in 2020 The latest action appears to push that development further into the future In addition Tesla is recalling more than 16 million Model S X 3 and Y electric vehicles exported to China for problems with their automatic assisted steering and door latch controls China’s State Administration for Market Regulation announced the recall in early January It said Tesla Motors in Beijing and Shanghai would use remote upgrades to fix the problems The recall is due to problems with the automatic steering assist function and applies to 16 million imported Tesla Model S Model X Model 3 and Model Ys When the automatic steering function is engaged drivers might misuse the combined driving function increasing a risk of accidents the notice said The recall to fix the door unlock logic control for imported Model S and Model X EVs affects 7538 vehicles made between Oct 26 2022 and Nov 16 2023 It is needed to prevent door latches from coming open during a collision Tesla was the top seller of electric vehicles in the world last year but China’s BYD beat the company in the fourth quarter BYD is the leader in the booming China market The steering investigation upgrade also announced Friday in documents covers more than 334000 Tesla vehicles The probe was opened in July of last year after the agency received a dozen complaints about loss of steering control in 2023 Model Y and 3 vehicles Now the agency says it has 115 complaints and it received another 2176 after requesting information from the company Agency documents say drivers are reporting loss of steering control often accompanied by messages showing that power assisted steering has been reduced or disabled Some complained of an inability to turn the steering wheel while others said it required more effort A message was left Friday seeking comment from Tesla In one case a driver told NHTSA that they couldn’t complete a right turn and ran into another vehicle The agency said there have been multiple allegations of Teslas blocking intersections or roadways Over 50 vehicles had to be towed according to the consumer complaints Many of the complaints reported the problem happened between 5 mph and 35 mph The highest reported speed that alleged an inability to turn was 75 mph the documents said The agency said it is looking into possible steering rack failures Follow The New Indian Express channel on WhatsApp Download the TNIE app to stay with us and follow the latest Copyright -

If youre looking for growth stocks that can help make you a millionaire keep reading Tesla and every other artificial intelligence (AI) stock cant make their technology without the help of one company and thats Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) Nvidia stock soared over the last year as its chips are in extraordinarily high demand from companies like OpenAI Oracle Meta Platforms and Tesla among others Nvidia which invented the graphics processing unit (GPU) has a significant head start over its rivals AI systems like OpenAis ChatGPT and autonomous vehicle systems like Teslas full self-driving rely on massive training models that use the kind of chips and accelerators Nvidia makes That strong demand should help power Nvidia stock higher this year as its coming off a third quarter in which revenue tripled year over year and its generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) profit rose by 12x As profits have soared the companys valuation has come down and it appears to be set for another strong year in 2024 as cloud infrastructure companies and others are still rapidly building out their AI infrastructure This should favor Nvidia Tesla made its name in electric vehicles but there are signs of slowing demand for EVs that could spell trouble for Tesla and its peers It also creates an opening for traditional automakers like General Motors (NYSE: GM) whose stocks got hammered as investors chased EV stocks and abandoned legacy automakers As a result GM stock now trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of just 5 GM may not offer the same growth potential that Tesla does but the company has a growing EV and autonomous vehicle (AV) business in Cruise whose rollout has taken a pause after San Francisco regulators suspended operations GM remains more profitable than Tesla and is reporting solid growth with a 14% increase in vehicles sold to 26 million Thats a strong growth clip for a mature business and from a stock priced for no growth Notably thats also significantly faster than Teslas Q4 revenue growth GMs low valuation also gives the company a greater opportunity to return cash to shareholders In fact the company announced a $10 billion accelerated share repurchase program in November and raised its dividend by 33% to $012 a share Considering the growth in its legacy car business and its investments in electric vehicles and autonomy GM should be able to bridge the gap with EVs and AVs when the time comes If GM delivers another strong earnings report the stock could soar Should you invest $1000 in Nvidia right now?

CEO Elon Musk wants the company to improve its sales in Japan Despite being a pioneering automaker the country has been slow to embrace EVs Japan bet early on hybrids and appears reluctant to move on Back in 2010 Elon Musk predicted that Japan would become Teslas largest market outside of the US But more than a decade later the EV maker isnt doing as well in the country as Musk had hoped There are some geographies where our market share is remarkably low like Japan Musk said in a fourth-quarter earnings call earlier this week We should at least have a market share proportionate to say other non-Japanese carmakers like Mercedes or BMW which we do not currently have he added But while Tesla is already up against major Japanese carmakers like Toyota Honda Suzuki and Nissan the reality is that all EV makers are struggling to make an impact in Japan EV sales have soared in recent years in the US and Europe but Japan has been slow to sell all-electric cars despite being one of the worlds biggest auto markets One reason for this is that hybrids have tended to dominate the Japanese market — sales of the cars beat out the combined share of gasoline and diesel cars for the first time in 2023 Bloomberg reported In Japan hybrids are popular because theyre affordable and reliable since they dont rely on the existence of strong charging infrastructure Bloomberg Intelligence senior auto analyst Tatsuo Yoshida said And leaders appear reluctant to pivot away from this strength to battery-powered alternatives Toyotas chairman and the head of Japans automotive association Akio Toyoda has previously accused the Japanese media of exaggerating the commercial and environmental advantages of EVs calling the benefits a mirage per The New York Times That hesitancy has also held back the development of charging infrastructure — there are only about 30000 EV charging connectors in the whole country — and kept price tags higher But Japanese carmakers do have some plans to boost their EV efforts Toyota has said it will roll out 30 battery electric vehicle models by 2030 while Honda wants EVs and hydrogen fuel cell cars to make up 100% of sales by 2040 Tesla and Toyota did not

In todays Market Clubhouse Morning Memo we will discuss SPY QQQ AAPL MSFT NVDA GOOGL META and TSLA Our proprietary formula exclusive to Market Clubhouse dictates these price levels This dynamic equation takes into account price volume and options flow These levels are updated every day and shared with all Clubhouse Members prior to the opening of the market We recommend closely monitoring these stocks and be prepared to leverage potential breakouts or reversals As always stay alert and ready to adjust your tactics based on the markets pulse to optimize your trading gains Now lets dive into the stock analysis: The SPY SPY is currently trading around our level of 48883 For those optimistic about the markets direction the initial target is 49011 Should the market sustain its momentum above this figure the next goal for buyers would be to elevate the price to 49170 Holding above 49170 during the trading day could set the stage for an upward move towards 49324 The ultimate objective for bullish traders today is reaching 49596 Conversely if the SPY fails to maintain 48883 as a support level the market may see a downward trend initiated by the bears aiming for 48754 A confirmation of bearish momentum could lead to further declines towards 48571 A breach of this level amid intense selling pressure might expose 48338 as a critical support point In a scenario marked by pronounced bearish activity the days lowest target for the bears is set at 48141 The QQQ ETF QQQ is hovering around a pivotal point at 41989 Bullish participants are eyeing a climb past 42216 with hopes of solidifying this as a new support base Success in this endeavor could pave the way for a move to 42327 and with sustained buying interest 42482 might come into play A robust trading session could potentially lead to a challenge of 42664 with the days bullish apex at 42850 Should the QQQ struggle to stay above 41989 bearish forces might dominate pushing the price down to 41849 Any sign of weakness could further entice bears to drive the price down to 41623 Persistent seller activity could challenge the support at 41420 and if this fails to hold the next target for bears is 41259 marking the days lowest anticipated level Apples AAPL stock is currently positioned at 18699 Bulls are aiming to keep this level as the floor with aspirations to push towards 18820 A continuation of upward momentum could lead to a test of 18944 Should the bulls maintain their grip on the market we could anticipate an ascent to the days high target for Apple at 19157 If Apples stock cannot find footing at 18699 a decline to 18586 may be imminent Further bearish pressure could lead the stock to 18496 and if the downtrend persists 18409 might come under threat A significant bearish push beyond this point could see the stock descending to the days bearish extremity at 18227 Microsoft MSFT is trading around 40274 with bulls hoping to sustain the price above 40492 Achieving this could lead to a rally towards 40601 which bulls would want to establish as a new support level A successful hold could see the price targeting 40846 with the ultimate bullish goal for the day set at 41064 If Microsofts shares cannot hold 40274 as a support the price may retreat to 40030 A breakdown below this level could prompt bears to target 39765 Continued downward pressure might lead to a test of 39568 with the days bearish floor at 39347 NVIDIA NVDA is navigating around the 61036 mark Bulls are keen on propelling the price to 61603 aiming to establish it as a robust support zone An upward trajectory could see 61963 in play with the potential for a surge towards the days high bull target at 62489 In the event that 61036 does not hold the bears might push for a test of 60588 A breach here could lead to further declines towards 60139 Weak market sentiment could see the price testing 59500 with the bearish boundary for the day set at 59044 Alphabets GOOGL shares are trading near 14253 Bulls are looking to secure 14377 as a support base potentially driving the price up to 14472 With sustained bullish momentum the market could be looking at reaching a high target of 14594 If Alphabet fails to maintain support at 14253 a move down to 14171 could be on the horizon A break below this level might see bears targeting 14057 with the potential for a further slide to the days bear low at 13946 Meta META is positioned around 38841 The bullish scenario involves holding above 39134 with a subsequent rise to 39435 Continued positive market sentiment could lead to 39615 with the days high target set at 39984 Should Meta fail to sustain 38841 as a base the price could fall to 38609 Persistent selling pressure might drive the stock down to 38411 and in the event of a significant bearish push the lowest target for the day is 38235 Tesla TSLA is currently at 18610 Bulls are aiming to drive the price towards 18922 with hopes of a further rally to 19381 A bullish market environment could see Tesla testing 19591 with an ambitious high target for the day at 20043 If Tesla cannot maintain 18610 as a stronghold a decline to 18253 may follow Continued bearish momentum could bring 17979 into focus and a substantial sell-off might result in reaching the days bear low at 17634 Final Word: Todays trading session is highly anticipated due to the FOMC rate decision at 2 PM EST followed by Jerome Powells press conference at 2:30 PM EST Although the market has seemingly adjusted for a pause in todays rate decision Powells comments on future rate cuts are

In this article I look at each of the companys AI endeavors qualitatively to better understand the kind of advantage if any Tesla has in this segment In my last Tesla article I quantified the value of Teslas side projects to see just how much the company could be worth by 2030 Today however I want to dive deeper into the qualitative assessment of Musks recent claims that Tesla should be viewed as an AI and robotics company If that is indeed the case what are Teslas main products and value propositions aside from cars? What are its competitive advantages? And who are its main competitors? Given the latest results I am still bullish on the future of the company but I am moving to a buy rating given the poorer outlook for the business in this last quarter and for 2024 The latest earnings were disappointing to many investors and though the stock sold off we have seen somewhat of a recovery since the release Financial Summary (Investor slides) Financial Summary (Investor slides) As we can see automotive revenues for the full year grew a measly 15% However we saw a 54% increase in energy storage and 37% in services I think the biggest issue for investors was the reduction in operating margins which peaked in 2022 and have come down significantly this year Operational Summary (Investor slides) Operational Summary (Investor slides) In terms of production its also quite discouraging to see the fact that the Model Y is the only car that grew this year with production in other models down 12% Some of this can be attributed to the companys hard-fought road to get the Cybertruck out It remains to be seen if this will pay off: As long as the price is affordable I mean I see us ultimately delivering on the order of 025 million something like 025 million Cybertrucks a year in North America maybe more But give or take roughly on that time frame and it sure is a head-turner Source: Elon Musk Q4 earnings transcript A bold statement from Musk but 2024 still seems like it could be a tough year Vehicle production is expected to be notably lower in 2024 as the company transitions to a more efficient model Musk and Tesla have always had high ambitions Did they bite off more than they could chew? 2024 will hold the answer but even I have concerns over the more immediate outlook for the company A few years ago Tesla was an absolute pioneer in electric vehicles It was thought that the company could easily dominate market share in foreign regions like Europe and China but the reality has been far from this Europe Market Share (Zoltan Ban SA Article) Europe Market Share (Zoltan Ban SA Article) Over in Europe Tesla has amassed a 127% market share throughout the first nine months of 2023 The European automakers have caught on to the EV trend fast and now pose a very significant competitive threat to Tesla The situation in Europe was very well covered in this article by my fellow SA contributor Zoltan Ban But the situation seems to be even worse in China NEV sales china 2023 (CPCA) NEV sales china 2023 (CPCA) EV competition has been even more fierce in China than anywhere else New small competitors have popped up everywhere and Tesla is already second to the unchallengeable BYD BYD Auto is a subsidiary of BYD Company (OTCPK:BYDDF) a Chinese multinational manufacturing company It was founded in 2003 and released its first car in 2005 Since 2020 the company has seen a great acceleration in growth as it has taken the Chinese market by storm and it now has plans to debut its first model in Europe Still it looks like in 2023 Tesla maintained a solid second place Well based on the most recent data Tesla is quickly slipping NEV sales China January 2024 (CPCA) NEV sales China January 2024 (CPCA) In January Tesla ranked fifth in terms of market share with Geely (OTCPK:GELYF) Changan and SAIC all moving ahead Bear in mind China accounted for 225% of Teslas revenues in 2023 This is a huge market for Tesla and one that it is losing its grip on And thats not even mentioning all the geopolitical risks of doing business in China Such a high concentration of revenue in China is definitely a problem With the latest 2023 numbers in the rearview mirror one thing is clear: Tesla needs to do more The company has always commanded a premium valuation and this can no longer be justified on EV hype alone Tesla Market cap vs other automakers (Wolf street) Tesla Market cap vs other automakers (Wolf street) At one point Teslas market cap equalled that of most of its main competitors Now it is true that right now market cap sits around $600 billion but that would still be more than its four largest competitors combined Its time for Tesla to take the next steps in developing its software and AI initiatives and really show investors how and when these will begin to pay off While we continue to execute on innovations to reduce the cost of manufacturing and operations over time we expect our hardware-related profits to be accompanied by an acceleration of AI software and fleet-based profits Source: Press Release In fact Musk himself has been very clear in recent weeks that he wants to make Tesla a leading company in AI and robotics and in order to do so he wants to increase his position in the company I am uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in AI and robotics without having 25% voting control Source: Elon Musk on X AI has been talked about a lot in the last year; it was again a central part of the Tesla earnings call and it will no doubt define Teslas future So lets go ahead and analyze Teslas AI roadmap which I have broken down here into three distinct initiatives Teslas Dojo supercomputer made headlines when it was released at Teslas AI day in August 2021 Dojo is only one of the two ways in which Tesla is currently trying to achieve full self-driving (FSD) technology The Dojo could be seen as an alternative to Teslas primary GPU cluster using Nvidia (NVDA) chips The Dojo supercomputer runs on Teslas custom-designed D1 chips produced by Taiwan Semiconductor aka TSMC (TSM) The Dojo supercomputer is used to train machine-learning models that support Teslas self-driving technology At one point Dojo was valued at a potential $500 billion by Morgan Stanley However its very important to note that Elon Musk has really tempered down the expectations on Dojo in the last earnings call And were pursuing the dual path of Nvidia and Dojo But I would think of Dojo as a long shot Its a long shot worth taking because the payoff is potentially very high But its not something that is a high probability Its not like a sure thing at all Its a high-risk high-payoff program Dojo is working and it is doing training jobs and we are scaling it up and we have plans for Dojo 15 Dojo 2 Dojo 3 and whatnot So I think its got potential but I cant emphasize enough High risk high payoff Source: Elon Musk earnings call transcript High-risk high-reward When Musk says something is a high-risk long shot I take it to mean it is highly improbable With that said FSD isnt a long shot Core technology (Investor slides) Core technology (Investor slides) The companys FSD software continues to accumulate driven miles quarter after quarter and this is a testament to Teslas key advantage in this area Each Tesla the company sells is a walking and talking computer sending very valuable data back to the company Musk himself has talked about the fact that Tesla could be selling cars at a loss and it would still be generating huge value This value lies in the network of cars that are roaming the street which are feeding Teslas machine learning models and could potentially one day even operate as a huge fleet of robot-taxis and perhaps even more …I mean theres a potentially interesting play where when cars are not in use in the future that the in-car computer can do generalized AI tasks can run a sort of GPT-4 or GPT-3 or something like that If youve got tens of millions of vehicles out there even in a robotaxi scenario where theyre in heavy use maybe theyre used 50 out of 168 hours that still leaves well over 100 hours of time available -- of compute hours Its possible with the right architectural decisions that Tesla may in the future have more compute than everyone else combined Source: Elon Musk earnings call transcript Thats certainly an interesting notion Its possible that one day Teslas cars will literally be used for much more This is still a long way away but it can give us some insights into what Musks vision is Teslas Optimus robot is in my opinion an underappreciated project A lot of people see this as a gimmick but the potential market moving forward in robotics is huge especially once we fully integrate it with AI Optimus obviously is a very new product an extremely revolutionary product and something that I think has the potential to potential to far exceed the value of everything else that Tesla combined When you think of an economy economy is productivity per capita times capita But what if theres no limit to capita? Theres no limit to the economy Source: Elon Musk earnings call transcript The Optimus Gen 2 is a humanoid robot that can walk and perform some everyday tasks Clearly this is an initiative with tons of potential A few weeks ago Musk actually took the Optimus 2 on a walk around the Tesla factory The robotics industry could grow to over 270 billion by 2032 And as mentioned by Musk in the earnings call Tesla is arguably already the largest robot maker in the world as in essence cars are four-wheeled robots With that said competitors are already at Teslas heels with Microsoft (MSFT) and Figure AI already in talks to raise $500 million for FigureAI a competing humanoid robot Again we cant deny that Tesla does hold a competitive advantage in this segment Even if arguably OpenAI and Microsoft can produce a better AI the larger hurdle will be production something that Tesla has a lot of experience in Again arguably a lot of the infrastructure they already possess could be repurposed to scale up the production of humanoid robots and other types of robotics Teslas energy business is booming with energy deployment increasing by 125% in 2023 Energy storage (Investor slides) Energy storage (Investor slides) By itself the energy business is already another reason to be bullish on Tesla Its not crazy to think that this could one day contribute as much in revenue as car manufacturing But theres even more to this I see the energy segment as another area where Tesla can leverage the best from its software and machine learning In fact the company is already doing this through the Tesla Autobidder which provides energy users with a way of monetizing their energy assets The autobidder is a real-time algorithm that optimizes energy operations It is part of the larger Energy Software that Tesla calls Autonomous control According to a Tesla employee the autobidder has a global portfolio of 7GWh of battery storage and has generated over $330 million in profits to its users As we know energy production especially when it comes to renewables is only a small part of education Storage and distribution are even more important and Tesla is making great leaps in this department Its important to note that Dojo and Optimus do not currently produce any revenue for the company But can they? The Dojo supercomputer could be the base for the companys FSD technology which would initially help Tesla increase service revenues Tesla would probably charge a subscription in order to access FSD Goldman Sachs predicts FSD could contribute as much as $75 billion in revenues by 2030 This would be level one The second level would be leveraging each car in a fleet of robo-taxis which Musk has also alluded to and the third level would be simply harnessing the raw computing power of each car which Musk alluded to in the last earnings call Of course any revenues from these two would probably take years to materialize Id be looking at a time frame beyond 2030 Moving on to the Optimus its also very hard to value this segment but we can give it a shot Robotics is becoming a very important technology Just look at the current trend in Amazon (AMZN) Amazon employees vs robots (blogfinxter) Amazon employees vs robots (blogfinxter) Robots could one day even outstrip humans in the workforce For the time being though I think humanoid robots could become as ubiquitous as phones Apple (AAPL) one of the most dominant companies sells close to 230 million new phones per year This seems like an achievable target for the Optimus eventually Optimus projections (finxter) Optimus projections (finxter) We can estimate that revenues could be close to $4 trillion with a sale price of $20000 Lastly looking at the energy segment As shown in the investor slides above this contributed $6 billion in revenue in 2023 with a projected gross margin of 25% gross margins by segment (Heller House) gross margins by segment (Heller House) By my previous calculations energy could add almost $55 billion in gross profits by 2030 but this doesnt even take into account the added revenues that could come from integrating AI technology like the autobidder which is already adding significant value Following the latest earnings results it should be clear to everyone that Teslas car business is slowing down in terms of growth and will likely fail to produce meaningful margins Anyone interested in buying at todays price is taking a leap of faith in Musks AI vision I see some similarities between Musks moves and what Amazon did with AWS or perhaps a more recent comparison can be made between Musk and MicroStrategys (MSTR) Saylor Saylor went all in on Bitcoin (BTC-USD) and at least today that bet is paying off Musks Tesla has the right ingredients to become a leading AI and robotics company Good software manufacturing infrastructure a visionary CEO and plenty of talent amongst its ranks But will this be enough?

ALEXIS KEENAN: Yeah Rochelle So this other case it was a pending case now just decided this week and it very well might have an impact on what Tesla decides to do here What happened was the shareholders similarly challenged this company Tripadvisor went ahead and voted on a move from Delaware to Nevada where it has more friendly rules for board directors in terms of liabilities that they can take on if theyre challenged Now that though decision said that the company could go ahead move to Nevada incorporate there but the real kicker here is that the judge said the lawsuit it can continue And if during the pendency of that lawsuit the shareholders who brought it are able to show that they were damaged by this move and that they should receive some sort of monetary compensation that that would allow the case to go forward and for the shareholders to get really their day in court So all of this-- a lot in the mix here yet Tesla has yet to make any move that weve seen to put forth a recommendation to its shareholders But so much to consider here and certainly would be a big move for Tesla if it does decide to go ahead with a suggestion here RACHELLE AKUFFO: And I know youll be following all of that action for us appreciate you breaking all of that down Our very own Alexis Keenan Related Quotes"

To sell more cars of course But they’re not the only beneficiaries Like Tesla Superchargers CCS fast chargers allow an EV to regain up to 80% of its range in about 15–30 minutes This makes long-distance road trips practical in an EV But even after several years building out their networks no single high-speed charging network yet approaches Tesla’s in size Using data provided by the US Department of Energy Electrify America the second largest network in the US currently has 918 CCS fast charging stations with 4133 ports in the US and Canada Meanwhile Tesla has 2393 Supercharger locations in the US and Canada with 26515 charging ports Even if we look at the sum of all CCS chargers in the US and Canada there are currently only 16995 CCS charging ports: Tesla has almost 40% more high-speed chargers than all the CCS charging networks combined There are currently more CCS charging stations (8475 vs 2407) but fewer actual charging ports But more important than the number of stations is the performance and reliability of these charging stations CCS charging networks like Electrify America have been plagued with performance and reliability issues EA chargers are frequently non-functional or are “de-rated” meaning they deliver power at much lower rates than they should This unreliability has led to an overall lack of confidence in the high-speed charging networks from EV owners and prospective EV buyers Although there are signs that this is improving the damage has been done Meanwhile Tesla’s Supercharger network enjoys the highest reliability and satisfaction ratings of any high-speed charging network Generally speaking Tesla Superchargers are fast and reliable and that’s critical for EV drivers particularly those traveling far from home The benefit to Ford customers is clear: access to Tesla Superchargers allows Ford EV owners to charge at the great majority of DC fast charging stations in the US and Canada This allows Ford EV drivers to travel long distances with confidence It also gives Ford EV owners without the ability to charge at home or at work more convenient charging options To take advantage of this new capability to charge at Tesla Superchargers Ford EV owners need to request the Tesla/NACS to CCS adapter from Ford at fordcom/FastChargingAdapter The adapter is free for retail customers until June 30 2024 or $230 after that date The customer then needs to create an account on Ford’s BlueOval charging network and activate the “Plug & Charge” feature Tesla Superchargers will support Plug&Charge with Ford EVs This means customers simply have to plug in and charging will automatically start with charges managed through FordPass This is similar to the way Tesla owners currently charge at Superchargers Ford owners will have access to all of Tesla’s V3 and V4 Supercharging stations which currently account for approximately 75% of Tesla’s Supercharger stations in North America All of the new Supercharger stations Tesla is rolling out now are Version 3 or Version 4 so these should all be eligible for use by Ford and other non-Tesla EVs using an adapter Ford also announced that existing customers can now use the FordPass App or the Charge Assist (soon to be “Public Charge”) App on the vehicle touchscreen to locate all chargers just like before but this now includes Tesla Superchargers Integration of Tesla Superchargers into the car’s built-in routing will come with a future software update By opening the Tesla Supercharger network to Ford EV drivers and other non-Tesla owners Tesla is able to increase its Supercharger revenue which then funds the construction of more Supercharger stations Non-Tesla customers are charged a higher charging rate than Tesla customers in order to accommodate the higher cost associated with supporting third party vehicles Non-Tesla owners who wish to charge at the lower Tesla owner rate can sign up for a monthly Supercharging subscription (currently $1299/month) This subscription option will lead to additional revenue for the company An additional benefit to Tesla customers is that by Tesla opening the Tesla/NACS plug to become an industry standard — and by having all of the major EV makers adopt this standard — the “Tesla plug” will also start being included in third party DC fast chargers All of the major DC fast charging networks — including Electrify America ChargePoint and EVGo — have announced that they will be adding NACS plugs to existing and new fast charging stations This means Tesla drivers will soon have hundreds perhaps even thousands of additional non-Tesla fast charging stations available to them without the need to purchase a CCS adapter In my case my Model 3 is too old (2018) to support CCS charging without a retrofit so I’m looking forward to having more high-speed charging options available Some Tesla owners are concerned that opening up the Tesla Supercharger network will lead to congestion and long lines at Tesla Superchargers and while this is possible it is unlikely It’s important to keep in mind that Tesla is still the dominant player in the US EV market Tesla sold more EVs in the US in 2023 than all of its competitors combined Tesla’s EV market share in 2023 was 55% Meanwhile Ford’s EV market share in the US in 2023 was 55% So for every 10 Teslas sold in the US in 2023 1 Ford EV was sold This is not a significant increase in Supercharger demand Even as other EV manufacturers like GM and others begin offering CCS adapters the increase in Supercharger demand will not spike overnight Most EV owners charge their cars at home or at work and only need access to high-speed chargers while traveling With a few exceptions Tesla has managed to stay ahead of the demand for Supercharger stations consistently building out the Supercharger network so that Tesla customers can use their cars for long-distance travel without incurring unnecessary delays I recently completed a 6000-mile road trip from New York City to Tacoma Washington and back in my Model 3 and found myself alone (or close to it) at dozens of Supercharger stations across the US In some major cities and around major holidays (particularly in cold weather) some Tesla drivers have had to wait to charge their cars but this is the exception not the rule With Tesla’s charging port becoming an industry standard it has become easier for the company to qualify for federal grants to build out the country’s EV charging infrastructure as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law Tesla recently secured $17 million in government grants to build out 41 additional Supercharger stations in the United States along major travel corridors With this influx in infrastructure investment Tesla should be able to keep up with increased Supercharger demand Also Tesla drivers still have exclusive access to around 25% of the Tesla Superchargers in North America In order to open up Tesla chargers to CCS-equipped vehicles Tesla had to modify the “signaling protocol” which is the communication between the vehicle and the charger This change was only made in the company’s V3 chargers and above Tesla’s V1 and V2 Superchargers do not support cars with CCS charge ports (with or without an adapter) V2 chargers are limited to a maximum charging speed of 150 kW (compared to V3’s 250 kW max) but this is still fast enough for road trips for most people or good for the occasional local top-off when needed Moving forward all Tesla Superchargers are likely to be V3 V4 (and beyond) but the 870 V1 and V2 Supercharging stations in North America will not be accessible by non-Tesla vehicles any time soon One of the only remaining — and somewhat legitimate — criticisms of current-generation electric vehicles is that they are not suitable for road trips This has never been my personal experience in six years and 65000 miles owning a Tesla I actually don’t mind stopping a little more frequently than I used to in my gas car and I’ve never had a problem finding an available Supercharger along my travel routes But for EV drivers who don’t own a Tesla the lack of reliable high-speed charging options has limited their vehicles’ overall utility Now Ford EV owners — and soon others — will have the same piece of mind that I and millions of other Tesla owners have when driving long distances in our EVs Range anxiety has left the building With the adoption of the NACS charging port by all major EV manufacturers and the opening of Tesla’s extensive and reliable high-speed Supercharger network to non-Tesla EVs current and prospective EV owners can feel more confident that they will always have access to chargers when and where they need them This removes one of the last remaining barriers for many car owners to purchase an EV With increasing EV demand and continued public and private investment in building up the charging infrastructure the US is on a clear path to replacing harmful ICE vehicles with emissions-free EVs Got thoughts on how this impacts the EV market or your own personal EV journey?

in the future of Earth But eco-conscious initiatives can be incredibly lucrative in terms of financial returns too If they have the potential for mainstream adoption sustainability projects can bring attractive profits to early investors A good example is eTukTuk – an electric vehicle ecosystem crafted to transform the TukTuk public transportation sector in developing economies eTukTuk puts forward an innovative cryptocurrency initiative with the goal of dismantling the obstacles hindering the widespread adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) Although there are numerous EV projects that operate with a broad scope eTukTuk strategically narrows down its focus on emerging economies Its approach proves highly effective given the prevalence of EV platforms catering to developed economies Due to their substantial investment costs these platforms are inaccessible to individuals from poor and middle-class backgrounds The financial barrier stands in the way of the mass adoption of EV technologies posing challenges to fighting global issues such as climate change and air pollution To implement meaningful solutions we need initiatives that transcend geographical and financial borders eTukTuk empowers the electric vehicle (EV) sector to permeate developing economies It assists the transition of public transportation in these nations toward green technologies powered by electricity This is achieved by strategically focusing on optimization by targeting TukTuks a widely used mode of public transportation Beyond their accessibility TukTuks are also notorious as significant contributors to air pollution in developing nations The focused approach enables eTukTuk to make a substantial and positive impact in the EV sector eTukTuks are electric adaptations of traditional TukTuks that feature green technology alongside integrated AI and blockchain functionalities On the financial front eTukTuk drivers stand to significantly increase their income up to 400%

Please place your bets now The Tesla Model Y won another monthly best seller title with over 128000 deliveries Expect the Model Y to continue racking up a series of monthly best seller titles in 2024 as the midsize crossover is now in full maturity this year With a refresh coming around April expect 2024 to be the best year of the current generation’s career Just below the BYD Song was again runner-up hitting a record 76086 registrations That could possibly be its peak performance given that the just-landed Song L will steal a significant volume of sales from it in 2024 as will the future Sea Lion BYD’s real Tesla Model Y competitor The last place on the podium went to the Model 3 which had more than 56000 deliveries ending well ahead of the #4 BYD Qin Plus Off the podium the highlight is the #8 Wuling Bingo Thanks to its continuous production ramp-up the small EV seems ready to go neck and neck with the BYD Armada for top 5 positions in 2024 And BYD sure needs some competition… Going up a notch when it comes to size the compact category saw two models shining First was the #15 VW ID3 which thanks to some aggressive price cuts in China saw its fortunes change completely in that market compensating for the so-so performances of the model in Europe In December the ID3 reached 17861 sales its best score since the artificial 28000 sales of December 2020 (when Volkswagen basically dumped thousands of ID3s on dealerships in order to comply with emission requirements) So one can say that this December result is in reality a record performance Now all the German brand needs is to fix (as in cut prices significantly) its European operations and it could get the ID3 into the top 10 The other category highlight was SAIC’s MG4 (MG Mulan in China) with the good looking hatchback scoring 12964 sales in December its second record score in a row It looks we will start to see this value for money EV more regularly on the table Chip in a few dollars a month to help support independent cleantech coverage that helps to accelerate the cleantech revolution! Being a record month record performances haven’t stopped here In fact the most significant record scores came in the full size category with the highlights being the fact that the whole Li Auto lineup reached record heights (20428 units for the L7 15013 for the L8 and 14913 for the L9) which meant that the hot startup scored over 50000 units in December alone! And that was in only the full size category The most immediate victim was BYD still the category leader in 2023 which saw sales of its full size duo (Han/Tang) pale next to Li Auto with some 33000 combined units With this in mind Li’s current profit margin per unit sold must be among the best in the industry… And still December’s best selling full size model was neither a BYD nor a Li Auto but a model from another make It was the #10 AITO M7 which had an amazing 25545 deliveries! With Huawei putting the whole weight of its strength into the AITO brand sales are jumping through the roof Clearly Huawei is looking to replicate Li Auto’s formula If someone is looking for an underdog that will surprise everyone in 2024 this could be it Interestingly all of the 20 models present here are being made in China — 16 belong to Chinese OEMs and 7 come from BYD alone These stats speak volumes to the importance of the Chinese market in the broader EV industry Outside the top 20 there is also a lot to talk about Going by size category the little Geely Panda Mini was close to joining the table having ended the month fewer than 300 units behind the #20 BYD Tang The compact Audi Q4 e-tron was also close with 11260 registrations In the midsize category SUVs are on trend with several record performers the most surprising of which was the Volvo XC60 PHEV After several years on the market it reached a record 7868 registrations in December Lynk & Co saw its 08 PHEV reach 10055 registrations SAIC’s IM brand is ramping up its LS6 midsize SUV (9878 registrations in only its 4th month on the market) and Changan is doing the same with its Deepal S7 (11360 registrations) But because not everyone likes SUVs the recent Wuling Starlight a rather stylish sedan coming from the SGMW joint venture seems to be on track for success having gotten 8050 deliveries in December With all the talk of GM investing in PHEVs maybe the OEM could bring the production of the Wuling Starlight to the USA as a Chevrolet maybe? I will even give them one suggestion after having the Chevy Volt and the Bolt why not the Chevy Jolt? (Editor’s note: A Chevy fan had the idea for this several years ago and even created a fake webpage for it which is still live! See — sometimes the internet is a cool place —Zach) Regarding the full size category the highlight is coming from the USA (surprise!) with the Jeep Grand Cherokee PHEV (surprise surprise!) reaching a record 7299 registrations That might not sound like much especially compared to the 25000 registrations of the AITO M7 but it was enough to be the best selling full size model not made in China Finally a special mention goes out to BMW The i4 continued to ramp up deliveries reaching another record score of 11203 registrations in December This allowed it to be the best selling EV without production in China Still the BMW fastback has a long way to go in order to become relevant in the midsize category After all despite this constant improvement the electric BMW only had about one fifth of the sales of the best selling midsize sedan in December (the Tesla Model 3 — 56896 registrations) But the good news does not end there for BMW The compact IX1 is also on a records streak and reached 8775 registrations its 3rd record in a row while the big iX SUV also shined with 7027 deliveries With the rather good looking i5 in ramp-up mode expect the German models to continue being mentioned here in 2024 In the final 2023 table the Tesla Model Y again had the highest place on the podium with 12 million registrations That allowed it to be the best selling model not only in the EV category but also on the mainstream market! This 12 million volume represented a 57% increase over the 771000 units registered in 2022 Expect it to again be the main candidate for the global leadership position in 2024 ahead of globetrotters like the Toyota Corolla and Toyota RAV4 The podium was the same as in 2022 with the BYD Song beating the Tesla Model 3 and taking the silver medal The Chinese SUV ended the year with 636000 registrations 33% progress over 2022 As for the #3 Tesla Model 3 it ended with 529000 registrations its best result ever Still despite the recent refresh this is a model at full maturity Not only has the sedan seen its market share erode (14% in 2019; 12% in 2020; 8% in 2021 47% in 2022 39% this year) but its sales have basically stagnated since 2021 the year when the sedan had 501000 registrations its best result until now So the 529000 registrations of 2023 represented a 6% increase over 2021 In the same period the plugin market jumped from 66 million units to 137 million units more than 100% So yes there are market limits to how much a given model can grow By the way for reference the best sales year for the BMW 3 Series was 2007 when it had 555000 registrations and the Toyota Camry’s sales record isn’t that much higher than that so 529000 units is a great result for a midsize sedan The problem is that the demand ceiling is sitting just a little bit above it So the medals went to Tesla (gold for the Model Y and bronze for the Model 3) and BYD (silver for the Song) Below the podium we have a squad of BYD models (#4 Qin Plus; #5 Yuan Plus/Atto 3; #6 Dolphin; #7 Seagull) In the case of the small EV it profited from another great performance in December to jump two spots into 7th thus putting five BYDs in the top 7 positions with the other two spots being filled by Tesla This is further proof that these two brands are really in a different league… In the second half of the table let’s note one last-minute position change The VW ID3 was up one position to 15th This was a great year for the German hatchback having seen its sales jump 79% compared to 2022 — to 139000 units — the first time it crossed the 100000 units mark All thanks to the Chinese operations… GAC’s Aion Y and S also had great years having seen their sales almost double but the real climbers were the Li Auto models The startup placed all three full size models in the top 20! Li Auto’s and more recently AITO’s successes have made a dent in the full size leaders The BYD Han did win another full size category title followed by its sibling the Tang allowing BYD to have another #1 plus #2 win in the full size category But the truth is that both models saw their sales drop in 2023 by 17% for the Han and 7% for the Tang In 2024 it will be much harder for BYD to retain the full size category title Finally while there were four legacy OEM models in the table in 2022 (VW ID4 Hyundai Ioniq 5 Ford Mustang Mach-E Kia EV6) there are now only two Both came from Volkswagen Group (#12 VW ID4 and #15 VW ID3) Adding the #21 Audi Q4 e-tron into the mix we have the top three legacy OEM models in 2023 coming from the German conglomerate Which says a lot about how far ahead they are from the remaining legacy OEMs… Here’s a look at the 2023 segment winners: A-segment/City Cars — This is all about Chinese EVs The #7 BYD Seagull stole the category title from the hands of the #8 Wuling Mini EV in December which is major news in this category The Changan Lumin was 3rd this year but it ended far from the top two It seems clear that the 2024 winner is already chosen — the BYD Seagull should take the title without a sweat B-segment/Subcompacts — Another example of the Chinese takeover: In 2021 there was a French model (Renault Zoe) on top followed by a Korean (Hyundai Kona EV) Since then the Chinese models have taken over This year the leader was by far the #7 BYD Dolphin followed by the#13 Wuling Bingo a welcome surprise The Peugeot e-208 was 3rd but it was far far FAR away from the top two with the French hatchback collecting just 51000 registrations more than 100000 units below the Bingo and some 300000 units behind the leader the Dolphin C-segment/Compacts — This category was Volkswagen’s turf in 2021 with the ID4 on top followed by the smaller ID3 But in 2022 the title went to the BYD Yuan Plus/Atto 3 and this year it was no different with the crossover ending with some 419000 registrations doubling last year’s result! The BYD EV was followed by the MPV-disguised-as-a-crossover GAC Aion Y which took silver thanks to 236000 registrations In the last position on the podium we have the #12 VW ID4 (up 11% YoY to 193000 registrations) For 2024 expect an interesting race between the top two Although the BYD Yuan Up a smaller and above all cheaper sibling to the Yuan Plus could be a surprise D-segment/Midsize — This is Tesla’s turf The #1 Model Y was on top up 57% compared to 2022 and the Model 3 was in third Between these two we had the #2 BYD Song (up 33% YoY) bringing hope to the competition Still the category winner for 2024 has already been found: the Tesla Model Y E/F-segments/Full Size — Three Chinese models were on top here with the #10 BYD Han (228000 registrations) #14 BYD Tang (142000 registrations) and #17 Li Xiang L7 (134000 registrations) taking the top spots If someone from Li Auto or AITO is looking for a podium position in 2024 they’d better have production capabilities for at least 150000 units/year because that should be the bare minimum to get there And the title winner will probably end up north of 300000 units by end of year Pickup Trucks — This was the second year that this category had relevant numbers with around 52000 registrations in 2022 This is not worlds apart from the 36000 registrations of 2022 Still it is a 44% increase so not too bad… Unlike 2022 when the Rivian R1T (16074 registrations) narrowly beat the Ford F-150 Lightning (15625 registrations) this year things were the other way around And actually Ford won by a sizable margin — the Ford model had 25000 deliveries while the Rivian was stuck at 15000 In 3rd we have a new Chinese pickup truck Geely’s Radar RD6 with 4736 registrations Will Tesla’s Cybertruck steal the show in 2024? I believe so Even if Tesla delivers a low number of units in 2024 say 55000 units Ford’s F-150 Lightning is not likely to reach 50000 units in 2024 so … I would be surprised if Tesla didn’t take this category’s title in 2024 LCVs/Vans — With data being less precise and a wide variety of models and body types it is wiser to look at this category by OEM In this case Stellantis is the winner with 47000 registrations followed by Hyundai–Kia (41000) and Ford (20000) Finally a few quick notes on fuel cell vehicles 9511 units were registered in 2023 a drop of 38% compared to 2022 which itself had been a drop from 2021 the year FCEVs reached their peak (15434 registrations) This year the Hyundai Nexo (5000 registrations) has again beaten the Toyota Mirai (4000 registrations) thanks to its relative success in its native South Korea Always interested in the auto industry particularly in electric cars Jose has been overviewed the sales evolution of plug-ins on the EV Sales blog allowing him to gain an expert view on where EVs are right now and where they are headed in the future The EV Sales blog has become a go-to source for people interested in electric car sales around the world Extending that work and expertise Jose is also market analyst on EV-Volumes and works with the European Alternative Fuels Observatory on EV sales matters José Pontes has 469 posts and counting See all posts by José Pontes"

475,"None","1/11/2024","https://www.businessinsider.com/renting-tesla-from-hertz-what-it-was-like-experience-2024-1","In my first few minutes inside a Hertz waiting room in Ann Arbor Michigan I quickly realized I wasnt the first person here to try test-driving an electric vehicle through a rental service One of the men in front of me was asking the rep about his options — a Tesla a Volvo a Chevy He wanted to know what set each car apart what each one looked like and what the pricing was for each When the worker went to the back to look for something the man turned to someone nearby and explained he really hated Elon Musk and didnt want to rent a Tesla if he didnt have to A conversation in the waiting room followed with a spirited debate (well as spirited as a bunch of polite Midwesterners get) about the pros and cons of Elon Musk and Tesla After that it was my turn to pick up my Model 3 I thought the employee might find it amusing after all the Tesla talk in the waiting room — but he wasnt fazed He must do tons of these a day I figured The experience that followed reflected some of the headaches that may have led to Thursdays decision by Hertz to sell off 20000 EVs from its fleet citing higher costs to service and repair The physical credit card needed for my booking was on the other side of town My fault for not reading the fine print and assuming I didnt need the card if I had paid ahead of time and also not a dealbreaker When I came back 40 minutes later with the credit card it only took a few minutes to complete the transaction and have the Model 3 pulled around I was prepared to get a walk-around of the car or maybe some kind of quick run-down on how to use an EV or how to charge it Instead the Hertz rep handed me the Tesla key card and sat back down at his desk I sat there for a moment before turning around to see my Model 3 parked out front Oh there it is! I said And I walked out to the car by myself Because Id driven a Tesla before I already knew how to tap the card to unlock the car and get in Im not sure a first-time Tesla driver would know that off the bat For what its worth Hertz did email me some instructional videos about my Model 3 a few days before I picked up my rental I found it buried in my inbox after I had the car and these videos did help me quickly troubleshoot issues such as adjusting my side-view mirrors My reservation quoted me about $56 a day — about what I expected for a fancier car during the holiday season In total my five days came out to $26130 once taxes and fees were added in When I got in the car instructions on the touchscreen told me to press the brake and tap the key card on the center console Once my Model 3 was ready to drive I immediately checked the range and my heart sank: Hertz had given the car to me with only 53% battery I knew that in the Michigan cold that wasnt going to last me very long I needed to find somewhere to juice up before I could start putting the Tesla through its paces Oh well I thought A small setback A Hertz spokesperson told me the company strived to have batteries at 80% for pickup so it seems my experience was an oversight The second I pulled onto the road cars kicking up salty water quickly dirtied up the massive windshield of the Model 3 I went to hit the wiper fluid and immediately got an error message on the touchscreen: Wiper Fluid Low Nothing came out of the sprayers The wiper fluid wasnt just low; it was empty Ok I thought getting a little more annoyed Add that to the list with charging Between the delay getting my car and the lack of charge I decided to scrap my errands for the day and head home I had dinner plans that night and needed to get home and change I made two visits to Tesla Superchargers that night in order to keep enough range in the battery to get me where I needed to go — never with enough time to get up to a full charge It was inconvenient but not prohibitive to my plans Still I wondered: What if I were a more typical rental customer and this was the first day of a trip in which I had a lot of ground to cover? This could derail travel plans in a way half a tank of gas really couldnt On the first stop I charged for 15 minutes — as long as I could wait without being rude to my dinner host — to go from 35% to 40% I left my house with 39% so this trip was kind of pointless in the end On my way home from dinner the second stop was an hour long and only got me up near 60% battery I got home after midnight About 24 hours after acquiring the Model 3 thanks to a quick stop at CVS the car was finally comfortable to drive and the battery was at 100% charge I could have asked for reimbursement for the wiper fluid when I dropped off the car but I decided the $20 wasnt worth a back-and-forth with customer service In the end its still a rental car Hertz had sent me a video with instructions on how to use my Model 3 that helped me get through some little learning curves and the free charging at Supercharger stations (so long as you return the car with the same level of charge you got it with) certainly saved me money I had to charge four times in the five days I had the car Dropping off the car at the end of my rental was also quick and seamless I just parked dropped the keys at the desk and was on my way Overall getting started on renting a Model 3 from Hertz was bumpy and there are definitely simple improvements that could make the transition into the car more comfortable Simply having 100% charge and a full wiper-fluid reservoir at pickup would have made all the difference in those first 24 hours These little things are especially important as Hertz reckons with how to keep EVs in its fleets My sometimes rocky experience renting an EV is proof that — from customers to employees to Hertz itself — theres still a lot of learning to do when it comes to electric cars Even with these issues Id definitely rent a Tesla — or another EV — from Hertz again A lot of the issues I encountered can be chalked up to one-off issues during the busy holiday season or the fact that I was renting from a smaller lot I think what surprised me the most is how regular the experience is once the car is fully charged and you get used to things such as one-pedal driving Even when youre renting a Tesla its still just a rental car And Hertz is still just Hertz Read next Jump to"

20 2024 March 20 2024 March 15 2024 March 15 2024 March 9 2024 February 26 2024 February 24 2024 Tesla (TSLAO) tumbled nearly 11 per cent on Thursday after CEO Elon Musk warned sales growth would slow this year despite price cuts that have already hurt margins and raised investor concerns at the world’s most valuable automaker Musk said growth would be “notably lower” as Tesla focuses on a cheaper next-generation electric vehicle to be made at its Texas factory in the second half of 2025 which is expected to spark the next boom in deliveries But his remarks fell flat with investors with Tesla set to lose about $70 billion in market value if losses hold That would push its market capitalization loss for the month to about $200 billion “The Tesla headlines have essentially gone from bad to worse” said TD Cowen analysts noting that the fourth-quarter revenue and profit were also below expectationsShares of other EV makers also fell with Rivian Automotive Inc (RIVNO) Lucid Group (LCIDO) and Fisker (FSRN) down between 47 per cent and 88 per cent The EV industry has been grappling with a slowdown in demand for more than a year and the price cuts by Tesla will likely worsen the pressure on the startups and automakers such as Ford (FN) “The problem for Tesla is any significant attempt to boost sales from here on will probably need to be achieved at the cost of further falls in operating margin due to having to compete with BYD in China as well as increased competition elsewhere” said Michael Hewson chief market analyst at CMC Markets At least nine brokerages downgraded the stock while seven raised their ratings The company on average has a “hold” rating with a median price target of $225 nearly 9 per cent higher than the share’s last closing price Tesla short sellers have made $345 billion so far this year making it the most profitable US short trade according to data and analytics firm Ortex The company’s stock trades at nearly 60 times its 12-month forward earnings estimates according to LSEG data That gives it a more premium valuation than the other “Magnificent Seven” stocks – a group that includes Apple Microsoft and Nvidia Some analysts said valuation could become tough to justify if Tesla’s sales growth and margin weaken further “Tesla is increasingly looking like a traditional auto company” said Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi Sign up

Share it with your friends or copy link Shares of Tesla have tanked this week following a downbeat earnings outlook but fund manager David Baron remains bullish on Elon Musks carmaker as well as his rocket-producer SpaceX He forecasts Tesla stock to gain about 550% to hit $1200 a share by 2030 and for SpaceX to triple in valuation over the same period according to a recent interview conducted by Bloomberg Baron runs the Baron Focused Growth Fund which counted Tesla and SpaceX as its largest holdings as of December 31 2023 The fund climbed 28% in 2023 outperforming the S&P 500s gain of 24% Baron told Bloomberg that the growth outlook for Musks companies remains strong even if it has moderated from previous calls While he may not be growing 50% a year as the company thought this year in a tough environment hes still growing volume by 15% to 20% per year and making us $7000 per car of gross profit Baron said His comments come on the heels of a rough week for Tesla which reported revenue and profit that lagged estimates and warned of a production slowdown in 2024 The stock tumbled 12% on Thursday following the results and a tumultuous earnings call one analyst called a train wreck This was the most sobering outlook I have seen from Tesla Gene Munster the managing partner at Deepwater said in an interview with CNBC Wednesday Meanwhile Baron expects SpaceXs valuation to increase by 20% this year Longer term he sees it doubling within three years and tripling by 2030 Bloomberg previously reported the company is worth more than $175 billion The Tesla allocation in Barons fund is critical for his ambition to boost his total assets to $2 billion up from current levels of about $13 billion One reason Baron is so bullish on Musk is that the worlds richest person still holds a significant stake in his companies Baron says he looks for such ownership levels when deciding where to invest [Musks] interests are aligned with ours Baron maintained Hes not going to do anything stupid to change the trajectory of the companies Advertisement"

Based in the Chinese megacity of Shenzhen BYD was founded in 1995 by Wang Chuanfu a low-key former academic who still runs the company Wang says the letters BYD don’t stand for anything in particular He said he chose a “rather strange” name to set it apart from other startups It is China’s top EV producer and exports electric taxis buses and other vehicles to the rest of the world including Europe South America Southeast Asia and the Middle East Unlike Tesla (TSLA) it also makes plug-in hybrids Israel and Thailand currently count as BYD’s major overseas markets where the Chinese company ranks number one in EV sales Its best-selling passenger cars are the Qin and Song models The Qin is a compact sedan available as a plug-in hybrid or an all-electric car The BYD Song is a series of compact crossover SUVs Compared to Tesla BYD is known for offering more affordable cars which helped it attract a wider group of consumers Its entry-level model sells in China for just over $10000; the cheapest Tesla Model 3 costs more than $32000 BYD’s passenger cars are not yet available in the United States But its electric buses — made in Lancaster California — are sold in the country Wang an engineer first moved to Shenzhen in the early 1990s to run a battery making business for a Beijing-based government research institute according to his official resume in the company’s filings Government posts in China at that time were considered “iron rice bowls” a popular term for a job for life But Wang soon quit and founded BYD The start of his entrepreneurial journey coincided with the opening of the Chinese economy to the world China’s former leader Deng Xiaoping had set up the country’s first special economic zone in Shenzhen which encouraged hundreds of manufacturing businesses to flock to the city lured by its liberal economic policies and cheaper labor and land costs By 1997 Wang had grown his small workshop to a medium-sized cellphone battery maker with more than 100 million yuan ($14 million) in annual sales That year the Asian financial crisis provided a growth opportunity as plunging battery prices pushed many competitors out of business Wang’s company was able to survive due to its cost advantage according to the Southern Weekly newspaper By 2003 BYD had become the world’s largest producer of nickel-cadmium batteries which were widely used in mobile phones But Wang wanted more Eyeing the future growth of EVs Wang ventured into the car industry in 2003 acquiring a state-owned automaker in the city of Xi’an for 269 million yuan ($38 million) While that surprise decision angered the company’s strategic investors and triggered a 21% plunge in the company’s Hong Kong-listed shares as Wang later described he remained steadfast “I build cars because I am optimistic about the future development of electric vehicles” he said defiantly after the share price plunge according to state-owned Beijing Business Today Just five years later in 2008 Wang was vindicated when he received a $230 million investment from his most famous backer Warren Buffett who paid about $1 per share for a stake of around 10% That vote of confidence helped boost the company’s stock by as much as 1370% over the next year BYD launched its first plug-in hybrid model at the end of 2008 Since then BYD has taken off as an EV manufacturer partly thanks to the Chinese government’s support for the industry Buffett has been gradually trimming his stake in BYD since 2022 taking some of the enormous profits he has made According to the most recent filing by Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway the firm held nearly 8% of BYD as of late October Those shares are now worth 1828 billion Hong Kong dollars ($23 billion) BYD has dominated the Chinese EV industry since 2015 when it surpassed its domestic and overseas rivals in the world’s biggest car market One of its key advantages against Tesla the number two player in China is price Tesla’s four models — the Model 3 Model Y Model S and Model X — have price tags ranging from $40000 to $120000 in the United States In China the cheapest Tesla model the base Model 3 has a starting price of 229900 yuan ($32375) It has a range of 272 miles on a full charge and a top speed of 140 miles per hour By contrast the BYD Seagull has a starting price of 73800 yuan ($10392) in China It has a top speed of 81 miles per hour The Seagull is available with two battery packs The smaller battery has a range of 190 miles while the larger battery has a range of 251 miles Both Tesla and BYD vehicles have received safety ratings from international organizations In 2022 Tesla’s Model Y and BYD’s Atto 3 received a five-star Australasian New Car Assessment Program (ANCAP) rating respectively Since 2020 BYD has been making its lithium iron phosphate battery (LFP) “Blade Batteries” for use in its own cars and for sale to other auto makers such as Toyota The company says the blade-shaped battery is thinner and longer than conventional lithium iron cells and thus can maximize the use of available space within the battery pack It’s also less likely to catch fire even when it’s severely damaged according to BYD Tesla also reportedly uses BYD Blade Batteries for its Y cars produced in the Berlin Gigafactory according to German media In March 2023 Elon Musk denied a media report saying Tesla was ending cooperation with

As a group HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment with high oil prices and elevated interest rates could TSLA face a similar situation as it did in 2022 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months - or will it see a strong jump? We currently remain relatively neutral on Tesla stock with a $237 price estimate which is slightly below the $248 market price We continue to believe that Tesla will remain a big beneficiary of the long-term transition to cleaner transportation and energy generation given its well-oiled supply chain superior battery and drive train tech and its lead with software and self-driving technology However Tesla stock presently trades at about 72x 2024 consensus earnings which could limit near-term upside Competition is also mounting and Tesla’s lineup is aging with its Model 3 Y X and S remaining the same visually since launch This is in contrast with mainstream automakers who typically overhaul vehicle models every seven to eight years While Tesla did recently launch the Cybertruck we believe that the vehicle will remain a niche proposition given its high price and unconventional looks While Tesla advertised a starting price of $40000 for the truck during the first unveil event back in 2019 the base model now starts at $61000 with top-end models rising to about $100000 Separately Tesla’s price cuts in the United States and China are impacting margins Tesla’s earnings for 2023 are projected to decline year-over-year See our analysis on Tesla Valuation: Is TSLA Stock Expensive Or Cheap? for more details on Tesla’s valuation and how it compares with peers For more information on Tesla’s business model and revenue trends check out our dashboard on Tesla Revenue: How Does TSLA Make Money?

As part of the IPOs ruling in late November last year Amanj was forced to pay Tesla £4000 while also shelling out £8000 in fees for his solicitor But despite the crushing defeat he doesnt bear a grudge toward the world’s richest man Amanj added: “I’m the type of person that I don’t have any hate against anyone I am too busy to hate people” Tesla has been contacted for comment"

Tesla will move immediately to hold a shareholder vote to transfer state of incorporation to Texas” It’s unclear whether Mr Musk plans to appeal the ruling to the Delaware Supreme Court regarding his compensation package If the ruling remains effective he will lose stock options but retain stakes he already owned Before the court’s ruling Mr Musk moved his business incorporation location out of Delaware After completing the $44 billion buyout of Twitter in 2022 he moved its business incorporation location to Nevada and renamed it X Following the Delaware court’s ruling Mr Musk also moved the business incorporation site of his brain implant company Neuralink from Delaware to Nevada according to Bloomberg Neuralink which has its physical headquarters in Fremont California officially became a Nevada company on Feb 8 according to state records Delaware records also list the company’s legal home as Nevada Mr Musk said last month that Neuralink had implanted a chip in a human patient for the first time and the “initial results show promising” Neuralink said it aims to create the world’s first neural implant that will allow users to control a computer or mobile device anywhere they go using their thoughts Mr Musk has expressed his desire for his company to assist individuals suffering from severe spinal cord injuries and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis He believes that brain implants could potentially treat other conditions such as obesity autism depression and schizophrenia He is also optimistic about the technology’s potential to enable telepathy and web browsing Tom Ozimek Caden Pearson and the Associated Press contributed to this report From The Epoch Times"

505,"Tesla Stock: Labor Troubles Worsen But Some Positives Are Visible (NASDAQ:TSLA)","2/21/2024","https://seekingalpha.com/article/4671985-tesla-labor-troubles-worsen-but-some-positives-are-visible","jetcityimage jetcityimage Since I wrote about the electric vehicle [EV] giant Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) last November its share price is down by ~19% and even more year-to-date [YTD] (see chart below) No surprises there given that a slew of factors were working against during at that time Price Chart (Source: Seeking Alpha) Price Chart (Source: Seeking Alpha) My focus then was on its labor troubles in Sweden that risked spilling over into the rest of Europe and the US Moreover they also posed a potential risk to the companys already declining operating margins through the first nine months of 2023 fueled by price wars among EV companies It didnt help that the stocks price had more than doubled YTD resulting in elevated market multiples compared to peers This along with the companys other challenges indicated little scope for further upside However much has happened in the past three months that reflects Teslas ability to come out ahead despite its challenges Here I take a closer look at all these aspects to assess whether the Hold rating on the Tesla stock is now due for a relook What started with Swedish mechanics striking for collective bargaining agreements in October last year spilt over into sympathy strikes by other workers unions This means that transportation building maintenance and postal workers unions among others refrain from Tesla related tasks even as they carry on work otherwise Unions in other Nordic countries like Denmark Norway and Finland also support IF Metall the Swedish Union which means that Teslas cars can no longer be unloaded on their docks However they havent impacted Teslas popularity so far In its biggest Nordic market Norway Teslas share jumped to 20% in 2023 from 122% the year before Moreover even in the eye of the storm Sweden the company has seen registrations inch up This is in line with robust growth in the companys sales The number grew by 20% year-on-year (YoY) in Q4 2023 even if it was considerably lower than the 38% growth seen for the full year 2023 However risks persist even though the share of Nordic countries in the companys 2022 sales was a small 27% The first risk is slowing growth In a hypothetical extreme case if Tesla were to exit the Nordic markets it could almost halve its quarterly YoY growth based on Q4 2023 figures The second risk is that of a spread in industrial action to Germany where it has big production plans and generates over 5% sales While Tesla was quick to improve terms for German workers possibly in anticipation the challenge persists The head of the countrys union IG Metall Christiane Benner expressed her displeasure with Tesla in an interview with Bloomberg upon taking on leadership last October In the US too the United Auto Workers [UAW] union said it targets the unionization of at least one Tesla plant As some background UAW successfully conducted strikes for better terms from big car companies like General Motors (GM) Stellantis (STLA) and Ford (F) last year But there could be some respite for the company as the macroeconomic situation improves The cost of living crisis has subsided substantially with Swedens inflation in January 2024 down to 54% YoY from 117% a year earlier It has declined also from 65% in October 2023 as I noted earlier While the Swedish economy doesnt look any better placed with growth of 02% expected this year after a marginal contraction in 2023 the fact that it wont contract further and inflation can be even lower this year is still some positive This in turn can play some part in easing the current labor pressures Similarly the German economy is expected to see better performance this year too Source: Tesla Source: Tesla Teslas own numbers also give some hope Besides robust sales its operating margin rose to 82% in Q4 2023 reversing the sequential decline seen for the past three quarters Its still only around half that seen in Q4 2022 but it has improved from 76% in Q3 2023 The real improvement was visible in its GAAP net margin which rose to a high of 315% due to an income tax benefit Still theres something to be said for the fact that it maintained its non-GAAP net margin at 99% from Q3 2023 even though its a decline from 169% in Q4 2022 As a result of the net income bump up in Q4 2023 and its price decline in the interim the TTM GAAP P/E is now at 442x compared to the 778x levels it was at the last I checked It remains significantly high compared to the other big four stocks by EV market share though The story is the same even for its forward ratio as well (see chart below) The multiples look particularly stretched as Chinas BYD Company (OTCPK:BYDDF) races ahead of Tesla in vehicle deliveries To be fair Tesla is a global brand while BYD is China-focused so they arent entirely comparable But even then its worth highlighting here that China is Teslas second biggest market after the US where its seeing increased competition Source: Seeking Alpha Source: Seeking Alpha In a nutshell the Tesla stock isnt out of the woods yet Its persisting labor challenges are getting spilling over into geographies outside of Sweden and closer home especially after UAWs win with other car companies last year So far though Teslas numbers are unaffected Not only did its sales see robust growth as such in 2023 but they also grew at a fast clip in Nordic countries It managed to arrest the operating margin decline in Q4 2023 as well and its GAAP net margin showed a bump up too However for the year as a whole the operating margin declined and the non-GAAP net margin was static With price wars underway and Chinas BYD company taking Teslas spot in the number of vehicles delivered in 2023 its market multiples still look stretched though This is even though they have reduced considerably in the past three months If Tesla Inc can continue to improve its margins in the next quarters and also manage its labor situation well it may well become a Buy again But that time isnt now And things can go either way for it This chapter in the Tesla

which has us wondering Should Apple and Tesla be on the chopping block? baiajaku/iStock via Getty Images Two of the Magnificent Seven have rapidly slowing growth which has us wondering Should Apple and Tesla be on the chopping block? baiajaku/iStock via Getty Images Brian Dress CFA -- Director of Research Investment Advisor With the recent action and developments over the past few months there is one conclusion that we can definitively state – US stocks are in a bull market There are any number of technical definitions of the term “bull market” and we will leave a link here if you are interested in the Wall Street definition of the term But for our part here at Left Brain we look at a bull market as a time when stocks generally move higher and when stocks predictably move higher in reaction to positive news whether it be company-specific or more macroeconomically-oriented This current earnings season which is quickly reaching its conclusion has given us a great deal of evidence that markets have reached a bullish condition Between 2021-2023 many businesses delivered strong earnings but it was never easily predictable how their stock prices would react to positive earnings releases That is more indicative of a bear market Though things did improve later in 2023 in this regard the stock price reactions we have seen coming out of the most recent earnings season have been more predictable In fact we have seen a great number of very large stock moves higher in response to companies report earnings that beat expectations Examples of this phenomenon this quarter include many of the market’s leading growth stocks: Meta Platforms (META) Netflix (NFLX) Uber Technologies (UBER) Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) just to name a few of the many companies that have delivered What’s interesting is seeing stock price moves of 10%+ in very large cap companies suggesting fresh buyers coming in and stock price analyst estimates that had been far too low in comparison to the fundamental improvements taking place at the individual company level This week we saw similar moves out of other giants including Block (SQ) and Walmart (WMT) but most notable was the more than 15% 1-day gain from the world leader in Artificial Intelligence (AI) Nvidia (NVDA) NVDA is a company that we have praised profusely in this space over the last few years particularly due to the grand vision of CEO Jensen Huang the highest rated CEO in our 2019 CEO profiles series NVDA’s Wednesday earnings report after market close was one of the mostly hotly anticipated releases in recent memory and the company delivered well beyond most analysts’ projections For the 4th quarter of fiscal year 2024 (last year for NVDA) the company reported $221 billion in revenue well in excess of the $205 billion predicted by Wall Street analysts and representing a 265% (!) year-over-year growth number Nvidia’s data center business had revenues of $184 billion last quarter which was a more than 400% increase from the prior-year quarter Analysts’ lofty expectations over the last year have been unable to keep up with the realities of the AI explosion spearheaded by Nvidia’s Hopper GPU computing platform Said CFO Colette Kress: “The world has reached the tipping point of new computing era The $1 trillion installed base of data center infrastructure is rapidly transitioning from general purpose to accelerated computing” In response to this better-than-expected earnings release NVDA stock increased in value by more than 16% in Thursday’s trading session This is the type of remarkable price action that we think is the hallmark of an emerging bull market Though the NASDAQ Composite index has gained nearly 30% in value since its most recent low in late October we think there is still plenty of space for stocks to gain in value Companies involved in AI cybersecurity digital transformation software and a number of other key sectors continue to grow revenues and profits at a rapid pace We would note also that the market’s upside performance has accelerated over the past month despite the fact that interest rates have started creeping back higher What we are witnessing in this market rally is a fundamental phenomenon rather than driven by hopes and expectations that the Federal Reserve is likely to announce numerous interest rate cuts in the coming year Not every large company has fared quite as well as META NFLX NVDA and the like We have seen two of the “Magnificent Seven” struggle coming out of their earnings releases this quarter Apple Inc (AAPL) and Tesla Inc (TSLA) The death knell for growth stocks is deceleration in revenue growth and that is in evidence for these two behemoths based on their most recent results and in their business trends over the last two years In today’s letter we are putting the spotlight on these two businesses and bringing you into our thought process on why they may deserve to be on the chopping block for investors’ portfolios In doing so we will use these two examples to show you why we are such devotees to active management in our investment approach (in contrast to passive index investing) We will devote our entire letter this month to this topic so no “Income Security of the Month” for February but we did want to point out that interest rates have been creeping higher in recent weeks so investors still holding cash that needs a home with a higher yield are in luck Bankratecom Yahoo! Finance NerdWalletcom AnnuityAdvantagecom Bankratecom Yahoo! Finance NerdWalletcom AnnuityAdvantagecom As we put together the chart of various fixed-income security yields in the box here we noticed that most of the listed interest rates ticked up anywhere between 005-03% over the last month We still think now is the right time for investors to move cash into higher-yielding instruments and that interest rates will eventually begin falling in earnest We think if you have cash still sitting in a no or low-yield checking account you really ought to consider moving to one of these instruments or possibly into a stock market vehicle if you are more tolerant of volatility Of course everyone’s circumstances are different so speak with a financial professional before making a move With that all being said let’s get into it! Those who follow us here at Left Brain will know that we are staunch evangelists for active investing: in other words active and deliberative stock and bond selection We think that active management done right has a wonderful opportunity to deliver value to an investor over time The major caveat to that statement of course is “done right” Selecting individual stocks is relatively costly requiring an idea generation method built on a diligent research process Put simply it’s not for everybody I’m sure there are many investors that have tried picking stocks on their own over the years in just a couple hours of work per week and have struggled to achieve strong performance That is not an argument against active management it’s an argument against hobbyist active management The more pertinent and topical argument for passive management in recent years is that it works (well enough)! Over the last 15 years (since February 2009) the S&P 500 (SP500) has generated an average annual total return of just over 16% And we understand – who can argue with success? A well-selected basket of stocks has the potential for eclipsing the returns of the broader market but yes also carries the risk of underperforming For busy professionals with families and lives outside the business world we can forgive investors for taking what appears to be the easy and cheapest route However we want to introduce you to what we think is a major vulnerability to index investing – concentration risk Over the past decade we have seen a self-fulfilling cycle take place: more investors are allocating money on a monthly basis to index funds who in turn continue buying the largest cap stocks in ever-bigger proportions leading to increased concentration over time Take a look at the comparison of the largest 10 stocks in the S&P 500 compared from September 2020 to August 2023: Coinspeakercom Investopedia Coinspeakercom Investopedia (Please pardon me for less than stellar Microsoft Word skills in building this table!) What we can see here is that the index is becoming ever more top-heavy over time with the top two stocks now comprising just under 14% of an investors’ portfolio if she owns just the S&P 500 in her portfolio This is up from less than 12% in no more than 3 years! You can also see as you move down the chart that most of the corresponding rows (#3 #4 etc) are larger than they were three years ago Well Brian you may ask “These are the strongest companies in the world why should I worry?” That stance is understandable as we look back to past results from Apple Microsoft Amazon and the like they continue to grow There are two problems with this First the top 10 companies list changes dramatically over time One only has to look back to 2012 to see when Exxon Mobil (XOM) was the world’s largest company and now is nowhere to be found in the top 10 But second and more importantly what happens to your portfolio when some of your largest positions start to be a drag? That second question we will now cover in more depth Even if you are an active investor odds are you own one or both of the following stocks so stay tuned We all know Apple (AAPL) and most of us are using one or more of their devices right now I’m writing this week’s letter on an iMac Apple shares have made so many millionaires worldwide that it is literally dizzying to consider the impact of this stock over the last two decades on portfolios around the world But something is amiss at Apple and that is very worrying considering the huge AAPL positions that many investors carry on their books We love growth stocks but there is one thing that can be kryptonite for growth stocks – slowing growth Take a look at the annual revenue growth numbers out of Apple over the past 8 years: Apple Annual Sales Growth by Fiscal Year ((Source: FactSet financial data and analytics)) Apple Annual Sales Growth by Fiscal Year ((Source: FactSet financial data and analytics)) On a raw sales basis you can see that Apple’s yearly revenues haven’t even doubled in that 8-year time frame: Apple Annual Sales by Fiscal Year ( (Source: FactSet financial data and analytics)) Apple Annual Sales by Fiscal Year ( (Source: FactSet financial data and analytics)) This stands in stark contrast to the growth in Apple’s stock price which has risen by more than 600% in the corresponding period Granted Apple once traded at a low price/earnings multiple (1356 in September 2016) and a relatively low price/sales multiple (289 in September 2016) compared to now (2996 and 778 respectively at the end of December 2023) What has happened to Apple’s stock price over the last 8 years has been in large part due to multiple expansion rather than due to sales or earnings growth We find it curious that the stock would trade at a dramatically higher multiple just as its growth rate has stalled over the same period The contrast is even more stark when we look at 2023 performance As the company had negative sales growth the stock price increased by more than 40%! Something isn’t adding up here or as the kids say these days the “math isn’t mathing” We think that the ever more intense move toward passive investing has something to do with this phenomenon but we can only hazard a guess With stalling sales growth in evidence we find ourselves asking a simple question “Given current business conditions how does Apple double its market cap from its current level of $28 trillion to an eventual capitalization of $56 trillion?” We know that Apple is working in the Virtual Reality space recently releasing the Vision Pro early in 2024 But what else is on the horizon? Granted Apple likely trades on a higher multiple than before due to more predictable revenue in the form of recurring services sales However iPhone sales constitute more than half of the company’s revenues and showed a negative growth rate of -24% in fiscal year 2023 The Services business was the only avenue of growth in the most recent year showing an increase of 91% year-over-year All of this is to say that as holders of Apple shares we are starting to question whether this belongs in portfolios specifically for growth investors We know that many investors sit on huge capital gains in this stock complicating the decision in taxable brokerage accounts especially With so many compelling growth stories in evidence from AI to cybersecurity to FinTech to weight loss drugs (and many more) we think it may be time to consider other uses of investment capital Herein lies the advantage of active portfolio management If you are a passive indexer you have no choice but to hold a large proportion of your investment capital in a stock like this On the other hand if you (or your investment professional) manage your portfolio actively you at least have a chance to consider a new path There is one more stock in the “Magnificent Seven” that has us worried – Tesla (TSLA) Since this is a smaller proportion of the S&P 500 this is less of a concern for passive investors than is AAPL in our view but this is another stock we know that is heavily owned Tesla is interesting for many reasons not the least of which is its CEO Elon Musk who can’t help but make news (good and bad) on almost a daily basis When we speak to investors about our thoughts on Tesla we are often asked if our concern comes from his behavior on X (formerly Twitter) and the answer surprisingly is no in this case Rather the problem in evidence here is rapidly slowing growth (and lower profitability) This case is slightly different than that of Apple which is in chronic growth deceleration Rather growth has deteriorated quickly at Tesla as we can see in the quarterly growth rates over the past two years: Tesla Sales Growth by Quarter ((Source: FactSet financial data and analytics)) Tesla Sales Growth by Quarter ((Source: FactSet financial data and analytics)) As we can see Tesla sales were well over 20% for most of the last two years and often in excess of 40% The fact that the last two quarters have seen single digit growth is quite troubling for investors And that is reflected in the stock price which fell more than 15% in the week following the earnings report on January 24 Higher interest rates are impacting Tesla’s sales negatively according to the most recent earnings report In conjunction with that issue the average selling price of vehicles in the most recent quarter was significantly lower than in previous periods reflecting a slowing demand environment In fact one anecdotal story is quite concerning for Tesla: citing the high cost of maintenance for its electric vehicle fleet (including Teslas) rental car giant Hertz just sold 20000 of its electric vehicles opting to replace them with gas-powered models Said Musk on the earnings call “Tesla is currently between two major growth waves Were focused on making sure that our next growth wave driven by the next-gen vehicle energy storage full self-driving other projects is executed as well as possible” This is exactly the type of tone that chases growth investors from a hypergrowth stock like Tesla Now we see a situation where the company will have to prove to investors that it is able to reaccelerate growth either through a new product line or an increase in demand for its products Given that there is already a certain level of saturation of the marketplace (ie many of the consumers who have interest in EVs already have bought them and those who haven’t are reluctant to do so) Tesla faces an uphill battle in the near to medium-term to turn things around Further profitability is under threat at Tesla Gross margins (on a trailing 12-month basis) have fallen six straight quarters from 271% in June 2022 to 1825% in December of 2023 In many ways Tesla is facing a similar problem that META did in 2022: they have been devoting a lot of capital to AI projects and next generation vehicles to the detriment of the company’s overall profitability Whether those capital expenditures will ultimately bear fruit is uncertain What is certain again is that there are many areas of the market where there is less uncertainty and we would rather focus there rather than on a broken growth story like Tesla I will close this section by saying we wouldn’t bet against Elon Musk and his ability to eventually right the ship: he’s done it before We see things clearly now in the beginning of 2024: it appears that the US stock market has turned bullish driven specifically by the AI revolution Early indications suggest that this explosion of innovation still in its infancy could be more dramatic even than the beginning of the Internet in the mid-1990s What’s really exciting is that the companies driving things like Nvidia have strong revenues cash flows and even net profits which stands in stark contrast to the boom nearly 30 years ago At the same time we think now is the right moment to take full stock of portfolios Specifically we think that as active portfolio managers there are two major stocks that are in many portfolios that deserve consideration as slowing growth is the kryptonite for growth stocks As we see deceleration in those two stocks – AAPL and TSLA – we think holders of these shares would be smart to take a closer look at what they hold Again the advantage of active management is the ability to make moves like this Passive indexers don’t have the same flexibility Editors Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major US exchange Please be aware of the risks associated with these stocks This article was written

Lets consider things through the lens of a snap test Popularized by Motley Fools co-founder David Gardner a snap test asks us to imagine a world where we snap our fingers and a companys products disappear In ASMLs case many of todays advanced electronics would be much different or less sophisticated -- at a minimum At worst they may be nonexistent How is this so? First ASMLs largest customer Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC) counts Apple as its biggest client Via this trickle-down effect from ASML to TSMC to Apple there is no doubt that Apples consumer electronics would be entirely different without using ASMLs lithography Sans ASMLs help Apples products might be physically larger slower less powerful and have fewer features Meanwhile another of TSMCs largest customers is Nvidia which relies upon the company to create chips for its graphic processing units (GPUs) These GPUs from Nvidia are then distributed to the rest of the Magnificent Seven for use in: While it is virtually impossible to imagine the extent to which a world without ASML would change it is clear that the Magnificent Seven would look dramatically different Posting a total return above 950% over the last decade ASML is not only crucial to the world of advanced technology but also shareholder-friendly Thanks to its dominant positioning in the lithography industry ASML maintains an incredible net profit margin of 28% The company has repurchased 1% of its shares annually since 2014 bolstered by this immense profitability while boosting its dividend payments ninefold ASML Shares Outstanding data by YCharts While ASML may not match its 14% annualized revenue growth rate from the last decade over the next 10 years it grew sales by 30% in 2023 and has clear megatrends working in its favor Supported by growth drivers in end markets such as the ongoing energy transition the electrification of everything and AI the semiconductor market should double within 10 years according to ASMLs CEO Peter Wennink Commanding a lofty price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 43 today the market expects this steady growth to come to fruition with ASML maintaining its leadership position for many years Since ASML secretly powers the Magnificent Seven in many ways yet trades at nearly twice the valuation of the S&P 500s average dollar-cost-averaging buys would be prudent for investors Should you invest $1000 in ASML right now?

The NHTSA defines a recall as when a manufacturer or NHTSA determines that a vehicle equipment car seat or tire creates an unreasonable safety risk or fails to meet minimum safety standards Most decisions to conduct a recall and remedy a safety defect are made voluntarily by manufacturers prior to any involvement by NHTSA Here are the “2023 NHTSA Top 10 Carmakers with Most Vehicles Affected by Recalls” Honda: 6334825 Ford: 6152614 Kia America: 3110447 Chrysler: 2732398 General Motors: 2021033 Nissan North America: 1804443 Mercedes-Benz USA: 478173 Volkswagen Group of America: 453763 BMW of North America: 340249 Daimler Trucks North America: 261959 The New York Times calls the recent Tesla warning light font recall “a setback for the company” It’s also clear that software issues are frequent obstacles to the transition to transportation electrification for many legacy automakers In this recent National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) Tesla notification the focus is on the brake park and anti-lock brake warning lights It seems they have a smaller font size than required by federal safety standards The decision is that such a small font size can make critical safety information hard to read increasing the risk of a crash “A visual warning indicator whose letter font size is smaller than 32 mm (1/8 inch) as prescribed in FMVSS Nos 105 and 135 could reduce the driver’s detection of it when illuminated increasing the risk of a collision” Tesla has already started releasing the software update and owners will be notified by letter starting March 30 Lots of other car owners who have an open recall need to get their vehicle repaired for free at a local dealership The Times also cited “another hurdle for Tesla:” a separate NHTSA notice that an initial investigation into steering issues “that may have affected 334000 Tesla vehicles was escalated to an engineering analysis” Steering worthiness is no small issue Steering allows humans to remain in control under infinite driving scenarios When 2000 complaints about loss of steering control in the 2023 Model Y and Model 3 vehicles were received NHTSA of course should investigate “A portion of drivers described their steering begin to feel ‘notchy’ or ‘clicky’ either prior to or just after the incident” the agency said More than 50 vehicles were towed from places including driveways parking lots roadsides and intersections as a result of driver unease due to alleged steering-related issues A majority of people who complained about this issue reported seeing a warning message “Steering assist reduced” How is this issue being addressed? You guessed it Tesla is releasing a software update that will fix the issue free of charge the safety administration said The models affected include the 2012 to 2023 Model S the 2016 to 2024 Model X the 2017 to 2023 Model 3 2019 to 2024 Model Y and 2024 Cybertruck vehicles In December 2023 Tesla said it would update the software for its Autopilot system in some 2 million cars in the US to fix issues that NHTSA claimed were unsafe In a statement the agency said Tesla had done too little to ensure that drivers pay attention to the road while its Autopilot driver assistance system is activated When the Chinese government announced last month that Tesla would recall nearly all the 16 million cars it had sold in the country to adjust their assisted-driving systems many wondered if Tesla could continue to compete with Chinese manufacturers in the global EV sector China is one of the world’s largest and fastest-growing markets for EVs Because OTA updates are not yet standard on all vehicles they are often misunderstood by the public and those public misconceptions are frequently fed by media stories that imply distrust of EVs in general and Tesla in particular What’s missing and rather significant is that remote management of such electronic fixes brings high economic benefits to both companies and their customers OTA updates provide a convenient and efficient way to deliver bug fixes security patches feature enhancements and other software improvements to many devices without physical access Cornell University experts note that OTA software updates are becoming essential for electric/electronic vehicle architectures in order to reduce traditional take-it-to-the-dealer recalls amid increasing software bugs and vulnerabilities By wirelessly transmitting the updated software to the target devices OTA updates enable seamless and on-demand software maintenance and ensure that devices run the latest and most secure software versions As explained in a 2023 SAE article vertically integrated solutions also enable the identification and correction of software and calibration defects for the entire vehicle life cycle through OTA software update packages Connected services are essential for not only the future of ADAS but also for the creation of a safer driving environment for all: “This eliminates the need for costly and time-consuming dealer visits and allows troubleshooting updates repairs and recalibration to be performed remotely There are industry-wide benefits of deep connectivity as well such as the sharing of critical and safety-related data to make functional enhancements and use in the creation of a real-world safety rating system instead of one based on lab data and general speculation” Next generation software will likely interconnect even more devices within vehicles in upcoming years so efficient architecture supporting advanced functionalities or features becomes essential And OTA updates will need evaluation metrics for vehicular software models vehicle computing units communication distances and vehicle cluster sizes Graphic provided by GAO Curious if your vehicle in the US has a recall?

Some longtime Tesla holders are hanging in Ross Gerber’s firm Gerber Kawasaki had 398000 shares as of the last filing in December He’s trimmed that holding he told Yahoo Finance but has held on to the bulk of shares on behalf of clients in part for tax reasons in part because he sees the long-term opportunity The cost of Elons behavior is really hurting shareholders and its really unfortunate because the reason were holding the stock is the long-term potential of Tesla is immense” Gerber told Yahoo Finance “So you know its this catch-22” Colin Rusch of Oppenheimer who has a Market Perform rating on the shares is waiting for margins to improve and stabilize before he gets more bullish on Tesla “The second thing we want to see is evolution of the FSD [full self-driving] technology and real adoption We still have a fluid environment around the regulatory backdrop As we get clarity I think we’ll have a better sense of how this technology performs and how they’ll be able to monetize it” he told Yahoo Finance In the meantime whether the noise around the board’s independence becomes a fundamental issue remains to be seen Longtime Tesla fanboys’ attitudes have typically been nonchalant: If Musk does drugs who cares? If the board pays him astronomical sums (and are themselves paid more than board members at other companies) who cares? So he posts a lot on X so what? He’s building the future! The real question is how much more consistent that future could be or even how expansive if Musk got challenged from within once in a while As Gautam Mukunda a lecturer at Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy and author of “Picking Presidents” put it: “There is no such thing as a person so brilliant that they’re not made better by having people around them who can challenge their ideas and test them and stop them from making mistakes in the worst case” Related Quotes"
520,"Tesla: Ignore The Noise And Buy The Dip (NASDAQ:TSLA)","2/8/2024","https://seekingalpha.com/article/4668460-tesla-ignore-the-noise-and-buy-the-dip","Slaven Vlasic Slaven Vlasic My previous bullish thesis regarding Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) kept up well before the disappointing Q4 earnings release However at the end of the day the thesis did not age well compared to the broader US stock market as the stock lost about 20% of its value since November In the swiftly changing landscape I aim to provide readers with an updated perspective on recent developments shedding light on their impact on valuation and revisiting the risks associated with investing in TSLA The stock witnessed a lackluster beginning to 2024 following an outstanding performance in 2023 The primary setback occurred with the release of disappointing Q4 2023 earnings a couple of weeks ago coupled with cautious guidance However my analysis indicates that the market may have overreacted significantly as the warning signs appear more likely to be temporary rather than indicative of persistent issues Furthermore under a high-conviction base-case scenario my valuation suggests that the stock is currently undervalued by 19% I stand by my Strong Buy rating for TSLA The company released its latest quarterly earnings on January 24 when TSLA missed consensus estimates Revenue and adjusted EPS misses were slight in relative terms though The top line expanded by 35% on a YoY basis which is a record slow pace after more than a dozen quarters of rapid revenue growth Despite the revenue growth the bottom line shrank with an adjusted EPS decrease from $119 to $071 YoY Seeking Alpha Seeking Alpha In instances of an unfavorable deviation in a companys financial performance it becomes imperative to discern the nature of the influencing factors Identifying whether these factors are secular is a clear red flag for investors Conversely if the downturn in financial performance is attributed to cyclical or one-off challenges it indicates that the hurdles are temporary and a recovery is likely on the horizon I do not see any secular factors when I look at the below summary from the companys latest earnings presentation Teslas latest earnings presentation Teslas latest earnings presentation Reduced vehicle ASP [average selling price] is an apparent temporary factor to me caused by discounts on vehicles to address the softening demand due to the cyclicality in the macroeconomy An increase in investments in artificial intelligence [AI] and R&D looks like an investment in the future to help Tesla remain the technological leader and continue setting trends in the automotive industry The ramp-up in Cybertruck production represents an investment rather than a mere cost given that the production volumes for 2024 are already sold out which is indicative of robust demand for the truck Furthermore the dip in Full Self-Driving [FSD] revenue is a one-off occurrence stemming from the spike observed last year when the feature was initially introduced widely in North America Its noteworthy that in my analysis I havent identified any concerning secular trends negatively impacting Tesla On the contrary I observe favorable secular factors that have played a crucial role in mitigating temporary headwinds for profitability Notably the lower cost per vehicle reflects a significant trend indicating the companys adeptness in absorbing the economies of scale effect and outlining a clear roadmap for achieving greater economic efficiency in production Looking ahead it is reasonable to anticipate further reductions in cost per vehicle from a long-term perspective The growth in vehicle deliveries aligns with the global shift toward electric cars marking another positive secular trend Additionally the increased gross profit in the companys Energy Generation and Storage business signifies a favorable long-term trajectory showcasing Teslas success in diversifying its business mix This diversification is instrumental in smoothing out the cyclicality inherent in the core automotive business Seeking Alpha Seeking Alpha I have two robust reasons why I am optimistic about the companys continued substantial investments in R&D and the Cybertruck production ramp-up First even with the last fiscal years dip in profitability Teslas return on invested capital [ROIC] is still stellar and far above the 82% WACC estimated by valueinvestingio As I often emphasize past performance does not guarantee future success; however investing in the stock market is not about assured returns but rather about assessing probabilities In this context the likelihood of ongoing successful investments in growth remains substantial given the commendable track record of consistently delivering high ROIC financechartscom financechartscom The second reason why I am optimistic about the companys ability to continue generating superior profitability from investments in innovation is the companys financial flexibility which allows it to keep the cost of capital low With $29 billion in cash as of the 2023 year-end and almost no debt compared to the market cap Tesla has a formidable financial position to continue betting big on innovation and production ramp Seeking Alpha Seeking Alpha Now let me move on to my expectations for 2024 During the latest earnings call the management warned that the company is unlikely to hit the staggering 38% delivery growth rate in 2024 The substantial disappointment for investors unfolded as the stock price plummeted after the earnings call However for investors aiming at success it is imperative to maintain a reasonable and sound approach Anticipating a 38-40% growth in 2024 is not sound considering the prevailing adverse factors such as high interest rates rising layoffs and extensive geopolitical uncertainty The management did not outline a precise delivery target for 2024 unlike it did last year but according to teslaraticom analysts expect 22 million deliveries in 2024 This implies an approximately 20% YoY growth rate in deliveries a figure that might seem like a significant decline when contrasted with Teslas historical growth trajectory However evaluating growth rates in comparison to historical benchmarks may be deemed unfair at least mathematically since sustaining the same rate becomes unrealistic as comparatives grow A more meaningful perspective would be to assess how Teslas projected 20% delivery growth in 2024 aligns with the overall trend in the global EV market As shown below the global EV demand also demonstrates a massive growth deceleration after a 2020-2021 spike ev-volumescom ev-volumescom In conclusion in my analysis of recent developments I posit that the companys underwhelming performance in Q4 2023 is predominantly attributed to temporary factors rather than persistent secular issues Conversely I identify several positive secular indicators: consistent growth in deliveries an impressive projected growth rate for 2024 and ongoing substantial investments in innovation including the promising ramp-up of Cybertruck production Consequently I encourage readers to look beyond the transient disruptions emphasizing the importance of not losing sight of the overall positive trajectory amid any short-term noise Tesla was one of the best-performing S&P 500 stocks in 2023 with a 110% return Nevertheless the onset of 2024 marked a challenging period for the company witnessing a significant downturn with approximately a 25% reduction in its market capitalization since the years commencement As previously highlighted the primary driver behind this decline can be attributed to the lackluster Q4 earnings report where the softened revenue outlook for FY2024 played a pivotal role in the notable depreciation of the stock price The table below shows that the current FY2024 revenue forecast is around $8 billion lower than the levels forecasted on November 23 At the same time I want to emphasize that the estimated consensus long-term revenue CAGR is still above 20% and even slightly higher than before That said Wall Street analysts consider revenue challenges short-term and not secular Authors calculation Authors calculation Let me update my discounted cash flow [DCF] analysis using new underlying assumptions as the environment has changed since November 2023 Moreover I will provide readers with the DCF outcomes of the three different revenue growth scenarios First let me determine the discount rate in light of the Feds recent announcement that three rate cuts are expected in 2024 Assuming that rate cats will be steady with a 25 basis points step each time I decrease my previous 10% WACC assumption to 925% Second let me move on to the FCF ex-SBC margin projections Using the 043% level demonstrated in FY2023 will be conservative enough for a cautious FY 2024 However I expect an aggressive 150 basis points expansion for the years beyond because Tesla has a strong track record of profitability expansion as the business ramped up For my base-case scenario I use a 15% revenue CAGR for the next decade which is substantially slower than the growth rate outlined in the above table meaning the assumption is very conservative I am also adding up the current $195 billion net cash position to the fair value calculation Authors calculations Authors calculations For the base-case scenario Teslas fair capitalization is around $710 billion This is almost 20% higher than the current market cap indicating a compelling upside potential It is also crucial to understand that undisputed market leaders like Tesla usually deserve a premium from the market the extent of which depends on the broader markets sentiment However the premium is difficult to assess reliably and to calculate my base-case target price; I will just inflate the current $188 share price by the estimated 19% upside potential which gives me $224 per share I will now delve into simulating two additional scenarios— one optimistic and the other pessimistic In the spirit of fairness Ill allow for a range of plus-minus three percentage points in the change to revenue CAGR on both ends of the spectrum I expect all other assumptions to be unchanged for both scenarios Let me start with the optimistic scenario ie with an 18% revenue CAGR for the next decade Authors calculations Authors calculations With the optimistic 18% revenue CAGR incorporated the fair capitalization jumps to almost $900 billion which means nearly a 48% upside potential Achieving these levels is not unreal for Tesla given the fact that its market cap has already surpassed $1 trillion a few times Adjusting the current $188 share price up by 48% gives the optimistic-case target price of $278 Now let us move to the pessimistic scenario with a 12% revenue CAGR Authors calculations Authors calculations As evident from the analysis above with a 12% revenue CAGR the stock appears to be slightly overvalued Its crucial to emphasize that the 5% downside potential is relatively minor particularly when considering that the projected 12% growth rate is nearly half of the consensus estimates Consequently the likelihood of such a scenario is deemed to be very low I am demonstrating this scenario to demonstrate the margin of safety for investors at current stock price levels A 5% reduction to the current TSLA price results in a pessimistic-case target price of $178 Here Im going to present a concise summary of the scenario table and the corresponding target prices derived from the analysis Authors calculations Authors calculations From the perspective of the risk it is important to emphasize that the competition is intensifying fiercely especially from the Chinese auto giant BYD (OTCPK:BYDDF) BYD has outpaced Tesla for the second year in a row in terms of production volumes building more than three million cars in 2023 Even Elon Musk has recently acknowledged the strength of Chinese EV makers and warned that they could demolish global competitors without trade barriers While I am convinced that BYD cannot compete with Tesla in terms of brand power and technology I must also highlight where BYDs strengths might make obstacles for Tesla First BYD has an extensive model lineup which helps the company to address various segments This looks like a solid advantage compared to Tesla whose narrower model lineup Second BYD has a very solid position to conquer the global segment of cheapest EVs with its Seagull and Dolphin models with prices of $12k and $16k respectively To mitigate the competition risk from BYD I believe Tesla should continue betting on its strengths which are the technology and the ability to quickly ramp up the production of current models While I believe that BYD is at the moment the major global EV competitor for Tesla I think it will also be useful for readers to understand the whole competitive EV landscape up to date As I have mentioned earlier Tesla delivered 181 million vehicles delivering a 38% YoY growth Below I would like to demonstrate how the largest automakers performed in 2023 in terms of EV deliveries I show the companies that are the greatest threats to Tesla in my opinion Apart from BYD there are several EV companies from China and Li Auto (LI) demonstrates an impressive growth rate but its model line does not significantly overlap with TSLA Geely Groups (OTCPK:GELYF) growth substantially outpaced Teslas but the EV scale is almost two times lower Robust delivery dynamics of iconic German automakers pose a notable threat to Teslas market share given their established brands and foothold in the luxury segment However despite their strong presence their EV production scales still lag considerably behind Teslas While other automotive manufacturers indeed present a challenge to Tesla its important to note that their delivery growth rates are likely to decelerate as EV production volumes increase naturally Furthermore examining the provided data its evident that despite some reports raising concerns about a potential cooling of the EV market several automakers exhibit impressive growth rates This underscores the enduring and robust demand for electric vehicles indicating a promising near-term outlook for the industry despite an uncertain macro environment Compiled by the author Compiled by the author Elon Musk is an extraordinary and polarizing figure serving as both a boon and a significant risk for Tesla His status as one of the most renowned individuals globally affords Tesla the unique advantage of spending minimal resources on marketing redirecting those savings toward innovation However due to Mr Musks wide popularity Teslas CEO frequently gets a lot of negative press which might adversely affect the stock price despite having no real effect on the companys fundamentals The inherent risk of a seamless link between Teslas image and Elon Musk poses a challenge beyond managements control Investors should remain cognizant of this risk and be prepared to endure substantial volatility when provocative and controversial headlines surface in the news The considerable volatility of Teslas stock is evident from its wide 52-week price range spanning from $152 to $300 As such pinpointing optimal entry points can be challenging For investors with moderate risk tolerance navigating highly volatile stocks like Tesla I recommend employing a dollar-cost averaging strategy and maintaining a long-term investment horizon For investors who are ready to take more risks strategically increasing exposure to Tesla stock during significant drawdowns can also be a sound approach For instance in 2022 the stock experienced a sharp -68% downturn only to rebound impressively by 110% in 2023 This highlights the potential for substantial gains following periods of market turbulence Seeking Alpha Seeking Alpha In summary Id like for you to look past the market noise knowing what appears to be an overreaction to the latest earnings release While deliveries growth is expected to decelerate notably in 2024 this primarily reflects the broader markets slowdown as EV penetration deepens On the profitability front the Q4 2023 decline can be attributed to temporary factors and heightened investments in innovation rather than any inherent secular issues In my view the valuation presents an attractive proposition with limited downside potential even under a highly pessimistic scenario To encapsulate I maintain a Strong Buy recommendation for

How many are needed on each continent? Elon Musk: Its a good question Its not something we -- I think well provide an update about that in the future but it is something were thinking about very carefully I really kind of like what is the fastest path to 1000-gigawatt-hours a year of production And youll see announcements come out later this year and next that answer that question Elon Musk CEO Tesla Q4 2022 Earnings Call Tesla Q3 2023 Investor Presentation Tesla Q3 2023 Investor Presentation Tesla Q3 2023 Investor Presentation Tesla Q3 2023 Investor Presentation After a substantial amount of analysis of the business I have distilled its unit economics for you below The math underlying this business is as follows: And this straightforward math is why Mr Musk has remarked: It [Tesla Energy Megapack] could be bigger but it will certainly be of a similar magnitude Elon Musk on 2019 Earnings Call Notably Mr Musk has also remarked that the business could achieve margins of 60%+ in the past (of course this is conjecture on his part and it remains to be seen) so it cannot be perfectly discerned at present as to where the upward trajectory of Tesla Energys gross margins will reach their asymptotic limit Memos By Heller House Memos By Heller House The business is very simple and the above-illustrated math represents the basic unit economics of the business Theres really not much more to say about it though it certainly need be said as I see so many folks commenting on the valuation of Tesla without fully appreciating the various lines of business and their possible unit economics Am I preaching Gospel to you today? Of course not and I think we have all divined that But in the interest of providing to you an explanation as to why Tesla would be valued so richly this basic math gives you greater context To close this section for your edification we can see Tesla Energys revenues and cost of goods sold below Tesla Q3 2023 Investor Presentation Tesla Q3 2023 Investor Presentation As we did for electric vehicles and Teslas FSD platform lets now perform a valuation exercise for Tesla Energy whereby we determine via a sum of the parts valuation exercise what the entire Tesla business could be worth long term and correspondingly what returns we may generate in purchasing it at about $650B in enterprise value which is where it trades today To perform this valuation exercise I will leverage the data Ive shared with you thus far with which I will populate my valuation models assumptions Assumptions: TTM 12-month revenue [A] $624 billion Potential Free Cash Flow Margin [B] (conservative) 15% Average diluted shares outstanding [C] 348 billion Free cash flow per share [D = (A * B) / C] $27 Free cash flow per share growth rate (results in 922 GWh by yr 10) 50% Terminal growth rate 3% Years of elevated growth 10 Total years to stimulate 100 Discount Rate (Our Next Best Alternative) 98% LA Stevens Valuation ModelLA Stevens Valuation Model LA Stevens Valuation Model LA Stevens Valuation Model As we can see Tesla Energy could be worth $44979/share by 2033 which represents an enterprise value of $1565T Today the entire Tesla conglomerate trades at about $234/share and $710B in enterprise value And remember this is just one line of business among: I believe this growth represents the exciting prospect that Tesla Energy and specifically its Megapack product may indeed be seen as Teslas AWS over the long run The unit economics are there The global demand is there and will continue to grow especially as demand on the electrical grid increases massively alongside EV adoption (which is often something that bears or skeptics miss in their calculations of how large this business could become) Today in the same way that AWS generated about $6B in 2015 Tesla Energy could be ready to scale parabolically in the decade ahead FourWeekMBA FourWeekMBA The central risk to the Megapack thesis revolves around Teslas ability to execute For instance while Cybertruck is an attractive product it will take a decade for some folks to receive the orders they are placing today Another risk would be lower cost producers achieving quality and reliability parity with Teslas Megapack product Thank you for reading and have a great day This article was written by Louis Stevens offers a proprietary approach to equity (stock) investing Employing his Four Foundational Investment Frameworks Louis purchases industry-leading businesses that possess mountainous cash hoards robust free cash flow generation long runways for growth and quality company cultures Here is a snapshot of the performance of the companies selected using these frameworks: https://wwwtiprankscom/experts/bloggers/louis-stevens Analyst’s Disclosure: I/we have a beneficial long position in the shares of TSLA AMZN either through stock ownership options or other derivatives I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha) I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Seeking Alphas Disclosure: Past performance is no guarantee of future results No recommendation or advice is being given as to whether any investment is suitable for a particular investor Any views or opinions expressed above may not reflect those of Seeking Alpha as a whole Seeking Alpha is not a licensed securities dealer broker or US investment adviser or investment bank Our analysts are third party authors that include both professional investors and individual investors who may not be licensed or certified by any institute or regulatory body"

The CEO has reiterated his stance that Tesla could – if things go well – be worth more in five years than Apple and Saudi Arabian Oil (Aramco) combined Now there are a couple of things that aren’t quite clear about this One is whether Musk meant Tesla will be worth more than those businesses are worth now or more than their value in 2029 On the assumption that the relevant numbers are the current ones that’s a total value of $495trn (Apple is worth $283trn Aramco $212trn) Tesla currently has a market cap of $758bn In other words the company is set to be worth around 65 times what its shares trade at today With a current share price of $242 that’s $1580 per share That’s a 45% average increase a year which is a big ask But this is in the context of a firm whose share price increased by over 100% in 2023 That kind of growth is a lot to expect from a car company The industry is notoriously cyclical competitive and capital intensive – none of which is conducive to sustained high growth According to its CEO though Tesla isn’t a car business In a post on X – formerly known as Twitter – Elon Musk stated the firm is “an AI/robotics company that appears to many to be a car company” It’s easy to see why investors might get confused The previous day the firm had released its quarterly report of the number of cars it assembled and delivered during the last three months of 2023 The report was reasonably strong with 485000 cars delivered taking the total to 18m for the year – in line with previous guidance But the stock slipped after the announcement One reason for the decline in the stock was the news that BYD – a Chinese car manufacturer – sold 526000 electric vehicles during the last three months of 2023 This is significant for Tesla Around 20% of Tesla’s sales come from China And even if the firm is more than a car company – which I believe it is – cars are an important part of the picture There are also issues around margins While the firm met its target for vehicle deliveries in 2023 it did so by cutting prices which hurt profitability Tesla supporters argue that this was a calculated move to increase the company’s market share It sounds plausible to me but it makes the results from BYD more of a concern As Musk noted $1580 per share by 2029 would require Tesla to execute well on all fronts But it’s hard to think of another stock that even has a meaningful chance at providing that kind of return There’s still a long way to go on robotaxis and humanoid robots but the company is arguably streets ahead of the competition Yet the more the stock falls the more I like it from an investment perspective even if it undershoots its price target Should you invest the value of your investment may rise or fall and your capital is at risk Before

more than 3 million new energy vehicles in 2023 surpassing Teslas production for a second straight year Tesla said Tuesday it produced 184 million cars in 2023 Most of BYDs cars sell in a lower price range than Teslas and come in hybrid versions in addition to battery-only powered cars While total production surpassed Tesla BYD manufactured 16 million battery-only passenger cars and 14 million hybrids putting Tesla on top for battery-only production Elon Musks automaker only sells purely battery-powered cars China accounted for about one-fifth of Teslas sales in the quarter ended Sept 30 BYD shares fell by more than 2% in Hong Kong trading Tuesday morning Even though it surpassed the 3 million mark BYDs annual sales slightly missed CLSAs expectations for 305 million vehicles BYD said it sold 302 million new energy vehicles in 2023 The company stopped producing purely gasoline and diesel-powered cars in March 2022 Companies wanting a slice of Chinas fast-growing electric car market have flooded the space with new models Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi last week detailed its plans to launch an EV to compete with Porsche and Tesla Li Auto whose monthly deliveries have surged to record highs is set to launch its first purely battery-powered vehicle MEGA on March 1 and begin deliveries later that month according to an announcement Sunday Thats slightly later than initial projections for late February deliveries The startup has so far seen success with cars that come with a fuel tank to charge the battery and extend driving range Li Auto said it delivered more than 50000 cars in December for a total of 376030 in 2023 a 182% year on year increase Xpeng on Monday launched its X9 MPV with deliveries starting immediately The Chinese EV maker said its overall deliveries of electric cars rose 17% year on year to 141601 in 2023 with a record 20115 vehicles delivered in December Huaweis new energy vehicle brand Aito said Monday that orders for its M9 SUV have surpassed 30000 in the seven days since its launch M9 mass deliveries are set to begin in late February Aito said it delivered 94380 cars in 2023 including 24468 in December alone For 2022 Aito said it delivered more than 75000 cars since beginning deliveries in March of that year Zeekr backed by Geely said it started Monday to deliver its latest model the 007 electric sedan Zeekr said its overall deliveries rose by 65% in 2023 to 118685 That total figure is still lower than Nios which said it delivered 160038 cars in 2023 up by nearly 31% year on year The company delivered just over 18000 cars in December Among the many other electric car brands in China Nezha reported deliveries of 127496 cars in 2023 Aion a spinoff of state-owned GAC Motor said it sold more than 480000 cars in 2023 up 77% year on year Several Chinese electric car players including Nio and BYD are also pushing into markets outside China especially Europe BYDs overseas sales in 2023 exceeded 242000 new energy passenger vehicles according to CNBC calculations of public data The company did not disclose comparable 2022 figures The Chinese EV giant announced plans in December to build a new production center in Hungary The company said it currently sells five models in Europe and plans to launch three more for the region in the next 12 months While the China market is one of the pioneers entering into the era of EVs we believe moving overseas (building factories in the overseas market rather than just shipping vehicles manufactured in China) is the only way for Chinas leading carmakers to achieve success in the global market in the long run Nomura China autos analyst Joel Ying and a team said in a Jan 2 note Given the company already has a bus factory in Hungary we believe the decision to build the first EU PV factory in Hungary will help BYD to minimize the potential risks in the overseas market the report said BYD said it sold 36095 new energy passenger vehicles overseas in December

Well here are three things to know Firstly it was always going to be tough for the Magnificent Seven (Apple Amazon Alphabet Meta Microsoft Nvidia and Tesla) to keep rising in unison That’s because they are very different companies Microsoft for example predominantly sells software And businesses can’t do without its products Tesla meanwhile sells electric vehicles (EVs) And the market for EVs has cooled a little recently as interest rates have risen and disposable income levels have dropped This brings me to Tesla’s results for Q4 2023 Put simply they were quite poor For the period revenue was up just 3% year on year to $252bn This marks the slowest pace of growth in more than three years Meanwhile gross margin came in at just 176% compared with 238% a year earlier and analysts’ average estimate of 183% Many of the other Magnificent Seven stocks have gross margins in excess of 50% As for earnings per share they came in at 71 cents down 40% year on year and below the consensus forecast of 74 cents And looking ahead the company warned of “notably lower” sales growth The problem here is that Tesla stock was trading at a very high valuation going into the earnings (the P/E ratio was near 60) So there was little room for error It’s worth noting that a slowdown in consumer demand is not the only challenge the EV maker is facing right now Another major issue is competition from rivals such as China’s BYD (which overtook Tesla to become the world’s top selling EV company last year) On the Q4 earnings call Tesla CEO Elon Musk said that Chinese automakers will “demolish” global rivals if trade barriers are not put in place underscoring the heat that the company is facing from Chinese rivals right now I’ll point out that analysts at Bernstein reckon that BYD stock is a better bet than Tesla In a research note posted late last year they highlighted the big valuation gap between the two EV makers Now from a long-term investment perspective Tesla still has a lot going for it One the earnings call Musk said that he sees a “path to creating an artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics juggernaut of truly immense capability and power” This is something to be excited about In the near term however I expect the stock to be volatile given the challenges the company is facing and its high valuation My personal short-term share price target for Tesla (and a level I might be interested in buying at) is $150 Let’s see if it gets there Should you invest the value of your investment may rise or fall and your capital is at risk Before investing your individual circumstances should be assessed Consider taking independent financial advice Edward Sheldon has positions in Alphabet Amazon Apple Microsoft and Nvidia The Motley Fool UK has recommended Alphabet Amazon Apple Meta Platforms Microsoft Nvidia and Tesla Randi Zuckerberg a former director of market development and spokeswoman for Facebook and sister to Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg is a member of The Motley Fools board of directors John Mackey former CEO of Whole Foods Market an Amazon subsidiary is a member of The Motley Fool’s board of directors Suzanne Frey an executive at Alphabet is a member of The Motley Fool’s board of directors Views expressed on the companies mentioned in this article are those of the writer and therefore may differ from the official recommendations we make in our subscription services such as Share Advisor Hidden Winners and Pro Here at The Motley Fool we believe that considering a diverse range of insights makes us better investors 25 March 2024 Ben McPoland Might investing in NIO stock at its current price make this Fool a fortune?

Elon Musk’s $56 billion pay deal was canceled after a lengthy court battle in the state that the Tesla head honcho loves to hate What does this mean? Elon Musk has many skills including the ability to convert a legion of young men into loyal fans of oddly shaped trucks through the medium of podcasts But clearly winning over a court of law is not one of them Musk was granted a $56 billion ten-year pay deal back in 2018 the biggest in the history of corporate America There was just one problem: a disgruntled shareholder with a whole nine Tesla shares to their name who argued that investors in the firm weren’t given a big enough heads-up On Tuesday a Delaware judge agreed So even though Musk argued that the money could fund humanity’s move to Mars when the Earth crumbles the court canceled the record-breaking compensation Why should I care? Zooming out: A win for one is a win for all Investors in the US don’t usually kick up a fuss about how much company bosses are paid Not that it has anything on Musk’s deal mind you: that $56 billion was six times what 2021’s 200 highest-paid executives made combined See big payouts tend to be made in the form of shares or share options as Musk’s was That incentivizes big bosses to drum up the share price which only benefits everyday shareholders too The bigger picture: “G” for “Greater good” Media has lit up the “E” in “ESG” with eco-friendly LED lights But while environmental considerations matter especially if you’d rather save the planet than follow Musk into infinite space the social and governance factors tend to be overlooked Musk’s pay debacle could dust off the governance folder though: independent committees should ensure that a CEO’s salary lines up with the value they deliver and this latest ruling could turn that theory into more common practice elon musk esg options regulation tesla stocks us amazon earnings earnings healthcare Disclaimer: These articles are provided for information purposes only Occasionally an opinion about whether to buy or sell a specific investment may be provided The content is not intended to be a personal recommendation to buy or sell any financial instrument or product or to adopt any investment strategy as it is not provided based on an assessment of your investing knowledge and experience your financial situation or your investment objectives The value of your investments and the income derived from them may go down as well as up You may not get back all the money that you invest The investments referred to in this article may not be suitable for all investors and if in doubt an investor should seek advice from a qualified investment advisor /3 • Your free quarterly content is about to expire Uncover the biggest trends and opportunities Subscribe now for 50% off Cancel anytime"

In terms of for their pricing pressures price wars and profitability? - Right And this is something also that Elon Musk has talked about slowing growth of sales although hes talked more about it feels like whats going on here in the US but obviously China is going to be an issue as well Now probably not affecting the stock but also floating around out there today is a story from Reuters that the company has lowering its driving range estimates Now Tesla has been under pressure from regulators about the accuracy of its range estimates And there have been various stories over the years saying that the company is sort of juiced those estimates or has not been entirely honest about the estimates So basically Reuters went and looked at their estimates then and now and found that they had in fact brought some of them down So is that affecting the stock? Probably not right So theres some crosscurrents going on obviously a lot of folks are looking at it on the Trending Ticker page and trying to figure out going into this year is Tesla one I want to be in? And today they dont want More people dont want to be in it than want to be in it or at a lower price - Although we know what a run And interesting when were talking about that market too because just to bring back to China we talked so much about the competition for Tesla including of course BYD - Yes indeed All right lets look at CrowdStrike also Those shares are trending and they are jumping up 5% Morgan Stanley upgrading the stock to overweight from equal weight Analysts there say they see an improving demand outlook for the cybersecurity technology company Guess what? They think Generative AI is going to be good for CrowdStrike as well and that there are going to be more cyber attacks and that will help CrowdStrike here Basically the analysts saying its going to be a lead beneficiary of the rising threat environment That was a quote from that Morgan Stanley analyst - Yeah their target goes to 304 They also-- as you point out certainly one bullet here they think it can leverage and importantly monetize Generative AI They also note the stock has already-- we should point out it is ripped higher here Julie I mean Morgan Stanleys coming in this thing is up 185% in the past 12 months But obviously Morgan Stanleys telling clients listen they think it goes higher In fact how many bulls on the street? Pretty much everyone Julie to holds to sell-- to sells to holds 46 buys So Morgan Stanley has plenty of company when it comes to CrowdsStrike - I mean it definitely feels like theres a lot of cybersecurity optimism broadly right? And there are a lot of names in the industry for people to choose from to your point Im going to have to You know what Im going to do Im going to have to look at a head-to-head comparison of CrowdStrike and some of its competitors in terms of analyst bullishness And who kind of wins in that bullishness - Thats going to be hard to beat for CrowdStrike Thats a lot of fans - I mean 92% Thats a pretty high percentage - All right were going to end it up here with Tilray Lets check those shares falling in todays trade Thats despite reporting a narrowing loss and clocking in record revenue The company however is still facing pressures from challenges in the cannabis market will be hearing from Irwin Simon thats Tilrays CEO at 4:00 PM Eastern So this ones interesting So Tilray reporting results here It looks like revenue just beat narrower than expected adjusted loss adjusted gross margin for cannabis 35% and that was 43% in the year ago period They did reiterate though 2024 guidance The alcohol business though climbed 117% to 47 million Julie And of course you know Tilray acquired those beer brands from Anheuser-Busch last summer And one big question for investors on this one is US health officials kind of recommending easing restrictions on marijuana maybe reclassifying marijuana as a schedule III drug that is a big open question for Tilray investors How that plays out there? - Right It seems like the Tilray would be poised to sell medical cannabis in the United States but it doesnt necessarily look like they would get into the recreational business in the US Right now they operate in Canada in the recreational market That 114% number sounds good but to your point its because they bought a bunch of stuff But this has been part of Irwin Simons strategy that the firm has been to build up its non-cannabis businesses including an alcohol and including in cannabis-infused drinks as well Ive been trying to look through the numbers here and try and figure out what happened with the stock because initially it was indeed rising On the conference call is when the company gave that reiterated guidance for the full year maybe thats an area that investors didnt love here but still trying to dig into and figure out exactly whats going on and thats something were going to ask Irwin about as well - Yeah You know what else Im going to ask him about? Vegetables - Right They sell vegetables - They growing vegetables in Quebec Im going to ask Irwin listen hes got strawberries cucumbers eggplants apparently maybe some tomatoes Basically monetizing some of that unneeded cannabis cultivation space - Right exactly - We have things to talk about - I dont know what tomato margin looks like versus-- - We ask Irwin maybe one knows Related Quotes"

Fact: My longest charging stop from OH to FL is 21 minutes! All in all he was stuck charging his car for a grand total of 126 minutes or just over a couple of hours and made a total of seven stops to replenish the juice in his battery Advert Not everyone was convinced as someone playing devils advocate said the Tesla driver spent over two hours charging their car for a trip of over 1000 miles They argued that there were hybrid cars which only really needed to stop every 500 miles meaning that instead of seven stops theyd only have to pull over twice While that might be the case the electric car driver argued back that when accounting for stops to get food or use the toilet it all worked out pretty similar in time unless you have an iron bladder There were other arguments over the number of stops the driver took as some thought stopping seven times in a journey of over 1000 miles was a bit excessive Meanwhile others pointed out that plenty of motorists took a break to get out of the drivers seat stretch their legs empty their bladder and potentially find something to eat more regularly Advert As with any car you want to make sure its got enough fuel to get where its going and if not youll need enough to reach the next point where you can top things up Charging an electric car will take much longer from a home outlet instead of one of the superchargers as Tesla reckon youll get about 44 miles of range per hour of charge from a wall connector Thats going to cost you a bit of money on the leccy bill and if you want to drive that cost down then youll need to spend thousands on a powerwall battery which uses solar panels and sticks the excess charge into filling up your car Topics: Tesla Cars Technology US News Joe graduated from the University of Salford with a degree in Journalism and worked for Reach before joining the LADbible Group When not writing he enjoys the nerdier things in life like painting wargaming miniatures and chatting with other nerds on the internet Hes also spent a few years coaching fencing Contact him via [email protected] @MrJoeHarker Advert Advert Advert breaking breaking"

Are we hitting the 10% in this country? Thats sort of the barrier and more people dont want to buy them He thinks its more of a price issue Weve got to have cheaper EVs to give to the masses And the legacy OEMs like Farley at Ford and Mary Barra at GM are saying we cant necessarily afford to make cars that cheap So well see Maybe the gen two cars will be better and from a profitability point of view SEANA SMITH: And Pras when it comes to the strategy that were learning here at least the companies that are most at risk when it comes to those legacy players out of what we have heard over the last two weeks in those at least short-term plans trying to navigate what is turning out to be an extremely challenging landscape is there one that maybe is better positioned than the other just in terms of helping to stem some of those losses? PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: I would say there thats-- I would say Ford and GM are in the drivers seat because they have really strong truck businesses and that seems to not be going away Stellantis will report next week And they do have the RAM truck franchise but its not a big moneymaker as F-150 Silverado GMC Sierra So I think if they have kind of a strong truck and SUV business you can kind of lean on that for a little bit But wait till oil prices go back high again then consumers will shift over to cheaper cars So right now I would say those guys are in a better spot in America at least because of the fact that the trucks and SUVs SEANA SMITH: Yeah giving them the ability to offset some of that weakness Related Quotes"

Heres what to know","1/15/2024","https://www.marketwatch.com/story/is-buying-a-used-tesla-from-hertz-a-good-deal-heres-what-to-know-75d1e9f7","Hertz Global Holdings Inc HTZ -013% said Thursday it is selling about 20000 electric vehicles from its fleet including many Tesla Model S sedans The move is aimed at better balancing supply and expected demand for EVs allowing Hertz to scrap a disproportionate number of lower-margin rentals and reduce damage expenses associated with EVs It also marks a reversal for Hertz which in 2021 bet on electric cars with a 100000-vehicle order from Tesla TSLA +575% The order propelled Tesla’s valuation above $1 trillion for the first time But is scooping up one of those EVs from Hertz a good deal for potential car buyers? It depends experts told MarketWatch Sean Tucker senior editor at Kelley Blue Book looked through the listings for used Tesla vehicles that Hertz had posted and said he has “mixed feelings” “These are surprisingly reasonable prices for a used EV” he told MarketWatch Listings on the Hertz site on Thursday ranged from a 2021 Tesla Model 3 Standard Range Plus Sedan with 31647 miles on its odometer for $20125 to a 2022 Tesla Model Y Long Range SUV with 92789 miles for $40886 Some industry observers described the listing prices as downright “cheap” with some models priced as low as $17700 Some used EVs are eligible for a federal tax credit of up to $4000 that further sweetens the deal for buyers But to qualify for that credit the EV must be a model from 2022 or earlier and can’t have a sale price of more than $25000 There are also income limits for the credit To qualify individual buyers can only make up to $75000 or twice that for married couples filing jointly In many cases the cars Hertz is selling already have 50000 to 60000 miles on them even in vehicles that are about a year old That’s a lot of miles to pack on over a short period Tucker noted “Hertz Car Sales offers competitive pricing at a nonnegotiated price” with vehicles available online and at bricks-and-mortar sales locations a Hertz representative told MarketWatch Hertz is selling EVs in multiple makes and models and there are more coming in 2024 the representative said In the company’s “Rent2Buy program” potential buyers can rent a vehicle for up to three days or take a free two-hour test drive Rental charges are dropped when customers make a purchase the spokesperson said When considering whether to buy a used EV mileage isn’t necessarily the most important factor said Jeremy Robb senior director of economic and industry insights at Cox Automotive More important is the quality of the battery and the tires which can wear out more quickly than in gas-powered cars “Almost 60% of [an electric vehicle’s] value is tied up in a battery and batteries degrade with use” Tucker said That’s why Tucker recommended having a vehicle you’re considering inspected by an independent mechanic or technician — and one who understands EVs You’ll want to get the tires checked too because EVs weigh more than gas-powered cars and need special tires that can handle the wear That’s because EV batteries are much heavier than a traditional gasoline-powered engine One of the reasons Hertz is selling off so many EVs is the high cost of repairs For EVs repairs after an accident can cost thousands of dollars more than their gas-powered counterparts — something else that potential buyers may want to consider And of course for those who are serious about purchasing a Tesla from Hertz’s fleet the basics of used-car buying apply You shouldn’t purchase the car sight unseen Tucker said and if Hertz or any other seller of a used car won’t let you inspect it with your own mechanic don’t buy it That being said: “Hertz is a top-tier rental company” Robb said “I’m sure the vehicles they’re going to sell will overall be in really good shape” There are additional factors to consider when purchasing an electric vehicle used or new Robb and Tucker agreed: How often will you use it? Will you be able to charge the vehicle at home? What’s the charging infrastructure like where you live? “That’s one of the most important things that a consumer needs to consider” Robb said “Most people that have an EV have some way to charge at home If you don’t it’s probably going to be difficult for you over the long run” But for a lot of buyers “this is just about the cheapest way to get into a used Tesla right now” Tucker added “If there are consumers that were thinking about purchasing a used EV [the Hertz sale] may be a good option for them” Robb said “Some of these units might be at a more attractive price point” Californians face yet another setback on the housing front as a major insurer pulls out of 72000 home-insurance policies citing costs Hannah Erin Lang is a personal finance reporter for MarketWatch based in New York Previously she covered banking and finance for The Charlotte Observer in her home state of North Carolina She graduated from UNC-Chapel Hill with a degree in business journalism and grew up in the same town as her alma mater Hannah Erin Lang is a personal finance reporter for MarketWatch based in New York Previously she covered banking and finance for The Charlotte Observer in her home state of North Carolina She graduated from UNC-Chapel Hill with a degree in business journalism and grew up in the same town as her alma mater Visit a quote page and your recently viewed tickers will be displayed here"

has declined by around 12% While shares in the company’s smaller more fledgling competitors have experienced even sharper declines I can see why you may think this is concerning Based on this latest price action it’s clear that the market is concerned that issues like slowing growth high competition and falling margins are not issues on the verge of clearing up not even for the global leader in EVs Yet while this latest weakness may persist in the near-term keep something in mind The bull case for TSLA is not unraveling I wouldn’t count on shares doubling in price again (as happened in 2023) but there may be a path for TSLA to finish this year in the green Other “Magnificent Seven” stocks after an initial rough start to the year have since resumed trending higher With this it may appear strange that Tesla stock has failed to rebound and has in fact kept on declining However look at the latest news directly related to TSLA stock It’s not a mystery why this is happening It makes sense that sentiment has been shifting back towards bearish As I recently pointed out a “China recall” affected the stock but isn’t as bad as it sounds This month the company also announced that it was revising reported driving ranges for its vehicles in light of more stringent testing rules from US regulators Just last week Tesla announced a production halt at its German gigafactory This temporary shutdown is because of the impact of recent conflict in the Red Sea on supply chains As hinted above souring sentiment about the EV sector is dampening bullish sentiment for TSLA as well Even as some argue that talk of an “EV slowdown” is an overreaction investors remain concerned that a slowdown is happening and it will impact Tesla’s results in the coming quarters Pessimism for TSLA stock may be rising but there are plenty of die-hard Tesla fans that may see an upcoming event as something that could get shares out of their latest slump That would be Tesla’s next earnings release scheduled to happen post-market on Jan 24 If you can recall it was Tesla’s Q4 2022 earnings release last January that helped the stock get out of its late 2022/early 2023 en route to substantially higher prices Record earnings and upbeat guidance outweighed concerns about the impact of aggressive vehicle price cuts on margins and profitability While not for certain a similar scenario could play out following the Q4 2023 earnings release The EV maker did once again report strong production and delivery numbers for Q4 and the full year 2023 Updates to guidance suggesting something like a growth resurgence may help to outweigh margin-related worries once again Better yet even if there’s no post-earnings rally for TSLA later this month other potential catalysts could drive a rebound later this year For example like I pointed out a few weeks back an improving macro picture in China and the US or maybe even the unveiling of a low-priced EV According to the skeptics Tesla is still overvalued and overhyped In their view growth and margins will keep falling As the EV powerhouse becomes more like its incumbent automaker competition the stock will experience a severe de-rating Yet while bearish on shares are free to maintain such a view I wouldn’t write off TSLA’s 2024 prospects Much remains in play to send shares back to full charge A solid price performance this year doesn’t hinge on one particular event A strong Q4 earnings release improving EV demand trends and new vehicle launches are just some of many possible catalysts out there As such consider my view on Tesla unchanged If you’ve yet to buy TSLA stock consider recent or continued weakness a good time to do so If you currently hold a position there’s no need to hit the brakes TSLA stock earns a B rating in Portfolio

588,"Earnings Preview: Tesla (TSLA) Q4 Earnings Expected to Decline","1/17/2024","https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-tesla-tsla-q4-150030801.html","Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when Tesla (TSLA) reports results for the quarter ended December 2023 While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the companys earnings picture a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report which is expected to be released on January 24 On the other hand if they miss the stock may move lower While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on managements discussion of business conditions on the earnings call its worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise Zacks Consensus Estimate This electric car maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $074 per share in its upcoming report which represents a year-over-year change of -378% Revenues are expected to be $26 billion up 69% from the year-ago quarter Estimate Revisions Trend The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 054% higher over the last 30 days to the current level This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts Earnings Whisper Estimate revisions ahead of a companys earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier Thus a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate However the models predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell) How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Tesla? For Tesla the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the companys earnings prospects This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -104% On the other hand the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3 So this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Tesla will beat the consensus EPS estimate Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue? Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings So its worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number For the last reported quarter it was expected that Tesla would post earnings of $072 per share when it actually produced earnings of $066 delivering a surprise of -833% Over the last four quarters the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times Bottom Line An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors Similarly unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss That said betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success This is why its worth checking a companys Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before theyve reported Tesla doesnt appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate However investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release Expected Results of an Industry Player Paccar (PCAR) another stock in the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry is expected to report earnings per share of $217 for the quarter ended December 2023 This estimate points to a year-over-year change of +233% Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $818 billion up 58% from the year-ago quarter The consensus EPS estimate for Paccar has been revised 08% higher over the last 30 days to the current level However a higher Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 397% This Earnings ESP combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) suggests that Paccar will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Let’s look at its financial metrics to know more… Jan 23 2024 Against a backdrop of the rising prominence of Electric Vehicles (EVs) automaking giant Tesla Inc (TSLA) is expected to post its fourth-quarter results tomorrow The company already reported delivering approximately 181 million vehicles last year indicating a 38% year-over-year growth However TSLA’s decision to cut prices on its popular Model Y vehicles aligning with the price war it has initiated in the EV market has weighed on investor sentiments The stock closed its last trading session at $20880 lower than the 50-day moving average of $23749 and 200-day moving average of $23168 Furthermore Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas cut TSLA’s price target from $380 to $345 which is a significant drop Jonas anticipates TSLA’s 2024 volume and profitability outlook to be modest The company also faces increasing competition from other automakers Amid this TSLA would have to stall production at its German factory from January 29 to February 11 as vessel attacks in the Red Sea have led to a lack of components supplied through that route Another question clouding the company’s outlook is Chief Executive Elon Musk stating that he would be uncomfortable growing TSLA as an Artificial Intelligence (AI) leader if he did not have 25% voting control Given this situation let’s look at the trends of TSLA’s key financial metrics to understand why it might be wise to exercise caution and avoid the stock now Analyzing Tesla’s Financial Performance: From March 2021 to September 2023 The trend and fluctuations of the trailing-12-month net income of TSLA from March 2021 to September 2023 can be summarized as: 2024 STOCK MARKET OUTLOOK From this data series it’s clear that TSLA’s net income has been on a general upward trend from March 2021 to December 2022 with fluctuations in 2023 The growth rate computed by assessing the final value from the first indicates an expansion of approximately $964 billion Please note that greater emphasis has been placed on more recent data in accordance with the given instructions The reported gross margin of TSLA indicates a general increasing trend from the start to the middle of the series (March 2021 to June 2022) This period observed the gross margin improving from 212% in March 2021 to a peak of 271% by June 2022 However after this period a consistent downward trend is evident with the gross margin decreasing from 271% in June 2022 to 198% by September 2023 Key notes: The growth rate of the gross margin taking the last value from the first value was negative which indicates a decrease though there were periods of increase in the initial part of the series The overall trend showcases a decline in the gross margin for TSLA from mid-2022 to late 2023 This suggests an increased cost of goods sold or decreased net sales during this latter period It’s crucial for stakeholders to monitor these shifts over time to evaluate business performance and adjust strategies accordingly The ROIC (Return on Invested Capital) trend for TSLA shows a fluctuating pattern over the period given Here’s a brief overview of the trend and fluctuations: In taking into account the first and last available values TSLA’s ROIC has grown from 71% in March 2021 to 247% in September 2023 representing a sizable growth rate Emphasizing the more recent data there appears to be a reverse in the previous upward trend Transitioning from the fourth quarter of 2022 to the third quarter of 2023 the ROIC reduced potentially indicating a negative change in the company’s profitability in this last quarter Here is an analysis of the asset turnover trend of TSLA based on the provided series data: In conclusion TSLA has demonstrated improvements in maximizing the usage of its assets to deliver sales Despite the recent fall the overall trend has remained positive with remarkable growth over time Analyzing Tesla’s Share Price Fluctuations from July 2023 to January 2024 The data represents the share price of TSLA from July 28 2023 to January 22 2024 From the above description it is evident that there are fluctuations in TSLA’s share price

In 2010 Tesla became the first US car company to go public since Ford in 1956 But CEO Elon Musk has revealed that just one year earlier the late Charlie Munger listed several reasons to him why he believed the electric vehicle (EV) firm would fail Yet despite the high likelihood of failure it has triumphed And last year its Model Y became the world’s bestselling car overtaking the Toyota Corolla even though it costs about twice as much To go from a start-up with one product to the world’s most valuable auto maker in less than 15 years is truly remarkable Even Munger later said: “What Tesla has done in the car business is a minor miracle“ So Tesla is undoubtedly a great company But is the stock overpriced? The shares currently trade at 69 times expected earnings for 2023 That drops to 55 times for this year’s forecast earnings That’s a mighty premium to the wider S&P 500 (21) And if this were a value stock then it would certainly be horribly mispriced But Tesla is a quality growth stock and these rarely trade at average market multiples Moreover the firm sold 18m vehicles last year despite the dodgy state of the global economy That was up from less than 500000 vehicles in 2020 So it is growing much quicker than the overall auto market arguably justifying its premium Admittedly the stock was ridiculously overvalued in late 2020 when it was trading at preposterous levels But back then its Shanghai factory had just begun production and the gigafactories in Texas and Berlin weren’t even built Therefore I think the stock is less risky today though there are challenges Musk predicted that Tesla’s biggest competitive threat would come from Chinese EV firms not legacy Western carmakers This was correct as Chinese rival BYD has just overtaken Tesla as the world’s top-selling EV firm I think Chinese competition is a risk as is China itself New regulations may emerge especially around data which Tesla collects a lot of and that could hinder operations and growth there If I’m after a cheap stock on a low valuation with a juicy 51% dividend yield then Ford could be what I’m looking for If I want to invest in fast-growing industries (EVs and solar energy) and potential future ones (robots and robo-taxis) then Tesla certainly fits the bill For different reasons I think both stocks could add value to a balanced portfolio despite the challenging global economy But given Tesla’s $754bn market cap I don’t expect the stock to double again this year And Musk has been tempering growth expectations lately saying the days of annual 50%+ growth are probably over He still expects rapid growth though If I didn’t already own Tesla shares I’d consider investing today but I wouldn’t bet the farm Should you invest the value of your investment may rise or fall and your capital is at risk Before investing your individual circumstances should be assessed Consider taking independent financial advice Ben McPoland has positions in Tesla The Motley Fool UK has recommended Tesla Views expressed on the companies mentioned in this article are those of the writer and therefore may differ from the official recommendations we make in our subscription services such as Share Advisor Hidden Winners and Pro Here at The Motley Fool we believe that considering a diverse range of insights makes us better investors 25 March 2024 Sumayya Mansoor This Fool explains how passive income stocks can help to create an additional income stream and details two picks she… Read more » 25 March 2024 Royston Wild These FTSE 250 trusts are on sale right now!

610,"Elon Musk said it was ‘time to move on’ from hybrids years ago—but a windfall from them will help Japanese carmakers challenge Tesla in EVs","2/16/2024","https://fortune.com/2024/02/16/japanese-carmakers-evs-push-helped-by-hybrids-windfall-elon-musk-tesla/","Timing matters When it comes to timing the transition to electric vehicles several Japanese automakers may be getting it just about right—despite appearing to be late to the game at first Rather than rush headlong into EVs Toyota Honda and Mazda have focused on hybrid vehicles as a more practical transition—to great success They’ve each enjoyed surging sales of hybrids which has helped them achieve record or near-record profits That’s positioned them well financially to invest in EVs today with an eye toward entering the fray in earnest in the second half of this decade Meanwhile the sales growth of electric vehicles while still strong has recently slowed prompting Ford and GM to pare back their production plans This is partly because an initial wave of EV enthusiasts have already bought their vehicles and everyday car shoppers are more likely to be turned off by higher prices range anxiety and poor resale value among other concerns Tesla in a call with investors last month warned of “notably lower” sales growth this year after a disappointing fourth quarter CEO Elon Musk said his EV maker is “between two major growth waves” as it aims to start production of a more affordable new model late next year One difference with that second growth wave for Tesla is that unlike in the first it will face intense competition from Japanese carmakers whose EV pushes have been helped by surging hybrid profits putting them on a stronger financial footing In 2022 Musk dismissed hybrids as a phase saying that it’s “time to move on” from them He might be right in the long run especially as regulators around the world push harder for EV adoption to meet climate goals In California and New York zero-emission mandates loom over the automotive landscape Both states will require that all new passenger vehicles sold be zero-emission by 2035 But for now many consumers are opting for hybrids which use less fuel than traditional vehicles—easier on the environment and the wallet—even while still requiring occasional trips to the gas station Currently car shoppers are worried about the downsides of EVs said Mazda CFO Jeffrey Guyton as reported by Automotive News “Our strategy is to follow regulation yes but also to pay close attention to what actual customers want” he said Mazda thanks in large part to strong hybrid sales reported record profits in its fiscal third quarter ending Dec 31 2023—and is closing in on the same for the full year ending March 31 Guyton said hybrids are getting extra attention among US consumers thanks in part to growing interest in electric vehicles “I think hybrid is benefiting a little bit from the hype around EV” Guyton said “Now there is a flattening of the EV market And I think the people who used to be shouting EV and promoting EV have decided well if we cannot get people to take pure electric hybrid is a good alternative” While EVs accounted for less than 1% of Mazda’s global sales through last September the carmaker expects that to reach up to 40% by 2030 By that time it hopes to be selling seven or eight EV models It recently set up a standalone division to build EVs on a new scalable platform with the first models from that expected to launch in the 2025-2027 timeframe Honda has similarly enjoyed surging sales and profits thanks in no small part to hybrids Two hybrid models accounted for a quarter of Honda’s total US sales in 2023 But it also aims to introduce 30 new EV models globally by 2030 by which time it plans on EVs making up 40% of its sales in North America Toyota the world’s top carmaker for four years running feels vindicated after being widely criticized for its EV stance It did sell an electric version of its RAV4 SUV that was discontinued in 2014 and more recently it launched an EV called the bZ4X in 2022 but it’s made relatively few EV offerings especially considering its size But this month Toyota said it expects to notch record operating profit for the fiscal year ending March 31 crediting higher sales of hybrid vehicles across all its major markets “We think the market is now rethinking the potential of hybrid products which are a strength of Toyota” Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a recent research note But as Toyota rakes in the hybrid profits it also has big plans for EVs In November 2023 it vowed to make 35 million EVs annually by 2030 with dozens of different models across its Toyota and Lexus brands To put that in perspective Tesla sold 18 million EVs last year And as soon as 2027 Toyota plans to introduce new solid-state batteries that allow for longer ranges and faster charge times than today’s lithium-ion batteries In October 2022 Akio Toyoda then CEO of Toyota said that EVs “are just going to take longer than the media would like us to believe” thanks in part to insufficient charging infrastructure He emphasized the importance of hybrids in the meantime insisting that Toyota would keep offering a wide variety of powertrains and let consumers decide for themselves Last month he predicted that EVs would capture just 30% of the market and would share the road with hybrid traditional and hydrogen-powered vehicles But that doesn’t mean Toyota won’t push hard into the EV space Last year Toyoda—whose grandfather founded the Japanese auto giant—resigned as CEO and became chairman making way for a new leadership team that’s better able to transition to EVs “I am an old-fashioned person in regards to digitalization electric vehicles and connected cars” Toyoda said “I cannot go beyond being a car guy and that is my limitation The new team can do what I can’t do”

Tesla will move immediately to hold a shareholder vote to transfer state of incorporation to Texas” On Tuesday a Delaware judge called a 2018 share-based package awarded to the Tesla chief executive “an unfathomable sum” that was unfair to shareholders and struck down the arrangement Soon after Musk wrote on X: “Never incorporate your company in the state of Delaware” He added: “I recommend incorporating in Nevada or Texas if you prefer shareholders to decide matters” Musk has strong ties with Texas He moved Tesla’s corporate headquarters from Palo Alto in California to the Texas city of Austin in 2021 after criticising California’s regulations and taxes and also clashing with health officials at the start of the Covid pandemic over reopening a factory in Fremont One of the carmaker’s gigafactories is in Texas and it is building a $1bn (£800m) lithium refinery in the state aiming to produce enough battery-grade lithium for about 1m vehicles by 2025 Other Musk companies including the rocket firm SpaceX and the tunnelling business the Boring Company also have operations in Texas Another Musk-related Texas expansion is under way at X which he also owns after the social media platform announced last month it would open a content moderation office in Austin with 100 staff It was not immediately clear whether the Tesla board supported Musk’s X declaration on Thursday The Delaware judge Kathaleen McCormick in her ruling on Tuesday wrote that Musk a 13% shareholder in Tesla had “thick ties” with the directors negotiating his 2018 package and had “dominated the process that led to board approval of his compensation plan” Brian Quinn a professor at Boston College law school said moving to Texas “will require the board to initiate the reincorporation” He added: “So if he hasn’t he should drop them a line because it’s supposed to be a board call not the result of a poll on X” Quinn said switching to Texas would not change the underlying law behind the Delaware ruling but the state’s launch of a new business court means it will want to show the court is “a fair forum for the adjudication of business disputes” Sign up to Business Today Get set for the working day – well point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning after newsletter promotion “It won’t help that effort to have their very first customer be Elon Musk who expects them to kowtow to managers’ interests He’s putting Texas in a bit of a bind” he said Two weeks before the Delaware ruling Musk challenged the board by writing on X that he needed to own 25% of Tesla’s voting shares or else he might build unspecified artificial intelligence and robotics products outside the company Musk is worth $202bn according to the Bloomberg billionaires index more than the luxury goods tycoon Bernard Arnault on $183bn and Jeff Bezos the Amazon founder on $180bn"

COLIN RUSCH: you know we try not to make too much of it Theres been a lot of noise about Elons personal life And we really try to focus on whats happening with the company from a technology perspective a product perspective and the broader market And the backdrop that you refer to I think is challenging We have higher rates you know persisting here And we saw that sentiment today coupled with some noise around some of the fundamentals on EVs And I think the disruption of the auto market is going through the difficult phase Its easy to get through some early adopters and get some real momentum But now were like fundamentally changing from internal combustion engines into electrified powertrains And thats a much harder process to go through And we think this is just a natural growing pains of a market thats very much in transition JOSH LIPTON: And let me get your take on this Listen I get it as a financial analyst youre focused on the business And you know this business and this C-suite as well as anybody One question I did have though regarding these headlines that dropped on Elon Musk and I do-- you know I think its a question investors have is there is this view out there Colin that Tesla is Musk and Musk is Tesla That he is simply just unlike a lot of CEOs that he is just foundational to where this company is and where it is headed Whats your take on that? COLIN RUSCH: Yeah I think theres a lot of truth to that I mean one of the things that hes brought to the table for this organization is just ambition and you know and vision And thats still I think remains the case But the bench strength of the organization is exceptional We continue to see this as an organization thats attracting the top talent from a technology perspective and really working on some of the most challenging interesting problems in the world for engineers And I think thats a compelling value proposition for a lot of executives and a lot of engineers that are coming out of school or want a new challenge in their careers You know and so that I think is an important piece of this is that this is not a single person driving this organization But he does set the agenda And he does have the authority to push people very very hard to move towards doing difficult things and changing markets and changing the technology landscape So he is an important figure not only for the organization but for these end markets And I think his viability as a CEO is important And so these pay packages I think are ultimately pretty critical to keep him engaged and keep the organization focused on the things that shareholders want and having his buy in to that JULIE HYMAN: Do you think that the Board of Tesla is independent enough? COLIN RUSCH: Thats hard to say In all honesty you know the board has been very much bought into Elon as a leader And how they keep that buy-in for him on a personal basis is a little unclear to me These reports in various papers around what happens in his personal life and how those relationships get managed its hard to double check the truth on those things And they could be hearsay They could be one-offs And theres also just a lot of noise around Elon himself just as a personality And so that independence I think has been a very-- been a very gentle line that everyones watching here But I think keeping his attention and buying into the organization is something thats critical And how they do that is a little unsure JULIE HYMAN: Whats the difference between buy-in and blackmail? You know like whats wheres the line between-- you know what I mean? Like you have-- like youre competing-- hes got all these different business entities Oh we have to give him this enormous pay package so he doesnt take his attention to something else or take some of the technology from Tesla to something else I mean I dont know Does that make-- COLIN RUSCH: I mean Blackmail is a pretty aggressive term here right? I mean leverage and negotiations and relationship management are something-- you know my clear sense is that this organization is his baby and his core focus and is critical to all the things that he does And so for him to wander off from an attention perspective seems unrealistic to me You know I think the pay package and the alignment of interest remains I think critical But I think if Elon stepped away from Tesla like it would be as damaging to him as it would be to the organization JOSH LIPTON: Colin I want to get you out of here on this Right now you rate the stock at perform Colin what would you need to see to get more bullish on Tesla? COLIN RUSCH: We really need to see margins bottom out here We need to see them slow down any sort of price declines so that the margins start moving higher and what weve seen in other markets whether its solar LEDs even in batteries is that the going through the rationalization and the disruption of those markets can be really challenging from a price perspective and a margin perspective And I think as when you feed the competitive landscape evolve what I want to see with Tesla is really some real stable gross margin so we can see growth from there The second thing that we really want to see is evolution of the FSD technology and real adoption Were still going through a pretty fluid environment around the regulatory backdrop And as we get clarity on that I think well have a better sense of how well this technology performs and their ability to monetize it What we heard from them last quarter is that they went through a full re-architecture of the software which is substantial And that will take time to settle in and what the benefits of that will become clearer over the next several quarters or a couple of years But we want to see all of that technology get implemented and really a more stable subscription base for the company to really drive some that recurring JULIE HYMAN: Colin its great to catch up with you as always on Tesla Thank you Appreciate it COLIN RUSCH: Thank you Related Quotes"

Bloomberg largely thanks to his roughly 13 percent stake in Tesla which was worth about $74 billion as of February 2024 But Musk’s business practices are unconventional and sometimes controversial In

Helped launch The Boring Company a tunneling venture that hopes to alleviate urban congestion and allow for high-speed long-distance travel CEO of Neuralink which is working to develop interfaces that allow the human brain to be connected to computers Agreed in 2018 to settle securities fraud charges brought against him by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) after he tweeted that he could take Tesla private for $420 per share and that funding had been secured which the SEC said “lacked an adequate basis in fact” Disclosed a 9 percent stake in Twitter in April 2022 before agreeing to acquire the entire company in a $44 billion deal later that month He later sought to back out of the deal before reversing his position and completing the deal at its original terms Elon Musk has been

also forced to step down as chair of Tesla for three years as part of the settlement Musk is also CEO and lead designer at SpaceX which develops rockets and spacecraft for missions to Earth’s orbit

backed by Musk who served on the company’s board The company sold and installed solar generation systems and other related products to residential commercial and industrial customers Tesla agreed to acquire SolarCity in a $26 billion deal in 2016 Some critics characterized the acquisition as a bailout for SolarCity which had struggled to raise money Musk said he wasn’t involved in the valuation of the acquisition and later won a shareholder lawsuit related to the deal Elon Musk has grown his net worth by creating and investing in companies He’s been able to turn his proceeds from the sale of PayPal early in his career into even greater sums by redeploying the money into ventures that have turned out enormously well His current estimated net worth of $200 billion has grown tremendously since the start of 2020 when it stood at about $276 billion according to Bloomberg Since then Tesla’s stock has appreciated more than six-fold and Musk’s net worth has risen with it vaulting him into the position of richest person in the world At his net worth of $276 billion at the beginning of 2020 he’d sit at number 57 on the current list of billionaires In April 2022 Musk disclosed a 9 percent stake in social media company Twitter after years of being an active user with a large following Eventually he agreed to purchase the entire company before later trying to back out of the deal He

merger agreement with Twitter saying he hasn’t received enough information to understand how many fake accounts exist on the platform July 12 2022: Twitter files a lawsuit against Musk seeking to

company August 6 2022: Musk challenges Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal to a public debate about the percentage of Twitter users that are fake or spam accounts October 4 2022: Musk agrees to purchase Twitter

unveiled a new X logo saying it would replace Twitter’s blue bird potentially setting up the company to enter the financial services industry Musk has also been a frequent commentator and supporter of cryptocurrencies through his tweets In February 2021 Tesla announced it had purchased $15 billion in Bitcoin and planned to accept the coin as payment for its product and services A few months later Musk appeared on Saturday Night Live where he referred to the cryptocurrency Dogecoin as a “hustle” The coin fell 30 percent after Musk’s comments and has fallen even further since Tesla stopped accepting Bitcoin as payment just a few months after it started due to environmental concerns Musk said in July 2021 that Tesla would “most likely” accept Bitcoin again once it becomes more eco-friendly In July 2022 Tesla said it had converted about 75 percent of its Bitcoin holdings into fiat currency despite touting the long-term potential of Bitcoin a year earlier Invest in physical things: Musk wrote in a tweet in March 2022 that “it is generally better to own physical things like a home or stock in companies you think make good products than dollars when inflation is high” He added that he wouldn’t be selling his cryptocurrency holdings such as Bitcoin Ethereum or Dogecoin Diversification: “Buy stock in several companies that make products and services that *you* believe in” Musk wrote to followers in 2022 By suggesting investors choose several companies Musk is arguing for a diversified approach which means you won’t be sunk if one or two of your investments perform poorly Stay calm: Musk suggests that the only reason to sell an investment is if a company’s products and services are deteriorating “Don’t panic when the market does” he says"

fourth-quarter 2023 results on Jan 24 after the closing bell The results will primarily center around the company’s vehicle deliveries and profit margins While fourth-quarter deliveries set records and beat our model estimates shrinking margins might act as a spoiler Notably TSLA surpassed earnings estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed in one the average surprise being 322% Before we delve into the factors that are set to shape its upcoming results here’s a snapshot of its third-quarter 2023 earnings report (Also read: Insights Into Expectations From Teslas Q4 Earnings) Tesla snapped its 10-quarter winning streak in the third quarter of 2023 The electric vehicle (EV) titan reported earnings per share of 66 cents which declined from the year-ago figure of $105 and also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 72 cents Total revenues came in at $23350 million witnessing year-over-year growth of 9% The top line however fell short of the consensus mark of $24381 million Tesla’s third-quarter production totaled 430488 units (416800 Model 3/Y and 13688 Model S/X) up 18% year over year and surpassing our estimate of 415645 units The company delivered 435059 vehicles reflecting a year-over-year rise of 27% and topping our estimate of 428141 units The Model 3/Y registered deliveries of 419074 vehicles marking year-over-year growth of 29% and outpacing our projection by 7999 units Deliveries of the Model S/X totaled 13688 units down 31% from the year-ago levels and below our estimate of 17066 units Tesla had cash/cash equivalents of $26077 million as of Sep 30 2023 Long-term debt and finance leases net of the current portion totaled $2426 million up from $1597 million on Dec 31 2022 The company generated FCF of $848 million during the reported quarter which declined from $3297 million generated in the year-ago period The company reported record deliveries of 484507 deliveries during the fourth quarter The delivery numbers rose 195% and 114% on a yearly and sequential basis respectively Additionally it exceeded our model projection of 476620 units Tesla’s models 3 and Y are the company’s most successful EVs accounting for most of its sales For the quarter Tesla delivered 461538 of those surpassing our forecast of 457892 units Fourth-quarter delivery performance was propelled by robust sales of the Model 3 in the United States particularly before the phase-out of federal tax credits for specific variants under the Inflation Reduction Act The conclusion of these tax incentives is likely to have played a role in the surge of fourth-quarter deliveries as consumers hastened to capitalize on the advantages before their expiration To stimulate deliveries by the end of December the company implemented various incentives including heightened discounts and a six-month provision of complimentary fast charging Fueled by the delivery surge our forecasts imply 5% year-over-year growth in automotive revenues projecting the metric to reach $2238 billion Nevertheless substantial discounts on models in the United States China and other regions are anticipated to exert downward pressure on its gross margins High costs of raw materials and logistical constraints are expected to have an adverse impact on overall results We project the cost of automotive sales to rise more than 16% to around $18 billion We expect gross profit from automotive sales to decline 256% year over year Automotive gross margin (excluding leasing) is projected at 179% significantly down from 255% recorded in the year-ago period and 182% in

646,"Tesla (TSLA) earnings preview: its going to be an interesting one","1/23/2024","https://electrek.co/2024/01/23/tesla-tsla-earnings-preview-q4-2023/","Tesla (TSLA) is about to release Q4 2023 and full-year 2023 financial results on Wednesday January 24 after the markets close As usual a conference call and Q&A with Tesla’s management are scheduled after the results Here we’ll take a look at what both the street and retail investors are expecting for the quarterly results While Tesla is an “AI/robotics” company according to CEO Elon Musk its automotive deliveries remain the biggest drivers of financial performance Tesla already disclosed its Q4 vehicle delivery and production numbers: And here are Tesla’s full-year 2023 production and delivery numbers: Tesla had been aiming for 18 million deliveries for the whole year Delivery and production numbers are always slightly adjusted during earning results For revenue analysts generally have a pretty good idea of what to expect thanks to the delivery numbers However Tesla’s average price per vehicle is changing a lot these days due to frequent price cuts and discounts across many markets which makes things more difficult The Wall Street consensus for this quarter is $25640 billion and Estimize the financial estimate crowdsourcing website predicts a slightly lower revenue of $25598 billion The crowdsourcing estimate is rarely lower than Wall Street consensus If Tesla can reach $25 billion in revenue it would be a new quarterly record for the company Here are the predictions for Tesla’s revenue over the past two years with Estimize predictions in blue Wall Street consensus in gray and actual results are in green: Tesla always attempts to be marginally profitable every quarter as it invests most of its money into growth and it has been successful in doing so over the last three years now However like revenues it has been harder to estimate earnings this year with price cuts digging into Tesla’s industry-leading gross margins For Q4 2023 the Wall Street consensus is a gain of $073 per share while Estimize’s prediction is slightly higher with a profit of $074 per share This would be significantly lower year-over-year amid price cuts Here are the earnings per share over the last two years where Estimize predictions are in blue Wall Street consensus is in gray and actual results are in green: Beyond the financial results Tesla always gives broader updates and answers shareholder questions in its shareholder letter and conference call with management following the release of the results Tesla gathers questions from shareholders from the “Say Technologies” website The currently most upvoted question is about the next generation Tesla vehicles: Given that you moved the start of the next generation compact vehicle production to Austin has the timeline improved so that we might see next generation platform vehicles in 2025? It’s a fairly simple question about getting an official timeline for the next-generation vehicle which we will probably not get a straight answer on Tesla doesn’t like to make product announcements on its earnings calls The second most upvoted question is a bit more interesting: Should retail shareholders be concerned that Elon has stated he is uncomfortable expanding AI and robotics at Tesla if he doesn’t have 25% of voting? This is in relation to Musk asking for a 25% voting control at Tesla which would require the company to give him about $60 billion worth of shares or he would prefer to build AI products at his new xAI startup We highlighted the conflict of interest problem and even possible breach of fiduciary duties that he is opening himself to with his statements Given the fix is in for Musk to get more Tesla shares for the Twitter fire one can reasonably conclude this call will be a major Musk pump in the face of dismal margin trends This is probably the softest way to ask about this issue but it is still going to be interesting to get a response from Musk or the rest of Tesla’s management The rest of the top questions are pretty straightforward like the state of the Cybertruck backlog and the timelines for Gigafactory Nevada expansion and Gigafactory Mexico construction Finally Tesla should also be sharing guidance for 2024 which should be interesting Join us on Electrek tomorrow for the best coverage of Tesla’s earnings FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links More Subscribe to Electrek on YouTube for exclusive videos and subscribe to the podcast Tesla is a transportation and energy company It… Fred is the Editor in Chief and Main Writer at Electrek You can send tips on Twitter (DMs open) or via email: fred@9to5maccom Through Zalkoncom you can check out Fred’s portfolio and get monthly green stock investment ideas Get interesting investment ideas by Fred Lambert ChargePoint Home WiFi Enabled Electric Vehicle (EV) Charger"

649,"Tesla Is Just a Car Company and Its Time Wall Street Valued It as Such","1/26/2024","https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/stocks/TSLA-Q/pressreleases/23622396/tesla-is-just-a-car-company-and-its-time-wall-street-valued-it-as-such/","There are few constants on Wall Street But one thing investors can always count on is a next-big-thing trend demanding attention For much of the past half-decade electric vehicles (EVs) have ranked high on the list of game-changing innovations Although estimates vary wildly as youd expect from any industry-changing technology Fortune Business Insights has penciled in a nearly 18% compound annual growth rate for the worldwide EV market through 2030 By the turn of the decade we could be talking about nearly $16 trillion in annual sales At the moment North American EV leader Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) is leading the charge (pardon the necessary pun) Led by outspoken CEO Elon Musk Tesla has introduced five mass-produced models (3 S Y X and Cybertruck) and spread its wings into energy storage and various services including its Supercharger network Image source: Tesla While Tesla is viewed by its shareholders as something of an artificial intelligence (AI) technology and automaking company rolled into one Im going to show you why its nothing more than a car company that should be valued as such by Wall Street Before digging into whats wrong with Tesla and the lofty valuation Wall Street has bestowed on the most valuable automaker by market cap let me start by giving the company credit where credit is due Tesla became the first auto company in more than a half-decade to organically build itself from the ground up to mass production That didnt happen by accident Although it took a lot of capital Tesla has seen its Model Y sport utility vehicle blossom into the best-selling vehicle in the world based on the companys own preliminary data Furthermore Tesla has become the only pure-play EV manufacturer to generate a recurring profit based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) On Wednesday Jan 24 it reported its fourth consecutive year of GAAP profits While legacy automakers are often generating sizable profits from their internal-combustion engine vehicles their EV segments are bleeding red Ill also add that investors appreciate the innovative capacity that Elon Musk has brought to the table Hes overseen the launch of Models 3 S X and Y along with the Cybertruck Tesla Semi and a host of battery/storage solutions Its fair to question if Tesla would be worth anywhere close to $661 billion without Elon Musk steering the ship But this brings me back to the point at hand Teslas valuation A roughly $661 billion market cap equates to the combined market value of many of the largest automakers Tesla sustains this ultra-premium valuation on the basis that its an AI-driven technology company But dig into its operating results and history of fulfilling the promises made by Elon Musk and youll find otherwise For example Tesla brought in $968 billion in total revenue in 2023 Only $6 billion derived from its Energy Generation and Storage segment with an additional $83 billion traced back to its Services and other revenue This means 85% of the companys revenue comes from selling and leasing EVs As a company like Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) has shown its OK for ancillary operating segments to do the heavy lifting with regard to operating income and cash flow Although Amazon generates the bulk of its revenue from its online marketplace most of its operating income and cash flow comes from its world-leading cloud infrastructure service segment Amazon Web Services (AWS) AWS makes up just a sixth of Amazons net sales but has accounted for the entirety of Amazons operating income in select quarters However Teslas ancillary segments are mostly for show at least from an operating standpoint Though total storage deployed (in megawatt (MW)-hours) rose by 125% in 2023 from the prior-year period solar deployed (in MW) declined by 36% from 2022 Despite Energy Generation and Storage revenue rising by 10% during the fourth quarter from the prior-year period it was down from what was reported in the first second and third quarter of 2023 Furthermore Services revenue of $2166 billion was flat in the fourth quarter from the sequential third quarter with a gross margin of just 27% Once operating expenses are factored in neither Energy Generation and Storage nor Services are doing much of anything to move the needle for Tesla The Model 3 is Teslas flagship sedan Image source: Tesla The painful truth for Tesla is that its a more or less average automaker contending with mounting headwinds in a highly competitive industry Beginning in early 2023 Tesla began slashing the selling price on Models 3 S X and Y Although optimists had assumed that these price cuts were strategic and based on improving production efficiencies Musk noted during Teslas annual shareholder meeting in May that the companys price cuts were in response to demand Waning demand coupled with rising global inventory have more than halved Teslas operating margin since September 2022 (172% to 82%) If Tesla were producing a superior operating margin to other auto stocks an argument could be made that it deserved a premium valuation But most time-tested legacy automakers are generating operating margins right around 8% give or take a percentage point in each direction Teslas forward price-to-earnings ratio comes in at 10 times the industry average despite delivering a run-of-the-mill operating margin To add to the above a substantial percentage of Teslas pre-tax income comes from unsustainable sources Youd expect an innovative high-growth company to generate organic growth by selling its core product(s) In Teslas case Im talking about selling EVs and to a far lesser extent generating a profit from the ancillary segments described above During the fourth quarter Tesla generated $433 million in profit from selling automotive regulatory credits given to it for free by governments It also netted $333 million in interest income from its sizable cash pile The worlds largest EV company by market cap earned 35% of its $2191 billion in pre-tax income in the fourth quarter from selling tax credits and generating interest on its cash Thats hardly innovative To make matters worse Elon Musk has a terrible habit of overpromising and underdelivering on new vehicles and innovations For instance not only was the launch of the Cybertruck delayed but its production ramp is expected to be slower than Teslas other models because of the complexity of the vehicle Other examples of failing to deliver include the now-annual promise made by Musk that Level 5 autonomy is one year away as well as Musks commentary in 2019 that his company would have 1 million robotaxis on the road by the end of next year While Teslas side projects (eg Optimus robots) can be fun talking points they dont provide any tangible value to the business TSLA PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts Most auto stocks are valued at 6 to 8 times forward-year earnings Based on Wall Streets profit consensus for Tesla of $367 per share entering 2024 this would put Teslas share price between $22 and $29 to be on-par with the auto industry While an argument can be made that Tesla deserves a premium to traditional automakers given its first-mover advantages in the EV space a triple-digit share price simply cant be supported given the companys operating performance and history of failing to meet production and innovation targets Its time to face the fact that Tesla is just a car company and Wall Street should value it as such When our analyst team has an investing tip it can pay to listen After all the newsletter they have run for over a decade Motley Fool Stock

are hiring right now We have also discussed the state of US labor market If you want to skip our detailed analysis head straight to the Top 5 Industries That are Hiring Right Now In 2024 the US labor market is expected to show signs of stabilization after a tumultuous 2023 The unemployment rate which reached 37% in November of 2023 is on a positive trajectory and the Fed is considering interest-rate cuts Despite concerns of a recession the economy is defying expectations with a soft landing Wages are anticipated to slow down returning to pre-pandemic levels While wages posted on Indeed were up 42% in October it marks a decline from Julys peak of 48% and January 2022s 93% Merit increases are also expected to slow with employers predicting a 35% rise in 2024 slightly below 2023 levels Hiring while slowing still holds promise with 57% of managers expressing plans to increase permanent roles in the first half of 2024 The job market is forecasted to slow down further making the present a relatively favorable time for job transitions Layoffs though unpredictable are expected to remain low in 2024 standing at 41% lower than November 2022 However there is a cautious note that a sudden increase to a more recessionary level could occur if the US slips into a downturn Despite challenges there is a prevailing optimism among employers towards 2024 with a focus on rightsizing and steady growth According to a recent analysis by career site Indeed some companies in the US are hiring at a faster pace than others Signet Jewelers Ltd (NYSE:SIG) topped the list with a relative hire rate of 229 making it the fastest in terms of hiring among the companies analyzed Marianos followed closely with a rate of 206 securing the second position Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) ranked at No 8 with a relative hire rate of 168 The analysis focused on the period from August 1 to the end of October and the companies on the list are still actively hiring It is also worth highlighting that Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)’s hiring will not be limited to the US alone In fact Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) is reportedly expanding its operations in Sweden by posting seven job openings for metal workers painters and claims adjusters at its Stockholm factory despite ongoing sympathy strikes in the region The conflict began when Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) mechanics in Sweden signed with the labor union IF Metall but negotiations broke down as Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) refused to sign a collective agreement Affiliated unions launched sympathy strikes affecting different aspects of Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) business The decision to hire nonunion workers suggests Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) commitment to its anti-union stance potentially impacting US workers who are the primary target of United Auto Workers leadership Speaking of Signet Jewelers Ltd (NYSE:SIG) their recent acquisition of SJR National Retail for $6 million may seem like a minor move but it holds major implications for the jewelry retail industry Despite a decline of 81% in Q2 revenues and a 12% drop in same-store sales Signets stock rose from $71 to almost $80 after surpassing analysts estimates The company maintained its year-end guidance with sales projected at $71 to $73 billion and an operating income between $635 million to $675 million Notably Signet Jewelers Ltd (NYSE:SIG)’s acquisition of SJR National Retail a full-service

666,"Tesla Stock: An Analysis Of Its Position In Artificial Intelligence (NASDAQ:TSLA)","2/13/2024","https://seekingalpha.com/article/4669746-tesla-an-analysis-of-its-position-in-artificial-intelligence","VCG/Visual China Group via Getty Images Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) is seen by its supporters as more than just a car company And CEO Elon Musk fueled this in the last earnings call where he said the following about AI and robotics: Our main goal with these AI Day things is recruiting and to sort of change the perception of Tesla as people thinking of Tesla as a car company when they should be thinking of Tesla as an AI robotics company So I think its important to look at where Tesla is relative to the competition in the markets of the future Does Tesla have a significant competitive advantage in these markets or is it too early to tell? In my opinion especially in the robotics market we are at such an early stage that it is very difficult to predict how these markets will develop because there are many large companies with a lot of money and great teams working on different areas of application for their technologies But its always a good idea to position yourself for future growth especially when a visionary like Elon Musk is at the helm I strongly believe that robots will change the job market They can perform dangerous and repetitive tasks and probably work more hours per day than humans without showing concentration problems after a while Plus one day they will probably be cheaper than human labor and more productive But we are still in the very early innings of this market Tesla once said that they could start selling robots somewhere between 2025 and 2027 And these will be the first versions that will probably have a lot of upside in terms of features and functionality But this market is going to be tough Almost all large companies have an interest in using robots in their factories so they are working in-house or with partners to develop them Amazon (AMZN) for example has a partnership with Agility Robotics Digit and OpenAI with 1x Technology And in my opinion the software side is going to be the hard part especially if you want to build intelligent robots that can observe and analyze in real time And this is where Tesla has an advantage because the Tesla bot uses Teslas ADAS which is also used in the car models This engine has a lot of data and is trained on real-time data every day Boston Dynamics now part of Hyundai Motor Company (OTCPK:HYMTF) is often the company people mention when they talk about robotics And this is probably because of the many viral videos that most of you have probably seen on social media of their robots doing some acrobatic stunts And when it comes to mobility and motion Boston Dynamics probably has the most advanced technology available today Their robot is probably faster and more maneuverable than the Tesla Bot because unlike Teslas EV it uses a hydraulic engine But this hydraulic frame also makes it more expensive and noisy and it probably has a higher power consumption A common criticism is that the Boston Dynamics Atlas is pre-programmed and does not adapt to new situations And for example many comments refer to the Tesla Bot as an AI bot and therefore superior But is this accurate? On their website Boston Dynamics says this: In this iteration of parkour the robot is adapting behaviors in its repertoire based on what it sees This means the engineers dont need to pre-program jumping motions for all possible platforms and gaps the robot might encounter In addition there is the Boston Dynamics AI Institute which also suggests that they are using AI and machine learning in their bots But to me Boston Dynamics is more of a research company and they are probably not going to mass-produce their robots to sell However their research is likely to benefit all companies in the field So I do not think the comparison with Boston Dynamics is the right one Comparisons to solutions from Amazon or Microsoft might be more appropriate in the future I could also imagine that in the future software will be licensed and companies will use their own robots but buy the best software from someone else just like you buy operating systems for computers But we are still so incredibly early in this market that very much can happen and I am curious to see how it develops The beauty of Tesla is that their products have synergies and can be used in multiple areas such as advanced driving assistance system (ADAS) in full self-driving (FSD) and Tesla Bot A competitive advantage that I believe is enhanced by the use of the Dojo supercomputer But lets take a look at the FSD landscape how it has evolved in 2023 and what we can expect in the future A recent study highlighted the benefits of ADAS and how they have the potential to eliminate up to 37 million accidents in the future So drowsiness detection systems have really come a long way in the past year and will likely help make the roads even safer for most of us After an accident last October Cruises driverless taxis were briefly prohibited from operating in San Francisco which was definitely a setback for the industry As a result Cruise a subsidiary of General Motors (GM) pulled all of its cars off the road to install software patches In general it seems that we are still some way off from fully self-driving cars as most of todays options are more semi-self-driving in that they require some assistance from the driver More and more manufacturers such as BMW (OTCPK:BMWYY) in the 7 Series or Mercedes (OTCPK:MBGYY) offer Level 3 systems And the Chinese automakers are getting better and better and are likely to play a big role in the future However the complexity of achieving Level 4 or Level 5 systems seems enormous and with the safety of road users the primary concern algorithms computing power and data must be improved to meet this goal After all in real time many influences must be processed in order to make the right decision and no mistakes can be made or injuries could result In addition these systems must be protected from external attacks as cyber-attacks are a risk The difference between Level 3 and Level 4 is that Level 3 still requires the driver to make important decisions while Level 4 is designed to operate without driver intervention And industry insiders go on the assumption that driverless taxis or commercial vehicles will be the first to reach Level 4 Interestingly they also assume that cars may not have pedals and steering wheels when they reach Level 4 and that the software side is difficult because the system has to make decisions where it is not certain that the decision is the right one They also expect that the number of sensors will double and that the camera systems will have to become even more powerful in order to reach the next level Teslas new FSD V12 Beta released in January promises quicker and more accurate decision making and early reviews are promising There have been improvements but when the first full Level 4 Tesla cars that can do more than just park themselves will be released is still up in the air Analyzing all the data that Tesla collects with the Tesla Bot and its cars is the right and obvious step in my opinion which is why diversifying into this area makes sense for Tesla Dojo is currently powered by a D1 chip manufactured by TSMC (TSM) perhaps the most important company in the world today In addition as Elon Musk answered a question at X the H100 from Nvidia (NVDA) and the Mi300 from Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) will also be used Both are also highly polarizing investments that are currently misunderstood or undervalued by many investors The live collection of data from the sensors in the bots and cars combined with machine learning could lead to major advances in the algorithms used by Tesla And the resulting software could be licensed as is likely to happen soon with Teslas FSD So the $300 million and $500 million investments to build two new Doja supercomputers could be well spent With 340 FP64 flops Dojo is the fourth fastest supercomputer in the world and they are aiming for 100 Exa-Flops later in 2024 Author Tesla which was relatively overvalued in the past has become more balanced in its valuation Currently the stock is pricing in a diluted EPS growth rate of 15% over the next 10 years based on TTM diluted EPS of $430 Not an easy task but one that is feasible for a company that is working in AI and robotics and sees its future in these areas Historically the EPS growth rate is 173% over the last 3 years but this is also due to the fact that the company has not been profitable for a long time We should expect a lower growth rate in the future but I think 15% is achievable and therefore the company is fairly valued If Teslas robotics business performs as promised in recent earnings calls one could even argue that the company is undervalued if managements predictions for the future come true But I think there is always a bit of optimism in these forecasts so realistically we are more in the fair range The risks in the FSD area lie in the fact that the breakthrough to Level 4 and Level 5 will take much longer than originally expected which is already the case in some cases and that regulatory requirements will make it more difficult Also a lot can happen in the robotics market because we are still several years away from the first mass-market robots so no one really knows how this market will develop and what will happen There are so many possible scenarios And with OpenAI we saw how something developed under the public radar can turn the world upside down in a matter of weeks Maybe a company has a big breakthrough in the robotics market and is just waiting for the right time to announce it Tesla Inc is attractively positioned in the 3 areas of Robotics FSD and Supercomputers Therefore I expect them to gain market share in the AI space Especially the combination of collecting real-time data and training the algorithms on this valuable data can be very important Other companies do not have this data and must purchase it at a high cost or obtain it elsewhere This is a huge competitive advantage for Tesla However the future will show how strong and how big this advantage is as all areas still have a lot of growth ahead of them and therefore the dynamics in these markets can change rapidly But the second generation of the Tesla Bot for example has shown that the company is capable of making great advances as this version of the Tesla Bot has much smoother movements a higher walking speed and a better sense of touch But I think the competition is incredibly fierce and I also think in all markets it is possible that the competition will have a better product in a few years Teslas success is not certain either and they have to execute accordingly And it often happens that a company that no one expected to be at the top ends up leading the industry years later I mean Tesla was underestimated by a lot of people and the same thing could happen now with other companies in the robotics or AI market This article was written by Analyst’s Disclosure: I/we have a beneficial long

670,"Forget Rivian Buy This Magnificent Electric Vehicle (EV) Stock Instead","2/17/2024","https://finance.yahoo.com/news/forget-rivian-buy-magnificent-electric-114200270.html?ref=biztoc.com","Making its public debut in November 2021 Rivian (NASDAQ: RIVN) arrived on the electric vehicle (EV) scene with a bang The companys initial public offering (IPO) was the largest for an American company since Meta in 2014 raising a whopping $12 billion But since its historic debut Rivian has struggled to find its footing in an industry that is growing more competitive by the year Thats why investors are better off owning companies that already have a proven track record of success such as Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) As the competition heats up Teslas distinct advantages will help it continue to grow over the long term and possibly even squash the dreams of hopefuls like Rivian Here are a few reasons why Tesla is a much better stock to own than Rivian At first glance there is one obvious problem with Rivian -- it has never turned a profit Quarter after quarter the company continues to eat into its cash reserves as it has been unable to get a handle on growing expenses Fortunately its massive IPO provided the necessary cushion to keep operations up and running but even this is beginning to dwindle In just over two years Rivians cash and equivalents have plummeted more than 60% Theyre currently sitting at just under $8 billion Rivian has enough cash to last another two to three years before it has to raise more capitalSSS Then theres Tesla While profit margins slipped in 2023 as strategic price cuts made their presence felt Tesla still boasts one of the most impressive and resilient business models not just in the EV industry but in the entire world Its ability to scale production cost-effectively while manufacturing vehicles customers love has given it a type of financial strength that is hard to come by In 2023 Teslas net income totaled $15 billion as it hit new production records yet again When considering those smaller profit margins a new all-time high in net income looks all the more impressive and goes to show just how robust Teslas business truly is While 2024 is shaping up to be lackluster for the entire EV industry with interest rates remaining elevated Teslas financial strength will help it endure this years challenges while continuing to build for a prosperous future With a whopping $291 billion in cash and equivalents Tesla has the funds to expand and refine operations while competitors will be forced to scale back operations and focus on efficiency After its grown more than 800% in the last five years its natural to think Tesla may have hit a ceiling This is why many investors may have originally flocked to Rivian hoping that it will follow a similar trajectory to Tesla in its early days However the assumption that Tesla doesnt have more room to grow is a mistake Take its global expansion efforts as evidence The company is in the beginning stages of construction at its new Gigafactory in Mexico and its in the final rounds of negotiation to build another factory in India As Tesla continues to grow its international presence Rivian holds no plans to expand abroad and remains confined to the US market one that Tesla dominates Adding to Teslas allure over Rivian is the development of its next-gen vehicle Production of the next-gen vehicle codenamed Redwood is expected to start in 2025 With an estimated price tag of $25000 Redwood has the potential to make owning an EV a little more affordable and lead to a new wave of growth for Tesla The upcoming launch of the next-gen vehicle is a testament to Teslas ability to reduce costs while at the same time highlighting a major issue that Rivian is facing -- affordability Even without the next-gen model Tesla vehicles are significantly more affordable than any of Rivians offerings Currently the cheapest Rivian model available for purchase costs almost $73000 and that includes EV tax credits Those same tax credits could be used to buy a Tesla for as little as $38000 While Tesla outdoes Rivian in terms of growth and pricing arguably the most important difference separating the two isnt related to cars Remember Tesla is more than just a vehicle manufacturer The company is actively developing technologies like artificial intelligence autonomous driving supercomputers and humanoid robots -- all of which hold the promise to catapult Tesla to new heights and help CEO Elon Musk realize his vision of making Tesla the most valuable company in the world Its worth noting that while Musk recently threatened to pack up Teslas extracurriculars unless hes given more voting control over the board growing consensus is that he would be unwise to do so If he

and indirect investments will primarily go towards establishing a manufacturing facility a battery ecosystem and other ancillary industries The Elon Musk-led company is said to be actively considering Haryana Tamil Nadu Maharashtra and Gujarat to set up a factory in India At the heart of Tesla’s hectic parlays is the burgeoning Indian EV market which is projected to balloon to a size of $110 Bn by 2029 As talks with the Indian government progress further over setting up a plant in the country EV automaker Tesla is reportedly open to committing nearly $30 Bn in direct and indirect investments in India over the course of the next five years Sources told Hindustan Times that the company is in advanced talks to enter the Indian market adding that the capital will primarily go towards establishing a manufacturing facility a battery ecosystem and ancillary industries As per the report Tesla’s India plan may include an immediate investment of $3 Bn to set up a unit to manufacture small cars for the developing world while a separate $15 Bn could be pumped into the battery ecosystem over a five-year period Sources added that a $10 Bn commitment could also come from Tesla’s other partners to support the manufacturing plans The Elon Musk-led company is said to be actively considering four major auto manufacturing hubs in the country for the potential facility – Haryana Tamil Nadu Maharashtra and Gujarat While a plant in Haryana could help the company cater to the biggest car market in India (Delhi NCR) people familiar with the development reportedly said that Tesla could instead opt for a coastal state in the west or south given its export ambitions As per the report the company is also confident that it could build the entire factory from scratch within three years of entry and roll out its very first car in two years The development comes amid reports that the Indian government is actively considering slashing import duties for a duration of up to five years to attract global EV makers to manufacture products in India “India will consider providing incentives to all players in the EV sector No company specific incentive will be given in any sector” a senior government official told the publication Meanwhile the report said that if a new EV policy is brought in that meets Tesla’s demands for tax sops for foreign-made EVs the company will kick off its India operations by bringing a limited number of models to the country Alongside the company intends to build a charging ecosystem and simultaneously invest in building a factory in India to roll out the first small car in two years While the pricing structure of this small car has not been decided it will be a cheaper model catering to emerging economies As per the report there will be a high degree of localisation at the potential factory that will cater partially to the Indian market and substantially to export markets “… unlike Apple Tesla brings everything in one go Don’t think of Tesla as just an auto company It is a tech company It is a critical minerals mining and refining company It makes its own semiconductors It is a design company It brings in a huge ecosystem The spillover from this to other industries is enormous” a person close to the company reportedly said The pivot to India is part of the company’s wider diversification plan to move some of its production out of China amid ongoing geopolitical tensions between Washington and Beijing The development comes at a time when the growing EV adoption in the country has garnered the attention of global automakers From Taiwanese tech giant Acer licensing its brand to mobility startup eBikeGo in India to VinFast signing an MoU with the Tamil Nadu government to set up a plant in the state a host of companies have made a beeline for India In addition giants such as Audi BMW and Mercedes-Benz have also launched a slew of EV offerings to tap into the burgeoning Indian EV ecosystem and cater to the growing demand Not just this local EV juggernaut Ola Electric also filed its IPO papers with the markets regulator SEBI and is looking at a potential 2024 public listing At the heart of this India push is the country’s burgeoning EV market which is projected to balloon to a size of $110 Bn by 2029 as per a report Become a Startup Insider in 2024 with Inc42 Plus Join our exclusive community of

revolution is speeding up with traditional automakers leaving no stone unturned to establish a strong foothold in this domain Japan’s auto giant Honda HMC is revving up its EV game At CES 2024 Honda showcased two concept vehicles the Space-Hub and Saloon signaling the future of its electrification strategy These models will be the forerunners of the upcoming Honda 0” series This new collection of EVs is anticipated to be rolled out in North America in 2026 EV titan Tesla TSLA grabbed headlines as it increased pay for its United States workers follows similar moves by industry giants like Toyota Volkswagen and Hyundai The Union Auto Workers’ success in negotiating significant contracts with Detroit 3 automakers last year has emboldened nonunion autoworkers to seek improved working conditions Meanwhile it also plans to temporarily suspend production at its Berlin factory due to the Red Sea disruptions In another news the company announced further price cuts in China EV startup Canoo Inc GOEV announced the acquisition of significant manufacturing assets to bolster its production capabilities Additionally the company has created more than 100 new jobs particularly in Oklahoma aligning with its strategy to enhance vehicle assembly capacity and reinforce its workforce following the asset acquisition Another EV company Lucid Motors LCID reports deliveries and production numbers for the fourth quarter and full-year 2023 The company also issued a safety recall for more than 2000 Air sedans Blink Charging Co BLNK also made it to the top stories with its collaboration with a Porsche dealership Grupo Q in El Salvador This marked a significant step toward enhancing the EV infrastructure in the region While HMC currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) BLNK TSLA GOEV and LCI carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) each You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here Tesla is suspending car production at its factory near Berlin for two weeks The disruption scheduled from Jan 29 to Feb 11 is a consequence of supply chain problems arising from attacks on vessels in the Red Sea Tesla cites a lack of components due to shifts in transport routes caused by the attacks leading to considerably longer transportation times and creating a gap in supply chains In a separate development Tesla hiked wages for US factory workers All US production associates material handlers and quality inspectors are set to receive a market adjustment pay increase marking a response to the momentum building within the United Auto Workers (UAW) union In another update the EV king adjusted the prices of its Model 3 and Model Y vehicles in China Model 3s price is now reduced by 59% to 245900 yuan (approximately $34600) Model Y saw a 28% reduction to 258900 yuan (around $36400) This move is part of Teslas pricing strategy initiated in late 2022 and early 2023 which has significantly impacted the automotive market in China prompting other local car manufacturers to lower their prices to maintain competitiveness Canoo announced the purchase of a variety of manufacturing assets from robotics to control processing equipment at significantly discounted prices This acquisition around 80% below the estimated value is aimed at bolstering the production capacity at Canoos Oklahoma City facility The assets acquired will be instrumental in constructing vehicle cabins aligning with Canoos strategy to meet increasing customer demands in 2024 This move also demonstrates Canoos commitment to creative and cost-effective asset acquisition amid a high-cost capital environment The deal is expected to play a crucial role in the companys manufacturing strategy and contribute to the creation of advanced manufacturing jobs in Oklahoma Canoo announced the creation of more than 100 new jobs in Oklahoma This development is a key part of the companys effort to scale its electric vehicle manufacturing operations The new jobs

manufacturing facility in Oklahoma City and the battery module assembly facility in Pryor Lucid produced 2391 Lucid Air luxury all-electric cars in the fourth quarter of 2023 a 32% decrease compared to the same period last year Deliveries also saw a downturn with 1734 Airs reaching customers globally marking a 10% year-over-year decrease However the production and deliveries improved sequentially

a 17% increase from the previous year and delivered 6001 cars a notable 37% increase year over year The 2023 production figures align well with Lucids revised forecast of 8000-8500 units announced in November In a separate development Lucid is recalling more than 2000 units of its Air luxury electric sedan This recall affecting certain 2022 and 2023 models is due to potentially faulty high-voltage coolant heaters (HVCH) supplied by Webasto AG These heaters are crucial for cabin heating and windshield defrosting The concern is that a malfunctioning HVCH could hinder the drivers vision by failing to defrost the windshield Lucid plans to mitigate this issue with an over-the-air software update by mid-month which will alert drivers to any HVCH failures Additionally Lucid service centers are set to replace any defective parts to ensure driver safety Blink Charging has partnered with Grupo Q Porsches official dealer in El Salvador to deploy five advanced EV charging stations in various premium

712,"Number of Engineers by Country: Top 20","1/28/2024","https://finance.yahoo.com/news/number-engineers-country-top-20-194847950.html","In this article we will look at the number of engineers by country: Top 20 We have also looked at the global engineering service industry and some key engineering companies If you want to skip our detailed analysis head straight to the 5 Countries with the Highest Number of Engineers The global engineering services industry is set for high growth with a projected market size of $17 trillion in 2023 reflecting a 39% Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) over the past five years Despite a dip in performance during the COVID-19 pandemic the industry has rebounded driven by increased demand for technical studies and engineering planning across different sectors The sectors workforce has also grown by 37% to 7 million employees accompanied by a 39% rise in wages to $5629 billion Looking ahead to 2029 the industrys positive outlook is fueled by expectations of continued economic growth particularly in Asia and North America providing ample opportunities for engineering companies and reinforcing the anticipated market expansion over the next five years While North American and Asian countries continue to dominate the engineering industry The US is believed to be one of the countries with the best engineers in the world Moreover in 2021 Jordan was the country with the highest number of engineers per capita Owing to the constant need for problem-solving and innovation engineers tend to have some of the most mentally stimulating jobs The interdisciplinary nature of engineering demands a broad skill set requiring them to integrate knowledge from various fields Engineers are required to analyze design and optimize systems pushing their cognitive abilities It is also often considered one of the most demanding jobs in the world Speaking of the demanding nature of the job it is worth noting that recently Elon Musk has announced that Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)’s engineers will be required to live and sleep on the production line at the Austin Gigafactory in Central Texas as the company prepares for the intense workload of producing a new electric vehicle model in 2025 During an earnings call Musk emphasized on the dire need for sacrifices to achieve a challenging production ramp Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) is also set to invest $500 million in building its Dojo supercomputer at its Buffalo New York factory according to Governor Kathy Hochul Dojo aims to support the development of self-driving cars by Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) by processing video data from electric vehicles for AI training Despite Elon Musk calling Dojo a long shot the decision was influenced by New Yorks power supply and available space Speaking of investments another engineering giant Siemens AG (OTC:SIEGY) is set to invest $150 million in a new electrical equipment production plant in Fort Worth aiming to power American data centers and drive artificial intelligence The company plans to manufacture low-voltage switchgear and power units at the facility creating 700 jobs The plant is expected to start production in 2024 with full operational capacity by 2025 Fort Worth approved a 10-year tax abatement saving Siemens AG (OTC:SIEGY) $6 million while the city anticipates generating $26 million in taxes over a decade This investment is part of Siemens AG (OTC:SIEGY)’s $510 million spending on US projects in 2023 aiming to add 1700 jobs nationwide On the financial end Siemens AG (OTC:SIEGY) reported a 10% increase in revenue growth for its fiscal fourth quarter of 2023 reaching a record high of 214 billion euros ($232 billion) However the German industrial giant anticipates a slowdown in 2024 projecting a sales growth of 4-8% over the next 12 months a decline from the 11% increase recorded in the 2023 fiscal year However Siemens AG (OTC:SIEGY) remains optimistic about fiscal 2024 with its Digital Industries segment expecting comparable revenue development of 0% to 3% anticipating a pickup in global demand for automation businesses especially in China in the latter half of the fiscal year A engineer overseeing a exposed network of pipelines connected to tanks at an oil refinery To list the number of engineers by country: top 20 we looked at two primary metrics Firstly we utilized UNESCO Statistics on the annual number of graduates in engineering/manufacturing/construction for top 10 countries For the next 10 countries we utilized UNESCO’s distribution of tertiary graduates by field of study (percentage of graduates in tertiary education in engineering manufacturing and construction) We utilized these percentages to shortlist the top 10 countries and then ranked them in order of population The list is presented in an ascending order Here is a list of top countries by number of engineers produced In Colombia two renowned universities for engineering are the National University of Colombia and the Pontifical Javeriana University The countrys most important engineering companies include Grupo Argos and Ecopetrol SA (NYSE:EC) Grupo Argos is known for leading in infrastructure and energy projects while Ecopetrol SA (NYSE:EC) specializes in the oil and gas sector Civil engineering holds particular prominence in Colombia given the country’s emphasis on infrastructure

potential to connect regions and transform economies Engineers in Italy are also known to drive innovation solve complex challenges and shape a sustainable future Italy is one of the European countries pay engineers the highest salaries While South Africa is one of the countries with the most engineers the Engineering Council of South Africa reports a stark engineer shortage with one engineer for every 3100 people compared to developed countries like Germany with a ratio of 1:200 Municipalities also grapple with a skills crisis as senior engineers have migrated to the private sector leaving a void in mentorship programs for new graduates A report commissioned by EngineeringUK predicts a 28% growth in engineering jobs in the UK by 2030 leading to approximately 173000 new roles This growth rate surpasses the projected national average for all occupations set at 23% The demand for engineers is expected to outpace other professions indicating a huge need for engineering

And what’s 2024 got in store? At the time of writing Tesla stock is trading for $248 while the average target price is $237 That’s never a good sign and it’s a bad starting point for our exploration What’s more there’s been several high-profile downgrades in recent months The most of these being HSBC in October Analyst Michael Tyndall Tesla with a ‘sell’ rating and a price target of $146 implying a 43% drop Tyndall said that Tesla’s more promising projects will not generate positive cash flow until the end of the decade The analyst called Elon Musk as a “single-person risk” for the firm And we can back this downgrade up with some data of our own The firm trades at 801 times TTM (trailing 12-month) earnings and 944 times forward earnings making it exceptionally expensive Moreover the price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio doesn’t improve the situation Tesla is expected to record compound annual earnings growth of 166% over the next three-five years And in turn this leads to a PEG ratio of 465 For clarity I’d be looking for a PEG ratio below one to suggest undervalued conditions I really want to believe in this Elon Musk project Tesla has engendered a lot of change in the industry and is at the forefront of AI/self-driving cars And I think this is something to be commended However I’m not willing to put my money where my mouth is As Tyndall noted it’s going to be a while before Musk’s idea of a self-driving taxi fleet comes to life or contributes positively to earnings And in the near term investors could be looking at more margin compression With an economic slowdown looming — or in some cases already here — Tesla may find itself needing to spend more to encourage sales amid weak demand Well there are plenty of companies to choose from if we’re looking for an alternative to Tesla My personal favourite is Li Auto with its 005 PEG ratio Yes it’s Chinese and this could present some challenges when it comes entering the global market The company reported delivery of 50353 vehicles in December reflecting a impressive growth of 227% month on month and a year-on-year increase of 1371% Moreover the firm is really expanding its range and will deliver the first of its all-electric minivans in March Of course it’s worth remembering that China is a huge market for EVs even if Li has some issues expanding overseas Should you invest the value of your investment may rise or fall and your capital is at risk Before investing your individual circumstances should be assessed Consider taking independent financial advice James Fox has positions in Li Auto Inc The Motley Fool UK has recommended Tesla Views expressed on the companies mentioned in this article are those of the writer and therefore may differ from the official recommendations we make in our subscription services such as Share Advisor Hidden Winners and Pro Here at The Motley Fool we believe that considering a diverse range of insights makes us better investors 26 March 2024 Christopher Ruane After an upbeat quarterly trading statement for its retail business our writer still has no interest in buying Ocado shares… Read more » 26 March 2024 Alan Oscroft An early 8% rise in the Ocado share price after the latest news?

730,"The News That Elon Musk Has Acquired 205% Of Tesla Is A Nothingburger (NASDAQ:TSLA)","2/16/2024","https://seekingalpha.com/article/4671004-the-news-that-elon-musk-has-acquired-20-5-percent-of-tesla-is-a-nothingburger","albertc111/iStock via Getty Images albertc111/iStock via Getty Images The February 14 SEC filing by Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) indicating CEO Elon Musk has a 205% stake in Tesla has been treated by some as significant news It is not; it is a standard SEC filing which must be done periodically In fact in the form that was filed a year ago it was reported that Musk had a beneficial ownership of 206% of Tesla stock so the percentage actually decreased by a minor amount There was simply no significant public commentary regarding the filing last year The two relevant sections of the recent filing are below: Tesla 13 G/A filing as of December 31 2023 (Tesla SEC filing)Tesla 13 G/A filing as of December 31 2023 (Tesla SEC filing) Tesla 13 G/A filing as of December 31 2023 (Tesla SEC filing) Tesla 13 G/A filing as of December 31 2023 (Tesla SEC filing) Although the filing shows on multiple lines that Musk beneficially owned over 715 million shares the figures reference Item 4-Ownership Item 4 indicates that only 411 million shares were owned outright while the remaining 304 million shares beneficially owned simply represent the options Musk currently has the right to exercise The ownership disclosure for December 31 2022 shows exactly the same number of shares beneficially owned although the shares actually owned increased by 10500 shares and the options decreased by the same amount which obviously must have been due to 10500 options being exercised during the year: Tesla 13 G/A filing as of December 31 2022 (Tesla SEC filing) Tesla 13 G/A filing as of December 31 2022 (Tesla SEC filing) The term Beneficial Owner does not actually mean what an investor might think it means It is defined by the SEC as follows (emphasis added): (i) A person shall be deemed to be the beneficial owner of a security subject to the provisions of paragraph (B) of this rule if that person has the right to acquire beneficial ownership of such security as defined in Rule 13d-3(a) (§ 24013d-3(a)) within sixty days including but not limited to any right to acquire: (A) Through the exercise of any option warrant or right; (B) through the conversion of a security; (C) pursuant to the power to revoke a trust discretionary account or similar arrangement; or (D) pursuant to the automatic termination of a trust discretionary account or similar arrangement; Teslas filings were exactly in line with this requirement Also as I previously stated the number of shares beneficially owned did not change by even one share during 2023 The only reason the percentage decreased from 206% to 205% is because Teslas total share count increased a bit during the year As a result this whole topic is a nothingburger Obviously a reason this filing received the attention this year which it didnt receive in past years is due to the recent Delaware Court ruling invalidating the 2018 option grant award What would Teslas filing look like if it were made as of todays date rather than prior to Januarys court ruling? Should Tesla have footnoted this subsequent event in its filing? As a bit of a side note I find it interesting that although the trial ended well over a year ago (November 2022) the ruling was only handed down a few weeks ago two days after Teslas 2023 10-K was filed I wonder if the judge purposely did this to give Tesla as much time as possible to sort this issue out and make acceptable modifications to either the compensation package or the approval process prior to the next audited report needing to be filed Depending upon the ultimate resolution there could be some significant issues the auditor will need to address when the 2024 10-K is issued about a year from now With the pay package having been voided by the court there is a possibility that much of the remainder of this article could be an academic discussion However there is a reasonably high probability that much if not all of the original terms could be reinstated via multiple possible paths I am therefore working on this assumption in the remainder of my analysis One of the possible paths relates to Musks proposal to move Teslas state of incorporation from Delaware to Texas although the fact that this is being proposed by him rather than the chairperson of Teslas board does reinforce the Delaware court view that the Tesla board is not the independent ultimate authority at Tesla that it is legally supposed to be Also Gary Black who manages a fund that invests in Tesla and is a frequent Twitter/X poster believes that there may simply need to be an appropriate process to reconfirm the original plan Others have expressed similar sentiments An issue related to this option package is Musks desire for 25% voting control Some investors might assume that simply means Musk would be satisfied with a mechanism that would give him an additional 45% voting control whether via additional options or otherwise It is not that simple though Although Musk currently beneficially owns 205% of Tesla stock per the filing it is only the shares he actually owns that give him voting rights The 411 million shares he currently owns represent less than 13% of currently outstanding shares To reach 205% he would need to exercise all his vested options and retain the underlying shares As indicated on page 8 of Teslas 2018 proxy statement Musks options are non-qualified as opposed to incentive stock options as most option grants are these days Tax is due at the ordinary income tax rate when exercised rather than when sold This could potentially be quite material for Musk The marginal federal income tax rate is 37% In addition there is a 38% net investment income tax and a 145% Medicare (Social Security) tax Although Musk is now a resident of Texas which has no state income tax Californias marginal rate is 133% It is highly likely that California would make the case that the options were earned while Musk was a California resident and would expect its pound of flesh The total tax on the gain on exercise could be as much as 55% The options have an exercise price (cost basis) of $2334 At the current price of about $200 close to 90% of the share value resulting from the exercise would be taxable upon exercise This means that Musk could potentially sell 40-50% of the shares resulting from the option exercise possibly as many as about 150 million shares In theory Musk could pay the income tax without selling Tesla shares However he does not have the liquid assets to do so and in fact has already borrowed a substantial sum against the TSLA shares he owns so borrowing substantially more to pay the income tax does not appear to be an option for him An additional 120 to 150 million Tesla shares dumped into the market would unquestionably have a detrimental impact on the market price of TSLA We all saw how much TSLA stock decreased in market price in late 2022 when Musk sold a much smaller number of shares to finance the Twitter acquisition After exercising the options and selling enough to pay the tax bill Musk would likely have about 16-17% voting control Would this be his starting point for his desire for 25% voting control or some other figure? Assuming the option award (or a reasonable facsimile) is ultimately certified or reapproved in some fashion there is still the question as to its value The only fact that was ever true about the option grant was that if it fully vested it would allow Musk to buy 304 million shares at a bit over $23 The $56 billion figure generally quoted assumes that the market price of TSLA reaches just barely high enough to result in a total market capitalization of $650 million If Teslas price skyrockets before the options are exercised and the five-year holding period for them expires the ultimate value could be a multiple of that On the other hand if the price decreases substantially it could ultimately be worth a lot less The various issues surrounding Elon Musks Tesla Inc option grants have placed us in uncharted territory These issues include not only the unprecedented size of the 2018 grant but also the fact that it has been voided The question then becomes what will replace it Further complicating the issue is the extremely inaccurate reporting regarding Elon Musks current ownership position and recent changes in it as well as Musks expressed desire for 25% voting control I hope I have clarified some of these issues in this article This article was written by Analyst’s Disclosure: I/we have a beneficial short position in the shares of TSLA either through stock ownership options or other derivatives I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha) I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article I have a hedged net short position in TSLA Seeking Alphas Disclosure: Past performance is no guarantee of future results No recommendation or advice is being given as to whether any investment is suitable for a particular investor Any views or opinions expressed above may not reflect those of Seeking Alpha as a whole Seeking Alpha is not a licensed securities dealer broker or US investment adviser or investment bank Our analysts are third party authors that include both professional investors and individual investors who may not be licensed or certified by any institute or regulatory body"

it only signed on dealers that could commit a minimum of five outlets so when demand for BYD EVs soared the distribution network was able to expand rapidly Pratarnwong said Rever currently has around 100 BYD showrooms which it plans to triple within two years We were thinking 100 showrooms in probably two or three years said Pratarnwong 39 That was our original plan prior to our first sales Pratarnwong and his sister are part of the Phornprapha family that established the Siam Motors Group (SMG) which helped develop Thailands automotive industry as a dealer and manufacturing partner for Nissan Motor 7201 Rever which is independent from SMG started with an initial investment of 3 billion baht ($83 million) with the goal of pushing BYD into the top tier of Thailands auto market within five years they said in an August 2022 launch event Rever has a one-price policy - introduced by Chinese car makers in Thailand - across all its outlets among the factors that convinced Natthakul Pingclasai to convert one of his Mazda showrooms into a BYD one The arrangement prevents price wars between dealers helping them to secure full margins on vehicle sales Natthakul 32 told Reuters BYD and Rever had nearly perfect timing for their market launch coming just a few months after the introduction of subsidies that made their product very competitive said Krzysztof Tokarz manager for automotive and manufacturing at ABeam Consulting in Thailand In early 2022 Thailand introduced its first subsidy package to help reduce prices of each EV by up to 150000 baht ($416089) to reach a government target of converting 30% total automobile production to electric by 2030 JAPANESE COMPETITORS Revers partnership with BYD was around five years in the making If you look at China you can see probably 20-30 EV brands there Not all of them will survive only big ones with a big production capacity and ability to innovate will stay Pratarnwong said outlining why he focused on BYD To build the BYD brand Revers marketing plan heavily focused on old-school advertising techniques unlike rivals such as Tesla that for years shunned traditional advertising to sell cars We underestimate how much of out-of-home media actually initiates trust said Rever Vice CEO Pratarnporn 38 For instance it strategically placed big BYD billboards in heavy traffic routes in Thai capital Bangkok and around provincial capitals in the hinterland such as one near Thailands border with Laos seen by a Reuters reporter last year This strategy proved effective as seeing BYD cars is now a common sight even in rural areas said ABeams Tokarz Rever currently ploughs back between 2%-3% of revenue into marketing With the support of government subsidies and an expanding stable of EV options BYD is poised to gain market share against Japanese automakers said Counterpoint senior analyst Soumen Mandal However in the longer term as Toyota Honda and the Renault-Nissan Alliance introduce more EVs BYD will face stronger competition ($1 = 360500 baht) Traders and investors use our platform Top website in the world when it comes to all things investing Mobile reviews with 49 average rating No other fintech apps are more loved Custom scripts and ideas shared by our users @Zeiierman Trading @Cenobar @TradingView @TradingView @iamcarlosbello @arakerbabian @dude_yugant @mytradingsetup @price_action_guru @akamenyar @garret_duke @fxdelta @mytradingsetup @icesef @thecurrencydon @fxtoday @jesseforexmt5 @neo_inversion Whatever the trade"

Mutual Funds ETFs Bonds To learn more about the CNBC CFO Council visit cnbccouncilscom/cfo In this article Hertz surprised many onlookers last week when the car-rental company announced it would be selling about a third of its global electric vehicle fleet reversing course on several big bets it had placed on EVs The move seemingly followed the rest of the auto industry which has quickly shifted its position on EVs after years of aggressive plans and projections with several automakers cutting production of vehicles or reducing prices as inventory has built up in recent months In October General Motors and Honda Motor announced that they were canceling plans to jointly develop affordable EVs in the face of slowing demand Over the course of 2023 Tesla cut the prices of its cars across the world aiming to reignite demand as consumer spending slowed and the EV market became even more crowded Hertz CEO Stephen Scherr told CNBCs Jim Cramer on Squawk on the Street on Thursday that the companys move which followed large purchase orders of Tesla and GM EVs was responding to the reality which is were trying to bring supply in line with demand The reality of EVs and Teslas being the best-selling car will at some point render them the best rental car Scherr said Its not yet so we may have been ahead of ourselves in the context of how quickly that will happen but that will happen Hertz said it would be selling about 20000 electric vehicles It would then use some of those proceeds to buy internal combustion engine cars The company would also be taking a $245 million incremental net depreciation expense as a result However Hertz said in a regulatory filing that it expects to improve its bottom line by an amount equal to $245 million over the next two years by replacing those EVs with internal-combustion-engine cars The company had already indicated on its third-quarter earnings call in October that it was slowing its purchase of EVs citing MSRP declines in EVs driving down the fair market value of its cars The company said about 11% of its entire fleet in October was EVs On Oct 25 2021 Hertz first announced plans to grow its fleet of battery-electric vehicles with an initial order of 100000 Teslas by the end of 2022 A commercial featuring repeat Super Bowl champion Tom Brady alongside parked Tesla Model 3 electric sedans in a Hertz garage accompanied the announcement Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said on CNBCs Last Call on Thursday that the move to sell part of its Tesla fleet is a black eye for Hertz adding that he believes Hertz miscalculated how its move to introduce EVs and Teslas to customers would play out from a marketing and roll-out standpoint Part of Hertzs original thesis into investing in EVs is that customers would be eager to rent them for a variety of reasons such as trying one for the first time avoiding high gas prices or choosing a more environmentally friendly rental car Scherr said that sort of experimentation was happening but not happening at a level of demand that justifies us maintaining a fleet of this size at this moment in time Teslas recent decision to lower the price of its vehicles also weighed into Hertzs decision given the impact on deprecation Scherr added Hertz had previously set a goal to have a quarter of its fleet be EVs by the end of 2024 Scherr said taking this course instead was about financial performance and operational integrity A smart company is one thats agile makes an adjustment takes away the distraction — financial and operational — and moves on Scherr said Got a

unavailable We’re working to restore it Please try again later Add articles to your saved list and come back to them any time Tesla had a blockbuster 2023 as its shares more than doubled in 12 months But 2024 is starting on a different note with Elon Musk’s electric vehicle maker off to its worst start to any year — ever The company has lost more than $US94 billion ($141 billion) in market valuation in just the first two weeks of 2024 It’s not hard to figure out why as the Austin Texas-based EV maker has been pounded by a barrage of negative news: an about-face on EVs from the car rental giant Hertz yet another price cut for its cars made in China and signs of rising labour costs Tesla CEO Elon Musk has big plans to keep the company growing in 2024 Credit: Marija Ercegovac All of this comes in the face of slowing growth in demand for EVs especially in the US “Investors’ main concern on Tesla is stagnating growth” Cowen analyst Jeffrey Osborne said in an interview The price cuts in China only fan those concerns because it is starting to look like “a race to the bottom for the EV industry given intense competition in that market” The hit to Tesla’s market capitalisation to start the year is the biggest the company has seen over a similar period since it went public in 2010 In percentage terms Tesla’s 12 per cent drop since the start of January is the worst since 2016 when the stock fell 14 per cent over the first nine trading days of the year To make matters worse the odds of an imminent turnaround for the EV maker don’t look good Tesla has been cutting prices on its cars aggressively since early 2023 in an effort to boost demand But the result has been a steady erosion of its once-hefty profit margin Tesla’s automotive gross margin ex-regulatory credits for the third quarter fell to 163 per cent from 279 per cent a year ago And the pressure is only mounting now that production workers at Tesla’s US plants are getting pay raises “We are going through a cyclical downturn for EVs but competitive dynamics are exacerbating the cyclical pressures” said Ivana Delevska chief investment officer at Spear Invest “Price cuts and plummeting margins are all a function of these unfavourable competitive dynamics” Adding to the woes Tesla has had to re-route shipments destined for its Berlin plant after Western military actions and security concerns in the Red Sea and is suspending most production at its plant near Berlin from January 29 to February 11 according to a person familiar with the matter Tesla first warned about the deceleration in EV demand during its October third-quarter earnings report Almost immediately after automakers and suppliers across the globe chimed in with their own downbeat forecasts Many carmakers dialled back their plans for expansion Then earlier this month Tesla reported its fourth-quarter delivery numbers While they were better than what analysts expected they put the company behind China’s BYD Co in global electric-car sales The result has been a rude awakening for Tesla investors Last year the stock was the eighth best performer in the S&P 500 So far this year it’s the eighth worst Naturally Musk is taking a big hit personally The world’s richest person who gained more wealth in 2023 than anyone else on the planet has seen his net worth shrink by $US23 billion so far this year according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index Musk regained the top spot on Bloomberg’s wealth index last year overtaking Bernard Arnault but now Jeff Bezos is rapidly closing in with $US179 billion to Musk’s $US206 billion as of Friday’s close The bulk of Musk’s net worth comes from his 13 per cent stake in Tesla and about 304 million exercisable stock options He also owns about 42 per cent of SpaceX which is valued at about $US53 billion according to Bloomberg’s wealth index With all that being said Tesla remains a key player in the global transition from gas-powered vehicles to largely electric ones The reason: It’s so far ahead of its potential rivals China’s BYD may have surpassed Tesla in the number of units sold but it still lags in revenue and profits And BYD doesn’t sell cars in the US where Tesla remains the market leader In many ways Tesla’s biggest problem may be its past success and the hope it generated As investors piled into the stock Tesla’s market capitalisation ballooned making it way larger than any other car company in the world However with the shares priced for perfection that also made them highly vulnerable to big reactions to any negative news That’s why so many Tesla proponents argue that it shouldn’t be compared to regular car companies To them the ultimate true value of the company rests in the future and it’s hope to develop the first truly self-driving vehicles The only problem is Tesla has been promising this for years and most experts say the technology is still years maybe even decades away “Tesla has not been able to deliver on fully autonomous driving and AI promises which are already embedded in the valuation” Spear’s Delevska said “Being simply another automotive manufacturer is not going to cut it for a $US750 billion valuation”

761,"Teslas Q4 Results May Disappoint Investors (NASDAQ:TSLA)","1/17/2024","https://seekingalpha.com/article/4663293-tesla-q4-results-may-disappoint-investors","Slaven Vlasic/Getty Images Entertainment Slaven Vlasic/Getty Images Entertainment Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock doesnt need much introduction here on Seeking Alpha or elsewhere: I cant think of an investor/analyst I know who doesnt have an opinion on this stock As a rule opinions on TSLAs future vary widely Its always been this way: first skeptics questioned the electric vehicle (EV) trend itself; then as EV adoption became a globally spread reality those same skeptics began questioning the companys margins saying Tesla couldnt sustain them at already high levels for long But the company has proven to the market and all the skeptics time and time again that it can handle a lot But unfortunately nothing lasts forever Since April 2023 Ive been one of the same skeptics questioning Teslas medium-term future Early in 2023 I was proven wrong after I made my first downgrade Over time however my sell calls proved to be reasonable: since June 2023 TSLA stock is down ~20% while the S&P 500 Index (SP500) is up 9% and since my last bearish call the stock is down 055% while the broad market is up 1182%: Seeking Alpha my coverage of TSLA stock Seeking Alpha my coverage of TSLA stock And I have reason to believe that Teslas upcoming Q4 results schedule for post-market on January 24th and earnings commentary may disappoint investors and the downward trend of its stock price will continue What we already know is that in the fourth quarter of 2023 Tesla had strong delivery volumes (484507) producing 494989 vehicles a 13% increase YoY and a 15% increase QoQ The total deliveries for the year reached 1808581 vehicles surpassing the companys previous guidance of ~18 million These are definitely strong results that cannot be disputed But why did TSLAs stock price drop ~13% after the announcement? I assume that institutional investors began to reduce their long positions as they saw in Teslas strong deliveries numbers the so-called pull-forward effect that occurs when consumers accelerate their planned purchases to take advantage of certain benefits before they expire In this case the increase in demand is linked to the impending expiration of EV subsidies in the United States Germany and France Google SearchGoogle SearchGoogle Search Google Search Google Search Google Search Teslas Model 3 SR (Standard Range) and LR (Long Range) trims in the US are expected to lose the full $7500 IRA credit at the year-end based on new IRA guidance Tesla emphasized that deliveries must be completed by December 31 to guarantee the full credit (hence the jump in deliveries) This announcement represents an increase from the previously expected loss of $3750 and its noteworthy that the LR which shifted to nickel-based batteries from LG sourced from China earlier in the year is now also losing eligibility Last calendar quarter Tesla continued to focus on pricing strategies implementing slight increases in China (+066%) and a rise in Model 3 Highland pricing outside North America However overall prices were reduced during this period After initial 3-4% price cuts across Model 3/Y trims in the US in early October Tesla reintroduced discounts to inventory vehicles in mid-November The entire quarters sales of Model S/X at new lower average selling prices (ASP) post a mid-August price cut will pose a challenge for Q1 FY2024 sales numbers (and likely EPS too) in my view Additionally there were incremental discounts on certain inventory vehicles in Europe and other soft discounts such as six months of free supercharging in the US and insurance subsidies in China I have no doubt that demand on the market leaves a lot to be desired at the moment - otherwise the company would not be cutting its sales prices so often and so sharply Also I infer from Elon Musks answer at the Q3 earnings call regarding the expansion in Berlin and Austin that Tesla really doesnt see a pickup in demand yet (otherwise Musks answer might sound more ambitious and promising it seems to me): Analyst: Could you please provide an update on capacity expansion plans for companys factories in Berlin and Austin and the opening schedule of Gigafactory Mexico? Elon Musk: Berlin and Austin factories the current priority is actually maximize the output from our existing lines by laser focus on efficiency improvement As always maintaining a high quality and the reducing per unit cost will be as critical as growing the production volume Source: TSLAs Q3 earnings call authors emphasis added In 2023 the EV market saw about 40-50 new models from different brands so competition has become Teslas biggest challenge for growth As a result by the end of the year Tesla was among the underdogs in terms of market share dynamics ex-China: BofA Auto teams research [December 2023 proprietary source] BofA Auto teams research [December 2023 proprietary source] Market share in China has grown but the companys share of this market is 22% so growth in this market looks like a consolation prize What puzzles me most is the markets reaction to the strong Q4 delivery numbers: Wall Street actually slightly raised its expectations for Q4 earnings after the release of those numbers and the drop in all quarters FY2024 EPS estimates is too small in my opinion to account for all the risks that exist Seeking Alpha authors notes Seeking Alpha authors notes Furthermore no matter how one tries to justify it I think the valuation of TSLA is still too high Given the events in the auto industry (and idiosyncrasies) that I described above I see no logical explanation for the consensus view that has developed regarding EBITDA growth over the next two years In my opinion it is very unlikely that Tesla will have two consecutive years of EBITDA growth in excess of 43% as shown below: YCharts authors notes YCharts authors notes And even if this happens the implied FWD EV/EBITDA will still be above 30x - thats too much against the backdrop of the companys declining business growth we have seen in recent quarters Data by YCharts Therefore I do not expect the Q4 figures to be a disaster in terms of YoY or QoQ momentum: the published delivery figures point directly to a potentially strong last quarter of 2023 Nevertheless I expect rather pessimistic guidance and comments from management for the reasons described above If I am right the value of the company should be revised downwards I understand very well the thesis of the bulls who say that Tesla is not just a car company Yes it really isnt just a car company Its business diversification is amazing and the prospects of each niche are really intriguing But Tesla manufactures and sells cars first and foremost and then everything else Therefore TSLA is subject to cyclicality which is clearly not on the side of bulls now But the presence of other faster-growing businesses poses some risks to my Sell thesis and Ill admit that Despite this upside risk however I expect the companys guidance for FY2024 as a whole to be fairly weak - perhaps significantly weaker than the consensus numbers are currently pricing in In the medium term the company does not look like a safe Buy This is why I reiterate my sell recommendation a week before the Q4 report is released but I want to be proven wrong if youre holding TSLA stock today Thanks for reading!

771,"Tesla Is Down But FCF Is Still Strong and Put Premiums Are High and Are Worth Shorting","1/26/2024","https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/stocks/TSLA-Q/pressreleases/23632039/tesla-is-down-but-fcf-is-still-strong-and-put-premiums-are-high-and-are-worth-shorting/","Tesla Inc (TSLA) stock is down a good deal after its earnings release on Jan 24 But TSLA stock may now have hit a bottom and its put premiums are very high That makes them worth shorting out-of-the-money (OTM) puts as an income play In mid-day trading on Friday Jan 26 2024 TSLA is at $18425 per share This is down significantly from a week ago at $22034 and its recent peak at $26089 on Dec 27 2023 However the stock is up today and may have hit a bottom As a result put option premiums in near-term expiry periods have skyrocketed That presents a huge income opportunity for short sellers This is especially true since Tesla is still making positive free cash flow (FCF) I discussed this in my last Barchart article on Jan 21 2024 “Tesla Stock Is Still Worth Considerably More Based on Its Free Cash Flow” At the time I suggested shorting the $180 strike price puts for expiration on Feb 9 2024 Those puts are still out-of-the-money by over 25% But the premium is now very attractive at $440 per put For example anyone who shorts 1 put contract at $180 for expiration on Feb 9 by securing $18000 with their brokerage firm can immediately receive $440 That works out to an immediate yield of 244% with just 2 weeks to go before that option expires Moreover on an annualized basis assuming the investor can theoretically replicate this trade every 2 weeks for the next 12 weeks (ie 6x) the expected return (ER) is $2640 That works out to 1467% per quarter or $2640 per 100 shares shorted That is a very attractive income opportunity It helps make up for the amount that TSLA has fallen (ie $18425 +$2640 = $21065) It also provides good downside protection The breakeven price is $18000-$440 or $17560 which is 458% below todays price Moreover more conservative investors including existing shareholders might be more comfortable shorting the $170 strike price puts Those trade for $185 per put contract shorted or 1088% in just 2 weeks That also has a good ER for the next 12 weeks of 1128% (ie 1088% x 6) assuming the same yield can be repeated every time One way to hedge the $180 short put play is to buy $175 puts for $289 The net credit is $150 (ie $440 - $289) Therefore the investor has limited their downside risk should the stock fall below $18000 in the next weeks They still end up a net credit and a potential downside unrealized loss of just $349 (ie $500 - $151) But even in that case the investor can monitor the situation and if TSLA rises and the $17500 put premium decays they can sell the long put That would enhance the overall return The bottom line is that TSLA stock has probably hit a short-term bottom here and the stock could potentially rebound That makes it attractive to short these high-premium OTM puts Provided Content: Content provided by Barchart The Globe and Mail was not involved and material was not reviewed prior to publication How much is Tesla Inc stock worth?

focus and likely slower growth ahead here’s what we think of Tesla’s stock Tesla TSLA released its fourth-quarter earnings report on Jan 24 after the close of trading Here’s Morningstar’s take on Tesla’s earnings and stock With its 3-star rating we believe Tesla’s stock is fairly valued compared with our long-term fair value estimate In 2024 we forecast Tesla will see a far slower growth rate with deliveries increasing just 10% to a little under 2 million from a little over 18 million in 2023 We forecast lower average selling prices as Tesla will likely have to cut prices in key markets like China in line with peers We forecast automotive gross margins will be 18% in 2024 in line with 2023 results In the longer term we assume Tesla will deliver a little over 5 million vehicles per year in 2030 This includes fleet sales an expanding opportunity for the firm Our forecast is well below management’s aspirational goal of selling 20 million vehicles by the end of this decade but nearly 3 times the 181 million vehicles delivered in 2023 We think Tesla will be successful in continuing to reduce its manufacturing costs on a per-vehicle basis We forecast segment gross margins will recover to the mid-20% range by the end of the decade—well above the 19% generated in 2023 but below the 29% margin achieved in 2022 Read more about Tesla’s fair value estimate We award Tesla a narrow moat based on its intangible assets and cost advantage The company’s strong brand cachet as a luxury automaker commands premium pricing while its EV manufacturing expertise lets it make vehicles more cheaply than its competitors We think Tesla’s combination of intangible assets and cost advantage will persist and allow the firm to generate excess returns on capital We see the potential for the firm to outearn its cost of capital over at least the next 20 years which is the measurement we use for a wide moat rating However the second 10-year period carries significant uncertainty for both Tesla and the broader automotive industry given the rapid advancement of autonomous vehicle technologies that could transform how consumers use vehicles As such we view a narrow moat rating which assumes a 10-year excess return duration as more appropriate Read more about Tesla’s moat rating We assign Tesla a Very High Morningstar Uncertainty Rating as we see a wide range of potential outcomes for the company The automotive market is highly cyclical and subject to sharp demand declines based on economic conditions As the EV market leader Tesla is subject to growing competition from traditional automakers and new entrants As new lower-priced EVs enter the market Tesla may be forced to continue to cut prices reducing the firm’s industry-leading profits With more EV choices consumers may view Tesla less favorably The firm is investing heavily in capacity expansions that carry the risk of delays and cost overruns The company is also investing in R&D in an attempt to maintain its technological advantage and generate software-based revenue with no guarantee these investments will bear fruit Tesla’s CEO owns a little over 20% of the company’s stock and uses it as collateral for personal loans which raises the risk of a large sale to repay debt Tesla faces environmental social and governance risks As an automaker Tesla is subject to potential product defects that could result in recalls including its autonomous driving software We see a moderate impact should this occur Another risk involves employee retention If Tesla is unable to retain key employees such as CEO Elon Musk its favorable brand image could decline Should the company not be able to retain production line employees it could see delays We see a low probability but moderate

781,"Short sellers lost more money betting against Tesla than any other company last year","1/6/2024","https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/06/business/tesla-short-sellers-losses/index.html","Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Here’s something sure to make Elon Musk smile – short sellers those investors who placed bets that the value of Tesla shares were going to go down lost a combined $122 billion last year more than short sellers lost on any other company in 2023 That estimate from markets analytics firm S3 Partners isn’t a shock – Tesla shares slightly more than doubled during the course of the year But for the shorts to take that kind of hit there needs to be not only gains for the shares but also a large group betting the other way With US stock indexes ending the year near record highs – the S&P 500 rose 22% for the year - shorts had a bad year overall S3 estimates overall short losses reached $1948 billion But the losses by those shorting Tesla were particularly bad – more than the losses they suffered at Microsoft and Faceboook owner Meta combined And Tesla which is worth far more than any other automaker in the world – despite having sales that are a fraction of many established automakers – has long been a top target for shorts who believe the shares are overvauled Last year investors had an average short interest of $189 billion on Tesla shares surpassed only by Apple which has an average of $19 billion in short interest with a much larger market value than Tesla To put the $122 billion in losses in context the 6-plus week strike by the United Auto Workers union against General Motors Ford and Stellantis cost the US economy as a whole a total of just over $10 billion according to an estimate from Anderson Consulting Group a Michigan think tank that tracks the cost of strikes The losses by short sellers are a stark contrast to a year ago when shorts made a $159 billion profit on Tesla shares as the company’s stock lost 65% of the value But Tesla shares have been going up far more often then down since it went public in 2010 Since its shares started trading publicly shorts have suffered a net loss of $618 billion according to S3 “That going to leave a mark” joked Ihor Dusaniwsky managing director at S3 in an interview with CNN Those shorting Tesla did even worse in the first half of the year than they did for the year as a whole closing out $13 billion in losing short positions from January-June but then making a $771 million profit in the final six months as Tesla shares lost about 15% of their value from their high in July through the end of the year Even with that more recent decline Tesla has a market capitalization of $756 billion more than twice the value of the second most valuable automaker Toyota That’s despite the fact that Toyota’s global sales are more than six times greater than Tesla’s Dusaniwsky and some analysts bullish on Tesla shares say that short sellers are waiting for Tesla to start trading far below its current valuation “Every year the bears come out of hibernation mode and think ‘This is the year that Tesla shares collapse” said Dan Ives analyst with Wedbush Securities “The bears view it as an automobile company that should trade at a valuation a multiple of GM or Toyota The bulls such as myself believe it’s a disruptive technology company And that’s the Wall Street consensus view” But some critics of Tesla continue to insist that trouble could soon be catching up with its high flying share price Analyst Gordon Johnson of GLJ Research one of the more vocal critics of Tesla points to a number of factors including a smaller profit margin in the wake of a series of price cuts excess production capacity at its factories given the current demand for its vehicles and growing competition from other automakers making EVs His 12-month price target for Tesla shares is about $25 a share which would be down nearly 90% from current levels “Their fundamentals have already imploded” he said “That’s the reason why this is the year [Tesla’s] stock price implodes” Beyond Tesla short sellers are known to highlight problems with company finances and operations that has caused some to nearly go out of business Nikola an electric truck maker that many once saw as the “next Tesla” was devastated by a report by Hindenberg Research a firm that engages in short selling Hindenberg’s report questioned Nikola’s claims about its products and its sales demand Its founder Trevor Milton was forced out and recently sentenced to four years in federal prison for defrauding investors Few if any CEOs like short interest in their company’s stock but Tesla CEO Elon Musk hates it more than almost anyone else He has argued that they have deliberately tried to hurt the company’s chances of success by making false claims about its prospects And he has accused anyone critical of Tesla of doing so in an effort to help short sellers He has suggested that the Securities and Exchange Commission with which he has battled should be known as the “Shortseller Enrichment Commission” And he has mocked them by selling short shorts on the company’s web site Most

Kathleen Wilson-Thompson the former human-resources chief of Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc who joined in 2018; and Joe Gebbia and JB Straubel who were elected to the board last year Gebbia co-founded Airbnb Inc and Straubel is a co-founder of Tesla Musk has close relationships with Murdoch Gebbia and Straubel During testimony in Delaware Chancery Court over his Tesla compensation package in 2022 the CEO fielded questions from a plaintiff’s lawyer about vacationing with Murdoch on several occasions After Musk tweeted about trying to take Tesla private Gebbia texted his praise calling it a “baller move” Musk and Straubel’s ties date back to Tesla’s founding in 2003 While Tesla’s directors have been well-compensated being a board member has at times been risky In April 2020 the company disclosed that it had decided not to renew its directors’ and officers’ liability policy due to high premiums quoted by insurers Musk agreed to personally provide coverage which the board determined wouldn’t impair directors’ independent judgment After catching flak for the arrangement which initially was planned to last a year Tesla disclosed in October 2020 that it had lined up a customary insurance policy for its directors and officers It paid Musk $3 million for 90 days’ worth of interim coverage that he provided Musk’s reported drug use may temporarily hit Tesla’s shares said Gene Munster a managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management But those who have held on through the CEO’s antics have been rewarded — the stock has soared 1168% since Musk’s marijuana toke in September 2018 “A small percentage of investors will sell their stock over the next week and put some pressure on shares” Munster said Sunday “Most investors won’t care because it falls into the category that if you want to profit from Elon you have to put up with his controversies” © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited All Rights Reserved Use of this site constitutes acceptance of our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy CA Notice at Collection and Privacy Notice Do Not Sell/Share My Personal Information Ad Choices FORTUNE is a trademark of Fortune Media IP Limited registered in the US and other countries FORTUNE may receive compensation for some links to products and services on this website Offers may be subject to change without notice S&P Index data is the property of Chicago Mercantile Exchange Inc and its licensors All rights reserved Terms & Conditions Powered and implemented by Interactive Data Managed Solutions"

Validate the decision and then find some way to post hoc compensate which is going to be anywhere close Are you gonna say look terrible process? This is not a board that’s functioning the way it should but on balance the substance of the decision was right” he said See Also: Everything You Need To Know About Tesla Stock Why It’s Important: Online travel company TripAdvisor TRIP referenced by Musk sought shareholder approval to move its incorporation to Nevada last year Despite two-thirds of shareholders supporting the move the plan was thwarted when two minority shareholders sued the company in Delaware according to a Wall Street Journal report The Delaware court ruled in favor of the minority shareholders asserting that excluding the votes of Greg Maffei the company’s chairman resulted in only 54% support for reincorporation Maffei holding 56% of the vote at Tripadvisor primarily through supervoting shares wielded significant influence TripAdvisor’s parent company Liberty TripAdvisor Holdings LTRPA LTRPB faced a similar dilemma The rationale behind TripAdvisor’s filing argued that relocating to Nevada would yield tax savings of $250000 annually reduce legal expenses and “potentially greater protection from unmeritorious litigation for directors and officers” Unlike Delaware known for imposing stricter standards on companies pursuing transactions favoring a controlling shareholder Nevada reportedly provides broad protections for directors and officers in many scenarios Musk recently transferred the incorporation of his brain chip implant company Neuralink from Delaware to Nevada Read Next: ‘Were There Any Half-Decent Ads?’ Asks Elon Musk While Tesla Bull Calls EV Giant’s No-Show At Super Bowl ‘Short-Term Thinking’ Image via Shutterstock © 2024 Benzingacom Benzinga does not provide investment advice All rights reserved Trade confidently with insights and alerts from analyst ratings free reports and breaking news that affects the stocks you care about"

Tesla rivals’ woes spark speculation as EV growth slows After markets opened on Thursday Rivian shares fell by as much as 26% their biggest drop and lowest level since the company went public in 2021 Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe pointed to high interest rates as one of the EV maker’s key challenges something Musk has described as hampering Tesla as well “Our business is not immune to existing economic and geopolitical uncertainties most notably the impact of historically high interest rates which has negatively impacted demand” Scaringe said on an earnings call That’s not the only challenge Sales growth of EVs while still strong has recently slowed spurring Ford and GM to pare back their production plans This is partly because early EV enthusiasts have already bought their vehicles and regular car shoppers are more likely to be turned off by the higher prices range anxiety and poor resale value associated with EVs among other concerns Tesla in a call with investors warned of “notably lower” sales growth this year after a disappointing fourth quarter Musk said his EV maker is “between two major growth waves” as it aims to start production of a more affordable model late next year Meanwhile Toyota the world’s top carmaker for four years running and other legacy automakers are enjoying surging sales of hybrid vehicles which many car buyers see as a more practical alternative to EVs On March 7 Rivian will unveil its R2 a midsize SUV that will take on Tesla’s popular Model Y and be priced at around $50000 The model will be smaller and cheaper than what Rivian has offered so far “There is a lack of choice of highly compelling EV products in that $45000 to $55000 price range recognizing the average price of a new vehicle transaction was around $48000” Scaringe said “We remain very bullish on the R2 segment and the R2 product itself” But the R2 is expected to launch in 2026 Asked on CNBC whether a capital raise would be required to get to R2 production Scaringe replied “We are very confident in the capital we have supporting operations through the end of 2025” He added the company is “driving efficiency into everything we do” and expected a fourth-quarter gross profit later this year But Rivian has a long way to go It accounted for 42% of EV sales in the fourth quarter last year compared with Tesla at 551% according to Kelley Blue Book estimates The Tesla Model Y alone had 332% of the market And Tesla itself of course was recently topped in global EV sales by China’s BYD chief among the Chinese EV makers striking fear into legacy automakers with their low production costs and rapidly expanding exports Musk in another post following Rivian’s earnings call wrote: “Their product design is not bad but the actual hard part of making a car company work is achieving volume production with positive cash flow” Read more: The BYD of Vietnam just reported a huge loss for 2023—a whopping $24 billion © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited All Rights Reserved Use of this site constitutes acceptance of our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy CA Notice at Collection and Privacy Notice Do Not Sell/Share My Personal Information Ad Choices FORTUNE is a trademark of Fortune Media IP Limited registered in the US and other countries FORTUNE may receive compensation for some links to products and services on this website Offers may be subject to change without notice S&P Index data is the property of Chicago Mercantile Exchange Inc and its licensors All rights reserved Terms & Conditions Powered and implemented by Interactive Data Managed Solutions"

In todays Market Clubhouse Morning Memo we will discuss SPY QQQ AAPL MSFT NVDA GOOGL META and TSLA Our proprietary formula exclusive to Market Clubhouse dictates these price levels This dynamic equation takes into account price volume and options flow These levels are updated every day and shared with all Clubhouse Members prior to the opening of the market We recommend closely monitoring these stocks and be prepared to leverage potential breakouts or reversals As always stay alert and ready to adjust your tactics based on the markets pulse to optimize your trading gains Now lets dive into the stock analysis: The SPY SPY is currently being traded around the 50671 mark For those bullish on SPY the initial target is a rise to 50752 Should the market sustain momentum above this level the next objective for buyers is to elevate the price to 50834 A successful defense of 50949 during the standard trading hours would set the stage for an advance beyond this threshold The ultimate bullish goal for today in the SPY market is reaching 51014 On the flip side if the 50671 level fails to serve as a reliable floor the market may see a downward push towards 50606 testing the resolve of the bears A visible presence of sellers could further drag the price down to 50532 Breaking below this level amidst intense selling could expose the next significant floor at 50395 In the event of a marked sell-off today the bearish boundary is set at 50285 The QQQ QQQ is hovering around a pivotal point of 43747 Bulls in the market are keen on sustaining levels above 43747 Holding firm at this juncture could see a bullish push towards 43889 establishing it as a new support level Continued purchasing power might then target the 44000 mark with a strong trading session potentially challenging the 44078 level The peak bullish target for QQQ today is envisioned at 44078 Conversely if the QQQ struggles to maintain its stance above 43747 it could signal a bearish takeover prompting a descent to 43658 Observing weakness at this level might compel bears to explore deeper at 43588 Persistent seller activity could challenge the 43476 support with a failure to hold potentially leading to a dip towards the days lowest bearish expectation at 43364 Apples AAPL current trading position is at 18060 Bulls are eyeing this level as a base for support hoping to propel the stock to 18125 A continuation of bullish trends could push the price towards 18227 Should Apples bulls dominate the days trading the aim would be to surge past to a high target of 18296 Should Apples support at 18060 falter a bearish scenario could unfold testing the waters at 18010 A sustained sell-off might lower the price further to 17936 and if the bearish momentum continues 17861 could come into play In a significant downtrend the days lowest bear target for Apple is set at 17818 Microsoft MSFT is trading around 40711 with bulls hoping to maintain a foothold above this level The initial bullish goal is to reach 40846 and secure it as support within the trading day A strong position above this key level could see the price aiming for 40969 with the days bullish peak targeted at 41064 If Microsoft fails to secure support at 40711 bears might test the lower boundary at 40601 A breach of this level could lead to further bearish exploration towards 40492 Continued downward pressure might push the stock towards 40274 with the bearish extremity for the day marked at 40139 NVIDIA NVDA finds itself at a critical juncture of 79144 Bulls are encouraged by the prospect of advancing to 79494 hoping to establish it as a solid support zone An upward trajectory might see the stock reaching 79910 with sustained buying potentially driving it up to 80461 The zenith for NVIDIA bulls today is set at 81013 However if NVIDIAs support at 79144 shows weakness bears might aim for a decline to 78768 A confirmation of seller dominance could see the price retracting to 78535 In a softer market the next level to watch is 78159 with the ultimate bearish target for the day lying at 77891 Alphabets GOOGL trading activity is centered around 13839 Bulls are looking to anchor support at 13946 aspiring to push the stock to 14005 With sustained bullish momentum the trajectory could extend to a high target of 14057 Conversely if Alphabet cannot maintain support at 13839 bears might press the price down to 13779 Failing to uphold this level could see a further dip to 13694 In the face of aggressive selling the lowest bearish aim for the day is 13629 Meta Platforms META is navigating the market at 48096 Bulls are aiming to solidify this level as a base pushing for an upward move to 48311 A robust buying spree could elevate the stock to 48596 with the ultimate bullish horizon for the day set at 48881 Should Meta fail to cling to the 48096 support a bearish tilt could lead to a test of 47947 Persistent selling pressure might drag the price further down to 47750 In a scenario of pronounced bearish momentum the days final bear target is 47519 Teslas TSLA current market position is at 20185 Bulls are eyeing an upward push to 20433 with a strong market potentially elevating Tesla to 20671 An overarching bullish sentiment in the broader market could see Tesla challenging 20951 with the days pinnacle bull target at 21153 If Teslas support at 20185 proves fragile the market might explore lower territories starting at 20043 Persistent selling could see a further retraction to 19750 and if the bearish drive continues a drop to the days lowest target of 19381 is anticipated Final Word: Todays trading landscape is dotted with significant data releases including the House Price Purchase Index and the Richmond Fed Manufacturing Index alongside Consumer Confidence figures The afternoon will bring insights from a 7 Year Note Auction by the US Treasury Remarks from influential figures like Fed Vice Char Barr and Yellen are also on the agenda potentially stirring market volatility

Crypto is rife with buzzwords: ‚Äúcommunity‚Äù ‚Äúprotocol‚Äù ‚Äúpermissionless‚Äù ‚Äúdecentralised‚Äù The US Securities and Exchange Commission has honed in on one ‚Äúecosystem‚Äù in its bid to convince courts that cryptocurrencies are much like stocks and bonds ‚Äî in other words within its regulatory purview Crypto lobbyists along with nine state attorneys general pushed back in a flurry of court documents Thursday The Blockchain Association and DeFi Education Fund filed a joint amicus brief in which they derided the SEC argument that cryptocurrencies amount to ‚Äúinvestment contracts‚Äù because the digital assets exist within ecosystems that founders and developers are actively trying to improve The industry lobbyists were joined by state attorneys general from Montana Arkansas Iowa Mississippi Nebraska Ohio South Dakota and Texas An amicus or friend of the court is a legal document offering support or information on legal cases from parties not directly involved The brief was filed in support of crypto exchange Kraken which is being sued by the SEC for commingling customer funds with its own and for acting as an unregistered securities exchange broker dealer and clearing agency The SEC‚Äôs argument is akin to mistaking a company‚Äôs product for the company itself Marisa Coppel the Blockchain Association‚Äôs top lawyer told DL News echoing an argument made in the lobbyist group‚Äôs brief That Tesla the electric car manufacturer is building its own network of chargers doesn‚Äôt mean the cars themselves should be treated like stocks and bonds ‚ÄúWhen you buy a Tesla you‚Äôre relying on the company to maintain and create its charging network because otherwise you wouldn‚Äôt be able to use your car‚Äù she said ‚ÄúBut that doesn‚Äôt make the Tesla a security‚Äù The SEC is charged with policing the US securities markets to protect investors from fraud and abuse Since the collapse of crypto exchange FTX in November 2022 the SEC has cracked down on the crypto industry suing players large and small for offering unregistered securities Chair Gary Gensler has said the ‚Äúvast majority of crypto assets are investment contracts and thus subject to the federal securities laws‚Äù The industry has treated the crackdown as something of an existential crisis arguing that shoehorning crypto assets into existing securities laws would amount to a death sentence given their unique features and the cost of complying with government regulations In March 2023 crypto exchange Kraken agreed to pay a $30 million fine and end its staking program in the US to settle an earlier SEC lawsuit alleging the staking program was itself an unregistered security But the regulator returned in November suing Kraken in federal court in San Francisco Supposed securities available on Kraken include Solana‚Äôs SOL Polygon‚Äôs MATIC Cardano‚Äôs ADA and several other tokens according to the SEC The SEC holds that an investment contract exists if there is an investment of money in a ‚Äúcommon enterprise‚Äù with a ‚Äúreasonable expectation of profits derived from the efforts of others‚Äù ‚Äî criteria known as the ‚ÄúHowey Test‚Äù for the landmark 1946 case SEC v WJ Howey Co ‚ÄúA reasonable investor would have understood the offer and sale of each of the Kraken-Traded Securities as offers and sales of investment contracts‚Äù the SEC said in its complaint against Kraken ‚ÄúPurchasers of the Kraken-Traded Securities would reasonably have expected to profit from the efforts of these issuers and promoters to grow and maintain the technology platforms and blockchain ecosystems associated with these crypto assets because such growth or operations could in turn increase the price of the underlying crypto asset and/or provide increased value to holders of the Kraken-Traded Securities‚Äù Coppel said it was ‚Äúabsurd‚Äù and an overly broad interpretation of the Howey Test ‚ÄúIn my reading of Howey and all the other cases that set forth a precedent in this area that‚Äôs just not the law‚Äù Coppel said ‚ÄúIt disregards certain elements of Howey and only focuses on the expectation of profit‚Äù She called the participation of state attorneys general a ‚Äúpowerful‚Äù move that could get the court‚Äôs attention ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt weigh in on every single case even if the case could potentially impact people in their state I think a judge would look at an amicus brief by any other government organisation slightly differently Like maybe give that a little bit more weight‚Äù The industry has put much of its faith in courts after a series of victories last year But Coppel believes industry developers are still nervous about running afoul of the SEC ‚ÄúPeople tend to be more bullish and more willing to take risks in a bull market‚Äù she said ‚ÄúAs the market shifts I think the risk calculation also shifts but I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs due to any anxiety ease from the SEC‚Äù Aleks Gilbert is a DeFi correspondent for DL News Have a tip?

Will he be attending the seminars on day 2 and day 3?” the official said on the condition of anonymity Speculation was rife that Musk might attend the summit “You will appreciate that it is the prerogative of any particular company on where to invest and what to invest So as far as Tesla is concerned the government of Gujarat will be more than happy to facilitate them in case if they decide to come to the state” Gupta said He also said the state’s industrial landscape and robust infrastructure were among other draws that can entice a company like Tesla Earlier Foreign Secretary Vinay Kwatra alluded to a meeting between Modi and Musk during the PM’s last visit to the US “There were many elements of value chain economic and commercial investment driven opportunities that were discussed between the Prime Minister and the leaders “And Tesla leadership had extensive meetings with a focus on how exactly can Tesla partner more strongly in the period of investment and manufacturing partnership with India so that it strengthens that segment of the automobile manufacturing in India” Kwatra said Also Read: Advantage BJP Again As Congress Shuns Jan 22 Ayodhya Event Your email address will not be published Required fields are marked * Name * Email * Comment * Notify me of follow-up comments by email Notify me of new posts by email Just tell us a hi Give us your feedback on our articles or how we can improve or enhance our customer experience"

820,"2 Growth Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever","1/15/2024","https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-growth-stocks-buy-hold-161500101.html","In Warren Buffets 1988 letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders he wrote when we own portions of outstanding businesses with outstanding managements our favorite holding period is forever What Buffett fully understands is that long-term compound interest is an investors best friend Holding shares of a growing business over many years can truly work wonders for an investors financial goals Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) have already demonstrated that they have the ingredients to make investors a lot of money Heres why these companies can continue to deliver shareholder returns for a long time Tesla has a market capitalization of $705 billion -- the value of all the shares outstanding This looks exceedingly high for a car company but it reflects Teslas industry-leading profit margin with more growth ahead While there are headwinds holding back electric-vehicle (EV) sales right now such as rising interest rates the future of auto is moving toward an electric future Last year set a record for EV sales which accounted for 76% of all vehicles sold in the US according to Kelley Blue Book up from 59% in 2022 Tesla delivered over 18 million vehicles in 2023 a good jump over the 13 million deliveries the previous year Tesla will face more competition as the market for EVs expands but its well positioned to create above-average returns for shareholders It dominates the US EV market with a 55% share and its accomplishing this while selling vehicles at a much higher profit margin than its competitors Tesla generated a net profit margin of 11% over the last year even higher than BYD Teslas top EV rival in China While Tesla has sacrificed some profit to sell more vehicles in a weak auto market the companys investments in software and artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities open the door for profitable growth avenues that could increase its margin and earnings growth over the long term Thats why the market is willing to pay such a high valuation for the stock Most importantly Teslas superior profitability indicates a competitive advantage built on brand power Tesla has beaten all the German luxury car brands in market share and it achieved all this in just over a decade As Tesla continues to sell more EVs every year investors should expect Tesla to invest the profits in areas that increase its margin and stock price for many years -- robotics energy solutions and so on Amazon is the next growth stock investors should consider buying for the long haul While Amazons cloud services business is a key factor driving interest for the stock on Wall Street Amazons commanding position in the growing $5 trillion global e-commerce market will remain an important driver of the companys long-term growth Like Tesla Amazon still only commands a small share of its market Moreover Amazons free cash flow a key measure of a companys profitability has improved over the last year as management improves efficiency at the companys fulfillment centers The stock is responding and will continue to climb with free cash flow over the long term Amazon still has several opportunities to improve profitability and deliver returns to investors One opportunity is in retail media Amazon attracts millions of customers to its site every day This is turning the site into a powerful advertising platform In the third quarter revenue from advertising services grew 25% year over year a $48 billion annual run-rate business Amazon is also pursuing other ways to create value for shareholders Last year it announced Buy With Prime in partnership with Shopify which will allow Shopify merchants to offer all the benefits of Prime shopping to their customers The added sales volume that could flow through Amazons fulfillment centers could be very beneficial to its bottom line The stock is trading at a price-to-sales ratio of 29 a discount to the stocks pre-pandemic valuation when it traded around 36 times sales or higher Look for improving revenue growth and free cash flow to push the stock higher over the next few years and from there it should grow in value for years as Amazon pursues a multitrillion online shopping market Where to invest $1000 right now When our analyst team has a

ALEXIS KEENAN: Yeah So not entirely fair And this is a special standard that the Delaware Chancery Court is able to apply Its a heightened standard that shifts the burden and puts it onto the Board of Directors at Tesla to show that they did go through a fair process with regard to the price of Musks compensation as well as the process for how they got there So this was a derivative suit It was brought by Tesla shareholders in Delaware Chancery Court They allege that the Board of Directors breached their fiduciary duty when they came up with this compensation package by okaying what they said was excessive performance-based compensation That of course was all in the form of equity still unexercised undistributed to Elon Musk The judge said that the board didnt meet this burden And wrote that the members of the compensation committee at Tesla that they testified to a lack of negotiation over arriving at these figures The judge also applied like I said this heightened standard for transactions And these are when the transactions between the board and an executive that they are talking with an executive with a controlling stake in the company So thats what brings this heightened standard into play here The judge also noted here that Musks personal relationships with board members and the general counsel were not fully disclosed to shareholders when they voted on this package And its important here to note that the Chancery Court its a special court Its a court of equity And it has really broad discretion in order to remedy what they see as breaches of fiduciary duties So its going to get a lot of attention in corporate circles here because this is one of the first times if not the first time that the Delaware court is establishing that theres such a thing called excessive compensation or putting a lot of guardrails around what that really means Also in response to this decision Musk tweeting out that he recommends not even incorporating in Delaware and instead going to Nevada or to Texas where hes already established relationship with his various companies Guys?

installation quote Sunrun earned 43 out of 5 stars based on our methodology and is our pick for solar leases Sunrun offers both a prepaid and monthly solar lease option so you can either pay upfront and lock in 25 years of solar savings or pay month by month You can finance your solar panels with the company’s BrightAdvantage solar loan program which requires no upfront costs We also like that Sunrun offers a wide range of solar services including EV chargers and backup batteries Customers also have access to system monitoring Sunrun offers three financing options: cash purchase loan or lease Sunrun customers who left positive reviews wrote about responsive customer service and friendly employees “My solar system was connected last week and I couldn’t be happier with the company and its employees Everyone I dealt with was courteous efficient and professional The whole process was so easy [Sunrun] handled the necessary paperwork installation and scheduled all of the required inspections I recommended Sunrun to friends relatives and neighbors without hesitation It’s nice to know there are companies that place a priority on customer care [and] Sunrun is a wonderful example” —Viola U via the BBB “I’m very happy with my rep that helped throughout the whole process and really liked being able to get answers quickly through a text Also I like how [Sunrun] broke down the entire program and helped us understand our arrangement plan” —Dan Y via the BBB Unhappy Sunrun customers reported that customer service was slow to respond and resolve system issues “Sunrun has a terrible response time with resolving issues I am approaching one month with no solar service and have not received notification the problem will be resolved anytime soon Meanwhile my utility bill doubled and I still have to pay the monthly lease for a service I am not getting I wish [Sunrun] would arrive and take [its] equipment so I could join a solar company that is more efficient I have gone through customer service three times and I still have not heard back in three business days!” —Christoper C via the BBB A Powerwall costs $11500 with a solar installation through Tesla If you want to install a Powerwall onto your existing solar system or are using another solar provider the cost of a Powerwall without installation is $9200 (though you’ll still need a Tesla Certified professional to install it) These figures do not account for the 30% federal solar tax credit and other incentives Of course how many Powerwalls you buy will determine your final cost You can add up to 10 Powerwalls to your solar system but Tesla recommends most homeowners install between two and four units to have enough stored energy during an outage If you want to go completely off-grid you may want to consider even more Most solar installers recommend installing two or three Tesla Powerwalls The more batteries you install the longer you’ll be able to power your home with stored energy Therefore you can determine how many Powerwalls you need based on your energy consumption and the number of hours or days of backup power you want You can add a Powerwall (or several) to your Tesla solar roof or any solar panel installation As you can see in the chart below the cost of each unit decreases when you purchase more tesla powerwall The quote you will get for your average cost of a Tesla Powerwall is inclusive of installation pricing The following prices include installation costs through Tesla and do not reflect solar incentives The cost of equipment labor and installation qualify for solar incentives like the federal tax credit which can significantly lower your final price You can get an individualized estimate for your Powerwall when you request a solar installation on the Tesla website If you already have a solar panel system or are installing panels with another solar company you can still purchase a Tesla Powerwall The cost of a single Powerwall before installation is $9200 You can order a Powerwall directly from the Tesla website but you’ll still need a certified Tesla installer to connect it for you If your Tesla Powerwall stops working properly and is still under warranty you can get your battery repaired or replaced at little or no cost If you’ve had your battery for more than 10 years you will have to pay for a replacement out-of-pocket You’ll also have to consider the cost of removing and disposing of your old Powerwall which could cost several hundred dollars The Tesla Powerwall is a home battery you can connect to your solar panels to store energy This highly popular energy storage solution can keep your home running during power outages and allows you to use your own solar energy at night The Tesla Powerwall is compatible with any brand of solar panels not just Tesla You can also retrofit a Powerwall onto an existing solar energy system so you don’t have to install it concurrently with your panels (although many people do) Tesla produces two types of solar batteries: the Powerwall 2 and the Powerwall+ The main difference is that the Tesla Powerwall+ is both a solar battery and a solar inverter whereas the Tesla Powerwall 2 is just a battery A solar inverter is a necessary solar system component that helps generate usable energy from your panels so which model Powerwall you need will depend on whether you already have an inverter If you’re unsure which Powerwall model fits your needs we recommend speaking with your solar installer or a Tesla representative Compare the specs of each model below: The Powerwall offers a round trip efficiency of 90% meaning you can use 90% of the energy you put into the battery as energy outputted With Tesla’s depth of discharge you can use 100% of the battery’s capacity before recharging it (although not recommended) Unlike the Tesla Powerwall most solar batteries require a recharge before being completely depleted There are several major providers that install the Tesla Powerwall including ADT Solar and Sunrun Tesla also offers a search tool on its website to find certified installers near you You can order a Powerwall through the Tesla website But Tesla “highly recommends” you contact an installer for a quote and to review your design and installation before placing an order Most installation companies can both order and install your Powerwall for you You can select one of the following Tesla Powerwall installers below to get started All Tesla Powerwalls come with a 10-year manufacturer warranty the industry standard for solar batteries This warranty has no cycle limit so it is still valid no matter how many times the battery is charged and discharged However the lifespan of a Tesla Powerwall is between 20 and 25 years Tesla Powerwall Batteries also have a 70% end-of-warranty capacity guarantee so even after your 10-year warranty ends your battery will maintain 70% of its capacity Additionally Tesla Powerwalls include a four-year workmanship warranty covering labor and shipping costs for repair and replacements Connecting your Tesla Powerwall to your solar energy system (or another renewable system) qualifies for the 30% federal solar tax credit and most other state and local incentives for solar equipment Your local Tesla Certified Installer can help you apply for solar rebates and incentives in your area Keep in mind that the cost of each Powerwall decreases when you buy more than one For example a single Powerwall costs $9200 but if you buy three at once each unit only costs $8400 Check out solar incentives in your state to see how much you can save: Alabama Alaska Arizona Arkansas California Colorado Connecticut Delaware Florida Georgia Hawaii Idaho Illinois Indiana Iowa Kansas Kentucky Louisiana Maine Maryland Massachusetts Michigan Minnesota Mississippi Missouri Montana Nebraska Nevada New Hampshire New Jersey New Mexico New York North Carolina North Dakota Ohio Oklahoma Oregon Pennsylvania Rhode Island South Carolina South Dakota Tennessee Texas Utah Vermont Virginia Washington West Virginia Wisconsin Wyoming A Tesla Powerwall can save you money on your electricity bill if: However a Tesla Powerwall can still be worth it by offering a backup power source during power outages which a standard solar power system cannot do alone It is possible to achieve complete energy independence from the electric grid with enough Powerwalls — even a single Powerwall can power a typical home for several hours So if you want to achieve energy independence would like protection from power outages or do not have the benefit of net metering where you live a Tesla Powewall would be worth it We recommend speaking with a Tesla installer like ADT Solar or Sunrun to help you decide if a Powerwall is worth it for you The Tesla Powerwall is a rechargeable lithium-ion battery that uses Nickel Manganese Cobalt (NCM) battery cells It is similar to the type of battery used in Tesla vehicles Tesla is now headquartered in Austin Texas after moving from California in 2021 We closely evaluate solar installation companies with a focus on the factors most important to homeowners like you We based our solar company methodology on input from multiple homeowner surveys discussions with industry experts and research into the renewable energy market Our review process involves assessing each company on the following criteria which we then use to calculate a rating out of 5 stars Cost and payment options (20 points): Cost is one of the most important factors when installing a solar energy system Solar providers that offer cash purchases and in-house loan financing earn full points in this category Companies also receive bonus points for offering solar panel leasing or power purchase agreements (PPAs) Services (20 points): In addition to solar installations companies offering backup battery and electric vehicle charger installations energy efficiency audits and system monitoring earn the most points in this category Companies can also receive points for completing installations in-house as opposed to using third-party contractors Reputation (20 points): To assess the reputation of each company we consider Google star ratings Better Business Bureau (BBB) scores and reviews and NABCEP certification status We also look at customer complaint rates on sites like the BBB and weigh how the company responds Warranty (15 points): We verify that each company offers workmanship product and performance warranties on all of its solar installs A provider earns more points for extending warranties that meet or exceed industry standards including 10 years for system workmanship and products and 25 years for panel performance Customer Support (10 points): Solar companies that offer virtual consultations a mobile app 24/7 customer support and high customer satisfaction with backend support earn the most points in this category Industry Experience (10 points): Providers with 10 or more years of experience in the solar installation industry earn a perfect score in this category Sustainability (5 points):To measure sustainability we assess each company based on whether it shares a detailed sustainability statement or ESG disclosures on its website We also conduct research to see if companies offer end-of-life panel disposal programs or have

Please inquire if interested “First of all when Tesla first came into the industry they didn’t actually keep the risk themselves; they were just a distribution channel” said Adam Denninger (pictured) global industry leader for insurance at Capgemini “What you’ve seen for a long time is that a lot of technology companies coming into the industry on the distribution side – offering new agent experiences new mechanisms of gathering data even occasionally doing the underwriting piece as well – all have had a similar experience They lost a lot of money” Denninger cited high-profile insurtechs like Hippo and Lemonade as examples of startups that have had a similar experience to Tesla Insurance “[These companies] came in thinking that the technology was the hard part and thinking insurance is this old slow backwater industry” Denninger said “[They thought] it’s not that complicated and they could solve it But they realised [insurance] was pretty complicated and it’s difficult to do it without losing your shirt I think that’s what happened to Tesla” Experts earlier claimed that Tesla’s pioneering use of advanced telematics would significantly help it price risk better and bring down auto insurance premiums for its policyholders in a market where traditional insurance players were raising their rates However accounts of high auto insurance premium quotes by EV drivers soon surfaced in media reports appearing to contradict Tesla founder Elon Musk’s assurances of affordable rates In December 2023 a California judge ruled that the tech firm’s insurance arm would face a class action lawsuit from drivers who claimed they were overcharged for their premiums which Tesla allegedly based on “false” crash warnings instead of actual driving behaviour Danger ahead for Tesla insurance: faulty forward collision warnings inflate premiums triggering a class-action lawsuit If youd like to see this fixed please share this article and spread the wordhttps://tco/6dEVVYXGqK$TSLA @Tesla @torquenewsauto #teslainsurance A recent investigative report by Reuters included allegations that poor management practices and understaffing by the company had led to extensive delays in claims and other operational shortfalls at Tesla Insurance “I think when Tesla came in they didn’t understand the level of difficulty for servicing and managing claims how much work it is to run an operation centre and handle all the incoming calls the support that people need etc” said Denninger “Essentially they were not prepared for what it meant to actually be an insurance company from an operational perspective which led to negative reviews” There have also been questions as to whether Tesla can deliver on the promise of its telematics scheme “This is what people said would disrupt the industry because [Tesla] was going to use their cars to do telematics” said Denninger “They are going to have a data set on a large number of cars that’s incredibly rich that nobody can compete with and they will be able to price more accurately than anyone else As you look forward that probably will happen” However critics have argued that Tesla’s reliance on in-house data may not align with industry standards potentially leading to inaccurate risk assessments and mispriced insurance premiums The US class action against Tesla Insurance also raised concerns about the sensor technology they’re using and whether these are “misreading” driving events But Denninger maintained that Tesla’s fundamental insurance pricing model is sound “People are saying ‘your car isn’t scoring me correctly because the things you’re dinging me for scoring are incorrect’ So there’s a technology fail” Denninger said “But the underlying model that they’re using to price insurance there’s nothing wrong with it at all People do variations of that using smart devices “The question is really whether the technology is doing it correctly and whether Tesla has a liability associated with that That’s an interesting question and I don’t know where it’s going land” Though there are technology and operational concerns on the table from some corners Denninger also points out that increased scrutiny over Tesla Insurance could also be part of the “Elon Musk effect” “When I look at all this stuff around Tesla and all the noise around it I think some of it is just that Elon Musk is larger than life People react to him and they try to jump on any bad news” said Denninger An appeals court has ruled that Elon Musk will not have to testify in a wrongful death lawsuit after two teenagers were killed in a Tesla Model S going 116 miles per hour in 2018—after a Tesla technician removed speed limiting software on the vehicle https://tco/Sl6EkLeSvg Its controversial CEO aside Tesla seems to be making all the right moves in its insurance strategy according to the Capgemini leader “What they’re doing is cutting-edge It’s exactly where the rest of the insurance industry is going for telematics Everybody wants to feed data off their cars” Denninger said “As for retaining the risk themselves other technology companies have tried to do this It’s not new and all of them lose their shirts when they do it and they end up partnering with traditional insurance companies at some point There’s nothing new here from an insurance industry perspective” But is there hope for redemption for Tesla Insurance?

848,"None","2/12/2024","https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-charge-non-tesla-ev-at-supercharger-models-adapters-2023-7","2023 was a pivotal year for Tesla and competing electric automakers A key factor in all of that? Whether companies planned to switch to Teslas charging standard now rebranded as the North American Charging Standard or NACS More car companies are shifting to the charging pioneered by Elon Musk in the hopes of boosting their customers confidence in going electric If you currently drive a Tesla you can keep charging at Tesla charging locations that use the companys North American Charging Standard (NACS) which has long served it well The chargers are thinner more lightweight and easier to wrangle than other brands If you currently drive a non-Tesla EV you have to charge at a non-Tesla charging station like that of Electrify America or EVgo — which use the Combined Charging System (CCS) — unless you stumble upon a Tesla charger already equipped with a Magic Dock adapter For years CCS dominated EVs from everyone but Tesla Starting in 2024 if you drive a non-Tesla EV (from the automakers that have announced theyll make the switch) youll be able to charge at 12000 Supercharger locations with an adapter Thats not all Superchargers — some (the original and V2 chargers) are not compatible with CCS but the V3 chargers are But by 2025 EVs from several automakers wont even need an adapter Non-Tesla stations will increasingly incorporate NACS in addition to CCS Heres how to charge up depending on which EV you have: Ford was the earliest traditional automaker to team up with Tesla for its charging tech Current Ford EV owners — those driving a Ford electric vehicle already fitted with a CCS port — will be able to use a Tesla-developed adapter to access Tesla Superchargers starting in the spring That means that if you own a Mustang Mach-E or Ford F-150 Lightning you will need the adapter in order to use a Tesla station come 2024 But Ford will equip its future EVs with the NACS port starting in 2025 — eliminating the need for any adapter Owners of new Ford EVs will be able to pull into a Supercharger station and juice up no problem GM will also allow its EV drivers to plug into Tesla stations Much like Ford GM EV drivers can start to use the Tesla charging network even before the automaker equips its cars with NACS Starting next year whether youre driving a GMC Hummer Cadillac Lyriq or other GM electric car you can use a Tesla charger so long as you have an adapter GM will build its EVs with the NACS port starting in 2025 From that point on GM EV drivers wont need an adapter to charge at a Tesla location As for Rivian drivers an adapter will also be available in the spring Then Rivian will build its R1T vehicles and upcoming R1S platform with the NACS port as standard beginning in 2025 Current drivers of Volvo EVs can start to use an adapter to use Tesla chargers sometime mid-next year Those who buy an electric Volvo starting in 2025 can expect the cars will be made with the NACS port from then onward The same rules apply for owners of Polestar EVs You can start using the chargers in 2024 with an adapter and expect the full experience a year later with a model year 2025 Polestar The German automaker just announced it will adopt Teslas NACS Mercedes-Benz EV drivers will have access to the Tesla network via an adapter beginning next year Mercedes will implement the NACS port into its vehicles built starting in 2025 Nissan is the first of the Japanese automakers to adopt Teslas NACS Starting next year 2024 Nissan models that currently have CCS will get access to adapters that allow those vehicles to connect to NACS plugs Nissan said in a release that it will build its EVs for the US and Canadian markets with a NACS port beginning in 2025 Fisker is following suit and announced in August it will adopt NACS Starting in the first quarter of 2025 Fisker customers can use adapters to access Supercharging The EV startup said it will later update its vehicles to include the NACS inlet Fisker said it will also continue to include a CCS adapter so customers can still charge at sites with that standard too Honda announced early September it too would adopt Teslas NACS The automaker will launch a new EV in North America equipped with the port in 2025 EVs launching before then with the traditional CCS port will have NACS compatibility with an adapter The same should apply to Hondas luxury brand Acura All new Jaguar electric vehicles sold in the US Canada and Mexico from 2025 and beyond will come equipped with NACS the luxury automaker said late September It will also give its existing customers and future buyers of its pure-electric vehicles not yet equipped with NACS an adapter to charge at Tesla locations Jaguar is planning on going all-electric by 2025 Hyundai will debut NACS on its new or refreshed EVs in the US starting in the fourth quarter next year the automaker announced early October Vehicles in Canada will have access to Tesla Superchargers in the first half of 2025 the company said An adapter to access the Tesla network will be available to drivers of existing and upcoming Hyundai EVs with the CCS tech starting in Q1 2025 The automaker will also make adapters available to charge NACS-equipped vehicles at CCS chargers BMW announced mid-October it will adopt NACS across all of its brands which also includes Mini and Rolls-Royce The German automaker said that owners of its EVs made with the CCS outlet will get access to Teslas network in early 2025 likely via an adapter BMW already has six pure-EVs across the three brands and is planning on a substantial electric future lineup In 2025 BMW will also start to produce its EVs with the Tesla standard built in Not long after Hyundai and BMW announced their upcoming switch to NACS Toyota announced it would do the same Beginning in 2025 Toyota and Lexus EVs will come equipped with the standard so drivers can plug into the Tesla network Customers of Toyota and Lexus EVs that come equipped with the CCS port will be able to use an adapter to charge there as well also starting in 2025 Lucid CEO Peter Rawlinson recently said hes not yet convinced about the industry-wide switch to the Tesla NACS tech but its likely the startup will eventually follow suit That means Lucid drivers have to charge at a location where CCS is readily available The Jeep-maker told Reuters in a recent statement it would evaluate a potential switch to NACS Currently non-Tesla EV drivers can plug in at an Electrify America or EVgo charger given both the vehicles and the stations are equipped to handle CCS-enabled charging Several charging companies are now planning to convert their equipment to NACS (You can keep an eye on which companies that is with this helpful tracker from consultancy EVAdoption) That means that for drivers of non-Tesla EVs built with the NACS port in the future (for many of them starting in 2025) these non-Tesla stations will also be able to accommodate them Theres a lot to keep track of in the world of EV charging But given how important charging is to an EV owners experience the space is bound to get more exciting in the coming years Are you a non-Tesla EV owner? Are you planning to use the adapter to be able to charge at Tesla stations starting next year? Do you wish you waited to buy your EV until after it was built with the NACS port? Do you have a tip or opinion to share?

Tesla Stock Overview” video Indeed we do not know the future Moreover a lot of companies went bankrupt after the dotcom bubble burst Lots of corporations decreased in size but stayed afloat for a while So we can safely say that Amazon was rather an exception and we should not rely on this example to say that Tesla will become the next Amazon and stay at this level for a while in my view For the sake of objectivity I must say that the corporation’s debt and liquidity position are strong The net debt has been negative since 2020 That is quite rare for a high-growth company like Tesla Interesting also is the fact that its liquidity position has been improving since then Net debt Seeking Alpha Seeking Alpha The debt-to-equity ratio is very low A “good” debt/equity ratio is less than 2 Tesla’s is just 0676 Debt-to-equity 2021 2022 2023 0967 0974 0676 Source: Prepared by the author based on Seeking Alphas data The current ratio is not ideal A good one should be about 2 But it is still above the critical level Current ratio 2021 2022 2023 138 153 173 Source: Prepared by the author based on Seeking Alphas data The working capital has also been improving for a while which is another positive of course Working capital (in dollars) 2021 2022 2023 7395 14208 20868 Source: Prepared by the author based on Seeking Alphas data However I am still skeptical of what the bulls say about Tesla Below I have presented the key bullish arguments Some of them are direct comments from a very fine article by my fellow Seeking Alpha contributor Dair Sansyzbayev I have also put some of my comments below each bullet point Tesla’s valuations are sky-high if you compare them to the sector’s medians Interestingly all of Tesla’s ratios are much higher compared to the sector’s averages The P/E ratio alone is a whopping 64 while the forward price/cash flow ratio is just over 40 So according to Seeking Alpha Tesla’s valuation grade is “F” Seeking Alpha Seeking Alpha However we can safely say that most of Tesla’s valuation ratios including the P/E and the P/S are not near their all-time highs But the P/FCF ratio is almost record high Main Street Data Main Street Data Main Street Data Main Street Data Main Street Data Main Street Data So we can say that Tesla’s stock is somewhat cheaper than it used to be but still extremely expensive compared to the sector’s medians Below I have summarized the company’s upside and downside risks My Hold rating on Tesla remains intact The company is trading at very high valuations; investors feel highly enthusiastic about the company while its profit margins are low These decreased in 2023 compared to 2022 Many stockholders assume Tesla’s innovations will turn out to be extremely profitable for the company But this might not necessarily be true After all it is hard to get the timing right However Tesla’s energy business is doing well revenues are rising and the debt position is pretty strong But in my opinion investors should not assume that Tesla Inc is the new Amazon Very few companies manage to be very successful keep growing and trade at extremely high valuations for such a long time period the way Amazon did So Amazon is rather an exception not a common story This article was written by Analyst’s Disclosure: I/we have no stock option or similar derivative position in any of the companies mentioned and no plans to initiate any such positions within the next 72 hours I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha) I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Seeking Alphas Disclosure: Past performance is no guarantee of future results No recommendation or advice is being given as to whether any investment is suitable for a particular investor Any views or opinions expressed above may not reflect those of Seeking Alpha as a whole Seeking Alpha is not a licensed securities dealer broker or US investment adviser or investment bank Our analysts are third party authors that include both professional investors and individual investors who may not be licensed or certified by any institute or regulatory body"

Or is that suddenly a human’s fault? The amounts of money thrown at generative AI from all directions are just vast And Nvidia is getting its share of the pie Nvidia’s revenues might hit $100 billion in 2024 knock on wood up from $27 billion in 2022 And it just might or might not surpass Tesla’s revenues which were already $97 billion in 2023 So we just accidently remembered that Tesla’s stock too went through these WTF spikes until it hit $41450 on November 4 2021 and then plunged 70% over the following year and was inducted into our pantheon of Imploded Stocks in December 2022 when its shares hit $123 after which they dropped some more These spikes unwind brutally Then came the big rally through mid-July 2023 and then the shares spiraled down again and today they’re down 54% from the peak in November 2021 and they’re still overvalued though Tesla has become a much bigger and a much more successful automaker since the all-time high in November 2021 Since that all-time high Tesla has become very profitable Its Model Y has become the #1 best-selling model in the world blowing away Toyota’s Corolla and it has become the #2 best-selling model in the US just behind Ford’s F-series truck And since the all-time high Tesla opened two new factories one in Germany and one in Texas and production and deliveries have soared and it’s eating market share of the legacy automakers in big gulps and despite its already substantial size its global deliveries jumped by 38% in 2023 And yet over those two years when Tesla’s business continued to boom Tesla’s market cap plunged by over $600 billion Turns out these WTF spikes are a state of mind And when that state of mind changes the spikes unwind Will Nvidia have a monopoly on AI-suitable GPU systems? Will no one figure out how to make something competitive and sell it a lower price? And will Meta a gigantic customer of Nvidia’s GPU systems suddenly discover that it has all the GPUs it’ll need just like it had suddenly discovered that it had way too much office space and way too many employees? Companies are kind of weird in what they suddenly discover All kinds of things can change that might rattle that overstretched state of mind – same thing that Tesla went through to get off its WTF spike Enjoy reading WOLF STREET and want to support it?

Sign up here Tags:Tesla Email to a friend Today let’s take stock in the crazy good that generative AI is brining to bear but let’s not forget the vast downside that’s coming Whether it’s the racial bias being programmed into Gemini the eventual collision course of massive job loses or the eventual sentient AI that will rise up at some point we’re watching the beginning of the end Today people are making boat loads of money Not too far down the road the other side rears its ugly head And during the in between time I’m sure that AI will do some amazing things probably contributing greatly to all sorts of medical advancements No irony in that AI could eliminate tons of BS jobs(or where a solid portion of a necessary job is BS) but we have built a society mostly around those which are not essential by definition but just so people can survive and pay rent put food on the table and so on Just another leap in productivity where mostly the wealthy will benefit AI will create Millions of new jobs! Not one person employed currently will become unemployed AI is here to “assist” workers become more “productive” Very comforting bedtime story No Chicken Little story this AI I say Mother Goose’s soothing voice becalms everyone that that sky is not falling But History reveals’ a story with more unsettling disruptive episodes plot line twists Whenever mechanization took place in industry in the short term after the new technology was adopted workers became displaced at times in large numbers Steam engine powered ships – what happened to the large force of “sailors” who tended the sails; fixed them; made the masts; sewed the sail? Yep… their numbers increased exponentially after steam engines turned the propellers and sails were tossed to the shore based ragmen many former sailors! Just kidding Diesel powered ships … Adieu Mon Amis … we do not need you or your coal shovels… Container ships … Longshoremen stevedores … “…could have been somebody… could have been a contender” Mechanized looms … Farewell artisan weavers Time to leave the Emerald Isle and head to America The stockyards are hiring if one is not aged out right Mr Carnegie? Well at least Dale lucked out and built the largest steel mill in the world at the time Horse drawn carriages … their numbers exploded exponentially every time a newer mode of public transportation became adopted PBX telephone systems … Hello Hello Operator!! Long Distance? Good Bye switchboard Operators… Good Bye Receptionists … we right sized the company It was fun having you during last 40 or so years Railroad trains… subways…buses…trams…etc In fact yesterday I was delayed 3 hours by extreme traffic congestion of horse drawn carriages on the way to the office Hordes mules donkeys carriages – more reasons to defy my Boss and WFH The steel tycoon was Andrew Carnegie Dale was the author of “How to Win Friends and Influence People” among other self-help bestsellers Thanks BC Good commentary and retrospective If productivity gains always led to dispersed wealth and societal benefit I don’t think wealth concentration would be at all-time highs today Productivity gains are great but they need to be accompanied by progressive tax rates worker rights (unions) enforceable anti-trust competition policy etc to be of larger societal benefit Today’s taxing and governance systems are woefully inadequate in the face of AI We haven’t had much productivity gain the past 30 years yet look at the huge increase in wealth concentration during that time frame Future productivity gains from AI will be disastrous to society if governance systems aren’t improved Just like… The Telegraph displaced the Pony Express The Telephone displaced the Telegraph The Internet displaced the Telephone Jobs will be lost Jobs will be gained Yes but… More people used Telegraphs than the Pony Express More used Telephones than Telegraphs More used the Internet than ever had Telephones Jobs were created by demand for the new that outpaced the loss of jobs of the old As populations stagnate or decline that demand is not available to outpace the loss of the old Countries will be going though a right-sizing due to not enough people Hopefully America can remain a place where people want to be and we avoid the need to right-size AI is an opportunity to make that right-sizing more graceful for those that remain Hundreds of billions of dollars have been invested in name of AI However if AI had really earned even a single billion dollar worth of business you would be seeing big layoffs of unnecessary staff Clearly it’s not happening based on unemployment numbers So it looks like more human time is going into building AI models and training it than the time AI is saving via automation Please note that thanks to pure stupid accounting standards companies can book Billions of revenues of future unconfirmed orders that are conditional to AI becoming useful So either you will see unemployment numbers explode due to use of AI or you will see this ponzi scheme crash the stock price For now it looks like Magnificent 7 have gone on hiring and spending spree thanks to bubble stock pricing Let’s recall the dot com bubble Companies bought a ton of computer hardware because of the POSSIBILITY of a crash situation when the clocks turned to 2000 It was all based on fear and speculation When nothing much happened suddenly hardware sales crashed back to reality AI looks like the same thing Companies are spending billions buying GPUs and software bulking up on tech staff It’s based on the fear of missing out or having your competitors leave you behind Most likely AI will amount to very little or it will actually increase business costs If so there will be a reconing for hardware sales when they all breathe a sigh of relief and go back to doing business as usual H And it isn’t really “companies” – it is a tiny handful of flush “Mag 7” companies pouring oceans of cash for Nvidia chips So we have a tight little coterie of companies with tightly linked “fortunes” If Microsoft or FacebookMeta have a crappy biz year (Meta anyone?) or wake up from an overly hyped biz delusion (Meta anyone?) then that oceanic flow of cash to Nvidia…stops This is practically the perfect cascade failure set-up…interlocking delusions among a tiny group of interlocked companies huffing each other’s carbon dioxide No one has ever made me understand the significance of Bitcoin except for speculation and mania Same with AI Brant At least in the abstract the point of Altcoins is to provide an escape hatch away from infinitely dilutable fiat currencies controlled by the usual pathological political types (ie endless printing to “fix” endless G debt) In practice a lot of potential risks…but at least some operational progress (at least for Bitcoin…and perhaps for future follow-ons tied to a diversified set of real utility assets) AI in the abstract too could have significant value…but the difference here is that the actual operational progress seems vastly overhyped (at a suspicious time when the equity markets need the “next new hazy thing” to justify huge overvaluations) AI progress has been overhyped *multiple times* over many decades…and again this time there is a lot more “golly just imagine” relative to “how” (it supposedly works) I’m genuinely curious what is the 5-step revenue recognition process under ASC 606 or IFRS 15 that companies have come up with (and had auditors sign off on) to record revenue as you stated? I would be interested to know how companies are booking billions in revenue on unconfirmed orders as you state AI should be seen as a person In that sense AI has skills and those skills are of varying levels Lets say that AI is used as a computer code writer Its not likely going to be your best code writer But having a second code writer can get significantly more done I’ve seen AI increase productivity or top tier coders and actually enable the uninitiated to write usable code I’ve heard the same is happening in Finance There are many accounting function that can be automated It will still be some time before that automation moves from a second pair of eyes to the only eyes watching your books Today making boatloads of money? Yes Tomorrow too if one has the courage and capital to take option positions for NVDA to drop as it likely to do so – question is when Institutional trader will make huge profits Iddy biddy retail investors will lose their boxer shorts and tong bikinis whether invested directly or indirectly via IRA 401K’s Let me spin you a tale of option trades I bought long dated call options on a stock that I was certain was undervalued (it was and still is) I sat on the leaps for 2 years and lost about 50% on them the stock moved 1 month later well above my strike price and would have netted me about a double in my option investment… my point is that being right on price and being right on the time for the market to recognize it is very difficult to pull off (If you care I still made money because I also went long the equity which doesn’t expire) Recently I’ve been reading about some of NVIDIAs clients making these H100 GPU purchases for “AI” one of the standouts is a company that used to be the “American Cannabis Company” which apparently provided “consulting” to weed growers prior to that the company was a “Media Production Company” producing interactive content in Brazil Now this canabis formerly media production company is merging with Hyperscale Nexus to provide “data center services” They signed some kind of deal with a Singapore company to lease 30000 H100 GPUs these GPUs cost something like $40000 each so that would be $12B in purchases for NVIDIA What’s curious aside from a Cannabis Company buying 12B worth of hardware is that Hyperscale Nexus the datacenter Company has 0 employees as far as I’ve been able to read So the question is why does anyone need this company to purchase 12B worth of gear for them when they have 0 employees and likely nowhere near $12B to spend LOL are they just fronting for Chinese companies to skirt sanctions? I’m not smart enough to figure it out but I hope someone here is You can look these company names up yourself if you’re curious “So the question is why does anyone need this company to purchase 12B worth of gear for them when they have 0 employees and likely nowhere near $12B to spend LOL are they just fronting for Chinese companies to skirt sanctions? ” This is a very interesting observation False overseas invoicing has long been used by Chinese wealth holders to evade CCP capital controls and get their wealth out the hell from under CCP control Anytime a seemingly nonsensical transaction is taking place it is worth asking if it is simply a front for Chinese capital flight Generative AI is not the end of the world- it’s a parlor trick- trained on human inputs It’s an enabler and perhaps a productivity enhancer as an example my son is a software engineer working on this for a large large large AI software company- he’s on the front lines- this is how he uses it So it will likely mean rather than needing 10k engineers they only need 7k In this way it’s no different than any other Industrial/information Revolution invention At some point the military will automate killing via an AI and THAT might be the end of the world I am glad someone mentioned this It’s here understanding how to use it will make it worth using I do automation for alot of my work my next step is turning prompts into automation action This won’t cut jobs because as the company is large in size 2 things happen 1 They pile more work onto a more expensive employee high skilled 2 They split a high skilled task into 2 parts and hire 2 low skilled employees If you have a high skilled employee then you have automation you’re more inclined to hire more higher skilled employees because you are scaling the model of sucess Pablo – inferred in an Economist article of a few years ago: ‘The Advent of the Slaughterbots’ (At the time commenting in part on the novel ‘new’ tactical use of drones by the Azerbaijanis to decimate Armenian armored forces…) may we all find a better day I really love that “DEEP Neural Networks” image Ya think AI came up with that one Guess What or just a run of the mill creepy salesman/hustler? You know one thing IS CERTAIN This AI creature is providing Wolf with good Lewis Carroll type material for (of all things) Financial articles I think he owes it a couple kilowatts wherever it is It’s definitely a mania (unless it really is different this time and earnings EXPLODE upward and stay there) The translation to that is not apparent (or in sight) “[A] a permanently high plateau” – a classic Irving Fisher 1929! 1929… nahhh … this time is different! Until it is not Esoteric comment earnings may explode upward but then go downward since consumers without a job won’t be able to buy much If one was a gambler the question might be: Will there be one more WTF like with TSLA? The entire AI ‘thing’ reminds me of dot coms/blockchains/etc Way way over blown with sorrows to come Many thanks to our host for all the informative charts AI is certainly being used as a talking point from tech companies as something to try and build hype and ride it and Nvidia is benefiting from this in a disproportionate way but not entirely without warrant due to the ability of their products to address the type of computing that is happening currently AI itself is neither overblown nor a short term trend It’s been affecting markets businesses sciences and all sorts of industries for a long time now in a completely indispensable way and the current hype around generative AI rather undersells just where we are in the development of it all rather than overstates anything That’s where it gets difficult to judge anything with Nvidia Long term the only thing I can think to look out for would be competition either regarding other businesses with out performing products or from a mathematical/scientific perspective that might negate the effectiveness of GPUs to solve the problems that need to be solved compared to some other type of computing product Short term this current WTF spike is eye raising and I wouldn’t hold my breath it lasts like this without a sizable correction “AI itself is neither overblown nor a short term trend” Apart from of course that it isn’t AI Agreed…it is AAI (Artificial Artificial Intelligence)…as in artificially inflated by hype starved “journalists”…again It is difficult to compare TSLA to NVDA NVDA has a history of making profits by supplying chips for gaming and now AI TSLA has a lot of debt and made money by selling emissions credits No matter what you call TSLA it primary is to manufacture and sell EV automobiles “TSLA has a lot of debt” No Tesla has relatively little debt ($27 billion) but sits on $30 billion in cash And in recent years it has financed its factory construction out of operating cashflow instead of borrowing There is a big difference between the two; Tesla is a designer software company and a manufacturer (among other things); Nvidia is a designer and software company (among other things) but someone else manufactures its products Yes Tesla made some money from emissions credits (paid for by automakers that don’t build EVs etc) around the world; but it makes a lot more money from selling cars And chip makers are going to get $60 billion from the government to build factories in the US Not sure if Nvidia is going to get any of it I played cards this week with a lady who bought Nvidia in 2020 so she’s quite happy right now I asked her if she will sell a portion to lock in some of those gains Nope she’s letting it all ride The chip makers are notoriously unstable in their levels of prosperity: Nvidia may look good this decade but long term it’s anybody’s guess who will be AI chip supplier to the world Nvidia isn’t a foundry They are a designer Worth repeating here: If people regard Nvidia only as a chip company that is their first mistake a sign that their knowledge about the company is superficial They are primarily a software company that just happen to make the best chips which are assembled into SYSTEMS that only they have which can be designed to tinker in any field Oh and they also look like their slowly morphing into a CSP that will generate recurring SaaS from leasing their systems and software stack While expensive not exactly outrageous with 55% net margins Forward PE = MSFT A friend of mine in the Reserves did the same thing back in the early 2000s with Nortel He had been a Nortel engineer in the early 90s when it was just a small phone company and had been given stock in his retirement portfolio (not even six-figures worth) Then it exploded in value to being worth a couple of million He had another Reserve officer in our unit as his broker and the broker BEGGED him to bank some profits He didn’t do it and rode it all the way to the bottom My rule of thumb on moonshot stocks is to sell it in quarters (or thirds depending on how fast a stock rises) The first quarter is sold when it will get you to break even… now you are gambling with house money The next quarter gets sold on the first real dip The next quarter gets sold as price growth slows The last quarter NEVER gets sold unless you think it is totally played out (although another way to do that is to divide the last quarter into a new set of thirds or quarters) Sadly I have never followed my own advice to the end… Had friend who worked for Nortel around this same time He briefly was worth 40 million in stock options It ended up being about 250K instead At a Christmas get-together a group of relatives was speculating about what Nortel stock would be going to; I think it was in the ’50s at that time Everyone except me predicted lofty numbers; I said 2 bucks I was dismissed with The Look Sometime later I had to listen to their agonizing about how their savings plans had been decimated Happy1’s comments always make me cry “If you don’t book your profits someone else will” Tell her if it’s a double sell half Then she can let the rest ride All these eventually blow up Yes market cap is astronomical but what would have more sense is if you compared PEG or even PE (forward 12 month) The mania maybe in orders being placed in last 6 months and maybe for another 3-4 quarters as well but in terns of FCF multiple PE multiple (forward) or PEG (forward) its a flatline for NVIDIA Same couldn’t havebeen said about Tesla multiples Anything “forward” is fiction and part of the “state of mind” of a stock price That’s pure bull$hit Correct I just didn’t want to call it “bull$hit” so I called it “fiction” 🤣 No it’s not Companies often have rosy projections that don’t line up with reality So say as an example a company’s “forward projections” are that the company will have annual earnings of $5 billion the following year So investors will hear them say that this is a forward PE of let’s say 26 Then along the way the company will quietly revise its projected earnings to $2 billion which would be a P/E of 65 Not so good anymore! But the financial media which does nothing more than cheerlead for the stock market will never say “Ahh Company X projected earnings of $5 billion which they’ve reduced by 60%!” Instead when the company reports earnings of $24 billion while the analysts were “expecting” the $2 billion they quietly revised it to they’ll scream loudly about the earnings “beat” even though the $24 billion is less than half of the original $5 billion that served as the basis for the forward P/E of 26 It’s a pathetic criminal game that no one should still be falling for Wolf is always the voice of reason that’s why I read his articles Selling covered calls on NVIDIA… Yes Forward is speculation prediction crystal ball gazing or as Wolf said…fiction GPU’s are not steady state The key to AI is speed and when faster GPUs come out the heavy hitters will upgrade Nope Do your homework The speed improvement vs price is a major disappointment NVDA has been good in pricing it’s products according to market mechanisms but their GPUs have not imrpoved that much Just research the throughput of their graphics cards (eg see tomshardwarecom which has an excellent list of all GPUs going back over 15 years) It used to be that with newer GPUs the price of the newer would take the price of previous generation and previous would drop in price according to their relative lower performance Instaed the older keep their price and the newer are priced at even a premium in their performance difference That may be good sales business but it also is the end of the price performance improvement cycle that warrent upgrades to newer products The datacenters now buying will keep what they have and not spend or retire older products or at least not very fast We have seen similar behaviour at Intel when they no longer could keep up with Moore’s law Apple is now hitting the iphone sales glut because upgrades do not have that big benefit to justify the expense Same with their macbooks and ipads no longer you need to upgrade but that 5 year old thing easily can do for another few years There was an interesting comment ‘fear of missing out’’ would push things further up another 16000% increase why not But the little detail is that the company already is reaching the valuation maximum and going to $320T value from current $2T unlikely More likely is a continuation of BS from the so called ‘free’ financial news sources like yahoo finance marketwatch to the gullible to urge them to buy what they are currently trying to sell at ridiculous price levels We had the ponzi fake gold coin crypto cycle and clearly this NVDA pumping is just another of those schemes Only difference is that we now have some value in the underlying company (nothing negative on them and product) but their share price is just another ponzi scheme unfolding before our eyes Yep I added more memory to my 15 YO laptop Software is much more bloated now The computer would run out of memory with only a few browser windows open Now it opens many more making it a useful computer again The *old/slow CPU rarely matters The big buyers/players will all build data-centre AI specific ASICs if this stuff really takes off It’ll be open season in the AI space shortly if it takes off properly Nvidia had a head start with parallel processing optimised GPUs and their fairly broad programming flexibility But once Google and MS etc know exactly what they need they’ll build specifically for it Nvidia likely won’t capitalise on their advantageous position now Too much risk and “why do xyz when we’re selling loads of UVW for the next few quarters?” Who knows The future of AI might come along but not even be on silicon… it might be done in chimp brains with teslas neuralink… bullish chimp breeders! AI applications are boundless Does this mean the big CSPs will design and build boundless ASIC chip designs that need to be different for every application? That is the very definition of ASIC Not to mention the fact this not their wheelhouse Plowing money into R&D for improved variations in perpetuity is another drawback AI applications are bounded in this case by being NNs There is a good chance some novel computing or programming advancement makes the GPU AI NN model out-moded in a moment Just look how 3dfx succumbed to Nvidia doing almost exactly the “same thing” in 3D graphics 25 years ago You don’t even need a big difference in deliverable output (in that case rendering 3D gfx) in a market with much smaller value at that time to see a big disrupter emerge/dominate There are at current valuations trillions of dollars on the table To think no one will try disrupt this market or specialise to gain percentage points of advantage is wishful thinking shirley? Usually and Super – copy that? may we all find a better day Generative AI works by running a huge number of GPUs in parallel each processing a small amount of information Because each is processing a small amount of information they don’t have to be particularly fast They are all also interconnected sending their outputs to each other which is what NVidia brings to the table (among some more esoteric applications) Speed improvements necessarily come from software improvements riding on top of the application Google’s latest gen ai app blows away everyone else’s in speed Two thoughts: A friend of mine once said “figure out which way the horse is running and ride it” That has always worked well for me in my stock investing I have a Ford F-150 and a Toyota Corolla I guess I need to trade in the Corolla for a Tesla Model Y to be stay with the top two vehicles :) In the US the Corolla wasn’t the top-selling car; the Camry was And the other bands’ pickups and SUVs have outsold the Corolla also So you already missed the boat 🤣 But it might be a good idea to hang on to your Corolla until it starts giving you problems Wonder if it will be like Intel I was there in the 90s during the every 18 months stock split and rise and then suddenly it missed the mobile market and didn’t see the sub $1000 laptop ever being possible Now there are just commodities and while profitable it is nothing like before Don’t see how this future would be different once the AI boom and bust is complete with winners and losers Don’t think AI boom will be same as com but never thought FB could make it as stock so what do I know?! What one man can do another man can do equally or better – very old but relevant observation proven true countless time NVDA not likely to escape it BTW … how many of the mighty industrial companies that composed the DJIA index on May 26 1896 its forming day are still in existence? The “Original 12” Companies THE MIGHTY 12… American Cotton Oil American Sugar American Tobacco Chicago Gas Distilling & Cattle Feeding General Electric Laclede Gas National Lead North American Tennessee Coal and Iron US Leather US Rubber Motley Fool has an article that says all but one have morphed (GE is the only one left in original name) but also that all but one are still around in some form Google used to do AI on GPUs They’re now running (at least) 3rd generation T(ensor)PUs they’ve designed and produced themselves These chips are cheaper and use less power per operation because they’re highly specialized Meta will certainly go the same way eventually and some company will start selling the same to be used instead of GPUs for AI If Nvidia management is smart it’ll be them – better to canabalize your own business than have someone else do it For most companies it’s likely cheaper to run your AI work on Google TPU Clusters than they to manage the hardware yourself Nvda has earnings and a decent PE to the growth potential while tsla did not! Like it or not companies and countries are being forced into AI or they will be outa biz! I have to agree AI is something that has no real limiting principle in terms of long-term adaptation There is no “top” to knowledge work That doesn’t mean you can’t have bubble in practice AI will probably not replace human judgment and thinking power but the potential is absurdly high This bubble has distance to run Compare this to electric vehicles There is an obvious ceiling to EV demand and it is well less than total world market vehicles which is a mature and even declining market in many parts of the world The Tesla bubble never even made theoretical sense There is a top to it Current demand for “thoughtful” output is largely fulfilled To fill more of it you need more demand But if all your employees who did thoughtful work are displaced by AI the economy will shrink as half the population won’t have jobs So there is a very clear top to AI demand/output Sufficient to displace some jobs but create sufficiently more to not hurt overall demand for AI thinking… which erm largely means the ‘value’ of AI is what it can add to GDP? Nvidia $15Tn boost in market cap alone is already a hefty global gdp boost expectation never mind ARM TSMC MS etc Nicely put and thought-provoking The revenues of one company are somebody else’s expense When productivity grows less than 2% per year it’s largely a zero-sum game Wealth inequality is already setting records Will productivity gains be allowed to enrich the top players even more? It seems AI won’t work without massive corporate tax increases or other distributions to the working class KL/Bobber – “…I love being in business it’s just the necessity for customers I can’t stand…” may we all find a better day AI companies can buy advertising developed by AI companies to sell to AI companies And the increased buying and selling will send GDP through the roof And if it slows down for some reason the government can just print some money and fire it right up again A true utopia Can’t wait Will we get the fireworks on the house as well? Classic! What the Fed hath wrought: assets no longer have a value They have a price and is so well put in this piece’s subtitle those prices are a “state of mind” (I’m gonna borrow that Wolf)! Eventually actual valuation will matter ‘Til then capital flows simply swamp fundamental anything For optimal AI power you need AI software and the only company that has the cutting edge software to drive AI is NVDA with its CUDA operating system Think msft for the x86 architecture Yes AMD is working on open source sftw but they are a far second place and have a small slice of the market This is not a fad and is the first innings of a teck leap forward Since it is the first inning there will be misteps but they will be fixed and more powerful and useful application will be incorporated! I write in CUDA It’s just a constrained language that reuses a C compiler and provides some globally accessible facilities It’s not an OS An OS manages files All nVidia code is embedded It’s like putting a program in a place in memory and then telling 2048 little calculators to run it Thank you Jeff I imagine we’re just a few good code libraries away from seeing Nvidia’s competitive moat erased Nvidia has always been stronger in software than their competitors but how long can that last in the current environment? Not long I would guess The only questions in my mind is how fast will enterprise adopt new frameworks how fast will frameworks adopt new libraries etc Wolf of course there are risks INTC had a lock on the desktop and server market and they got complacent and failed to inovate and AMD seized the opportunity however unlike NVDA they didn’t own the Windows OS like NVDA has with CUDA Right now China says they have the accel chip that is superiour for AI but it’s all talk right now Right now NVDA is the 800 lb gorilla that controls the banana plantation and the monkeys will need to step up their game to steal more than a few bananas If you notice NVDA is investing in dozens of AI startups and opened its teck dept to work with data centres that want to produce their own chips They are also developing other infrastructure gear that AI stacks need which is putting pressure on Broadcom and Marvel Huang’s actions says he’s more than 2 steps ahead of the competition– afterall Huang put NVDA to work on AI many years ago before anyone had heard of AI Sorry to tell you: Work on AI is already 40-50 years old Ever heard of lisp prolog; Inference Corp Quintus? And before that concepts like cellular automata are from the ‘60 so 60 year ago No NVDA got a headstart thanks to computer graphics requiring massive parallel processing pipelines Intel also got in the game but each time f$cked up by bloating everything at cost of that paralellism AMD also in the graphics did not make that mistake but they are the worst towards their own profit making a mistake nvda wisely did not Nvda is showing signs of hitting limits performance improvements no longer appear as much as used to be and they are now following Intel’s sales model that older processors no longer are sold for less but newer are just more expensive relational to their improvement That will work great until you hit saturation And regarding they have now money to invest in other startups: no they do not You confuse the market cap of the company with working capital Yes they will be able much easier to buy other companies while paying with their immensely overvalued stock But once that happens part of that stock will be sold and the house of bid up stock price will come crashing down And regarding buying startups there are many other buyers with extremely deep pockets and cash they have no idea where to put it I strongly believe that you believe strongly They said the same about Cisco in 1999 Know a guy in Europe who’s become a millionaire from a 3 x long bet on Nvidia since just before Covid He loves AI mania He’s now got a US flag on the wall in his kitchen What has he produced in life? Thanks Depth for giving me the right frame of mind when I read these kind of stories and sometimes wish it was me I know its the completely wrong thing to want but always need/welcome a reminder Just chose your pill you can swallow and sleep well: 1 Bet On NVIDIA or 2 Bet on semis (SOXX) or 3 Bet on Technology sector (VGT) or 4 Bet on S&P 500 (SPY) or 5 Bet on Total Market (VTI) or 6 Bet on world (VT) or 7 Throw some bonds… etc #1 Should not be the answer for most (including me) But some would get NFTs go figure Disclaimers: Many many years ago I did my Masters degree in SW in AI neural networks And I respect the technology Many years ago I spent time with blockchain and BTC from technology side My conclusions were: CRAP! So where are you now? Where investment wise or technology? I do mixture of 2-5 Chips have been cyclical they used to be But history does not have to repeat itself for this There is a risk of (major?) corrections in the short-mid term But for the long term chips (or equivalent) will power the future economy including VR/AR and this is my bet I don’t bother much with timing (just having OK the entry point and hold) Just having enough extra margins/buffers makes me quite at peace Why I don’t hold NVDA directly? Just not feeling like I need the rollercoaster ride because I don’t have to In few years competition can overtake NVDA Re Tesla: Crazy that there’s almost a negative correlation between share price & profitability NVDA frustrates me No way its worth that much But I have faith its share price will fall back to reality soon just like Wolf points out w TSLA No need to be frustrated Short nvidia or even soxx What I’m missing? The problem Is market can remain irrational long-term than you can remain solvent Stocks can stay irrational longer than a short can last Very true and I would not short NVDA I’m just a little more smart than the Fossil Michael Burry looks like LOL! But if someone is sure about “NVDA frustrates me No way it’s worth that much But I have faith its share price will fall back to reality soon just like Wolf points out w TSLA” then has to short I believe in science and logic I wanted short Tesla at 75$… “The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent” — John Maynard Keynes Is there a correlation between the gamblers bank roll and teh outcome resulting from teh roll of the dice? Curious animal that stock market … at times it discounts the present the future and even defies the law of gravity but never more than a few years I like Wolf’s phrase … “consensual hallucination” Before AI hijacked what little rationality existed on Wall Street investment pundits only humans were hallucinating With AI being implemented both humans and computers will be hallucinating It will be entertaining how Dave and Hal will eventually settle their dispute over future dominance of investment speculating practices @Biker Chique 01 are you @Biker’s wife? “With AI being implemented both humans and computers will be hallucinating” 👍😂 I work in CA government and told to cut back on all but essential expenses State is hugely dependent on capital gains so while it was flush a few years back it is in the hole until another big sell off Admittedly CA is hugely irresponsible with its money but at this point barring something unseen there will be none of like that with COVID collapse Be interesting how the next few years are navigated as each exiting governor always leaves the incoming one a deficit and this appears no different Strange a 20% correction in the markets could make California flush again in 2025 but simply would start the cycle all over again Nothing to worry about CA will; be rescued by Julie Su formerly EDD Secretary currently Acting US Secretary of Labor Under her watch CA lost possibly as much as $40 Billion to COVID unemployment fraud while inconvenienced hundreds of thousands of unemployed workers desperately short of money to pay for basic necessities through her completely inept incompetent’ style of management and leadership Well California Julie Su at least you have her to look forward to Confused on how you spend money in CA that’s not essential can you provide an example of something you could buy before but dont now Other than travel I don’t see any way to cut state expenses If I hear “AI” one more time… ai this ai that The intrest in “ai” coincided with the 2000s boom as well I keep putting “ai” in quotes because really this is still computing People keep thinking we’re going to have sentient ai These models don’t think They are based on patterns Just like the algorithms that calculate the shortest path when using Google maps to go somewhere I don’t know of anyone getting much of a huge productivity boost beyond some neat tools like summarizing meeting notes and generating the boiler plate code you need It’s a neat tool but doesn’t warrent this level of enthusiasm Wolf hit the nail on the head in terms of meta or any of these large data centers buying up graphics cards They’ll eventually make their own or a competitor will Remember Cisco in the 2000s? Wasn’t long before it was replaced by Juniper! Another point is maybe there will be a huge efficiency in these algos where the compute requirements are much less Exactly many people don’t understand the fundamental comp-sci 101 concept of weak vs strong AI A weak AI is basically machine learning that can generate things based on its own programming A strong AI is a machine that can rewrite its own code better and mold it’s “mind” own its own essentially Don’t get me wrong the current wave of “AI” systems are quite impressive but they’re not ground breaking This isn’t the point of the monkey picking up a rock and hitting another rock and making fire This is all still weak AI We’ve yet to reach the point where a machine is self-aware and can generate its own ideas and corrections without external input This is just the latest tech-bro silicon valley fleecing that’s always been going on Same as how 2-3 years ago every company was a part of the block chain Everyone threw billions at “innovative block chain technology” without even knowing what the hell that even meant I’ll give you that many jobs will likely be lost and done away with in the coming years If I was an accountant voice actor writer or something like that I’d be worried The hype of nearly every white collar job vanishing in 2 years is utter nonsense though You grossly underestimate what you’re looking at This distinction between “strong” and “weak” AI is a misunderstanding as what you write as strong AI is not what it is The better terminology that is less confusing is between specialized AI and generalized AI and for any definition of generalized AI that we for example would fall under for intelligence it’s only a matter of training a variety of specialized AI models together in an applicable domain to which we want it to function in This latest wave of chat based AI systems are actually remarkable and by and large the biggest type of specialized AI we could get for advancing a generalized AI that lay people such as yourself couldn’t argue against (as seems to be the wont) What’s coming out of large language models is wholly unexpected and training other models alongside LLMs yields remarkable results Anyone who looks at these and thinks “Oh they’re ok nothing ground breaking” doesn’t really know what they’re looking at and hasn’t taken a peak at the academic literature being generated around them It’s people seeing consumer targeted goods and assuming industry targeted goods are of the same worth having zero knowledge of the industry use Anyone comparing AI to blockchain technology is just reaffirming they don’t know what they’re looking at Blockchain was only ever going to be useful for a tiny subset of uses Specialized AI alone is changing so much as we speak that most people have no direct view of never mind what actual AI research and development is doing Not commenting on Nvidia here but scoffing at the current state of AI is almost like looking at an iPhone and thinking “this won’t last what use does this thing have” Yes I said many jobs are going to be lost I was more directing this as the crowd of people who run around saying we’ve basically created Terminator or HAL 9000 Then again I’m a truck driver surrounded by AM radio listening boomers who can’t dim the screen on their phone All I hear is how ChatGPT is about to become basically Animated Mastercomputer from I Have No Mouth and Must Scream This current artificial intelligence isn’t that This generative AI isn’t the point of singularity and it isn’t strong AI I’d call something like the invention of language invention of numbers discovery of fire printing press nuclear weapons etc as ground breaking Those are things that completely reshaped every single human life and changed the entire structure of society The singularity will cause that and possible be the biggest event in human history to that point This recent wave of AI won’t do that from what I’ve seen Granted I’m not studied on it but I think this is mostly more hype driven crap from marketing execs It’ll be big on some sectors just like buttcoins was big for pump and dump artists and scammers Just like how all those jobs of shuffling around punch cards vanished or the beehive hair ladies operating company switchboards being moved or laid off Don’t miss the forest from the trees Even 30 or so million jobs being automated away isn’t going to change the way society works globally There will be a lot of growing pains as a lot of middle class or upper class people suddenly find themselves worthless in their field and the job market but again it’s not comparable to faster than light travel or built a base on Mars NF Can you enlighten us more please? Isn’t the very soul of ai the global data base it assesses? Considering there is a great deal of bogus data out there how does ai deal with that bogus data In other words how is it expected to sort the black pepper from the fly $hit and generate useable outputs? Seriously Most entry level knowledge jobs will be eliminated in 5 to 10 years A single experienced professional can boost productivity 5x with the existing tools Management doesn’t have a clue about AI but the push is coming from the top and they only care about ‘efficiency’ and cost cutting In the coming recession AI will be used as an excuse to halve the workforce At least 40% of office jobs are BS anyway (see David Graeber) Niall – …and every one of those displaced will simply vanish into the ether their labor or custom from that labor no longer necessary yes? may we all find a better day This could be the right thread to post this Over the years reading the comments here is that the majority of commentators are averse to risks and have a “the end is near” mentality How the market behaves is the reality not much we have control over So rather than being frustrated it is better to act Instead of fearing learn expand your knowledge That would prevent you from buying the meme stocks/BTC etc in the first place I really mean it this is not a “look at me i got lucky” post People that take no risk in their lives cannot be successful One should take as much risk as they are comfortable with (aka what the worst can happen safeguards) In many forums the “panic” is self-fulfilling One’s fears grow on other frears This is not the way to live I would hate it if I had most of my $ in bonds or gold and then frustrate myself when there is no recession I refuse to live my life under constant fears I do not claim I know what happens in the future but I take calculated risks There is zero fear in holding a safe appreciating investment Your definition of success may be different “holding a safe appreciating investment” sounds like oxymoron Holders of TLT and BND could tell their story I’d be surprised if non-traders here hold TLT or BND @Biker I have not listed the name of every WS poster in Excel and sorted the list for “likes risk” “risk averse” and “risk averse with a the end is near mentality” but I don’t think that the “majority” (or even one in four) have a “the end is near mentality” (unlike on other sites I have not read about a WS poster saying that he is selling his gold to buy food and ammo to get ready for the end of civilization) Most people posting here seem to be older than average with more assets than average and only a fool would not be a little “risk averse” if they are older and already have a decent net worth (I would not recommend that a 75 year old guy sell the $5mm in stock he has in a S&P500 index fund to put it all into NVDA) Good points Thanks! Will try to have it in mind I am probably younger than average for this site – 28 I mostly hold bonds because I’m a highly strung person and I value my sanity above all else When the market is not insane (inflation is nominal and unemployment is low) I put money in the market I don’t feel nervous about it then because returns are realistic – 6-7% YoY is reasonable But when the market goes topsy-turvy it makes me nervous Thus when CD HYSA Tbill yield is so high why would I bother with a market that is going to stress me out? I would rather make less money for lower stress I was 28 years old once and did the same I’m 62 now and know without a doubt that I was wrong to have that philosophy I ended up okay but have probably 1/5th of what I could have had That is assuming the next 40 years will be like the ones you lived through My bet is they won’t be I have rarely heard any commenters on this site talk about gold guns ammo and beans That is ZH stuff (which is sometimes an amusing site) People ask me why don’t I take on more risk I tell them because I don’t have to Risk-taking is for people trying to make their pile Once you have made it risk-taking just to make more seems almost stupid That makes a lot of sense to me If you’ve reached your goals then be grateful for your good fortune and enjoy your life Biker- “The weeping philosopher too often impairs his eyesight by his woe and becomes unable from his tears to see the remedies for the evils which he deplores” — Charles Mackay Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds Nice! Was reading something about how this crazy bubble with Nvidia is very similar to Cisco before it imploded and never got back to its all time high Both companies have strong profit and revenue but that didn’t stop the fact that the bubble still popped I am sure Nvidia fanboy will say this time is different Once again it’s funny to see this kind of insanity in a supposedly tightening financial condition QT environment… good luck to Pow Pow on fighting them inflation A lot of the apps for AI seem just like dog work eg scanning resumes looking for the magic words or phrases Bet ‘AI’ itself will be one No doubt this is just for screening because anyone who hires via AI alone is in for some nasty shocks The other app getting attention is manipulating images and sounds including voices to create alternate ‘realities’: Many will be criminal using fake videos or voices to defraud Others will create great entertainment Maybe Elvis’s movie career has just begun subject to legal issues No doubt there are real and useful apps This differs from another darling where the hype is pure: Bitcoin There is only one actual use for BC: ‘ransomware’ The ransom is perhaps the ONLY transaction where the payer has to trust the payee and where there is no third party handling and verifying the payment And no rush because all the victim can do is hope The theoretical max speed of BC is six transactions per second laughable as a medium of exchange aka ‘money’ A day or so ago a DB market analyst noted that the US tech markets are the most concentrated since 1929 The one day 250 billion bump in NV looks like the high water mark Ransomware is not the only use Just one of a number of criminal activities To be clear Criminal activity is the only use Also to be clear politicians love BTC because of that feature Nothing like an anonymous method of executing this kind of behavior Look at the Senator who is on the ropes for illegal payments using gold as an example No politician is going down that road again now that BtC has been found useful This is also the only reason politicians have not legislated it to be a fraud Bitcoin and crypto in general is readily trackable That’s what the blockchain does (gross simplified) Every transaction including theft and/or remuneration for criminal activity is traceable to a specific coin or fraction thereof and that ledger entry follows said coin in perpetuity When the rogue agent converts crypto to fiat they’re outed in the real world assuming law enforcement is interested True anonymity only exists with cash (my preference) or in a cyrpto-only economy which is not something we have to worry about in the short term Plenty of problems with crypto but anonymity ain’t one of them – yet I guess I don’t understand how a crypto -only economy could be anonymous if the blockchain address is tied to a transaction and specific quantity with timestamp in a public ledger Or why a more durable money like physical gold bought for cash is not anonymous if it’s a private transaction in person with your trusted coin dealer Selling is just as discreet as those involved I think that most governments have few objections to financial speculation in crypto because it’s relatively easy for them to keep an eye on it and tax the profits If there are no alternatives money can be whatever the One World Government decides it is Globalism isn’t doing so well for good or ill I must have made a lot of multimillionaires anyone who read ant of my comments back in August 2015 and never sold I put it on youtube Usenet and various blogs I also parlayed Nvidia (bought at $20) onto AMD at $120 and $625 Trump’s trade war with China cost me millions on that parlay I was out at $80 on AMD Hmmm – all the AI bubble hype is hard to believe but under sober consideration AI is amplifying winner-take-all dynamics that always exist in markets and even more so in the digital economy We see the S&P 500 narrowing down to the Mag 7 then narrowing down to the Mag 2 until NVDA even leaves META in the dust? The narrowing of markets cause these euphoric bubbles based on beliefs rather than reality as price multiples expand due to exuberance and FOMO but the process will continue on steroids until it breaks That requires some kind of breakdown in liquidity and a reality check Big Data tech companies can actually boost productivity and stock prices by shedding employees made redundant by AI so the tech layoffs are not necessarily bad for earnings and stocks prices I suspect that’s why market action is flowing in their direction I guess one needs to see small and midcaps advance to confirm any of this bubble mania but the Fed and UST seem determined to keep it flowing > Big Data tech companies can actually boost productivity and stock prices by shedding employees made redundant by AI so the tech layoffs are not necessarily bad for earnings and stocks prices Just want to push back on this while layoffs are happening these companies are generally not contracting They’re laying people off but then hiring more people a few months later I don’t really think that’s indicative of AI induced layoffs unless your read is that they’re laying people off in favor of AI and then finding out that AI isn’t good enough It’s highly unlikely that the layoffs were done “in favor of AI” and then that experiment was found to be a failure in a matter of weeks Corporate reshuffling happens all the time and as WR has noted the highly public layoffs were a good way to remind folks that management still has some leverage in the fights over pay WFH etc I am someone who works in the chip industry and can tell you more and more competition for nvda is coming As wR said forward guidance is pipe dream which may or may not materialize Exactly I posted this in another thread: “Third and while this is somewhat dependent on market forces and the competition from other chip makers but I’m skeptical that NVidia will be able to maintain its enormous profit margins (75%?! or so) going forward Look at Tesla While they have expanded their market share enormously they had to reduce their prices (and thus their margins) significantly to do that” Nature abhors a vacuum The nature of the free market means that grotesque margins won’t survive long term not unless the government puts its hand on the scale somehow I agree that NVDA is a bubble but Tesla isn’t remotely comparable during the peak of the Tesla bubble it was unprofitable and there isn’t anything unique about Tesla that a motivated competitor can’t copy in short order (see BYD) At least NVDA is profitable (enormously) and has a short-term position in AI that will take a few years for competitors to match Still way overvalued of course What goes up hard and fast comes down harder and faster NVDa sells to the mag 7 Will they keep spending at this rate for the coming quarters Chips are cyclical Will NVDa growth be at 265 percent or greater from this quarter ? Watch for the negative divergences There be bag holders and muppets to come As I recall this: “NVDa sells to the mag 7” was a feature during the com ascent Internet companies were buying out others investing in others based on their inflated valuations Same with the S & L collapse: real estate was being jacked-up with daisy-chain appraisals Similar to the lead-up to the housing collapse in 2008 When Cathie Wood was asked to justify Tesla’s insane valuation she gave an answer that implied that they would own a majority or even nearly all of the entire automotive industry in the future The reality was that they would eventually face competent competition The current Nvidia valuations assume that the hardware needs of the future growth of AI will all land in Nvidia’s pockets Even the possibility that Nvidia will face competent competition in the future doesn’t seem to be priced in Google builds AI chips in-house (https://cloudgooglecom/tpu) and if Nvidia chips start being expensive or difficult enough to acquire that will motivate various players in the AI software stack to integrate with AMD ROCm At the peak of the craziness in 2021 the “market” was pricing in that every car on earth would be made by Tesla every person on earth would do nothing for entertainment but use Facebook every person on earth would get all exercise on a Peloton and every person on earth would eat nothing but Beyond Burgers “meat” Ha ha so true! Does Nvidias positive results suggest anything about the effectiveness of US tech sanctions to prevent shipments to China ? Has China’s Nvidia market disappeared with enough non-China demand to make up the difference or is China still getting Nvidia product by other means ? The fact is NVDA has a market cap of 2 trillion without the current or future sales to back up the value unless something changes then all bets are off Thank goodness NVDA is a USA company ! DM: WARNERBROSDISCOVERY shares plunge 10% as company bleeds… DM: PARAMOUNT put on negative watch… The commercial real estate markets are slumping residential real estate markets are stagnate and look to roll over reverse splits everywhere the fed is ongoing with QT And the markets are at all time highs? Now that’s a big WTF Im scratching my noodle trying to figure out where is all this pent up liquidity still coming in from? Did the fed just pull another tool out of its tool box kind of a ‘hide the peperoni’ moment or has the PPT suddenly arrived to the scene with its tools to? Haven’t heard much from the presidents working group lately formerly called the plunge protection team… But im sure they got a big ear to the curb here I remember when reagan first came out with the ppt in 1988 just after that 1987 crash I think it was presidential order 12631 under reagan if memory serves But you can bet your bippy something is cookin in these parts “Now that’s a big WTF Im scratching my noodle trying to figure out where is all this pent up liquidity still coming in from?” Yes it does seem weird but setting aside IPOs and buybacks it’s just a circular flow For every buyer putting in cash there’s a seller taking the same amount out What moves prices is the relative eagerness of buyers vs sellers In other words is it mostly the offer being taken out or the bid being hit? About the only complicating factor is that the use of leverage tends to rise along with the price which creates inherent fragility As Wolf puts it: “Turns out these WTF spikes are a state of mind And when that state of mind changes the spikes unwind” By end of year Nvidia could have between $80-$90 billion in cash depending on what they do with net income That is Apple type money without the debt They officially have very deep pockets now I can see how future demand might be an issue competition is not Competition would definitely be an issue It’s a matter of time Tesla thought the same about no Competition The dotcom bubble was popped by Greenspan It was designed to be popped Greenspan injected too many excess reserves into the banking system in preparation for Y2K Then he had to wash them out But Greenspan didn’t learn from his mistake “Black Monday” Likewise Powell has increased reserves by the draining of the O/N RRP facility The increase in liquidity has been associated with a rising stock market Between November 2020 and October 2022 Nvidia shares plunged by 65% Wolf I think you mean November 2021 going by the graph It went up in 2020 Yes typo thanks 2020 should be 2021 Fixed When I was a kid I remember the run that video game systems had Every 2-3 years a new one came out the made all the old ones entirely worthless Then eventually the hardware surpassed the software and now you could play just about any game on a 5-10 year old gaming console (or even a phone for some) But during that run a $300 gaming system would be worthless when the new generation came out and everyone would run out to go upgrade This is what’s happening with NVIDIA but instead of a $300 Xbox they make $30000 H100 GPUs Much cheaper specialized inference hardware will be competing against the bloated GPUs “Startup Groq has developed an machine learning processor that it claims blows GPUs away in large language model workloads – 10x faster than an Nvidia GPU at 10 percent of the cost and needing a tenth of the electricity” MARK…are you serious re GROQ? REALLY? Have yo invested in this Co…or is this not possible now? “Turns out these WTF spikes are a state of mind And when that state of mind changes the spikes unwind” May be But seeing Tesla’s chart – 6-8 times (say $100B in 2020) in 4 years is still not bad Basically 100 to 1000 (this happens fast) and back to 400 (happens in 3-4 years) is not a bad deal Amazon was $9 at the end of dot com bust when it started its travel to the moon what specifically relates to nvidia’s stock prices in addition to market hysteria is the actual GPU chip market that they compete in supply has been constrained relative to demand which I believe will continue to grow steadily even if some investors grossly overvalue stock prices but look at nvidia’s competitors on the chip supply side for what will impact its stock price despite today’s hysteria AMD’s new chip is better and lower cost than nvidia’s they will give nvidia a run for its money It’s an interesting one If you look at Steam game platform their average user is still running nvidia gtx 1060 level graphics The pandemic market silliness messed this up further with high price rises so a great deal of possible upgrades never happened Along with console graphics performance and their market abundance most games are designed to look good at around that level of graphics power You basically can spend about $250 on your graphics card from nvidia or amd and get ‘good enough’ $500 is top end Over that is just not required in practice I can’t see how real market demand will lift in this segment while prices remain so high and generational advancements remain so low Nothing is driving the need to upgrade And in the professional gpu markets if AI really is going to take off in visual creative sectors and displace many seats (if not jobs) then the AI industry GPU sales is eating into pro GPU sales in lots of creative areas Interesting times ahead I think copyright issues and the training data issues are going to kill this phase of generative AI Most of the people who’ll lose out from generative AI (artists actors designers etc) are the ones who’ve had their work scraped or copied to make all this possible in a way that makes it all look as convincing as it does AI leaves much to be desired so far I am an expert in a very specific field When I asked ChatGPT a question concerning it it responded at pretty much a high school level and left out some very important references If you don’t expect much more from AI than Wikipedia level knowledge then I guess it is okay Maybe it will get better I turned off the Brave browser Summarizer (a kind of AI) as it was just wasting space on my monitor William Leake one should not underestimate how quickly these things get better Having built ML and AI models personally I can tell you that this is just the beginning and this technology will transform several things AI is a bubble because these changes will take time and the winners are yet unknown It is like every other technical revolution in history from canals railroad electricity locomotive internet etcLikely this will first collapse before pieces are put together and actual useful solutions are created But for now the Silicon valley hype industry is winning Few people are getting rich at the expense of everyone else So the usual stuff boring boring… I am part of an expert advisory network and often speak to financial analysts who are interesting in this technology when evaluating some tech companies And the fantasies they have built (and looking to validate) are mind blowing to say the least Will never understand why they are paid so much Aman- “… this technology will transform several things” Could you elaborate on which things you are referring to here if I’m not being too nosey? Thanks Conceptually any job that requires subjective judgment with a clear outcome can be automated using the right model Examples could include 1 Analyzing medical reports correlating with prior known illness and diagnosing likely problems 2 Administrative work of managing schedules meetings note taking etc 3 Summarizing or proof reading legal paperwork 4 Troubleshooting operational bottlenecks in supply chains and recommending course of action 5 Risk assessment in insurance portfolios etc 6 Predicting likelihood of commercial success of new media content (movies songs etc) 7 Digital interfaces and peripherals 8 Translation real time transcription (already there but better quality) 9 Tax filing audits etc In a way it will transform mid to low skill work which requires judgment and subjectivity My view is that the impact of this technology is going to be limited not by the availability of chips but availability of trained engineers to train models Hope this helps Happy to discuss further Good info Thanks Aman Wolf I know you’re following fin news in Nippon…thought you might have perhaps missed these 4 news articles in Bloomberg by Howard Chua Eoan in the OPINION section yesterday FYO (For Your Eyes Only) p: Alas I couldn’t share the screen shot! 1) Nvidia sentiment had a 7 sigma (!) spike That’s top 000…1% percentile The good news this drama started cooling down a bit on Friday 2) As an insider and many years hands-on practitioner of AI must admit GenAI is a fancy autocomplete: autocomplete words pixels voice etc No intelligence whatsoever Don’t get duped in this Investing in it you pay dollars for pennies I would never own an individual stock like NVDA because it’s well outside of my risk profile My only concern with it right now (along with other Mag7 stocks) is the extent to which it’s distorting index funds that I do own The trick is keeping AI from getting ‘inside’ your risk profile A couple of big books from a few years ago by Yuval Noah Hatari: Sapiens A Brief History of Humankind and Homo Deus I see the future of AI doing everything and as long as governments prohibit it from taking our sperm and eggs we will be relaxing getting high and having sex while the money shows up in our bank accounts I hope the future manifestation of myself enjoys it Will AI be able to do my laundry in the future or cut my grass? Probably both Your AI self-driving lawn mower will mow your lawn to perfection while you sit and watch the football game Over time it will learn to not run over your neighbor’s poodle or cat What is this worth to us? I am old enough to compare this to the internet dotcom bubble Valuations went through the roof with any company with com or E in their name Then everything crashed because the internet isn’t THAT valuable The internet is here to stay and I use it every day but the value of it in 2000 was vastly overrated AI will be with us just like the internet Rico – my concern is that it eventually develops itself to a point that it can experience boredom (oh the mischief that will ensue!)… may we all find a better day Wolf Only you could write this article brilliant Thank you Its the future reality that matters When this parabolic NVDA “bubble bursts” ( See Chart ) the consequences will cascade like domino’s spreading like wildfire thru this stock the entire AI Bubble and ultimately thru the entire hallucinatory US stock market Forewarned I recently had a “chat” with an AI driven “chat session” Asking why one of my accounts with a firm I deal with showed that it was “inactive” when I’ve paid every account subscription payment on time and without fail As confirmed by their payment history window I got a lot of chat replies on how I could become more active and several links to articles about exercise routines After again trying to clarify the question more links to “leisure activities” and “activities for seniors” arrived After 10 minutes of this and exhausted from all this I quit the chat Then come the email surveys asking me if my chat session helped me with my “inactive” status Now I’m getting ads for gyms and exercise bikes AHHHHHH!!!!! That’s funny! More and more E seems like something to deal with The promise of AI in fields where pattern recognition plays a role and in basic knowledge work like accounting and financial analysis is enormous NVDA is a bubble for sure but AI will totally transform knowledge work in 5 years “Once men turned their thinking over to machines in the hope that this would set them free But that only permitted other men with machines to enslave them” — From Frank Herbert Dune From the OC Bible in Dune: “Thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a human mind” Government and religion got involved and that was the end of AI We only need a click through prompt from Windows CoPilot to designate our AI voting proxy for the US political parties to 100% support AI Who better to decide who I should vote for than the company that knows more about me than my spouse? If you think AI is a bubble then tell the Chinese gang that they are wrong when scrambling to catch up with AI and possibly use it in military against us I don’t recall that Xi was big on blockchain In such short time “unlimited” used cases are being created daily Some of them fakes normal And the progress with the technology is very fast Blockchain after 10+ years does not have any use cases with decent meaning No progress with blockchain and never been The “progress” was about hacking around the building-in inefficiencies Not doable since the protocol is by its very nature inefficient And it MUST waste the tons of energy for validations Since the AI innovation is so fast there the growth will have some pullbacks in the sort/mid term for sure Now the financial market is tight If now would be 0% interest rates then it would be easier to call it a typical bubble My definition of bubble: Fast growth in asset value It bursts and whatever is left has not much value For investors better is wait it out In the long time span just a blip and burned eg tulip mania With AI the growth is fast (the first part) I don’t think that the rest is applicable I don’t see that one can wait it out There will be winners and losers and everyone is spending to be a winer Now NVDA is making a lot of money but the companies buying their chips need to pass the cost on to their customers Will Meta be able to charge more for every new AI ad? Do their customer have more money to spend on AI ads Will AI ads be so much better that a customer only need to buy 5 ads to be as effective as 20 Now Meta may charge more for those 5 ads but they are selling 15 less to the same customer It could be a wash in revenue? Their AI investment may just mean they are a survivor? But then again would Facebook disappear if they did have AI ads Would people quit using Facebook if Meta did not buy 350k AI chips? It will be interesting to see how this plays out Let’s say I want to buy a home blueprint Will I pay more for an AI generated blueprint over a human made blueprint No But the company that sells the AI blueprint did remove an expense of having a human architect They may see a bigger profit as long as the AI expense is less than a human Also AI may be able to generate 1000s of more blueprint designs than one human but I will still only buy one blueprint and may actually demand to pay less since it was easily built by AI Better yet what if there is an open source home blueprint AI that will create my blueprint for free? ru82 – sounds like-what was that word of recent memory? Oh yeah: ‘disruption’ (…only that things appear to be drifting towards more ‘self-disruption’…) may we all find a better day I wrote this comment in a previous thread unrelated specifically to AI and NVDA… The comments here tell me this is why there are only a few truly visionary entrepreneurs in the world who can SEE what might be possible while the VAST unwashed (like me) can only see what’s right in front of us… The possibilities of where this technology can lead is BEYOND most of us’ ability to imagine Science fiction often becomes reality over periods of time I could give examples but I’m sure most here can think back to things that seemed impossible only to become staples in day-to-day life As to AI for one example I think something along the lines of the movie “Blade Runner” and much of its futuristic tapestry is one of the eventual outcomes of an AI-infused world But it’s only one thread of many of where it might lead…But it will lead somewhere that most of us can’t imagine today The question is not if but when as technology feeds on itself and grows exponentially Petscom So-called ‘technology’ is headed to shrinking exponentially I’m assuming you are shorting it This is helpful for the market Thanks I disagree there are millions of them who can see the future the thing is there wrong and fail in equal proportion to the unwashed masses and we only learn of the winners The national security state will clamp down on Ai and that will be the end of that No way no how will they allow this to take hold and lose complete control of the narrative This is such a setup Allow the money to come in make billions and then pull the plug Anybody who complains is a traitor Perfect if using AI to help us make daily decisions is going to be a “benefit” to us I suspect AI will take those opportunities to see that we are fed even more marketing emails and texts than we get now i hope my ISP upgrades their spam filters accordingly Here’s a big problem in my opinion Stocks like NVDA may not be worth what they currently trade for but people who own them have made tons of paper wealth They are encouraged to spend more in the real economy and so the Fed thinks it is obligated to protect outrageous asset prices via lower interest rates and QE to avoid deflation in the real economy It’s another form of too-big-to-fail safety in numbers etc What starts out as a harmless speculation becomes a wealth-effect and systematic economic risk assuming joblessness and price deflation are to be avoided It’s not just NVDA It’s MSFT AAPL FB GOOG many other cash flowing stocks homes and other overpriced assets that form this systematic risk (the “everything bubble”) This wealth effect has been supported far too long Sure the Fed let some small high-flyers fail in 2021 and 2022 as well as Bitcoin but this didn’t pose a systematic threat Letting larger parts the everything bubble collapse like the NASDAQ or S&P 500 is a different matter The Fed has always come to the rescue after a significant drop in the stock market indices Given the Fed’s formal policy of annual 2% inflation the Fed must respond in the face of an overall asset price decline It’s built into policy If anyone disagrees please tell me how asset prices can suffer a meaningful decline WITHOUT triggering deflation in the real economy (ie a meaningful recession)? If it were possible I don’t think the Fed would be so careful when pursuing its soft landing The Fed seems to be accepting 3-5% inflation for many future years despite the recent three-year 20% inflationary spike That evidences a real fear of deflation in my opinion Some people might accuse me of wanting a “blow-up” when it’s really the Fed’s refusal to accept periodic cleansing recessions that promotes these blow-ups Our experiences of 2000 and 2009 were not unforeseeable events unless the long-term blinders are on Playing around with moral hazards has real consequences Continuously rising asset prices and p/e ratios are a systematic problem The Fed needs to understand that and start considering that as part of policy The Federal Reserve has nothing whatsoesvewr to do with NVIDIA or any other equities (stocks) that speculators bid up far beyond any realistically conceivable net worth and that has always been the case Fed does not want the assets to go down as they themselves are deeply invested in assets I Remember few months back Powell said financial markets are doing the job of rate hikes when stock market was down and financially conditioning were tight Now financial conditions are much loose woupd Powell come out and say financial conditions are not helping feds cause ? “Given the Fed’s formal policy of annual 2% inflation the Fed must respond in the face of an overall asset price decline” Asset prices are not included in PCE or CPI and those are the measures of inflation If asset prices were included in the Fed’s inflation target decisions financialization would never have been able to reach the level that is at now That said I agree with you that the Fed won’t allow asset prices to decline without acting even if it is after the fact “people who own them made tons of paper wealth” The profits (or losses) are not real until they sell When people brag to me how much money they have made I ask them “Did you sell?” The answer is usually no I tell them it ain’t real until it’s sold Agree but doesn’t the Fed’s fear of deflation essentially secure those gains moreso than in the past when QE and long-term interest rate suppression were not tools in the toolbox? How can the Fed let people suffer significant (albeit well-deserved) asset price declines while avoiding systematic risk to employment and price levels? A reasonable conclusion is that it’s not possible and the Fed stock market put is a tight stop Overvalued herds of assets get protections (stock indices housing etc) but individual members of the herd do not (Bitcoin Wolf pantheon names etc) particularly when these individuals are young “The ban includes top policymakers such as those who sit on the Federal Open Market Committee along with senior staff Future investments will have to be confined to diversified assets such as mutual funds Fed officials can no longer have holdings in shares of particular companies nor can they invest in individual bonds hold agency securities or derivative contracts The new rules replace existing regulations that while somewhat restrictive still allowed officials such as regional presidents to buy and sell stocks” I think Fed family members are also restricted But Fed members have friends lawyers and others to buy stock for them The Fed’s mandate has nothing to do with the stock market But we all know they are involved in it (wink wink nudge nudge) My guess is Fed members are worried about banks pension funds and their own portfolios They really do not care at all about individual investors Can variations in the prices of stocks be considered a “systematic risk to employment and price levels”? Well they were in 1929 I am not sure if they have been since The FDIC has prevented or postponed systemic risks associated with failed banks Personally I am drawing down my bank deposits and moving them to T-bills I get a better rate and I don’t have to deal with a systemic collapse of banks which is unlikely but not a zero probability “The Fed’s mandate has nothing to do with the stock market But we all know they are involved in it (wink wink nudge nudge)” Agree but assuming the Fed is supporting asset prices to prevent recession and deflation shouldn’t the Fed explicitly admit to it and explain how it impacts Fed policy? As it stands now people who listen to the Fed might think the Fed will let the stock market drop significantly These trusting individuals might not invest in the stock market (due to overvaluation) and they become victims of inflation when the Fed “surprises” everybody with stimulus every time there is a market hiccup Right now lots of people think the Fed will not resort to QE next time stock indices drop Others think they will Which is it? A transparent Fed would communicate its intentions in this area How can people plan and invest not knowing whether the Fed is going to intervene with massive stimulus on the short or long end? Isn’t the lack of transparency around the Fed’s intentions and tools a major source of uncertainty that benefits insiders at the expense of the public? “Isn’t the lack of transparency around the Fed’s intentions and tools a major source of uncertainty that benefits insiders at the expense of the public?” Of course No @ William I bought 100 shares in Dec ’17 at just under 200 It later split 4-1 so 400 shares @ 50 After the split i’ve sold 300 shares on the way up and still hold 100 I’ve done well but EVERY now and then I whink but what if I hadn’t sold any… and then I remember my experience w/ Nokia stock I’d bought 100 at 129 It split 2-1 then 4-1 so I had 800 shares @ 16 1/8 which eventually hit a high of 65/share I rode it all the way up… then all the way down…then I did it again when it had one more run left in it going from about 15 to 45 Didn’t sell then either It’s been in the low single digits for years and I’ve been selling some shares for the tax loss… So w/ NVDA I learned my lesson and Have taken profits even though this time I’d be up 16x in just over 6 years But I ain’t complaining… :-) Wolf How often do you see incidents like NVDA hitting a bubble top then crashing almost 70% then going right back into a bubble? This appears to be a very rare incident in history– it happened during Dutch Tulip Mania South Sea and related bubbles in the 1700s and a few times during the 1800s A few stocks did this in the 1920s [Clearly this doesn’t mean go out and short the market as the timing is viciously difficult] Can you think of any other examples? And what are your thoughts about what this says of the economy/financial markets? Do you have any thoughts about the long bond trade (TLT) being in a bear market for almost 4 years? Does this have any application to the market’s behaviour? What’s being restricted I understand the Fed went from 0-5 percent interest rates but so what Housing is at a high stocks are at an all time high auto insurance is up 40 percent my home insurance jumped 100 percent Government debt is high government spending is all time high food is double from 2020 gas is still high so how exactly is the Fed being restrictive Bill the Fed is not being restrictive historically Note that the average Fed funds rate over the last 50 years (1971-2022) was 486% median 497% This is about what it is now If you leave out the perverse ZIRP years the average 1971-2008 was 643% median 562% (FRED) well above today’s rate My point is from an historical perspective (we have no other) the current Fed funds rate is not restrictive and is about normal If you exclude the bizarre ZIRP years the current Fed funds rate would be characterized as loose This is why all economic indicators are looking good and core inflation is still supposedly high But in fact the average core cpi 1971-2022 was 390% (FRED) exactly the same as the year ending Jan 2024 Rates have to go much higher to get inflation down to the Fed’s desired 2% Powell and his cronies do not have the guts or intelligence to do this So historically speaking our economy is pretty much normal and will plug along as it always has MSM screeching for lower rates is just a reflection of greed and stupidity Lowering rates from the current 5% will likely inflame inflation I have been in computers over 50 years and seen used and read about the tech everyday and have built supercomputers using NVIDIA GPU cards for the COVID project(s) and have tested ChatGPT The AI term is being used loosely and I tested it using plain Google searches side-by-side against ChatGPT and was impressed somewhat by it but it isn’t real artificial intelligence because it isn’t “thinking” it is aggregating and combining several Google and other search engines together and typing out in essay form what you ask and I found using manual Google searches the exact same thing but it was raw data that I would have to discern what was best – I liked my searches better Real artificial intelligence will be when we reach “Singularity” where a robot or computer is as smart as human being and this is MOST important part because it won’t happen until about 7-10+ years away at best probably more and is being worked on by NVIDIA Google Amazon IBM AMD Intel Tesla and a lot of small startups – so competition will be fierce along with the hype The stock price reminds me of Cisco at the dot com era around 2000 and the price can remain irrational for a very long time until the competition catches up and or supersedes NVIDIA tech maybe they won’t – but IMO it will One thing that hasn’t been talked about and is real important too is the amount of electricity these GPU’s gulp down and this will become a bigger issue when factored in with EV’s and all the demands of other computing electronics needs The (5) supercomputers I built for COVID projects plus (5) others tripled my electric bill and put out huge amounts of heat another factor is cooling these CPUs and GPUs down running at about 180-210 degrees F In summary there will be lots more competition hype controversy etc and the likes of Google Bing etc are already concerned about the data that ChatGPT(s) uses from their databases – then you have the people who published the info that’s available and guess what? – here comes the lawyers about infringements patents regulations ownership etc etc We are a long way off from true Artificial Intelligence but it will happen this tech has just scratched the surface Two comments on the value of AI: First jet airplanes piloted by autonomous AI can perform maneuvers at G’s that cause human pilots to lose consciousness There is no contest These systems are under development now by many countries Second the game of Go popular in Asia is more complicated than chess meaning it has more possible moves The AI model that beat the highest ranked player in the world several years ago performed moves that have never been seen in the several hundred-year history of the game Books are being written on the moves AI is the most significant development in human history since the printing press But unlike the centuries it took for the printing press to transform mankind it will take decades or years for AI to transform mankind to something we cannot imagine Nvidia is a once in several lifetimes’ opportunity I have shares in NVDA ARM and NOW all with 100% plus gains I have taken some profits to play with the house’s money Most significant development since the printing press? LOL okay According to Larry Summers What does he know? AI is based on spellcheckers Seek mental assistance Different opinions no bubble then yet LOL AI is just another mania It has been around for at least 25 years Software analyzed situations made decisions in a nanosecond and communicated with humans like Hal in the movie 2001: Space Osyssey It has just steadily improved Some hype-slinging stock jockeys have flogged stocks like Nvidia like it is the Second Coming Of Christ On A Cracker Reminds me of not long ago when “block chain” were the words inscribed on golden tablets brought down from the mountain by Moses Companies were changing their names to include block chain and the stock would jump Insane I had promised myself that I would jump on the next mania after block chain died a merciful death but 3 family deaths and funerals and moving back to China all at the same time made me miss the boat However I’m ready for the next tulip Bring the insanity! AI has been around for 25 years but its growth went asymptotic around 2018 when transformers were developed GPT = Generative Pre-Trained Transformer MW: Tech stocks likely headed for a pullback These 5 charts show their momentum is starting to fade Well I would welcome a pullback in tech and let the small caps fire up? I’m just LONG term investor thinking that the tech importance (owned it for years) will grow over the next 10y I’m not going to quit the tech because NVDA is maybe overpriced if indeed nvidia will behave like tesla and the other imploded stocks… shouldnt everyone short nvidia? It seems so clear what am I missing? You’re not missing anything You are just earlier than most people Shorting a stock like this is dangerous because you have to get the *timing* right not just the valuation and there can be further melt-ups It can be tempting sometimes due to our tendency to become careless but shorting any stock risks losing your entire life savings and if you have one your family’s financial stability Wall street loves to take the other side of the bet on anyone who short sells They will do everything they can to squeeze you and make you cover at a higher price You win by not playing a crooked game A substantial part of massive spikes such as nvda could be due to short squeezes Real “Artificial Intelligence” hasn’t arrived yet the programs I created many years ago would be considered AI today — Read my prior post Do a Google search – “Singularity explained AI” and understand!! I’m a bit skeptical of the value because I’ve been in the corporate world and understand it’s much easier to make a case for an investment than it is to actually create value from the investment Tech companies are flush with cash it’s not a scarce capital environment it’s a scarce opportunity environment for new revenue and margin This company’s numbers are real so long as the investment cycle continues — it seems entirely unsustainable though because LLMs are hard to monetize and it’s not cheap Microsoft copilot is fine it’s not the new iPhone LLMs tell you what you want to hear not the truth It’s interesting but the reality doesn’t match the hype in my experience There is just no alternative to liquidating every penny of investable capital and purchasing NVDA What could possibly go wrong? Apple dropping its EV plans to focus on AI It tells something about nvidia vs Tesla Tesla has big management issues as well Comments are closed Prices of New Houses v Existing Houses: Price cuts and mortgage-rate buydowns make new houses more attractive Reserves Domestic ON RRPs Currency in Circulation the TGA and official foreign RRPs determine how far QT can go Germany is an example of what interest-rate repression and QE do to home prices and what happens when inflation causes those policies to be reversed “Many potential buyers are postponing their purchasing plans in hopes of securing lower rates Consequently lower buyer competitions exerted downward pressure on prices”: Realtorcom They learned a lesson from the mess in 2019 which Powell referred to several times Copyright © 2011 - 2024 Wolf Street Corp All Rights Reserved See our Privacy Policy"

On the surface the refreshed Model 3 features a new streamlined front end with slimmer front headlights new daytime running lights (DRLs) and updated rear headlights The exterior design has been nipped and tucked in other areas but otherwise looks similar to the outgoing model though Tesla says the exterior styling has been “optimized for maximum aerodynamics” as well New wheels and two new color options are on offer too Under the skin is where more of the bigger enhancements have been made Tesla did not disclose these details but reviewers say the Model 3 features new suspension components and tuning leading to a more comfortable ride as well as better handling Tesla CEO Elon Musk had complained in the past that the Model 3 went through “production hell” during its initial industrialization and development and this new mid-cycle update is a way to address some product concerns Chief among those concerns was the interior which has been criticized as somewhat spartan in nature Tesla said it has included “softer more sophisticated” materials in the interior as well as new seats and ambient lighting Tesla says the new interior is quieter as well thanks to “acoustic glass” as the company calls it and likely more sound-deadening materials throughout Though the big center touchscreen remains the main interface for the vehicles functions Tesla added a second display for rear-seat occupants for entertainment purposes and rear climate controls The biggest feature here — and what will have fans rejoicing — is the new Model 3 costs the same as the old one The Model 3 Rear-Wheel Drive costs $38990 just like the outgoing model and features the same 272-mile range The Model 3 Dual Motor All-Wheel Drive remains priced at $45990 but its range increases by eight miles to 341 miles on a full charge Pras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance You can follow him on Twitter and on Instagram Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis including events that move stocks Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance Related Quotes"

Why Its Not Time to Hit the Breaks on TSLA Stock Just Yet","1/28/2024","https://investorplace.com/market360/2024/01/hold-on-why-its-not-time-to-hit-the-breaks-on-tsla-stock-just-yet/","Countdown to Luke Lango’s “2nd Trillion-Dollar AI Trade” The US govt just unlocked an $8 trillion market to move in a new direction See how it could unleash 6000% potential upside Theres no need to ditch TSLA stock following this slide Advertisement Source: Arina P Habich / Shutterstockcom As you may know Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock was trending lower ahead of this week’s quarterly earnings release But instead of shares surging back upon the unveiling of positive surprises/”less bad” results the market reacted negatively to the company’s latest financials and to updates to guidance provided by CEO Elon Musk Still even as shares have experienced a post-earnings sell-off and said sell-off could morph into a continued slide in the near-term that’s not necessarily a reason to bail on this EV winnerAs I’ll explain below there is a path back to higher prices based upon more positive news/developments also recently revealed On Jan 24 Tesla announced earnings for the quarter ending Dec 31 2023 For the quarter revenue came in at $251 billion representing a 3% increase from the prior year’s quarter Non-GAAP earnings per share came in at 71 cents down 40% year-over-year These numbers came in slightly below sell-side forecasts but that’s not the main reason TSLA stock tanked to the tune of 121% the first trading day following the earnings report Rather this double-digit sell-off resulted from discouraging guidance from CEO Musk As Barron’s reported Jan 25 Musk stated that vehicle volume growth “may be notably lower” in 2024 compared to 2023 For reference Tesla increased its vehicle delivery volume by 38% last year Even as the market has expected a growth slowdown Musk’s concurring rather than assuaging of growth concerns was not what the market wanted to hear Although there could be a silver lining (lower expectations about growth may mean Tesla feels less pressure to cut vehicle prices in order to meet delivery guidance) it’s still very possible that this slowdown in demand growth is coupled with further weakness with margins/profitability Admittedly with TSLA stock sporting a rich forward earnings multiple (548) It goes without saying that the prospect of slowing growth is not a good sign As you know while the market may pay up for growth it’s apt to punish growth stocks that enter a slowdown period With this in mind I wouldn’t rule out the possibility that the TSLA slide carries on The extent of the potential share decline is uncertain Positives such as the expected lowering of interest rates later this year could help soften the blow Instead of making a full retreat to the stock’s late 2022 multi-year low (a little over $100 per share) a move back down to $150 or $125 per share Yet while even this price forecast suggests that the best course of action is to sell/avoid now this may not fully be the case Sure if you’ve yet to buy taking your time is likely a wise move If you currently own TSLA however the catalysts I hinted at above

907,"Elon Musk Melts Down in Baffling Answer on Tesla Supercomputer","2/10/2024","https://futurism.com/elon-musk-baffling-answer-tesla-supercomputer","A few years back Tesla was talking a huge talk about a supercomputer that it called Dojo which was supposed to be key to the companys self-driving efforts Musk himself called it a super power training computer and a beast The car company claimed it was the fifth most powerful in the world In 2022 the companys early prototype drew so much power that it tripped the power grid in Palo Alto California Is the much-hyped supercomputer still a going concern? Youd think so given all that braggadocio — but as highlighted by CleanTechnica CEO Elon Musk was asked about it at a January investor meeting and his answer was absolutely baffling I mean the AI auto question is — that is a deep one he said tripping over his own words again and again So were obviously hedging our bets here with significant orders of Nvidia GPUs — or GPUs is the wrong word Really needs to be — theres no — it doesnt even — it doesnt mean — you cant like produce graphics he said So thats whats — sort of a graphical processing unit neural net processing unit or something like that But I would you know think of Dojo as a long shot he eventually admitted after proffering that training a car is much like training a human Its a long shot worth taking because the payoff is potentially very high he mused But its not something that is a high probability Dissecting Musks largely nonsensical remarks its hard to believe the company is making much concrete progress on Dojo after all this time — or if it is it sounds like Musk has no idea about it In fact it calls to mind an anecdote about Musk during his time at Zip2 one of his early companies There according to an employee he put a normal PC inside a giant pompous wheeled case which he would show off to potential investors and tell them it was a mini supercomputer In other words it sounds a lot like Musk is the same as hes always been: a talented marketer who leads with the hype adjusting the story as he goes in response to reality Remember when he first showed off a Tesla robot called Optimus except that it was just a person in a suit? Sometimes these stories can take on a life of their own Optimus is now an actual robot that can shuffle around and perform rudimentary tasks though not without controversy Some of Musks magic though may be starting to fade Teslas shares have been put through the wringer this year in large part due to the mercurial CEOs racist antics Earlier this month Quartz reported that the company is now officially the worst-performing stock in the S&P 500 a market index tracking the 500 largest companies in the US Theres still at least some lingering hype for Dojo A September report by investment bank Morgan Stanley predicted that it could add a whopping $500 billion to the companys value Shares jumped at the news indicating some optimism about the project At the same time as Clean Technica points out Musks most recent comments about Dojo are markedly different than how he was talking about the project a few years ago In fact just six days before hopping on the earnings call Musk threatened to pursue AI ventures outside of Tesla unless he was allowed to claw back a 25 percent stake an increase of 12 percent given his standing at the time Incensed some long-time investors accused Musk of blackmailing shareholders More on Tesla: Tesla Is Officially the Worst-Performing S&P 500 Stock of the Year Share This Article DISCLAIMER(S) Articles may contain affiliate links which enable us to share in the revenue of any purchases made Registration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our Terms of Service © Recurrent Ventures Inc All Rights Reserved"

A place to hide and launder stolen cash?

910,"Tesla Stock Forecast: Bullish But Not For the Reason You Think","2/13/2024","https://investmentu.com/tesla-stock-forecast-2/","We have several FREE e-letters that could help you out Just take this short survey to see which one is best for you By Teddy Stavetski Feb 13 2024 at 3:40PM Tesla (TSLA) is one of the most fascinating companies in the world This is mainly due to its dual status as both a revolutionary technology company and a meme stock On one hand Tesla is pioneering so many new technologies and is legitimately one of the best 6 non-FAANG stocks to hold for the next decade But on the other hand you have Elon Musk selling short-shorts for $69420 to mock investors who doubt the company It just seems like a true banana republic over there at Tesla HQ Tesla’s stock was one of the biggest winners during 2020 and 2021 rising a staggering 1000% But 2022 and 2023 were a bit less-than-stellar with Tesla losing roughly 50% Heading into 2024 investors are trying to figure out what type of Tesla stock forecast to plan for As for me I’m bullish on Tesla But probably not for the reasons that you think Disclaimer: This article is for general informational and educational purposes only It should not be construed as financial advice as the author Ted Stavetski is not a financial advisor Tesla has been on a tear over the past few years reaching profitability much faster than many investors were expecting But the past few quarters haven’t been as rosy Here’s how Tesla performed over the last three quarters: Revenue growth has become a bit stagnated recently and CEO Elon Musk has even resorted to slashing prices on certain EV models to increase sales These price cuts have been in response to increased competition from legacy automakers as well as Chinese EV companies For years Tesla enjoyed a unique position as the world’s only major electric vehicle company But those days are rapidly coming to an end as virtually every single automaker now produces several lines of EVs As far as whether or not Tesla stock is overpriced Tesla currently has a price-to-earnings ratio of just 42 While this is significantly higher than most automakers it really isn’t that much for a tech company Either way I don’t want to spend too much of this Tesla stock forecast talking about EVs because I don’t think that will be the main driver for TSLA stock moving forward The future of Tesla isn’t EVs – it’s robots Investors have always viewed Tesla as a technology company first and a carmaker second After all Teslas are essentially just computers on wheels This mentality of investors to treat Tesla as a tech company is what has allowed the company to command such high valuations in the past If Tesla was “just a car company” then it wouldn’t trade at 50X earnings (and even higher in the past) Right now Tesla is working on a new product that’s gotten a surprisingly quiet reception: the Optimus humanoid robot If you haven’t already seen videos of Tesla’s Generation 2 Optimus then quickly watch this 2-minute-long video It looks like a prequel to “I Robot” If you haven’t seen I Robot it’s an old Will Smith movie where humans live alongside robots Now most people reading this Tesla stock forecast will probably scoff and assume that this tech is at least a decade or two down the road It isn’t There’s a very good chance that Tesla’s humanoid business will eclipse its EV business in the few few years Musk’s Comments The Optimus is still a prototype As such it didn’t get a lot of screen time during Tesla’s last earnings call in January But CEO Elon Musk had this to say about Optimus: “Optimus obviously is a very new product an extremely revolutionary product It’s something that I think has the potential to far exceed the value of everything else that Tesla combined” Elon Musk has been known to hype up Tesla products in the past But this is still high praise coming from the company’s CEO Tesla’s Advantage As far as competing in the humanoid market one major thing that sets Tesla apart is its manufacturing capability This will help Tesla compete (and beat) other robotics companies like Boston Dynamics for example Tesla is already one of the biggest car manufacturers in the world and delivered 181 million cars in 2023 At the same time it has AI capabilities from developing cars that can translate over to developing humanoids In fact Tesla actually uses the same AI inference technology for both cars and robotics (according to Musk on Tesla’s last earnings call) Finally Tesla has the capital-raising ability to help scale the humanoid technology once it’s ready Honestly Musk could probably pay for it all himself if he really wanted to So yes Tesla might be at the forefront of the humanoid revolution But how will this turn into profit for EV manufacturers? Well humanoids are clearly an emerging technology which means that there isn’t a set use case just yet But the possibilities are nearly limitless Tesla designed Optimus to fit smoothly into human society With this in mind you could theoretically swap in an Optimus into whatever tasks a human could do Here are a few examples: As far as the timeline for when humanoids will be released it’s tough to say But I have a feeling that it will be much closer than investors think considering where the tech is at now and how fast AI is accelerating Additionally it doesn’t necessarily matter when Tesla starts profiting from these robots All that matters is the hype cycle that leads up to the robots Once the hype starts to build investors will start to pull projected earnings forward One concern for Tesla shareholders is the company’s erratic CEO: Elon Musk Five years ago having Musk at the helm was an undeniable tailwind for the company In the past Musk’s behavior was likened to that of a “crazy genius” like Tony Stark But Musk’s behavior has felt a bit more “crazy” than “genius” lately When writing any Tesla stock forecast Musk is definitely a risk factor worth mentioning Here’s a quick history of Elon Musk’s questionable decision-making over the past few years: So what happens if Musk starts acting similarly at Tesla? If the board refuses to give him more shares will he hold a press conference and tell the board to go f*ck themselves? Will he lay off any engineer who disagrees with him? Will he crash the value of Tesla by 70% with shoddy decision-making? These questions sound absurd But he’s done all of these things with Twitter – so why not Tesla? There’s also the fact that Elon Musk currently runs six different companies: Tesla SpaceX xAI The Boring Company Neuralink and X (Twitter) No person can realistically work six different jobs which calls into question his capabilities as a CEO For years Elon Musk was Tesla’s biggest asset But he might be turning into its biggest liability If Tesla can leverage the “genius” side of Elon Musk and mitigate the “crazy” then the future looks bright for this growing humanoid company I hope that you’ve found this Tesla stock forecast valuable in learning whether or not Nvidia is overvalued If you’re interested in reading similar articles be sure to subscribe below to get alerted of new articles from InvestmentU Ted Stavetski is the owner of Do Not Save Money a financial blog that encourages readers to invest money instead of saving it He has five years of experience as a business writer and has written for companies like SoFi StockGPT Benzinga and more Ted Stavetski is the owner of Do Not Save Money a financial blog that encourages readers to invest money instead of saving it He has five years of experience as a business writer and has written for companies like SoFi StockGPT Benzinga and more March 20 2024 March 19 2024 March 5 2024 February 29 2024"

BYD (BYDDY) dethroned Tesla (TSLA) to become the world’s top seller of electric vehicles last year To get to that position BYD has relied on its home market of China for more than 80% of its sales But now with China’s EV boom projected to slow for a second straight year the company is eyeing rapid international expansion Just don’t expect an entry into the US anytime soon “We’re not planning to come to the US” Stella Li executive vice president of BYD and CEO of BYD Americas told Yahoo Finance Live (video above) “It’s an interesting market but it is very complicated” she added citing growing political pushback on Chinese companies and the slowing rate of growth for EV adoption Chinese carmakers faced with a 275% tariff on car imports from China have largely been shut out of the US market But BYD’s rapid growth in Mexico and plan to build out a factory there has raised alarms among Western competitors worried that the company may be positioning itself for a US entry by establishing an export hub in Mexico that would help it avoid high tariffs Li dismissed that speculation saying the company’s plant would be located within 200 miles of Mexico City to focus solely on Mexicos domestic market An official announcement on the plant is expected in the second half of this year she said “We’re not even considering any northern state [in Mexico]” Li said alluding to brands that typically set up operations near the US-Mexico border to target the American market “We are targeting the local market That is the BYD strategy” In recent weeks executives at Western car companies have warned that they would be unable to match Chinese carmakers price advantages should they enter the US During Tesla’s (TSLA) most recent earnings call CEO Elon Musk said Chinese carmakers would “pretty much demolish most other car companies in the world” without trade barriers in place Meanwhile Stellantis CEO (STLA) Carlos Tavares likened the impending entry of Chinese companies to that of Japanese and South Korean automakers in the 1970s and 1990s “The Chinese are the major threat right now because they are the only guys that can sell [battery-electric vehicles] at the price of ICE [vehicles]” Tavares said referring to gas-powered cars According to Tom Narayan lead equity analyst at RBC Capital Markets BYDs cost advantage amounts to roughly 40% compared to Stellantis The vertical integration of its business has helped drive costs lower Roughly 75% of the parts and components that go into its vehicles are manufactured in-house allowing the company to control costs and timelines according to Li “The threat isn’t small” Narayan said “Chinese [original equipment manufacturers] have some very compelling products” On Friday the Alliance for American Manufacturing released a report warning about “China’s existential threat to America’s auto industry” The report characterized Chinese investments in Mexico as “an effort to gain backdoor access to American consumers by circumventing existing policies that are keeping China’s autos out of the US market” “I think they are a little bit [overreacting]” BYDs Li said “A little bit too scared about Chinese competition I never believe that trade protection will help any company” Regardless Congress and the White House are monitoring Chinese investments Representatives Mike Gallagher and Raja Krishnamoorthi have called on US Trade Representative Katherine Tai to raise existing tariffs on Chinese car imports while Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen visited Mexico in December to discuss ways to strengthen cooperation on screening of foreign investments in North America Founded in 1995 as a battery manufacturer for cellphones and other consumer electronics devices BYD has undergone rapid expansion since 2019 growing from 500000 deliveries to more than 3 million in 2023 Government subsidies and tax breaks in China have also played a key role in BYDs expansion The US has looked to counter that through President Bidens landmark climate and energy law which set aside billions of dollars in incentives to spur EV adoption while also aiming to bring the manufacturing of EV parts and components back to the US But the country still trails well behind China and Europe in the transition to go all electric New electric vehicles sales accounted for just 76% of the overall market according to data from Kelley Blue Book The EV penetration rate in China climbed to 357% despite a slowdown according to data from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers “The Chinese make EVs predominantly — full electrics” Narayan said “And in the US full electric penetration is slowing Its not as robust as it is in Europe Im less worried about the US for the Chinese threat More worried for Europe” Li said BYD’s focus remains firmly on expanding market share outside of the US The firm has already announced the establishment of new factories in Hungary Thailand and Uzbekistan BYD exported roughly 243000 cars out of the 3 million vehicles sold last year with Australia Brazil and Israel among its biggest markets “The Chinese market is the most competitive market” Li said “If you are the winner in the most competitive market why [can’t you win] in other [countries]?

938,"None","1/11/2024","https://www.businessinsider.com/used-tesla-hertz-sales-cheap-red-flags-battery-depreciation-2024-1","A slew of used Teslas have hit the Hertz car sales website after the company announced Thursday it was selling off 20000 EVs from its fleet Across the US there were 657 Teslas to choose from — mostly Model 3s — with some listings as low as $20125 when we checked on Thursday afternoon Its a screaming deal for shoppers in the market for a used Tesla or any budget-minded EV shopper a demographic slowly making up most of the electric car market A car-rental company like Hertz is always a good place to look for a deal on a used car but when it comes to EVs there are a number of different pitfalls to keep in mind since the used market is not near as mature for battery-powered vehicles A used Tesla that has been in a rental fleet is likely to used much more frequently than one thats been personally owned You can see that in the difference in mileage when you look on Kelley Blue Book for a used Model 3 The first one that came up here in Southeast Michigan was listed for $27995 at a local dealership with 46171 miles That $20125 Model 3 we found on the Hertz website a 2021 model was listed with 92789 miles Related stories Mileage is always something to consider when shopping for a used car but with electric vehicles little is known at this early stage about battery deterioration at high mileages This mystery in the valuation equation has created a headache for the industry as more electric cars hit the used market Used cars tend to require more maintenance than a car fresh from the factory With an EV that can look different than a simple part or filter replacement One of the reasons Hertz cited in its Thursday filing for reducing its EV fleet was the elevated cost of maintenance for these vehicles Teslas in particular are notoriously difficult to service due to the lack of brick-and-mortar infrastructure for Tesla service and the level of technology packed into the cars Even something as simple as a fender bender can be difficult to manage with a Tesla and these cars are a lot easier to total than their gas-powered counterparts While $20000 is an incredible deal in todays car market (the average new car sells for around $46000 and the average new EV closer to $50000) adding an EV to your driveway comes with more than just the sticker price on the car In order to get the most out of an electric vehicle its usually recommended to have some form of fast charging at home These chargers cost anywhere from $250 to $750 and installation can run you somewhere around $1600 Depending on your state the energy usage for overnight charging can start to get pricey as well Perhaps one of the reasons you can get such a good deal on a Tesla at Hertz right now is that the outlook for EV value retention is pretty grim at the moment A recent study from iSeeCars found that electric cars have an average five-year depreciation rate of 491% compared to an industry average of 388% Teslas Model 3 does fare the best in resale values only falling 429% in five years but as Tesla lathers on more discounts for new models that could quicken the pace of depreciation Read next Jump to"

Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment Musks post stood at odds with remarks he previously made suggesting Tesla is already an important artificial intelligence and robotics company and its value hinges on its prowess in these domains In April 2022 Musk predicted during Teslas first-quarter earnings call that the companys humanoid robot Optimus ultimately will be worth more than the car business and worth more than full self-driving Tesla unveiled an early Optimus prototype at Tesla AI Day in September that year and Musk said in a post around that event The point of AI Day is to show the immense depth & breadth of Tesla in AI compute hardware & robotics More recently on Dec 27 2023 Musk criticized Craig Irwin senior research analyst at Roth Capital who appeared on CNBCs Closing Bell Overtime saying he thought Tesla was egregiously overvalued especially compared with Japanese auto giant Toyota Bristling at the comparison to a large competitor that has sold more hybrid electric vehicles than battery electric models Musk said in a post on X He has the wrong frame of reference Tesla is an AI/robotics company While Teslas last annual or 10-K filing showed that around 95% of its revenue came from its automotive segment in 2022 in its third-quarter 2023 financial filing the company described its business as increasingly focused on products and services based on artificial intelligence robotics and automation Even on Monday morning Musk posted a video clip on X showing the Optimus robot in development folding laundry at a table although the robot was remote-operated and not autonomous Musks wish to control even more of Tesla will undoubtedly add to the pressure on Teslas board of directors in 2024 In addition to determining appropriate CEO and director compensation Teslas board is already facing some investors concerns over several issues Some investors and lawmakers have expressed concerns over: Musks split focus and use of company resources as he continues to run SpaceX X Corp and other ventures alongside Tesla; his divisive political and cultural commentary including recent tweets disparaging corporate diversity and inclusion initiatives; federal probes involving Musk and Tesla; and worries over drug use by the CEO recently reported by The Wall Street Journal Musk is also in the midst of a trial in Delaware over his earlier $56 billion pay package from Tesla The unparalleled 2018 CEO compensation plan made Musk into one of the richest people on the planet Shareholder Richard J Tornetta has sued Musk and Tesla alleging the CEOs compensation was excessive and its authorization amounted to a breach of fiduciary duty by Tesla and its board Musk also noted on Monday that Teslas board of directors is waiting to establish a new compensation plan for him until the Tornetta case is decided in the Delaware Chancery Court He wrote: The reason for no new compensation plan is that we are still waiting for a decision in my Delaware compensation case The trial for that was held in 2022 but a verdict has yet to be made Referring to his call for 25% voting control he said: If I have 25% it means I am influential but can be overridden if twice as many shareholders vote against me vs for me At 15% or lower the for/against ratio to override me makes a takeover by dubious interests too easy In an earlier trial in Delaware several Tesla board members agreed last year to pay back $735 million to the company in a settlement agreement over their own director compensation Dont miss these stories from CNBC PRO: Got a confidential news tip?

947,"Tesla Q4 Preview: Rich Margins And EV King Status May Be History (NASDAQ:TSLA)","1/20/2024","https://seekingalpha.com/article/4663730-tesla-q4-preview-rich-margins-and-ev-king-status-may-be-history","Gerasimov174 Gerasimov174 We previously covered Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) in October 2023 discussing its decelerating Full Self-Driving (FSD) adoption as demonstrated by the moderating service revenues and declining gross margins Combined with the reversal in sentiments from the automakers impacted electric vehicle (EV) revenues and elevated inventory levels we at that time believed that the stocks elevated P/E valuation was unwarranted explaining our Hold rating then In this article we shall discuss why TSLAs EV King investment thesis has faded with it no longer the largest global volume producer by Fiscal Q4 2023 (to be reported post-market on Wednesday January 24th) with its profit margins likely to continue suffering as an adverse effect of the sustained price cuts While improved manufacturing scale may be possible in the long term we believe that there may be more near-term uncertainty arising from the increased operating expenses and potential unionization of its labor force With TSLA being inherently more expensive than its Magnificent Seven peers we believe that the stock may likely trade sideways for a little longer before it grows into its premium valuations For now TSLA has already been dethroned as the king of EVs as it produced 4949K units (+149% QoQ/ +125% YoY) and delivered 4845K in FQ423 (+113% QoQ/ +195% YoY) or the equivalent annualized total of 197M and 193M units respectively These numbers are underwhelming indeed when compared to BYD Companys (OTCPK:BYDDF) excellent pure EV production of 51896K units (+182% QoQ/ +59% YoY) and sales of 5264K units in FQ423 (+218% QoQ/ +60% YoY) or the equivalent annualized total of 207M and 21M respectively With TSLA expecting to deliver 22M units in 2024 it appears that BYDDF may very well boast the honor of being the EV King ahead triggering further uncertainty in the formers prospects as the latter also enters the North American market through Mexico Combined with the sustained price cuts in the US the EU and China in 2023 it is unsurprising that TSLA is expected to generate underwhelming revenues of $2576B (+67% QoQ/ +177% YoY) in the upcoming FQ423 earnings call on January 24 2024 Its decelerating rate of growth is alarming indeed when compared to its FQ422 sales growth rate of +133% QoQ/ +372% YoY and FQ421 growth rate of +288% QoQ/ +649% YoY PPI Index For Transportation Equipment Manufacturing Industry Trading Economics Trading Economics At the same time inflation is still raging with the Producer Price Index for the Transportation Equipment Manufacturing industry at record high of 140563x by December 2023 (-0089 MoM/ +2579 YoY/ +16163 from 2019 averages) This implies that the consensus FQ423 adj EPS estimates of $074 (+13% QoQ/ -381% YoY) are not overly bearish as well with TSLAs price cuts directly impacting its profit margins despite the volume growth The Consensus Forward Estimates Tikr Terminal Tikr Terminal The same has been observed in the consensus EBIT margins estimates of 109% in FY2024 and 131% in FY2025 with these numbers falling short of TSLAs hyper-pandemic peak margins of 168% in FY2022 It is apparent that the automaker may face more top and bottom line headwinds in the intermediate term as the EV price war deepens from the inventory clearance of its outdated models and the flooded market from Hertzs (HTZ) sale of 20K units On the other hand TSLA is still expected to generate a sustained expansion in the adj EPS profitability at a CAGR of +93% despite the elevated interest rate environment While it remains to be seen when the automaker may introduce the $25K EV the CEO has confirmed that the Berlin plant will be manufacturing its future mass market offerings implying its expanded operational scale and efficient global supply chain over the next few years It makes sense then why TSLA has applied for an expansion in Berlin Gigafactorys manufacturing capacity from the annualized sum of approximately 260K in March 2023 to the approved capacity of 500K and to the eventual long-term plan of 1M units The same may also be observed in the Texas Gigafactory with approximately 520 Cybertrucks already rolling out of the production line by the end of 2023 with demand gated by supply This is based on the 19M pre-orders recorded by July 2023 and the managements commentary of over 1M in pre-orders by the latest quarter Demand may continue to grow as well thanks to the reopened Cybertruck pre-order website with $250 refundable deposit as the automaker targets an annualized production capacity of 250K by 2025 This trend may also be aided by the declining lithium spot prices with the EV market growth expected to grow to $9067B by 2028 and Goldman Sachs already projecting price parity to internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles by mid-2026 This means that energy storage costs are likely to moderate further triggering tailwinds in the EV adoption in the second half of the decade as inflation normalizes by Q426 As a result with TSLAs gross/ EBIT margins diluted over the next year to 18 months before Cybertruck is a significant positive cash flow contributor further impacted by the refreshed New Highland Model 3 and Juniper Model Y to be launched in 2024 it appears that our previous Ford Motor Company (F) observation may hold true In that multiple automakers are likely to report underwhelming EV margins and stock performance over the next few years until the Gen 2/ 3 offerings are launched and demand returns TSLA Valuations Seeking Alpha Seeking Alpha As a result of these near-term headwinds we are not certain if TSLA may be able to maintain its premium FWD EV/ EBIT valuation of 7317x and FWD P/E valuation of 6873x compared to its 1Y mean of 5169x/ 5822x and the sector median of 1396x/ 1542x respectively Most importantly the automaker has had to hike the wages of most of its US-based workers by +10% from January 2024 onwards in an effort to stave off the potential unionization of its workers Readers must note that TSLA is also facing a growing labor dispute in the EU with things potentially escalating in Berlin Assuming a similar hike in wages ahead we may see its margins further compressed as similarly observed for multiple legacy automakers after the historic UAW successes with Ford General Motors (GM) and Stellantis (STLA) This means that TSLAs premium FWD valuations may not be sustainable until the margin headwinds are fully resolved with any negative news likely to be trigger moderate volatility ahead Otherwise the stock may at best trade sideways as it has over the past few years before it eventually grows into its premium valuations Only time may tell TSLA 3Y Stock Price Trading View Trading View And it is due to the mixed bag of pessimistic news discussed above that TSLA has recorded another volatile rise and fall since the October 2023 bottom with the stock losing much of its recent gains Magnificent 7s 1Y & YTD Stock Prices Trading View Trading View In addition if we are to look closer TSLAs stock performance has also paled in comparison to the Magnificent Sevens SPDR® S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and Invesco QQQ Trust ETF (QQQ) outperformance on a one year and YTD basis with multiple EV stocks negatively impacted by the ongoing winter storm in the US Magnificent 7s FWD P/E Valuations Tikr Terminal Tikr Terminal If anything TSLA has recently overtaken Amazon (AMZN) and Nvidia (NVDA) as the most overvalued stock amongst the Magnificent Seven as well with the elevated expectations likely to bring forth increased volatility Furthermore we believe TSLAs EV demand may remain impacted in the near term with borrowing costs for used vehicles still elevated at 114% and new vehicles at 71% by December 2023 compared to 82% and 54% in December 2019 respectively implying that the price cuts may be a norm for a little longer On the one hand the TSLA stock appears to be trading near its fair value of $20760 based on the 1Y P/E mean valuation of 6529x and the consensus FY2023 adj EPS estimates of $318 Based on the consensus FY2025 adj EPS estimates of $531 there seems to be a more than decent upside potential of +607% to our long-term price target of $34660 On the other hand TSLA has charted painfully lower highs/ lower lows since the July 2023 peak with it remaining to be seen if bullish support may materialize at its previous support levels of $200s If these support levels are breached we may see a further correction to its next support range of between $180s and $190s implying a -14% downside from current levels As a result of the potential upcoming volatility while Tesla Incs long-term prospects may appear to be bright we prefer to continue rating TSLA as a Hold (Neutral) here with the markets elevated greed

It involves a new kind of robot which may maim and kill you but on the plus side you’ll get a chance to participate in an exciting foray in innovation Don’t all rush at once The ethics of medical experiments that pose a danger to participants such as challenge trials are debated at great length And rightly so Yet we may soon become unwilling test subjects for a technology that looks more dubious by the day Parliament has begun debating the Automated Vehicles Bill announced in the King’s Speech last year It’s intended to coax self-driving vehicles onto our roads by providing a clear legal framework The Government touts autonomous driving as “the future of transport aiming at safer greener and more efficient travel for all” and it doesn’t want Britain to miss out on either the consumer benefits or the economic potential In reality we’ve been here before Steam locomotives caused a death on their very first day of public operation when the MP William Huskisson fell under Stephenson’s Rocket The first pedestrian to be killed by an automobile in the UK was struck with a vehicle moving at just 4mph Extinguishing the risk to the public from innovations in mass transportation is clearly impossible - they’re designed to go everywhere so accidents can happen anywhere A balance is needed But recent developments in the US have made regulators think twice Not so long ago pundits and image-conscious policy wonks regarded autonomous driving as the cornerstone of a “fourth industrial revolution” encompassing AI and smart cities But no sooner had the dream inched towards reality than things became ugly Just weeks after San Francisco permitted the deployment of General Motors’ Cruise robo-taxis last August - after years of human-supervised trials - then a grisly incident obliged it to call a halt A pedestrian was dragged 20 feet under a Cruise taxi which had failed to stop Regulators had only received partial footage of the collision from GM – and not the really nasty part – and so suspended the company’s licence A third party report into the incident last week suggested that ropey internet was probably why regulators didn’t get the full details But nevertheless it found serious management failings at Cruise on multiple levels The worst of these was an ingrained hostility to co-operating with a regulator Cruise was banned from operating in the state in October and in December announced 900 job cuts It’s just the latest in a long line of industry retrenchments Some $100bn (£79bn) has been spent on self-driving vehicles over the past decade Only last week Bloomberg reported that Apple is scaling back its autonomous driving software project Titan and pushing back the internal launch date to 2028 The report states that at best the software will perform what the industry classifies as Level 2 functions - partial automation such as steering and acceleration assistance Big deal Partial driving is a widely recognised problem as the RAC Foundation notes Humans who have turned off their attention can only switch it back on very slowly Such problems have obliged Tesla to recall cars over its partial self-driving tech the most recent a giant two million-vehicle recall in December following a safety agency investigation Despite the many billions of dollars spent on self-driving technology projects over more than a decade not one truck driver has yet been replaced “Progress in this technology has failed to meet many of its promoters’ predictions” the Transport Select Committee observed last November Edison analyst Richard Windsor says that the fundamental technical issue is a reliance on deep learning the basis of generative AI systems This just isn’t reliable enough to create a safer-than-human robot driver in real world conditions We shouldn’t allow the astonishing mimicry of large language models such as ChatGPT to distract us from the corresponding progress in machine vision To borrow an idiom: if you’re so smart how come you keep crashing? It’s also exposed a moral black hole Only a few years ago the venture capital class and their lackeys were arguing that “we’re going to have to be more forgiving of a car causing a fatality” if it was a self-driving car Because progress As the Tesla biographer Ed Niedermeyer observed in 2019 “the tech sector has lost its ability to anticipate the negative consequences of its innovations” and was instead “blitz-scaling its way toward a technological dystopia” The story reverses the familiar mythology of innovation and regulation We know all about regulators inhibiting innovation – but these days they are so keen to be seen as the first and polish their resumes they risk putting the public in danger for no good reason Fortunately the Autonomous Driving Bill is aware of these issues It calls out mis-labelling of autonomous features – something Tesla has been criticised for – and there’s a requirement to provide information to regulators But not enough according to the select committee Lords confirmed to me last week that much more detail is needed As is continuing scrutiny Regulators are rueing the decision to let the companies mark their own homework The Department for Transport still hopes that half of our car journeys by 2047 could be autonomous But it may turn out to be like a 1970s council skateboard park built for skateboarders who never come"

asked McCormick in her decision The stockholder plaintiff in this derivative lawsuit says so He claims that Tesla Incs directors breached their fiduciary duties by awarding Elon Musk a performance-based equity-compensation plan In the final analysis Musk launched a self-driving process recalibrating the speed and direction along the way as he saw fit the judge wrote The process arrived at an unfair price And through this litigation the plaintiff requests a recall McCormick ruled that Tornetta had proved that Musk controlled Tesla and that the process leading to the boards approval of his compensation was deeply flawed She wrote that Musk had extensive ties with the people who were negotiating for Tesla on the package including members of management who were beholden to Musk among them General Counsel Todd Maron his former divorce attorney There is no greater evidence of Musks status as a transaction-specific controller than the Boards posture toward Musk during the process that led to the Grant McCormick wrote Put simply neither the Compensation Committee nor the Board acted in the best interests of the Company when negotiating Musks compensation plan In fact there is barely any evidence of negotiations at all she wrote Rather than negotiate against Musk with the mindset of a third party the Compensation Committee worked alongside him almost as an advisory body Musk did not immediately respond to CNBCs request for comment In a tweet late Tuesday afternoon Musk wrote Never incorporate your company in the state of Delaware In a later tweet he started a poll with the question: Should Tesla change its state of incorporation to Texas home of its physical headquarters? Tornettas lawyer Greg Varallo in a statement said We are enormously grateful for the Courts thorough and extraordinarily well-reasoned decision in turning back the Tesla boards absurdly outsized pay package for Musk The Courts hard work will redound directly to the benefit of Tesla investors who will see the dilution from this gargantuan pay package erased Varallo said McCormicks ruling hinged on a finding that Musk rather than its board of directors and shareholders controlled Tesla at least when it came to the question of setting his compensation The judge wrote: In addition to his 219% equity stake Musk was the paradigmatic Superstar CEO who held some of the most influential corporate positions (CEO Chair and founder) enjoyed thick ties with the directors tasked with negotiating on behalf of Tesla and dominated the process that led to board approval of his compensation plan Tesla and Musks attorneys the court decided were unable to prove that the stockholder vote was fully informed because the proxy statement inaccurately described key directors as independent and misleadingly omitted details about the process Earlier this month Musk began angling for 25% of voting control over Tesla He currently owns about 13% of the companys stock outright I am uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in AI & robotics without having ~25% voting control Enough to be influential but not so much that I cant be overturned he wrote in a post on X the social media site formerly known as Twitter Musk owns X and runs it having purchased it in late 2022 Dont miss these stories from CNBC PRO: Got a confidential news tip?

Eberhard is no longer involved with Tesla However he confirmed that he still owns shares in the automotive company He stated that he isn’t a billionaire but the engineer refuses to reveal how much his stake is worth Even without Tesla the inventor still has a notable resume He has founded a number of successful companies and made millions in the process Martin Eberhard also makes money as a speaker and charges $50000 to $100000 for live events Martin Forest Eberhard was born on May 15 1960 Raised in Kensington California he developed a passion for inventing and bringing his ideas to life In 1982 he earned a bachelor’s degree in computer engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign Two years later he got a master’s degree in electrical engineering and was hired by Wyse Technology as an electrical engineer At his first job he created his first official product a computer terminal he named WY-30 ASCII In 1987 Martin created his first business venture through co-founding Network Computing Devices After nine years he partnered with Marc Tarpenning to launch the NuvoMedia ebook company Tarpenning and Eberhard became close associates They shared the same concerns about fossil fuels and global warming This led the two to become the original founders of Tesla Motors which aimed to produce electric cars As the biggest investor in the startup Elon Musk joined the business duo Early employees Ian Wright and JB Straubel were also given the title of co-founders Martin Eberhard served as chairman and CEO Martin’s relationship with Elon was a bit rocky Musk put a lot of money into Tesla but wasn’t confident with the abilities of Eberhard Understandably he was concerned about the firm’s future So he reportedly forced the CEO out and took his place This led to Martin suing Elon for slander and libel in 2009 However he dropped the case later that year for undisclosed reasons After that he started working with another automotive firm Volkswagen In 2016 he created inEVit a power storage provider for considerable equipment manufacturers It was purchased by Seres in 2017 and Eberhard left the company after a year In 2019 he launched Tiveni to make intelligent EV battery systems Eberhard is currently retired after leaving Tiveni in December 2021 He prefers to keep a low profile but it is known that Martin is married to Carolyn Eberhard It is reported that they have known each other since their college days Patrick is a dynamic content writer who combines technology and creativity With a computer engineering background and seven years of writing experience he specializes in producing engaging entertainment and lifestyle content Save my name email and website in this browser for the next time I comment Δ Email: [email protected] 1968 S Coast Hwy #675 Laguna Beach CA 92651 (949) 799-2165 Type above and press Enter to search Press Esc to cancel"

That’s part of a growing debate on Wall Street where shares of Elon Musk’s electric-vehicle maker are tanking as the rest of the market rallies — and the company is warning that things may not get better for a while An original member of the so-called Magnificent Seven tech stocks that have been driving the S&P 500 Index to new heights traders are now wondering if Tesla’s name belongs next to those other powerhouses The storm clouds are gathering for TeslaCredit: Reuters After doubling last year Tesla’s stock price is down 22 per cent to start 2024 Compare that to Nvidia Corp‘s 46 per cent surge or Meta Platforms Inc’s 32 per cent gain since the beginning of the year and it’s easy to see where the questions are coming from Indeed it’s by far the worst performer in the Magnificent Seven Index this year The problem for the EV-maker is six of those seven companies are benefiting from the enthusiasm surrounding burgeoning artificial intelligence technology The group hit a record 295 per cent weighting in the S&P 500 last week even with Tesla’s decline according to data compiled by Bloomberg But despite Musk’s efforts to position his company as an AI investment the reality is Tesla faces a unique set of challenges “Although Elon Musk would probably disagree investors don’t see Tesla as an AI play like most of the other Magnificent Seven stocks” said Matthew Maley chief market strategist at Miller Tabak + Co “We have a much different backdrop for Tesla and the others in the Mag Seven — the demand trend for Tesla products is fading while it’s exploding higher for those companies that are more associated with AI” At the heart of this divide is the dimming outlook for electric vehicles Demand is expected to slow in 2024 and perhaps beyond raising doubts about Tesla’s ability to grow at the rapid pace investors are accustomed to seeing Roughly a third of the analysts covering Tesla recommend buying the stock compared to an average of 85 per cent for the rest of the Magnificent Seven Moreover analysts have cut their average 2024 profit estimate for Tesla nearly in half over the past 12 months while earnings expectations for the others have risen or stayed flat “The challenge is that Tesla has become a one-product company — the Model Y with every other initiative either not a meaningful contributor to revenue and earnings or still a bit of a science project” said Jeffrey Osborne of Cowen “Being a one-product company and mismanaging the timing of product cycles can create periods of pain which is what we are in now until the next generation vehicle comes out next year or in 2026” While other Magnificent Seven companies such as Nvidia are soaring this year Tesla has struggledCredit: AP The double trouble of slowing EV demand and shaky AI credentials make it hard for investors to swallow Tesla’s sky-high valuation Even with this year’s selloff the stock trades at over 60 times forward earnings The second-most expensive Magnificent Seven stock is Nvidia at around 36 times forward earnings while the rest trade between the low twenties and low thirties “During the year others in the Mag Seven were able to show how AI was driving real profitable business growth” Brian Johnson former auto analyst with Barclays and founder of Metonic Advisors said in an interview “Tesla investors just got some random Optimus videos Musk’s admission Dojo was a moon shot and yet another full-self-driving release that may be an improvement but still a long ways from robotaxi capability” “The demand trend for Tesla products is fading while it’s exploding higher for those companies that are more associated with AI” In contrast the rest of the mega-cap technology companies boast of diverse and stable revenue streams which in most cases translate into slightly slower growth but also less volatile shares Tesla believers say the company’s unique position as the only profitable large-scale pure-play EV maker earns it a seat in the elite club Even though demand is expected to fall in the near-term experts widely expect electric cars to eventually come dominate the auto industry For anyone willing to bet on that future Tesla is still the only real game in town which also explains its lofty market valuation and the all-or-nothing nature of the company’s stock price — soaring 50 per cent in 2021 plunging 65 per cent in 2022 and then leaping 102 per cent in 2023 “I can understand traders being short-term negative on the stock” said Brian Mulberry client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management “But long-term investors are likely more positive given that no other EV maker can profitably produce the volume of units that Tesla does in the pure EV space” Bullish Tesla investors also point out that the company’s revenue growth beyond 2024 is expected to surpass all of the Magnificent Seven other than Nvidia Corp Its earnings are also projected to bounce back in 2025 after dropping this year and will be climbing at a faster pace than most other mega-caps Still Tesla’s heavy exposure to the cyclical automotive industry makes it stand out among the Magnificent Seven particularly in light of the uncertainty around the technology of self-driving cars Though Musk has often claimed that a future where the so-called robotaxis will be a common thing is not far off most industry experts believe it’s still years if not decades away “Tesla is one of the riskier companies we cover because the underlying business is cyclical and the autonomy piece is binary” said Ivana Delevska chief investment officer of Spear Invest “They will either crack the code on autonomy or this will drag for many years before anyone has a solution” Bloomberg The Business Briefing newsletter delivers major stories exclusive coverage and

Mr Ali said he would have appealed the IPOs ruling but did not want to spend any more money adding that the two-year long dispute had caused him many a sleepless night The last 18 months have been hard for me he said I work very hard and sometimes I work more than 12 hours a day I was scared and couldnt sleep at night while this was going on I could appeal against the decision but why? I just want to let it go and save my money and focus on the business He hopes to open a second branch of Colorados Chicken but says Elon Musk is no longer welcome He said: If you asked me will you be inviting Elon Musk?

982,"‘Next Tesla’ EV startups struggle as demand sags and once-bullish investors flee: ‘Whoever finds a sponsor has the best chance’","2/24/2024","https://fortune.com/2024/02/24/next-tesla-ev-startups-struggle-as-investors-flee/","There was a time when the backing of some of the world’s deepest pockets and the mere ambition to sell electric cars was enough to inspire confidence in the stocks of upstarts Rivian Automotive Inc and Lucid Group Inc Now investors have all but thrown in the towel on the shares All it took was a fresh dose of reality from the two companies this week around cooling demand for EVs Rivian which makes electric pickups SUVs and delivery vans and counts Amazoncom Inc as its top shareholder said its production will stay flat at last year’s levels It also announced plans to shrink its workforce again Lucid majority-owned by Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund projected only a slight increase in output over 2023 Both forecasts fell far short of analysts’ expectations For investors the sense of gloom has been building since October when Tesla Inc warned of sagging interest in EVs Though shares of the EV giant have fared poorly since then losing around 20% and massively underperforming the broader market the impact on smaller rivals like Rivian and Lucid has been nothing short of disastrous Read more: Tesla has chance to ‘grow their market share even more’ thanks to EV startups faltering and legacy automakers focusing on hybrids “If you are a hyper-growth company in what is seen as a disruptive industry and you are not growing your topline you are in trouble” said David Mazza chief strategy officer at Roundhill Investments “Having an anchor investor like Amazon or the Saudis gives them a longer runway from a capital perspective but their growth will still be slower and margins thinner than what was once expected” Shares of Irvine California-based Rivian are down by about 44% since Tesla’s October warning — the first in a series of grim outlooks from global EV-makers and suppliers — and closed Friday at a record low Newark California-based Lucid has dropped some 33% in the same period and isn’t far above its own nadir Still had it not been for their wealthy backers — Amazon has a 17% stake in Rivian and Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund holds roughly 60% of Lucid data compiled by Bloomberg show — the stocks could be looking far uglier “The presence of these names is a comfort to investors and a cushion to the price” Mazza said “If these stocks were just relying on the EV hype then they will be down much worse” Amazon in an emailed statement said that the recent results from Rivian don’t change anything about the e-commerce company’s “existing investment collaboration or order size and timing” Rivian has a deal with Amazon to sell it 100000 electric delivery vans by 2030 Saudi Arabia’s PIF didn’t respond to an email seeking comment outside of the fund’s regular business hours on Friday Overall the biggest concern is that these cash-burning unprofitable companies will struggle to sell cars at a time when even industry-leader Tesla — by far the biggest seller in the US market — is cutting prices to boost demand And while Tesla’s profits and large-scale production allow it to compete by lowering prices Rivian and Lucid have neither of those advantages “For these car manufacturers investors want to see demand” said David Wagner portfolio manager at Aptus Capital Advisors Rivian’s latest results suggest it will take several quarters to emerge from its production stoppage with a leaner cost structure and a redesigned platform he said “In the meantime I think skeptics will be scrutinizing the cash balance and ringing alarm bells” Wagner said “So if there is no multiple expansion and no growth — what else is the stock supposed to do?” Both Rivian and Lucid are now worth a fraction of the prices they fetched at their public-market debuts in 2021 Rivian’s market value is around $96 billion and Lucid’s is about $69 billion That’s a long way down from their $153 billion and $91 billion valuation peaks respectively in 2021 Wall Street analysts are losing confidence as well Analysts’ average 12-month price targets for Rivian and Lucid fell nearly 20% just this week Meanwhile the outlook for EVs broadly just keeps getting worse Global sales of EVs are estimated to grow 20% this year to about 167 million units according to BloombergNEF’s most recent analysis That’s a marked cooling from the 33% jump seen in 2023

I think there are two main issues facing Tesla at the moment The first is a weak macroeconomic environment and the second is concerns around its CEO The company’s earnings update last month was not particularly strong Overproduction led to price cuts which resulted in lower margins and weak earnings On top of that though management’s guidance going forward was impressionistic at best This left investors largely trying to figure out the path for the business by themselves This might be the consequence of a third issue Elon Musk has recently stated that he wants 25% of the voting control in order to feel comfortable continuing to develop products for Tesla in future All these issues are weighing on the Tesla share price at the moment But some of them look more serious to me than others The weak numbers in the earnings report shouldn’t – in my view – have surprised anyone This is largely the result of a weaker macroeconomic environment If I thought this was the biggest issue I’d be seriously considering buying Tesla shares But I’m more concerned at Musk’s demand for more equity One issue is that it would come at the expense of existing shareholders But a bigger concern is that I’m not clear what stops this happening again in the future One reason Musk doesn’t own 25% of Tesla is because he sold stock to buy the business formerly known as Twitter In my view it’s not up to shareholders to reimburse that with more equity Warren Buffett says the time to be greedy is when others are fearful – and people seem pessimistic with Tesla right now But while I think some of that is short-sighted I see real issues here There’s a real possibility that things could turn around quickly for Tesla It’s not unimaginable that the macroeconomic environment could improve and the issue with Musk’s demands blows over If that happens then I wouldn’t be at all surprised to see the stock rally sharply reversing its losses from this year and much more besides But that might be a big ‘if’ It’s impossible to say whether or not pessimism around Tesla shares has reached its peak But right now expectations built into the share price are much lower than they were at the start of January Should you invest the value of your investment may rise or fall and your capital is at risk Before investing your individual circumstances should be assessed Consider taking independent financial advice Stephen Wright has no position in any of the shares mentioned The Motley Fool UK has recommended Tesla Views expressed on the companies mentioned in this article are those of the writer and therefore may differ from the official recommendations we make in our subscription services such as Share Advisor Hidden Winners and Pro Here at The Motley Fool we believe that considering a diverse range of insights makes us better investors 26 March 2024 Christopher Ruane After an upbeat quarterly trading statement for its retail business our writer still has no interest in buying Ocado shares… Read more » 26 March 2024 Alan Oscroft An early 8% rise in the Ocado share price after the latest news?

unit","2/7/2024","https://fortune.com/2024/02/07/ford-earnings-electric-vehicles-smaller-cheaper-tesla-china-ultimate-competition/","Ford Motor Co is working on inexpensive small electric vehicles to stem its electric vehicle losses and take on Tesla Inc and Chinese automakers Chief Executive Officer Jim Farley revealed the plans to analysts Tuesday after the automaker announced adjusted earnings per share of 29 cents more than double the 13 cents analysts expected on average Fourth quarter revenue of $46 billion surpassed the $403 billion analysts expected Ford is recalibrating its EV strategy to move away from large expensive EVs because high prices are the biggest barrier to convincing mainstream car buyers to go electric Farley said “We’re also adjusting our capital switching more focus onto smaller EV products” Farley told analysts on a conference call He said Ford “made a bet in silence two years ago” to develop a team to create a low-cost EV platform The small team is being led by Alan Clarke executive director of advanced EV development who came to Ford two years ago after more than 12 years developing models for Tesla The new EV platform will be the basis of “several types of vehicles” Farley said which should generate a profit Ford’s current battery powered models lost $47 billion last year and projects the losses will grow to as much as $55 billion this year “We are nowhere near our earnings potential” Farley said “All of our EV teams are ruthlessly focused on cost and efficiency in our EV products because the ultimate competition is going to be the affordable Tesla and the Chinese” model EVs As electric vehicle sales slow Farley is attempting to thread the needle between scaling back the company’s EV spending by $12 billion while dialing up output of traditional internal combustion engine models which generate profits needed to fund future growth Play Video For the current year Ford forecast earnings of $10 billion to $12 billion before interest and taxes compared with $104 billion on that basis in 2023 That result was on the high end of the $10 billion to $105 billion the company predicted in November when it lowered guidance following a six-week strike the by the United Auto Workers union As part of that initiative to wring out more profits the carmaker plans $2 billion in cost cuts targeting areas such as materials freight and manufacturing operations Read more: Ford Dumps Automated Parallel Parking Feature to Cut Costs “We expect the stock to trade up” on the better-than-expected quarterly results and bullish full-year guidance Wells Fargo said in a research note written by analysts led by Colin Langan Ford shares rose 55% at 9:39 am in New York Through Tuesday’s close the stock was down 1% on the year The automaker is giving investors a supplemental dividend of 18 cents a share in addition to the regular 15-cent quarterly dividend both payable on March 1 to shareholders of record on Feb 16 In December the automaker halved production of electric F-150 Lightning pickups while boosting output of its highly profitable Bronco sport-utility vehicles and Ranger pickup trucks Chief Financial Officer John Lawler told analysts the company no longer expects to reach its 8% margin goal on EVs by 2026 Ford’s 2023 EV deficit translated to a loss of roughly $28000 on each battery powered model it sold according to an analysis by Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Joel Levington who noted those losses are “unsustainable” A bright spot is hybrid gas-electric vehicles which Ford has pivoted to in response to strong consumer demand Farley said he expects sales of hybrid models to grow 40% this year up from last year’s 25% jump in sales of those powertrains The Dearborn Michigan-based automaker also faces higher labor costs than its crosstown rival General Motors Co which wowed Wall Street last week with a 2024 forecast of $12 billion to $14 billion in earnings before interest and taxes GM has said the contract it struck with the UAW will add about $575 in costs per car while Ford predicts an increase of up to $900 per vehicle due to the record deal that increases workers’ wages by 33% over four-and-a-half-years “GM is better set up to absorb those labor costs because they already had a healthier cost base in North America” David Whiston an analyst with Morningstar Inc in Chicago said in an interview before Ford posted results “And Ford has more UAW employees in the US than GM” In its traditional internal combustion engine business known as Ford Blue the company earned $813 million before interest and taxes in the fourth quarter less than the $8665 million analysts expected Ford’s US sales rose less than 1% in the fourth quarter as the UAW strike cost it production of high profit models such as the F-Series Super Duty pickup truck and the Explorer SUV In its commercial business known as Ford Pro the automaker earned $181 billion before interest and taxes more than the $143 Billion analysts expected Bloomberg Intelligence predicts Ford Pro will see margins expand this year while its Ford Blue unit will experience margin pressure as pricing drops because dealers have replenished their lots with inventory after pandemic-related shortages “Ford profit is on a tightrope as the transition to electric vehicles takes longer than expected requiring right-sizing to cut EV losses while managing increased pricing competition for Ford Blue” BI analysts Steve Man and Peter Lau wrote in a Feb 2 note “Our scenario sees US electric-vehicle sales climbing 9% this year after growing at a compounded annual rate of 65% over the past three years” © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited All Rights Reserved Use of this site constitutes acceptance of our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy

Here it’s worth remembering that despite recent downturns Tesla’s stock has still grown more than 500% in the 2020s so far and has time and again bounced back from public setbacks to push investor portfolios higher Crucially Tesla is a leader in a market that’s still emerging and with Morningstar forecasts suggesting that the EV manufacturer will deliver over 5 million vehicles annually by 2030 while reducing its manufacturing costs on a per-vehicle basis there’s every sign that the falling stock represents good value for a long-term hold among investors Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) was the star of the 2023 semiconductor boom that went under the radar Having doubled its market capitalization in the past year the stock offers diversified options to a range of clients without the cost and hype surrounding players like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) With a GAAP-measured trailing-12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 321x Broadcom appears far more grounded than the likes of Nvidia all while still displaying impressive levels of growth Broadcom’s Q4 2023 fiscal net revenue increased 4% year-over-year and total revenue climbed 8% last year to a company-record $358 billion According to Broadcom CEO Hock Tan the positive quarterly results at the end of last year were down to “investments in accelerators and network connectivity for AI by hyperscalers” Having announced in September 2023 that Symantec a division of Broadcom will be partnering with Google Cloud to embed generative AI into the Symantec Security platform to offer greater protection against cyber attacks there’s a lot more to come from this impressive semiconductor stock On the date of publication Dmytro Spilka did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer subject to the InvestorPlacecom Publishing Guidelines Dmytro is a finance and investing writer based in London He is also the founder of Solvid Pridicto and Coinprompter His work has been published in Nasdaq Kiplinger FXStreet Entrepreneur VentureBeat and InvestmentWeek Growth Stocks Article printed from InvestorPlace Media https://investorplacecom/2024/02/3-must-own-growth-stocks-as-consumer-confidence-sweeps-wall-street/ ©2024 InvestorPlace Media LLC Stocks to Buy Stocks to Buy Todays Market Stocks to Buy Todays Market Stocks to Buy Crypto & Blockchain Stocks to Buy Financial Market Data powered by FinancialContent Services Inc All rights reserved Nasdaq quotes delayed at least 15 minutes all others at least 20 minutes Copyright © 2024 InvestorPlace Media LLC All rights reserved 1125 N Charles St Baltimore MD 21201 Not Yet a Premium Subscriber?

The biggest drivers behind Woods financial model are the number of cars Tesla will be able to produce in the future as well as additional revenue streams for the business By 2027 Wood assumes that only 47% of Teslas total revenue will be derived from EVs This is because she believes that Teslas progress in self-driving car technology will put it at the forefront of a new industry More specifically Wood believes Tesla is on the verge of launching a robotaxi fleet The advent of robotaxis could significantly impact ride-hailing and delivery businesses alike as it represents a major cost-savings opportunity Furthermore Arks research suggests that the robotaxi business will carry much higher margins compared to Teslas EVs given their recurring revenue Should this be the case Tesla could enjoy accelerated profitability and free cash flow -- which it can use to reinvest in more growth areas The combination of Teslas rising EV production industry-leading battery technology and the potential of autonomous driving results in an estimated share price of $2000 by 2027 in Woods base case Given Teslas current share price Wood is calling for a nearly 800% increase within the next few years Going off of Woods forecast alone is not reason enough to believe Tesla stock has immense upside While all eyes are on the companys self-driving capabilities Tesla has other use cases for AI as well Its humanoid robot Optimus could upend the labor market and warehouse operations To me the biggest question marks revolve around when Tesla will begin commercializing these new products Although investors occasionally get updates on Teslas AI endeavors during earnings calls it is not yet known how far away monetization is These reasons make it obvious that Wood is assuming that a lot goes right for Tesla in a relatively short amount of time Teslas forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 58 is the highest among its Magnificent Seven cohorts and its not even close I think this is a good indication that investors are broadly more bullish on Teslas prospects relative to other megacap tech companies This could signal that the potential of AI is already priced into Teslas share price -- at least to some degree Ive held Tesla stock for years and plan to continue doing so While her research is interesting to read I am not overly concerned about (or overly confident in) Woods lofty price targets For now Ill treat share price forecasts as speculation and instead continue monitoring Teslas operating results and AI roadmap Overall I think further gains are very much in store for Tesla shareholders and I am excited to see how AI plays an integral role in the evolution of the business Where to invest $1000 right now When our analyst team has a stock tip it can pay to listen After all the newsletter they have run for two decades Motley Fool Stock Advisor has more than tripled the market* They just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now and Tesla made the list -- but there are 9 other stocks you may be overlooking See the 10 stocks *Stock Advisor returns as of January 8 2024 Randi Zuckerberg a former director of market development and spokeswoman for Facebook and sister to Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg is a member of The Motley Fools board of directors John Mackey former CEO of Whole Foods Market an Amazon subsidiary is a member of The Motley Fool’s board of directors Suzanne Frey an executive at Alphabet is a member of The Motley Fool’s board of directors Adam Spatacco has positions in Alphabet Amazon Apple Meta Platforms Microsoft Nvidia and Tesla The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Alphabet Amazon Apple Meta Platforms Microsoft Nvidia and Tesla The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy Cathie Wood Thinks This Magnificent Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock-Split Stock Could Surge 777% was originally published by The Motley Fool Related Quotes"

1004,"A power play at Tesla could give investors a painful shock","1/18/2024","https://fortune.com/2024/01/18/elon-musk-stake-voting-control-tesla/","Hi folks senior tech reporter Kylie Robison here This week the world’s richest man is asking for more money and power because of course “I am uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in AI & robotics without having ~25% voting control” Musk tweeted “Enough to be influential but not so much that I can’t be overturned” He currently has a 13% stake in the electric car manufacturer after selling a big chunk of his shares in Tesla to help fund his $44 billion acquisition of Twitter (now known as X) He added that unless he’s able to secure the 25% voting control he’d “prefer to build products outside of Tesla” Perhaps Musk is having a touch of Zuck envy The Meta CEO and Facebook founder has 61% voting control of his company thanks to special supervoting shares In fact dual share structures are the norm in founder-led tech companies: Alphabet Snap Pinterest and Palantir all have them The idea in theory is to give “visionary” tech entrepreneurs the leeway to focus on long-term bets without meddling from pesky investors hungry for short-term profits And to Musk’s credit his track record of executing on long-term bets (from electric cars to reusable rockets) looks pretty strong compared to say the leaders of Snap or Pinterest “If I have 25% it means I am influential but can be overridden if twice as many shareholders vote against me vs for me” Musk noted in a tweet “At 15% or lower the for/against ratio to override me makes a takeover by dubious interests too easy I would be fine with a dual class voting structure to achieve this but am told it is impossible to achieve post-IPO in Delaware” Still Musk’s threat to move AI development out of Tesla (which livestreamed splashy “AI day” events for a couple of years) if he doesn’t get what he wants is not exactly a diplomatic or collaborative way to go about it And his request comes at a strange time Musk is still in the midst of a lawsuit regarding his whopping $56 billion pay package which he references in the post where his time spent “on the clock” so to speak at Tesla is under some scrutiny Not long ago Tesla shareholders were concerned about Musk’s time split between his companies: SpaceX Neuralink Boring Company xAI and X even taking to the platform he owns to voice their displeasure “There is no TSLA CEO today” Gary Black managing partner of Future Fund LLC which holds approximately $50 million in Tesla shares posted a year ago “The market voted today that the $TSLA brand has been negatively impacted by the Twitter drama Where before EV buyers were proud to drive their Teslas to their friends or show off Teslas in their driveways now the Twitter controversy is hurting Tesla’s brand equity” Black told the Wall Street Journal at the time What’s more Musk’s erratic posts about anti-Semitic conspiracy theories and the Journal’s explosive exposé on his alleged drug use hardly bolster his argument for increased influence over the $675 billion automaker Yet as Bloomberg’s Matt Levine points out “his companies need to compete for his attention and that competition is expensive” So maybe the board will give him what he wants I’m doubtful it’ll get them more of his attention though His hands are rather full I mean I just watched him play Diablo for 3 hours He’s a busy busy man!

1006,"Tesla Stock: When You Get a Dip Get on Board the Ship","1/20/2024","https://investorplace.com/2024/01/tesla-stock-when-you-get-a-dip-get-on-board-the-ship/","Countdown to Luke Lango’s “2nd Trillion-Dollar AI Trade” The US govt just unlocked an $8 trillion market to move in a new direction See how it could unleash 6000% potential upside Dont let every scary-sounding headline steer you away from TSLA stock Advertisement Source: sdx15 / Shutterstockcom Do you want to be a beginner or a professional? Beginners get shaken out of perfectly good stock positions with each and every headline Meanwhile professional investors know that Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is a leader among electric vehicle manufacturers They stand by their investments and I encourage you to buy and hold TSLA stock when it dips even if the headlines are sometimes scary EV stocks and technology stocks had a rough start to 2024 Tesla stock was no exception but that’s not necessarily bad news If anything it’s just an opportunity to decide for yourself whether it’s time to add to your Tesla share stake Most times the headline risk surrounding Tesla is overblown and big-picture thinkers end up winning practically every time From a technical standpoint it’s very interesting that TSLA stock’s 52-week high is $29929 Is there some mysterious force that’s preventing the stock from breaking above $300? There’s no need to get into conspiracy theories when the negative pressure on Tesla stock can be explained Technology stocks fell in early 2024 so that’s one contributing factor Tesla’s trailing price-to-earnings ratio probably needed to come down from its high level Tesla’s GAAP trailing P/E ratio was around 73x in mid-January so it wouldn’t be too shocking if Tesla stock dipped for a little while longer There were also scary headlines to shake out beginner stock traders Here’s a sampling of the negative news items: That list doesn’t even include the controversial things that Musk says and does There’s an overarching theme here: assume that volatility is par for the course if you’re going to buy and hold Tesla stock Now I can add two more items to the list of things to worry about First Tesla reduced the prices of its vehicles in China again Specifically the automaker lowered the prices of its Model Y and Model 3 vehicles in China by 3% to 6% Like the other items on the “things to worry about” list I don’t consider Tesla’s latest round of price cuts to be a deal-breaker Tesla is doing what’s necessary to be competitive in China None of this negates the fact that Tesla reached its EV-delivery target and beat Wall Street’s delivery estimate in the company’s most recently reported quarter Finally I’ll give you one more scary headline: Tesla halted EV production at its German factory because of supply-chain disruptions in the Red Sea This like many other of Tesla’s issues is temporary and probably won’t substantially alter the company’s long-term growth story It’s important to be aware of these news stories You don’t have to let them scare you out of a perfectly good investment Remember there were plenty of off-putting headlines pertaining to Tesla in 2023 but Tesla stock still went up sharply It makes sense to hold a core position in TSLA stock and then add to that position if the share price drops 5% 10% or more That’s a sensible strategy if you believe that Tesla will continue to produce and deliver plenty of EVs So don’t obsess over the headlines too much and try to adopt the mindset of a professional instead of a beginner And when it’s falling – or even when it’s not falling – consider adding some shares of Tesla stock in your long-term holdings On the date of publication David Moadel did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer subject to the InvestorPlacecom Publishing Guidelines David Moadel has provided compelling content – and crossed the occasional line – on behalf of Motley Fool Crush the Street Market Realist TalkMarkets TipRanks Benzinga and (of course) InvestorPlacecom He also serves as the chief analyst and market researcher for Portfolio Wealth Global and hosts the popular financial YouTube channel Looking at the Markets Consumer Discretionary Automotive Electric Vehicles Article printed from InvestorPlace Media https://investorplacecom/2024/01/tesla-stock-when-you-get-a-dip-get-on-board-the-ship/ ©2024 InvestorPlace Media LLC Stocks to Buy Stocks to Buy Todays Market Stocks to Buy Todays Market Stocks to Buy Crypto & Blockchain Stocks to Buy Financial Market Data powered by FinancialContent Services Inc All rights reserved Nasdaq quotes delayed at least 15 minutes all others at least 20 minutes Copyright © 2024 InvestorPlace Media LLC All rights reserved 1125 N Charles St Baltimore MD 21201 Not Yet a Premium Subscriber?

1007,"Tesla: Sell-Off Likely To Accelerate On Weak Q4 Reporting","1/21/2024","https://seekingalpha.com/article/4664060-tesla-sell-off-likely-to-accelerate-weak-q4-reporting","Robert Way Robert Way Following Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) (NEOE:TSLA:CA) results for the September quarter I argued that the US leading EV maker is a Sell as I have pointed out slowing growth and weakening margins Since my argument got published TSLA shares have returned negative 4% while the S&P 500 gained 13% Looking ahead to Teslas Q4 earnings release which is expected to be published on the 24th of January after the market closes I am gaining more and more confidence in my bearish skew on Tesla expecting the sell-off for shares to accelerate In this article I explain why While I expect Tesla to report Q4 2023 results broadly in line with consensus estimates referencing $2575 billion in revenues and 075 cents EPS I see a large downside risk for commentary on 2024 guidance There are multiple variables to my negative thesis: Firstly I point out a broader macro weakness for EVs with volumes for electric vehicles trailing lofty expectations Specifically for Tesla the 50% CAGR expectation for deliveries should be crushed in 2024 with volumes likely growing below 20% Secondly competition against Chinese EV manufacturers appears to be intensifying as BYD starts to see booming international demand while Tesla has once again lowered prices of Model 3 in China to compete with more cost-conscious alternatives Thirdly Tesla is likely seeing more margin pressure on wage increases in the US Fourthly I point out fading investor confidence as a concern following Elon Musks suggestion that he may need new incentives to develop AI technologies On that note sentiment should also suffer from the recent Hertz announcement sharing plans to rebalance its vehicle fleet back to ICEs In recent days Tesla has experienced a series of developments that suggest negative implications for investors heading into 2024 Most notably I point out broader macro weakness for the global EV market with demand trailing lofty expectations To support this thesis I highlight that Ford has recently scaled down production in the electric F-150 model to push more production volume in favor of the ICE-powered sport-utility vehicles Bronco and Bronco Raptor as well as the Ranger and Ranger Raptor pickups The thesis of lower-than-expected consumer demand is also confirmed by Tesla itself with the EV maker delivering about 200k vehicles below previously established expectations of 2 million Interestingly Tesla fell short of its own target despite numerous price cuts throughout the year and easing supply-chain pressure as evidenced by rapidly falling production wait lists across geos Demand for EVs is certainly becoming an increasing problem for Tesla especially as mass consumer sentiment appears to reject the aggressive electrification push promoted by politics and large institutions such as Hertz On this note Hertz a major player in the car rental industry has recently announced plans to sell 20000 electric vehicles from its US fleet This number constitutes about a third of its global EV fleet The sales process began in December 2023 and is expected to continue throughout 2024 An interesting aspect of the decision by Hertz relates to the companys plan to reinvest a portion of the proceeds from the EV sales into ICE vehicles This strategy is likely a response to meet specific customer demands as suggested by management Moreover Hertzs CEO had previously highlighted in October 2023 that repair costs for EVs particularly collision and damage repairs can be nearly twice as high as those for ICE vehicles While Teslas fourth-quarter delivery numbers were ok delivering 484000 cars theres a growing consensus that 2024 could present significant challenges to the companys vehicle volume projections Specifically the expectation that Tesla could maintain a 50% compound annual growth rate in deliveries into 2024 and beyond is increasingly becoming questionable and farfetched due to factors highlighted in earlier arguments One key issue is the ability of Tesla to both increase demand for its vehicles and build them Scaling up 2023 deliveries to a 50% increase would mean selling 27 million cars in 2024 On that note consensus projection according to Refinitiv currently suggests delivery numbers for 2024 to be 219 million units a year over year growth of about 17% Meanwhile Barclays projected Teslas delivery numbers for 2024 to be around 197 million units only suggesting a year over year growth of less than 10% Personally I expect Tesla might set its delivery guidance for 2024 in the range of 20 - 21 million units aiming to establish reasonable projections early in the year to build a buffer for multiple disappointments throughout 2024 And while Teslas Elon Musk likely wont formally wave good-bye to the 50% CAGR projection the markets will certainly read this statement between the lines accordingly Looking beyond 2024 Tesla is in dire need of a new growth driver like the previously teased next-generation platform Talking about price cuts it is also disappointing to learn that Tesla has reportedly once again lowered the retail selling price for the Model 3 and Y in China crushing investors hope that the price-driven margin pressure may fade In detail Tesla has recently announced that the base MSRP for the standard-range Model 3 and Model Y should be cut by 59% and 28% respectively Additionally prices for long-range variants of both models were lowered by 2%-4% Meanwhile outside of China Tesla is facing an increasing supply push from low-cost competitors such as BYD and Xpeng In fact in December 2023 BYD even managed to take Teslas crown as the worlds leading EV manufacturer While Tesla delivered 484000 cars in the fourth quarter surpassing analysts expectations BYD shipped a record-breaking 526000 BEV units to customers Outside of China BYD delivered 36000 units in December alone bringing the volume of international sales to 243000 units for the entire year Compounding the challenges from the demand side Tesla is also increasingly facing margin compression due to escalating cost pressure Specifically I point out that in Q4 Tesla announced pay increases for its US production workers following growing unionization efforts and a historical win for the United Auto Workers (UAW) against the Big Three in Detroit Stellantis General Motors and Ford The wage increase announced by Tesla suggests a roughly 10% wage increase for production staff in the United States While the wage increase is significantly lower than what has been achieved by UAW workers the EBIT headwind for Tesla is nevertheless significant In act assuming that Tesla employs about 45000 production workers in the United States and the average annual compensation including benefits is around a reasonable $75000 and $85000 then a 10% increase would translate to an additional annual labor cost of approximately $340 - $380 million or a notable 3% headwind to 2024 consensus EBIT Meanwhile I also point out that Tesla is poised to suffer a negative margin impact from the Cybertruck ramp-up as commented on by Elon Musk: I mean we dug our own grave with Cybertruck the Cybertruck is one of those special products that comes along only once in a long while And special products that come along once in a long while are just incredibly difficult to bring to market to reach volume to be prosperous I do want to emphasize that there will be enormous challenges in reaching volume production with the Cybertruck and then in making a Cybertruck cash flow positive According to consensus estimates collected by Seeking Alpha Teslas EPS projection has started to fall throughout 2023 However I argue that estimates may still be too high Most notably EPS expectations have not yet fallen on the announced wage increases Personally I expect a fresh downward revision cycle for EPS estimates following the Q4 reporting on disappointing 2024 delivery guidance and cost projections Seeking Alpha Seeking Alpha Teslas Q4 earnings release is expected to show in-line results but there are strong downside risks for guidance As a broader theme going into 2024 the demand for EVs including Teslas vehicles is facing challenges and may not meet lofty expectations On that note margin pressure is increasing for Tesla due to wage increases and competition from low-cost competitors In line with my bearish sentiment on Teslas growth story I am highly concerned about the valuation backdrop with the companys enterprise value trading at 7x EV and 71x EBIT That said I expect negative momentum on Tesla shares to accelerate post Q4 reporting with shares accelerating their path toward a more reasonable valuation which I see at minimum 20% lower This article was written by Analyst’s Disclosure: I/we have no stock option or similar derivative position in any of the companies mentioned and no plans to initiate any such positions within the next 72 hours I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha) I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Not financial advice Seeking Alphas Disclosure: Past performance is no guarantee of future results No recommendation or advice is being given as to whether any investment is suitable for a particular investor Any views or opinions expressed above may not reflect those of Seeking Alpha as a whole Seeking Alpha is not a licensed securities dealer broker or US investment adviser or investment bank Our analysts are third party authors that include both professional investors and individual investors who may not be licensed or certified by any institute or regulatory body"

Trade” The US govt just unlocked an $8 trillion market to move in a new direction See how it could unleash 6000% potential upside These EV stocks will grow bigger and stronger Advertisement Source: Sopotnicki / Shutterstockcom Within a long-term bull market there can be intermediate corrections A 30% to 40% decline in stocks before a fresh rally is not uncommon in high-growth industries The reason is that markets always tend to react on extremes A good example of my point is electric vehicle (EV) stocks As the EV sector faces some near-term headwinds EV stocks have been depressed In my view this is a golden opportunity to accumulate for the next five years and potentially beyond Global electric vehicle adoption still has a long way to go and is being backed by policymakers To put things into perspective global EV sales were approximately 14 million units last year It’s expected that global electric car stock will expand to 350 million vehicles by 2030 By the end of the decade more than 60% of vehicles sold globally will be EVs Therefore there is a big growth opportunity ahead and it’s a good time to buy some of the best EV stocks This column discusses three names that can be massive value creators I believe it’s the negative sentiments for the Chinese markets that have depressed Li Auto (NASDAQ:LI) stock At a forward price-earnings ratio of 30 the high-growth name is trading at a deep valuation gap With positive business developments sustaining it’s a good time to remain invested in LI stock For the last year Li reported stellar deliveries growth of 1822% on a year-on-year (YoY) basis to 376030 vehicles Strong deliveries growth will likely sustain in 2024 One reason is the impending mass delivery launch of LI MEGA in March Further Li Auto has been aggressively expanding its retail network within China With greater reach in tier-two cities there is ample headroom for growth I also like the fact that Li Auto has a strong balance sheet As of Q3 2023 the company reported a cash buffer of $1213 billion Additionally Li reported free cash flow of $18 billion for the quarter There is high financial flexibility to invest in innovation and potential international expansion Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock slumped after the company announced Q4 numbers I believe this presents a good opportunity to accumulate the stock over the next few months With ambitious growth plans Tesla has a positive long-term growth outlook The first point to note is that Tesla reported adjusted EBITDA margin of 157% in Q4 2023 Margin contracted by 652 basis points YoY Having said that Tesla reported operating and free cash flow of $133 billion and $44 billion respectively It’s worth noting that Tesla is working towards next-generation vehicles with half the cost compared to Model 3 or Model Y Going forward relatively low margins might be the new reality However Tesla is positioned to benefit from the perspective of volume growth if low-cost cars are launched for emerging markets I must add here that the pipeline looks attractive Cybertruck is in the mass production stage with Tesla Semi in pilot production Roadster and the next-generation platform are in the pipeline Therefore there are multiple reasons to be bullish on growth in the next few years Panasonic Holdings (OTCMKTS:PCRFY) stock has remained sideways in the last 12 months I believe a strong breakout on the upside is imminent after the consolidation At a forward price-earnings ratio of 9 the stock looks undervalued Further PCRFY stock also offers an attractive dividend yield of 246% An important point to note is that Panasonic Holdings has ambitious growth plans The company plans to quadruple EV battery capacity to 200GWh by 2031 This expansion will likely be associated with EBITDA margin expansion I therefore expect healthy cash flow growth from the business through the decade On the innovation front Panasonic is targeting a boost in energy density of the 2170 cell That is likely to translate into a reduction in overall EV cost At the same time battery productivity will be enhanced Expansion coupled with innovation will ensure that Panasonic maintains or potentially increases market share With these positives PCRFY is positioned for multibagger returns in the coming years On the date of publication Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or

1017,"Elon Musks $55 billion Tesla CEO compensation gets voided by judge","1/30/2024","https://electrek.co/2024/01/30/elon-musk-billion-tesla-ceo-compensation-voided-by-judge/","A Delaware judge has sided with Tesla shareholders who filed a lawsuit claiming that Elon Musk unjustly secured a $55 billion CEO compensation plan The plan is now voided by the court It’s unclear what will come out of this unique situation where Musk could potentially have to give back billions of dollars worth of Tesla shares In 2018 Tesla shareholders voted for Elon Musk to get a historic new CEO compensation package that could be worth $55 billion for the executive if Tesla achieved remarkable growth in valuation and profits which it did However some shareholders argued that Musk unfairly secured this extremely generous compensation plan through misleading shareholders about the fact that the plan was being put together by an independent board They filed a complaint in court in Delaware The case went to trial in 2022 but it took a long time for the judge to give her decision The case came back into the news lately as Musk discussed another potentially historical CEO compensation plan at Tesla as he seeks to get 25% voting control over the company His stake in Tesla is currently down to about 13% (~18% if he ends up being able exercise some stock options left from his compensation plan) after he sold tens of billions worth of Tesla stocks to buy Twitter Musk said that Tesla was waiting on the judge’s decision before moving ahead with the new compensation plan The decision finally came today Delaware Chancery Court Chief Judge Kathaleen St J McCormick sided with the shareholders who filed the complaint: This posttrial decision enters judgment for the plaintiff finding that the compensation plan is subject to review under the entire fairness standard the defendants bore the burden of proving that the compensation plan was fair and they failed to meet their burden Musk briefly commented on the judgment which he is most likely going to appeal on X: Never incorporate your company in the state of Delaware In short the judge found that “Musk controlled Tesla” at the time the compensation package was put together: The collection of features characterizing Musk’s relationship with Tesla and its directors gave him enormous influence over Tesla In addition to his 219% equity stake Musk was the paradigmatic “Superstar CEO” who held some of the most influential corporate positions (CEO Chair and founder) enjoyed thick ties with the directors tasked with negotiating on behalf of Tesla and dominated the process that led to board approval of his compensation plan At least as to this transaction Musk controlled Tesla An interesting caveat to the decision is that Musk’s lawyers had the option to shift the burden of proof that the compensation package was unfair to the plaintiff but only if the package approved by “fully informed vote of the majority of the minority stockholders” Of course Tesla shareholders voted for the plan but the judge found that “the defendants were unable to prove that the stockholder vote was fully informed because the proxy statement inaccurately described key directors as independent and misleadingly omitted details about the process” Therefore an important part of this case relied on the judge agreeing with the plaintiff that the board members behind the package were not “independent” Here’s how the judge describes how it wasn’t even clear who was negotiating on Musk’s behalf versus Tesla’s behalf: The process leading to the approval of Musk’s compensation plan was deeply flawed Musk had extensive ties with the persons tasked with negotiating on Tesla’s behalf He had a 15-year relationship with the compensation committee chair Ira Ehrenpreis The other compensation committee member placed on the working group Antonio Gracias had business relationships with Musk dating back over 20 years as well as the sort of personal relationship that had him vacationing with Musk’s family on a regular basis The working group included management members who were beholden to Musk such as General Counsel Todd Maron who was Musk’s former divorce attorney and whose admiration for Musk moved him to tears during his deposition In fact Maron was a primary gobetween Musk and the committee and it is unclear on whose side Maron viewed himself Yet many of the documents cited by the defendants as proof of a fair process were drafted by Maron After hearing from both sides the judge found that there was “no meaningful negotiation over any of the terms of the plan” Musk’s lawyers tried to argue that the CEO made some “concessions” as part of negotiations but the judge didn’t buy it In this litigation the defendants touted as concessions certain features of the compensation plan—a five-year holding period an M&A adjustment and a 12- tranche structure that required Tesla to increase market capitalization by $100 billion more than Musk had initially proposed to maximize compensation under the plan But the holding period was adopted in part to increase the discount on the publicly disclosed grant price the M&A adjustment was industry standard and the 12-tranche structure was reached in an effort to translate Musk’s fully-diluted-share proposal to the board’s preferred total-outstanding-shares metric It is not accurate to refer to these terms as concessions I think the part that bothers me most on this entire story is that when this was voted in NO ONE believed that Tesla would come close to hitting even the first “step” in this package It’s like everyone has forgotten just how badly almost the entire world was set against this company during this time Not a single player in the industry felt they would succeed No one seriously thought there would be a third fourth and even fifth vehicle And actually turn a profit? Nada And if Tesla had followed that path then this lawsuit would have never happened If absolutely NOTHING changed in this story except Tesla failed to grow and expand into what it has become then there would be no lawsuit This was never about not being properly informed or bad arms length negotiations This has always been about whether Elon got “too much money” And that is what bothers me: all this legal dancing would still be just as a valid … just no one would care One of the main arguments from Tesla shareholders who are against this lawsuit is that “it was good for everyone” Yes Elon gets 6% more of Tesla but Tesla gets $600 billion more in valuation The judge had an answer to this argument: At a high level the “6% for $600 billion” argument has a lot of appeal But that appeal quickly fades when one remembers that Musk owned 219% of Tesla when the board approved his compensation plan This ownership stake gave him every incentive to push Tesla to levels of transformative growth—Musk stood to gain over $10 billion for every $50 billion in market capitalization increase Musk had no intention of leaving Tesla and he made that clear at the outset of the process and throughout this litigation Moreover the compensation plan was not conditioned on Musk devoting any set amount of time to Tesla because the board never proposed such a term Swept up by the rhetoric of “all upside” or perhaps starry eyed by Musk’s superstar appeal the board never asked the $558 billion question: Was the plan even necessary for Tesla to retain Musk and achieve its goals?

Several factors are likely to propel Shopify stock’s market cap growth trajectory over the next decade Shopify is a significant player in a fast-growing global e-commerce market A late 2023 research report by the Boston Consulting Group forecasts that e-commerce could capture 41% of global retail by 2027 up from just 18% in 2017 – to mark a decade of strong growth Shopify is participating in this growth as it powers all sizes of merchants’ businesses Most noteworthy Shopify is employing generative artificial intelligence (AI) the latest breakthrough technology that could significantly increase customer retention through “compelling” product recommendations and cross selling Further the company’s omnichannel dominance should propel revenue growth forward Shopify bridges the gap between physical storefronts and e-commerce Brick-and-mortar stores’ adoption of Shopify’s “Buy Online Pick Up In-Store” meets the Gen Z and Gen X evolving consumer preferences The company’s platforms are increasingly more relevant in an evolving business landscape Lastly Shopify’s subscription-based business model generates predictable recurring revenue – a valuable stock attribute in volatile markets The company’s cash flows may show less cyclicality Bay Street analysts project a 508% long-term earnings growth rate for Shopify While Tesla is still a leader in the electric vehicle (EV) industry revolution the company’s path forward is increasingly fraught with significant hurdles Competition is intensifying Telsa recently lost its number one position as the biggest seller of electric vehicles by volume to Chinese EV maker BYD Traditional automakers are rapidly ramping up their EV offerings and some have already surpassed Tesla in battery technology cost and range A new wave of EV superpowers is emerging from unlikely sources – mostly Chinese Resultantly Tesla’s market share is under attack from left right and centre Secondly potential recessions and global geopolitical scuffles could dampen consumer demand for Tesla’s high-priced vehicles Most noteworthy Tesla’s high valuation defies traditional metrics and could be vulnerable to a correction if market sentiment sours Tesla stock fetches a price-to-sales (P/S) multiple of 69 while an average car manufacturer is valued at a comparable multiple of 07 The EV leader’s premium could be attached to its high-tech innovation track record and the “Elon Musk factor” However competitor Mercedes Benz beat Tesla to a licensed Level 3 autonomous driving vehicle in 2023 And Elon Musk could still leave the company at some point Wall Street analysts forecast a 156% average long-term growth rate on Tesla’s earnings – a much slower rate compared to Shopify’s 508% This writer has no crystal ball but here’s a possible scenario: On one hand Shopify’s e-commerce advantage industry growth and a resilient revenue base could propel its value higher Its AI-powered e-commerce and payments platforms should continue to gain global traction and break language barriers solidifying SHOP’s dominance in the global e-commerce space resulting in sustained revenue earnings and cash flow growth – and a steadily rising stock price On the other hand Tesla’s maturing business and its recent loss of the EV crown might decelerate revenue growth and dampen investor enthusiasm Increasing competition geopolitical risks and macroeconomic headwinds may put pressure on Tesla stock’s valuation Will Shopify stock’s market capitalization surpass Tesla’s by 2034? It’s a bold claim but not an entirely improbable one Explosive growth in e-commerce sustained innovation and a recurring revenue model could propel Shopify stock to unprecedented heights over the next decade Meanwhile Tesla is losing its crown and may face the headwinds of a maturing market and intensifying competition That said the race to the top could be a thrilling spectacle The valuation gap between the two contenders is still wide and Tesla will remain a moving target that can rally ahead if the EV pioneer embarks on another AI- and tech-driven innovation marathon Both stocks are capable investments to add to a diversified growth-oriented retirement plan portfolio The post Will Shopify Stock Be Worth More Than Tesla by 2034? appeared first on The Motley Fool Canada Before you buy stock in Tesla consider this: The Motley Fool Stock Advisor Canada analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Tesla wasn’t one of them The 10 stocks that made the cut could potentially produce monster returns in the coming years Consider MercadoLibre which we first recommended on January 8 2014 if you invested $1000 in the “eBay of Latin America” at the time of our recommendation you’d have $17988!* Stock Advisor Canada provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success including guidance on building a portfolio regular updates from analysts and two new stock picks each month – one from Canada and one from the US The Stock Advisor Canada service has outperformed the return of S&P/TSX Composite Index by 35 percentage points since 2013* See the 10 stocks * Returns as of 1/24/24 More reading 10 Stocks Every Canadian Should Own in 2024 [PREMIUM PICKS] Can You Guess the 10 Most Popular Canadian Stocks?

The past few days have been good news/bad news for Tesla investors Tesla produced a record of 185 million vehicles last year up 35% over 2022 At the same time China-based EV company BYD said its tally was slightly bigger Tesla is no longer the largest EV company in the world based on unit sales Tesla investors like to point out that most BYD models are sold in China only However China is the world’s largest car market Tesla still has half of the EV sales in America the world’s second-largest car market At least a dozen other companies are chasing it Some of them are huge multinationals including BMW Ford General Motors and Nissan None of these has produced a model that has sold well despite billions of dollars in EV R&D production design and marketing investments A much smaller group of EV companies hopes to take enough market share to survive These include Rivian and Lucid Neither of them has been able to sell more than a few thousand vehicles a year And each has a balance sheet that must make investors wonder how long it will be in business Among Tesla’s huge advantages is its universally recognized brand It does not need expensive marketing campaigns Many Americans think the EV industry in the United States is Tesla The company is in the headlines almost every day as is Musk Tesla stock has more than one hurdle to clear to continue its run Among these are investigations into the safety of its vehicles particularly the autonomous driving features There have been some deadly accidents when this system was engaged Tesla’s defense has been primarily that drivers who were hurt or killed were not using the system based on the safety rules given to owners (Here are five reasons to avoid Tesla’s Cybertruck no matter what) Tesla will have more competition Too much money flows into the EV manufacturing market for all these efforts to fail Even if large car companies only get a few percentage points of overall US sales Tesla’s market share will continue to dip Tesla has started a price war to keep its sales high The tactic has worked but the discounts also hurt margins The formidable issue facing all EV companies is the reluctance of the American car buyer EVs can take hours to charge A driver can fill a gasoline tank in a few minutes EV chargers are scarce outside large metro areas There are 145000 gas stations in America Many EVs have a range of only 300 miles Can Tesla stock rise another 100% this year?

Lango’s “2nd Trillion-Dollar AI Trade” The US govt just unlocked an $8 trillion market to move in a new direction See how it could unleash 6000% potential upside These companies have life-change potential Advertisement Source: ImageFlow/Shutterstockcom In an era where the market shifts at breakneck speed millionaire-maker stocks can pop at any minute Identifying potential investment avenues is critical to navigating a constantly changing landscape These millionaire-maker stocks represent market giants and catalysts reshaping consumer discretionary technology finance and automobile sectors Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has rapidly accumulated over 05 billion miles (Q3 2023) driven with the Full Self-Driving beta This indicates the company’s significant progress in AI development which is crucial for achieving full vehicle autonomy Elon Musk stresses Tesla’s unique method of converting large input data into concise outputs Tesla can become a leader in self-driving technology with this AI-focused strategy Tesla completed a 10K GPU cluster of H100s highlighting their focus on large-scale deployment of advanced computing infrastructure This technology enables faster production of high-compute units crucial for training AI models Implementing this computing infrastructure could give Tesla a competitive edge in self-driving capabilities Finally Tesla deployed 4 gigawatt hours of energy storage products in Q3 indicating a substantial increase in its energy division Tesla’s highest-margin business contributed over $05 billion to quarterly profit Focusing on energy storage aligns with Tesla’s strategy to diversify revenue and meet the demand for sustainable energy solutions and makes TSLA one of the millionaire-maker stocks on the rise Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) staggering surge in operating income by 343% year-over-year is noteworthy (Q3 2023) reflecting effective strategic changes These changes focused on cost optimizations operational efficiency enhancements and strategic investments in high-return areas Amazon’s transition to eight regional fulfillment networks in the US was a major operational change This change has positively impacted Amazon’s cost-to-serve metrics customer experiences and operational efficiency Overall the optimized regional fulfillment clusters reduced distances and improved delivery speeds have lowered costs and enhanced customer satisfaction Thus focusing on shorter travel distances and fewer touches in the delivery process has helped achieve faster delivery speeds a crucial factor influencing customer buying behavior Microsoft’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) robust start to fiscal 2024 (Q1) was underpinned by the exceptional growth in Microsoft Cloud The cloud has recorded quarterly revenue surpassing $318 billion marking a substantial 24% increase This substantial growth reflects the increasing adoption of Microsoft’s cloud services by businesses worldwide The company’s proactive cloud strategies have resulted in impressive figures Azure Microsoft’s cloud service is gaining market share as organizations move to the cloud Additionally Azure Arc has witnessed a 140% increase in customers totaling 21K The company provides services for the Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) database further simplifying customer migration and contributing to Azure’s allure as a preferred cloud provider Finally Microsoft’s focus on consolidating its Microsoft Intelligent Data Platform has attracted significant adoption with over 73% of the Fortune 1000 currently using three or more data solutions Lastly over 16K customers have actively used Microsoft Fabric This includes more than 50% of the Fortune 500 indicating the platform’s efficacy in unifying computing storage and governance for analytical purposes MSFT easily makes any list of millionaire-maker stocks YouTube a subsidiary of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) continues to be a thriving platform for advertising revenue The revenues from YouTube advertising surged to $8 billion marking a substantial 12% year-on-year growth (Q3 2023) This growth was driven by both brand advertising and direct response initiatives The platform’s broad audience and diverse advertising formats sustain growth The success of YouTube Shorts and its increasing monetization capabilities averaging over 70 billion daily views and watched by over 2 billion signed-in users monthly showcase its potential for revenue expansion Alphabet’s diversification strategy is evident in the growth of other revenue streams Non-advertising revenues from YouTube amount to $83 billion and are growing by 21% This indicates the company’s success in monetizing its subscription services Finally YouTube TV and YouTube Music Premium contributed significantly to this revenue stream highlighting the company’s efforts to create alternative revenue channels beyond advertising Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKB) has a strong liquidity position and substantial investments are pivotal strengths contributing to its stability and growth potential As of Q3 2023 the company held $1520 billion in cash cash equivalents and US Treasury Bills with $1276 billion invested in US Treasury Bills Additionally investments in equity and fixed-maturity securities (excluding specific investments) amounted to $3411 billion Cash reserves and diversified investments serve multiple purposes It provides Berkshire Hathaway with liquidity for investments and support during market downturns The investment portfolio provides protection against market volatility Overall the company’s substantial holdings in US Treasury bills signify a conservative yet secure approach to preserving capital while generating modest returns Finally the sizable investments in equity and fixed-maturity securities reflect Berkshire Hathaway’s strategy to deploy capital across various asset classes Visa’s (NYSE:V) establishment of over 500 commercial partnerships with fintechs globally marked a 25% year-over-year increase (Q4 fiscal 2024) This signifies the company’s strategic efforts to collaborate with diverse players in the financial industry These partnerships let Visa access fintech innovation and agility The company grants startups and established players access to Visa’s network expertise and resources This mutually beneficial collaboration fosters the development of innovative payment solutions Hence this expands Visa’s market reach and enhances its competitive edge in the rapidly evolving financial technology landscape Visa focuses on expanding merchant locations by 17% particularly in Latin America Central Europe the Middle East and Africa (CEMEA) This underscores the company’s focus on broadening its footprint in high-growth markets Increasing merchant locations facilitates greater consumer access to Visa’s payment services and drives transaction volumes and revenue growth Breaking down JPMorgan Chase’s (NYSE:JPM) performance into segments provides a fundamental perspective on its diversified operations For instance there is a reported net income of $53 billion on revenue of $17 billion (Q3 2023) This suggests the strength of this segment in contributing significantly to the company’s overall earnings Within Consumer and Community Banking Banking & Wealth Management showed a substantial 30% year-on-year revenue increase This is driven by higher net interest income due to increased rates The end-of-period deposits down 3% quarter-on-quarter might reflect a strategy shift or market trends However based on Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation data the leadership position in retail deposit share solidifies the company’s market presence and customer trust Finally with revenue up 7% year-on-year driven by higher NII in Card Services due to increased revolving balances and successful market share recapture in Auto this segment shows adaptability to market dynamics and customer preferences Thus despite some decreases in revenue in home lending the company maintained a strategic position by capitalizing on specific market trends and positioning itself as one of the millionaire-maker stocks to buy now As of this

Perhaps After all Tesla is invariably described in the financial media as an electric car company not an AI/robotics company Indeed as American financial journalist Herb Greenberg notes in his Substack newsletter Tesla’s own financial accounts confirm some 95 per cent of its revenue comes from “automotive” sources Tesla uses the words “automotive” and “automobile” 138 and 49 times respectively in its 10-K filing adds Greenberg – a lot more than “AI” (six) and “robotics” (three) Tesla’s regulatory filings contain various warnings about the competitive and cyclical nature of the global car market but warnings about AI or robotics are conspicuous by their absence Tesla bulls might say such snark ignores the fact markets have never valued Tesla as a mere car maker but as a tech stock of sorts True – but describing it as an AI/robotics company is pushing it © 2024 The Irish Times DAC © 2024 The Irish Times DAC"

Might hybrids be the preferred technology until a more efficient battery evolves? Will EV competition from established and new auto manufacturers upend Tesla’s market share? Maybe most critical could Toyota not Tesla be at the forefront of a significant technological advance for automobiles? With a price-to-earnings ratio of 9 for Toyota and 72 for Tesla the answers to our questions have critical implications for shareholders of both stocks Sales of EVs are multiplying The latest data shows that EVs will account for 9% of all domestic new car sales in 2024 That leaves plenty of upside for EV manufacturers if the US follows the path of other countries like Germany and China in which EVs represent approximately a third of all new car sales While the transition from internal combustion engines (ICE) to electric is sure to continue its pace appears to be moderating There are a few drawbacks affecting the uptake of EVs Consider the following: The obvious benefit for EV owners is fuel costs NADA estimates an EV owner will save approximately $5000 in gas and a few hundred dollars in maintenance costs over five years versus an ICE owner The market for EVs among early adapters and wealthier environmentally concerned consumers is starting to get saturated More car buyers will likely shift from ICE to EV but that transition will be slower than it has been for the more eager first adapters At one point Tesla’s market cap was almost equal to that of the entire auto industry Not only were Tesla investors projecting that Tesla would be the largest automaker but also that some of their other ventures like energy generation and robo-taxis would do fabulously well A lot has changed since then Tesla no longer has a monopoly on EVs Almost every auto manufacturer and a few new ones like Rivian and Fisker now manufactures EV cars as shown in the graph below courtesy of Cox Automotive Further consider the following paragraph from Cox Automotive: EV transaction prices in Q3 were down significantly from 2022 In an attempt to increase sales volume Tesla slashed prices which are now down roughly 25% year over year The price cuts have helped as Tesla’s Q3 sales grew by 195% year over year surpassing the industry’s overall growth rate of 163% However Tesla’s share of the EV segment continues to plunge hitting 50% in Q3 the lowest level on record and down from 62% in Q1 Bottom line: Tesla is losing its competitive advantage They are relinquishing EV market share and cutting prices ergo profits to stay competitive This discussion of hybrid automobiles does not refer to models with gas engines and battery packs that can be plugged into a power source As shown in the graph above Toyota lags every other automaker with only 05% of sales coming from EVs However Toyota has a different strategy regarding producing environmentally friendly vehicles They are the largest seller of hybrid cars The hybrid Prius was introduced to the US market in 2000 Toyota’s first mover experience gives them a unique advantage in profitably manufacturing hybrid vehicles Hybrid automobiles can get 35 to 50+ miles per gallon The technology enables a battery to capture a charge through its braking mechanism This electricity then supplements its internal combustion engine Consumer Reports estimates hybrids provide a 40% improvement in gas mileage versus non-hybrids The graphic below courtesy of CNBC shows that US sales of hybrids have easily kept up with EV sales since 2015 Car owners prefer better gas mileage and we presume many want to do their part to help the environment That said most auto consumers are not ready to fully commit to EVs We listed some reasons for the hesitation but likely the most important is the price The CNBC graphic below shows hybrids and ICE vehicles are similar in price while EVs are costlier We think hybrid vehicles can be the transitional technology of choice until a better EV battery evolves Many consumers seem to agree! The following is from a recent Wall Street Journal article entitled Toyota Motor reports rise in quarterly net profit as sales grew Executives at Japanese automakers that are strong in hybrids including Toyota and Honda say they are skeptical of competitors’ ability to catch up quickly They observe that it took some two decades for Japanese carmakers to bring their hybrids to profit-margin parity with purely gasoline-powered vehicles Hybrid sales grew last year at a faster clip than sales for pure electric vehicles in the US and some other markets Signs have emerged that the EV push might have gotten ahead of US consumers who are worried about charging problems and higher prices That has steered them toward less expensive hybrids which can be filled up with gasoline Automakers that had been rushing to pivot toward full EVs are now reconsidering General Motors said last week it would introduce some plug-in hybrid models in North America after facing pressure from dealers Ford Motor said last year it would seek to quadruple its hybrid sales in the next five years We now consider the next potential game changer for the auto industry: solid-state batteries Solid-state batteries promise to eliminate many problems associated with current EV lithium-ion batteries Lithium-ion batteries are heavy expensive to manufacture slow to charge and have a mileage range considered too short by many Solid-state batteries vastly improve on those problems However whether the technology can be mass-produced at reasonable costs is unclear Many experts believe Toyota is the leader in solid-state battery development Per Forbes: Toyota’s stated goal is for their solid-state batteries to ultimately have a range of >1200km and to go from 10 – 80% charge in 10 minutes or less This compares to the Tesla Model Y which currently has a range of 542 km and fast-charges in 27 minutes Other automakers are investing in solid-state battery development Toyota believes they will be the first to produce cars with solid-state batteries Production could come as early as 2027 The investment and production costs are enormous and there are no promises these batteries will make economic sense for consumers or manufacturers Tesla does not believe in the viability of solid-state technology and as far as the market knows it is not developing solid-state batteries Elon Musk is an innovator He knows that his current battery technology will fall behind his competitors if it is not improved Tesla is betting on 4680 batteries instead of solid-state The 4680 battery hopes to improve cost weight and energy density Per evlithiumcom the potential benefits are battery weight which may be about 10% lighter Additionally the cost of the batteries could be 15% cheaper and the driving distance on a charge could improve by 10-15% Such would be a decent improvement but it pales compared to the promise of solid-state batteries So with an appreciation for the role of hybrids EVs and solid-state batteries let’s compare Toyota to Tesla and better appreciate their comparative valuations and fundamentals Before looking at the valuation comparisons below consider that Tesla is a high-growth company while Toyota is mature Toyota is the world’s largest auto manufacturer while Tesla is ranked 15th Given its smaller size it is much easier for Tesla to gain global market share The potential for outsized growth is reflected in the valuations Tesla trades at valuations 6-8 times that of Toyota implying 6-8x excess growth for Tesla over the long run ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT The PEG ratio however tells a different story The PEG ratio divides each company’s P/E ratio by its 3-5-year expected earnings growth The ratio helps normalize the P/E ratio for companies with varying growth rates Based on the P/E and the PEG ratio the market implies earnings growth of 1905% for Toyota and 1244% for Tesla In addition to growing more rapidly than Toyota Tesla is more operationally and financially efficient EV cars have fewer parts making assembly quicker and cheaper Additionally Tesla’s revenue and earnings benefit from EV credits Lastly Tesla generates revenue from other sources While not currently sizable they skew the data and forecasts Toyota’s revenue has been relatively stagnant over the last five years while Tesla has grown by 33% a year on average Tesla’s cash flow growth is challenging to gauge as they are heavily reinvesting into production and R&D as shown by the tremendous growth in its capital expenditures Another indication that the companies are in different lifecycle stages is Tesla’s lack of dividends compared to Toyota’s healthy 355% yield Tesla has much less long-term debt than Toyota However if they are to continue growing rapidly debt will likely grow accordingly Investing in Tesla or Toyota is a bet on the future of automobiles Tesla shareholders hope the company will continue improving EV technology expanding its charging network and gain valuable market share Importantly it’s a wager that some version of the current lithium-ion battery technology is the future of EVs Tesla has other non-manufacturing ventures that may also be very profitable Toyota investors will do well if the company maintains its leadership in ICE vehicles and its hybrid models continue to gain market share Further if solid-state batteries are the preferred EV battery then Toyota may have a huge leg up on Tesla and the industry Toyota has a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 9 less than half of the S&P 500 and well below Tesla’s 72 It appears that Toyota offers a conservative investment in the state of the current auto industry with a potentially valuable option for the future via its considerable investment in solid-state batteries If solid-state batteries prove to be the next step in EVs Toyota may be the next Tesla In such a case Tesla may struggle if they don’t adapt to comparable technology However if solid-state technology is too costly Tesla may continue to gain market share and meet the lofty goals of its shareholders It’s worth disclaiming that other potential technologies such as hydrogen exist While we don’t discount them we limit this discussion to what is probable over the coming five years Toyota appreciates hybrid vehicles’ role in transitioning to more energy-efficient transportation While losing the EV battle they make up for it in hybrid sales More importantly they may have a better EV battery within a few years If Toyota can continue to dominate the hybrid space and make significant inroads into EVs later this decade via a solid-state battery its stock is cheap Tesla is a bet on Elon Musk and his proven ability to innovate Not only did he start the EV revolution but he is at the forefront of other exciting technologies How those fold into Tesla is unknown While Musk has proven to be a great horse to bet on Tesla’s price is very high At a P/E of 72 and a PEG ratio more than 10x its competitors Tesla investors are hoping for continued tremendous growth Importantly they are betting that Tesla will take significant market share from well-established automakers Given all he has accomplished it’s hard to bet against Elon Musk However we think Toyota may be the safer investment and the stock with more upside By Zerohedgecom More Top Reads From Oilpricecom: Back to homepage

1040,"Why Tesla May Settle in Texas While X Found Its Spot in Nevada","2/23/2024","https://news.virginia.edu/content/why-tesla-may-settle-texas-while-x-found-its-spot-nevada","(Illustration by Warren Craghead UVA School of Law) Immediately after a Delaware court in January declared Elon Musk’s lucrative $56 billion Tesla compensation package illegal the X and SpaceX owner pivoted to marketing two other states as business-friendlier havens for corporate charters “Never incorporate your company in the state of Delaware” Elon Musk posted “I recommend incorporating in Nevada or Texas if you prefer shareholders to decide matters” He then polled X users asking them whether the car company should move to Texas where Tesla is physically headquartered – and suggested that the 87% “yes” vote had decided the matter University of Virginia School of Law professor Michal Barzuza whose scholarship has exposed how Nevada deliberately structured its corporate law to protect executives like Musk has a different explanation for Musk’s apparent preference for Texas over Nevada: The Delaware court decision on his compensation doomed his initial plan to move the company to Nevada Musk incorporated his X holding company in Nevada then brought Twitter there after he took it private He’s made it clear in the past that he would like to move Tesla there as well Barzuza said But because Tesla is a publicly traded company Barzuza said reincorporation in Nevada would still require shareholders’ approval and Delaware’s courts might not count Musk’s shares in that vote tally “Since Nevada has significantly more protections on directors and officers a move to Nevada may be considered self-dealing and thus may trigger the entire fairness standard the same standard that [Delaware Court of Chancery Judge Kathaleen] McCormick applied to Musk’s compensation package” Barzuza said In the Tesla compensation case the court said Musk was a controlling shareholder In Delaware a conflicted controller transaction triggers the heightened scrutiny of the “entire fairness standard” As part of that standard a “majority of the minority” shareholders had to approve the compensation plan They did but the judge ruled they were not properly informed about their decision “The standard also requires that independent directors conduct arms-length negotiations with the controlling shareholder and the court found that Tesla directors lacked independence and ran a flawed process” she said Musk is seeing a similar scenario play out as shareholders ask the Delaware courts to intervene in TripAdvisor Inc’s attempt to reincorporate in Nevada Barzuza added TripAdvisor’s move was instigated by controlling shareholder Greg Maffei TripAdvisor shareholders are currently asking the Delaware court to refuse to count Maffei’s votes for the move and to scrutinize the board approval of the transaction under the entire fairness standard Musk is likely backing off moving to Nevada to avoid triggering such analysis Professor Michal Barzuza’s expertise in corporate law and the Musk issue was just featured in the Washington Post (Contributed photo) “Given Musk’s compensation result in Delaware it would be too risky for him to attempt a reincorporation to Nevada” Barzuza said “A move home to Texas would be an easier sell to shareholders than a move to Nevada and is less likely to trigger an entire fairness review given that Texas is not as protective to management and directors as Nevada is” There is another advantage Musk sees in Texas: Tesla employs more than 20000 people at an Austin factory roughly the same-sized workforce as that of the neighboring University of Texas With some projections that the company could soon hit the 60000-employee mark Tesla would become one of the largest employers in the state On Valentine’s Day Musk announced he was reincorporating SpaceX a privately held company to Texas – a gift that Gov Greg Abbott received with a warm greeting on X “When you provide income to so many employees you have political clout” Barzuza said “So in the future if he needs something he may be seeing the home state as a place that he could influence more” She cited a trend in the 1980s when firms that were incorporated and headquartered in other states lobbied their legislatures to get some protections from takeovers One prominent New York corporate lawyer famously circulated a client memo urging companies to consider leaving Delaware for states that supported companies’ ability to fight off takeovers “The companies were able to use their political clout within the state where their headquarters were to lobby for these rules” Barzuza said This all begs the question of why half of all public companies and two-thirds of Fortune 500 companies have incorporated in Delaware in the first place The state offers favorable tax laws a flexible incorporation law and 230 years of specialized corporate precedent to draw on when sorting out disputes according to experts So would a Tesla move to Texas be bad for shareholders? “I’m not that concerned about a mass migration of firms from Delaware but I am concerned about the pressure that would create on Delaware courts” Barzuza said “So now when the court does its job there’s a risk of firms leaving for the states where they are headquartered or to Nevada” Although Musk is frustrated with corporate law in Delaware Barzuza sees its protections as a boon to the shareholders and market integrity In an earlier paper she and David Smith from UVA’s McIntire School of Commerce found that Nevada attracts firms that are 30% to 40% more likely to report erroneous financial results that later require corrections than firms incorporated in other states including Delaware Such accounting errors can be red flags indicating fraud or incompetence and overstatements can inflate share prices that may later crash “Delaware offers a balanced law with some protections and some accountability but Musk wants more protection from shareholder litigation” Barzuza said “It seems like he would have preferred Nevada over Texas We can see that from the way he established the X holding company there and then merged Twitter into X But given how he came out of his compensation case he doesn’t want to go through what TripAdvisor is going through now” Melissa Castro Wyatt mwyatt@lawvirginiaedu

1045,"Teslas Last-Minute Cancellation Of Pie Orders Resembles A Bar Exam Essay Question","2/28/2024","https://abovethelaw.com/2024/02/teslas-last-minute-cancellation-of-pie-orders-resembles-a-bar-exam-essay-question/","Subscribe and get breaking news commentary and opinions on law firms lawyers law schools lawsuits judges and more Today is the last day of the February bar exam But a recent business snafu involving Tesla might be an interesting way for test takers to apply what they studied so far Last week a story about Tesla cancelling a large order of mini-pies just before delivery went viral A Tesla employee in San Jose made an order with a small business for 2000 mini-pies to be delivered on what the business considered short notice The owner quoted a fee and the Tesla representative approved But the owner didn’t get payment for the order When she contacted Tesla about it the representative apologized and said that it was because their vendor is new The representative then asked if they could double the order The owner agreed She then purchased additional ingredients and turned down other orders to accommodate the new larger order Later the Tesla representative contacted the owner to cancel the order Apparently it turned out that the employee had no authority to promise any payments The order was billed at $16000 But because of the cancellation the owner lost more than $2000 for expenses Thankfully the media published her plight and the people in the community came to support the business The owner said that business has tripled since that incident In addition Elon Musk tweeted that he would make things right with the owner and Tesla gave her a check for $2000 But suppose Tesla did nothing and the business owner is contemplating suing Tesla What would happen? Under these facts was there a contract between Tesla and the business? There does not need to be a formal written document signed by both parties to have a binding contract The text message exchange between Tesla and the business owner seems to show that there was an offer and acceptance with adequate consideration But does the representative have the authority to enter into a contract on behalf of Tesla? It is unclear what position this representative held at Tesla Under California law an employee of Tesla can have authority to enter into a contract in two situations First they either have the express or implied authority to do so Or if Tesla’s actions give third parties the impression that an employee has authority to enter into a contract This will be a matter of contention if litigated Assuming there is a contract the next issue is whether Tesla breached that contract Tesla canceled the order just before the pies were to be sent out As a result of this anticipatory breach the business lost $16000 in revenue due to turning customers away and spending on expenses But the business owner must take steps to mitigate damages When she posted her story online it went viral and as a result business has tripled So it is safe to assume that damages will be mitigated over time So even though Tesla’s employees stiffed a small business at the last minute resulting in the business owner losing $2000 out of pocket it would not be a slam-dunk case if it were to be litigated As a practical matter a lawyer is not likely to take this case due to the amount at issue unless he or she has a personal crusade against Tesla and Musk Probably the most efficient way to litigate this would be to go to small claims court where it would be litigated a lot faster and without lawyers Since California’s small claims court limit is $12500 the plaintiff would probably do better there as opposed to superior court where attorneys fees can eat up the award But the best way to avoid litigation is to not put yourself in a position to have to do it The small business should have taken a deposit up front and not start work until the money is in the bank Cancelling orders is not uncommon and in most cases there are justifiable and understandable reasons for doing so Even if you deal with trustworthy people you should at least get a deposit to cover costs As for Tesla they will need to make sure that the person making orders also has authority to issue payments to vendors Thankfully this business owner got lucky thanks to media exposure and a significant number of the population hating Musk But others will not be as lucky and will end up learning a business lesson the hard and expensive way Steven Chung is a tax attorney in Los Angeles California He helps people with basic tax planning and resolve tax disputes He is also sympathetic to people with large student loans He can be reached via email at stevenchungatl@gmailcom Or you can connect with him on Twitter (@stevenchung) and connect with him on LinkedIn Bar Exams Elon Musk Law Schools Pie Steven Chung Tesla We will never sell or share your information without your consent See our privacy policy Trump-Appointed Justice Isn’t Buying Trump-Appointed Lawyer’s Arguments: That’s rough buddy And Here’s Where I’d Put My Meaningful Action If I Had Any!: Biglaw’s pro-DEI sentiments need some action behind them Guess Who Is Taking A Bite Out Of Apple?: Pretty big firm Like really big Goodbye Property!: Which loss will hurt Donny Boy the most?

Trillion-Dollar AI Trade” The US govt just unlocked an $8 trillion market to move in a new direction See how it could unleash 6000% potential upside These EV stocks are primed to soar Advertisement Source: shutterstockcom/Alexander Steamaze EV stocks could be in a prime position to deliver strong gains for investors as the broader indices like the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq take off as part of a bull market I think that EV stocks can stand to benefit more than companies in other industries — such as tech companies — whose valuations may be stretched too far for the comfort of many investors Also these brands have solid growth prospects ahead of them making them suitable investments in their own right regardless of the cyclical ups and downs of the market So here are EV stocks for investors to consider buying Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) continues to dominate the EV market with a substantial market value showcasing its capability to produce vehicles at scale leading to reduced prices and a broader market capture There are a few reasons why I think that TSLA could take off this year amid the growing bull market First TSLA is projected to deliver roughly 225 million vehicles in 2024 with Morgan Stanley’s Adam Jonas highlighting Tesla’s potential to expand its dominance outside of China These deliveries are also backed by an expanding product line that could complement its efforts This is because TSLA plans to ramp up production of the Cybertruck and introduce updated versions of the Model 3 and Model Y including a new Model Y expected to begin manufacturing as early as mid-2024 Although the consensus on Wall Street is that TLSA is a “Hold” this rating also comes with a few counterfactuals Its stock price is predicted to rise 1789% within the next twelve months and its EPS is also predicted to surge 3139% next year to $496 These facts lead me to believe that TSLA is one of those EV stocks that could benefit substantially from the ongoing bull market and we could see it meeting analyst expectations General Motors (NYSE:GM) has made significant strides in the EV sector despite facing setbacks such as the withdrawal of a $5 billion EV development plan with Honda Still GM to me is perhaps one of the more underappreciated picks for investors who are looking to invest in EV stocks The brand is steadfastly committed to transitioning its vehicles to electric CEO Mary Barra underlines this commitment to eliminating tailpipe emissions from light-duty vehicles by 2035 It also recently announced the reintroduction of plug-in hybrid options alongside its all-electric vehicle efforts This move is seen as a temporary measure to bridge the gap as the national charging infrastructure continues to develop which will be helped by TSLA’s Supercharger network Also due to falling 716% in the past year and Wall Street’s consensus price target for GM that implies a 3022% upside I think that there’s substantial room for its shares to appreciate in value This undervaluation is punctuated by its low valuation ratios trading at just 5x earnings and 02x times sales Ford Motor (NYSE:F) is making a strong pivot towards sustainable transportation through the electrification of its vehicles I think this year for Ford will be a strong one with it announcing seven new all-electric vehicles in Europe by 2024 including both passenger and commercial vehicles This includes a medium-sized crossover built in Cologne and an electric version of the popular Ford Puma Ford’s Transit range will also see the addition of four new electric models The company is also proceeding with its electric Explorer planning to start its production in Europe in June with customer deliveries expected in August A second EV model is anticipated to begin production by the end of 2024 This initiative is part of Ford’s broader plans to transition to an all-electric lineup in Europe by 2035 aiming to sell 600000 EVs annually in Europe by 2026 Another bonus for investors is that Ford pays a great dividend yield of 468% and Wall Street expects its share price will increase 803% within the next twelve months This then makes Ford one of those EV stocks to consider as the bull

options or any of our other products work and whether you can afford to take the high risk of losing your money Zhujun Li Market Analyst 15 Jan 2024 00:00 Teslas share price jumped by 102% in 2023 primarily due to a price reduction at the beginning of the year leading to a significant surge in deliveries in the first two quarters with 440808 and 479700 vehicles delivered respectively However in the third quarter deliveries declined to 430488 due to factory upgrades Teslas revenue for the last quarter was US$2335 billion showing a modest year-over-year growth of 88% The adjusted EPS was $066 reflecting a 37% decrease compared to the previous year The gross profit margin remained at 179% staying below 20% for the third consecutive quarter Due to the underwhelming performance in Q3 Teslas stock price briefly dropped below $200 in late October However driven by expectations of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut the stock has been steadily rebounding since November recovering all the losses incurred after the Q3 financial report In Q4 Tesla has exceeded Wall Street expectations regarding deliveries producing 494989 vehicles and delivering 484507 Notably Model 3/Y contributed 461538 units Despite achieving a record annual delivery of 181 million vehicles in 2023 surpassing the 18 million target they fell short of Elon Musks 2 million goal As such the market response has been muted Teslas stock experienced a 442% decline in the first week of January Investors will likely closely watch the fourth-quarter gross profit margin performance especially considering Teslas four consecutive price hikes in November for vehicles sold in China These were driven by profit concerns and increased competition from other electric vehicle manufacturers The price adjustments might be aimed at leveraging the buy high sell low psychology of investors to stimulate sales However Tesla also reduced prices for inventory vehicles sold in the US and Canada in the last quarter of 2023 likely to counteract the impact of high interest rates on consumer sentiment indicating a potential further decline in gross profit margin in Q4 Looking ahead to 2024 the era of subsidies for new energy vehicles is ending Germanys subsidy programme for electric cars concluded on 18 December 2023 and France tightened subsidies limiting them to a maximum of €7000 for electric cars manufactured in Europe as of 15 December 2023 The subsidy policy decline in European and American countries and low demand caused by high-interest rates may compel Tesla to sustain its low-price strategy Profit margins may be challenging to improve significantly and economic downturn expectations might impact sales While Tesla may maintain its market share through a low-price strategy Elon Musk acknowledged significant production challenges for the newly-released Cybertruck In the Chinese market several local manufacturers continued price reduction activities in 2024 indicating an ongoing price war With

1063,"Going Into Earnings Is Tesla Stock a Buy a Sell or Fairly Valued?","1/18/2024","https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/going-into-earnings-is-tesla-stock-buy-sell-or-fairly-valued-2","With Tesla’s margins under pressure and an uncertain 2024 outlook here’s what we think of its stock Tesla TSLA is set to release its fourth-quarter earnings report on Jan 24 2024 after the close of trading Here’s Morningstar’s take on Tesla’s earnings and stock With its 3-star rating we believe Tesla’s stock is fairly valued compared with our long-term fair value estimate Our fair value estimate is $210 per share We use a weighted average cost of capital of just under 9% Our equity valuation adds back nonrecourse and non-dilutive convertible debt In the longer term we assume Tesla will deliver around 5 million vehicles per year in 2030 This includes fleet sales an expanding opportunity for the firm Our forecast is well below management’s aspirational goal of selling 20 million vehicles by the end of this decade However it is nearly 4 times the 131 million vehicles delivered in 2022 Our forecast assumes Tesla increases its Model 3 and Model Y deliveries that the Cybertruck is a success and that the company ramps up volumes over several years We also believe Tesla will ramp up semi-truck volumes over time Further we forecast that Tesla will launch its sports car and eventually its affordable sedan and SUV platforms in the second half of the decade We think the company will successfully continue to reduce its manufacturing costs on a per-vehicle basis Combined with a shift to producing a greater proportion of higher-priced Model Y vehicles we forecast segment gross margins will expand to roughly 30% near the 29% level achieved in 2022 as automotive profit growth grows faster than revenue over the medium and long term We assume revenue growth and margin expansion from autonomous software sold on a subscription basis We also assume the successful growth of the insurance business and increased profits from the charging business result in long-term profit growth and margin expansion in the “services and other” segment Read more about Tesla’s fair value estimate We award Tesla a narrow moat stemming from its intangible assets and cost advantage The company’s strong brand cachet as a luxury automaker commands premium pricing while its EV manufacturing expertise lets it make vehicles more cheaply than competitors We think Tesla’s moat sources will persist letting the firm generate excess returns on capital We see the potential for it to outearn its cost of capital over at least the next 20 years which is the measurement we use for a wide moat rating However the second 10-year period carries significant uncertainty for both Tesla and the broader automotive industry given the rapid advancement of autonomous driving technologies which could transform how consumers use vehicles As such we view a narrow moat rating which assumes a 10-year excess return duration as more appropriate Read more about Tesla’s moat rating We assign Tesla a Very High Morningstar Uncertainty Rating as we see a wide range of potential outcomes for the company The automotive market is highly cyclical and subject to sharp demand declines based on economic conditions As the EV market leader Tesla is subject to growing competition from traditional automakers and new entrants As new lower-priced EVs enter the market Tesla may be forced to continue to cut prices reducing its industry-leading profits With more EV choices consumers may view Tesla less favorably The company is investing heavily in capacity expansions that carry the risk of delays and cost overruns It is also investing in R&D to maintain its technological advantage and generate software-based revenue with no guarantee these investments will bear fruit Tesla’s CEO owns a little over 20% of the company’s stock and uses it as collateral for personal loans which raises the risk of a large sale to repay debt

1064,"Tesla EV Prices Are Inverting Why Thats A Bad Sign","1/19/2024","https://www.investors.com/news/tesla-stock-ev-giant-prices-are-inverting-why-thats-a-bad-sign/","TOP FUNDS: These Mutual Funds Beat Benchmarks Over A 10-Year Span Tesla (TSLA) vehicle pricing has turned upside down with the historically more expensive Model Y now often cheaper than the Model 3 after the latest round of price cuts and with help from various subsidies TSLA stock edged a fraction higher Friday but fell on the week Tesla customers throughout Europe and the US can now get the Model Y in many cases for less than a Model 3 with Tesla continuing its strategy of offering vehicle discounts and slashing prices early in 2024 as the EV giant attempts to shore up demand In January Tesla has trimmed China vehicle prices on the Model 3 and two Model Y variants and then on Tuesday slashed Model Y prices in many European countries The European price cuts come even with Tesla Berlin set to suspend production for two weeks starting Jan 29 The latest vehicle price action and IRA tax credits in the US mean the Model Y is now cheaper than the Model 3 in some countries In the US a Model Y Long Range has a price of $41490 including the $7500 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) tax credit A Model 3 Long Range vehicle has a price of $45990 and is not eligible for IRA tax credits The Model Y Performance trim is also less than the Model 3 Long Range coming in at an IRA adjusted price of $44990 US buyers also can take advantage of hefty discounts on inventory vehicles with bigger deals for the Model Y So the effective Tesla inversion is even stronger than list prices suggest On Friday Tesla unveiled new Model Y lease prices up to 8% lower than before on a 36-month term Meanwhile in Germany a Model 3 all-wheel drive model goes for €51990 more than the €49990 for the Model Y Long Range Likewise in France a Tesla Model Y Performance trim goes for €48990-€50990 after the €5000-€7000 subsidy based on income A Model 3 all-wheel drive vehicle in France has a price of €50990 The China-made Model 3 is no longer eligible for French subsidies To maintain sales momentum in 2023 Tesla aggressively cut vehicle prices and offered discounts throughout the year Auto gross margins which peaked at 30% in Q4 2021 amid industry chip shortages have plunged well below 20% Tesla bulls in the latter half of 2023 repeatedly predicted that Teslas price cuts were ending and that auto gross margins had bottomed The Model Y is Teslas most popular offering but with prices continuing to fall it appears there could be an inventory glut In the fourth quarter Tesla delivered 53868 Model Y vehicles in Europe down 2% compared to 2022 according to data compiled by Troy Teslike However while Model Y deliveries declined year-over year it was not a supply issue with Tesla finishing Q4 with 32000 unsold Model Y vehicles Tesla Berlin which will suspend production for two weeks starting on Jan 29 is running well below capacity Tesla Shanghai has reduced exports to Europe Tesla may also have to now cut prices on Model 3 vehicles to realign pricing in Europe and the US Barclays analyst Dan Levy on Wednesday lowered the firms price target on Tesla stock to 250 down from 260 and kept an equal weight rating on the shares Levy told investors the central theme for Tesla in 2024 is that it faces volume pressure in a demand constrained environment Barclays view is that 2024 will be the first time in Teslas history that volume will likely be more a function of demand than of the companys production capacity Levy predicts Tesla delivering 197 million units in 2024 Tesla average vehicle prices in Q4 were $43010 down 16% compared to $51400 in 2022 according to FactSet For Q1 Tesla average prices are expected to drop 7% to $42670 FactSet projects the average selling price falling throughout 2024 to $41670 in Q4 2024 Tesla stock pared early losses edging up a fraction to 21202 Friday during market action TSLA fell 3% on the week and is below its moving averages following five straight weekly declines So far in January Tesla stock has tumbled below key levels of support as analysts await news on auto gross profit margins excluding regulatory credits and watch to see if vehicle pricing has stabilized On Jan 17 Gary Black managing partner of the Future Fund posted on X that based on the January price cuts he was revising 2024 earnings estimates to $375 per share down from $390 per share The analyst consensus for 2024 EPS is down to $372 a share vs $381 at the end of last year It was $565 at the end of January 2023 Black wrote that Tesla management still does not see that cutting configurator prices and inventory discounts by the same amount is value destructive Price cuts are a short term sugar high that pulls forward orders from those who already own or are interested in an EV Black added Friday on X With Tesla reporting Q4 earnings and revenue next week closing out 2023 analysts are still focused on vehicle pricing and margins in 2024 Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi wrote in early January that auto gross profit margins are a key question going into Q4 earnings Sacconaghi models 157% auto gross profit margins for the fourth quarter but that they could drop lower given the impact of price cuts in September and October as well as significant discounting of inventory models in Q4 Tesla stock has retreated more than 14% in January TSLA shares tumbled 78% to 21889 last week plunging below the 50-day and 200-day lines Investors could use 26513 and 27898 as potential buy points Tesla stock is technically in an awkward double-bottom base according to MarketSmith analysis The relative strength line which tracks a stocks performance vs the S&P 500 is at its lowest level since late May according to MarketSmith In 2023 Tesla doubled easily outperforming the broader S&P 500 index Tesla stock ranks fifth in the 35 member IBD Auto Manufacturers industry group The stock has a 72

Let’s take a closer look Tesla has a notorious history of volatility The stock currently has a beta of 24 meaning that for every 1% the market moves Tesla shares tend to move 24% As a rule of thumb I look for stocks with a beta in line with the market to help manage volatility within my portfolio In addition to its volatility the stock trades at a huge price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 46 This means that investors value the stock at 46 times its earnings As an avid value investor I tend to look for stocks that trade below a P/E ratio of 10 The Nasdaq where Tesla is listed currently has an average P/E ratio of 27 The index largely consists of high-growth stocks Given that Tesla shares currently trading at a significant premium to this average it doesn’t fill me with confidence In addition to this analysts at HSBC recently dropped their target price to $146 for the stock a steep decline from the current price of $199 More worryingly they identified Elon Musk Tesla’s CEO as a “single-person risk” factor Musk’s vibrant leadership has indeed propelled Tesla to a market-leading position but there have been many instances where the share price has tumbled off the back of his actions Tesla has long led the charge for fully self-driving (FSD) vehicles While the target of full autonomy is yet to be achieved Tesla has made significant progress in driving AI-powered FSD already Human oversight is required at all times but its vehicles can brake and accelerate on their own as well as steer and change lanes So what does this mean for business performance? In an interview with CNBC in May last year Musk announced that the opportunity for AI integration in Tesla’s business model is “gigantic” adding that “It’d be like selling cars for software margins because in fact it is software And so instead of effectively having say 25% margins it might be 70% or more” If Tesla is able to achieve this kind of margin expansion its profits would soar This would no doubt fuel a boom in share price Personally I like to target lower-risk high-yielding stocks Unfortunately Tesla does not fit this bill The story is exciting of course and I will continue to closely follow Elon Musk on his journey to full self-driving cars However the high volatility and punchy valuation are too much for me to ignore At $199 I won’t be buying Should you invest the value of your investment may rise or fall and your capital is at risk Before investing your individual circumstances should be assessed Consider taking independent financial advice HSBC Holdings is an advertising partner of The Ascent a Motley Fool company Dylan Hood has no position in any of the shares mentioned The Motley Fool UK has recommended HSBC Holdings and Tesla Views expressed on the companies mentioned in this article are those of the writer and therefore may differ from the official recommendations we make in our subscription services such as Share Advisor Hidden Winners and Pro Here at The Motley Fool we believe that considering a diverse range of insights makes us better investors 26 March 2024 Christopher Ruane After an upbeat quarterly trading statement for its retail business our writer still has no interest in buying Ocado shares… Read more » 26 March 2024 Alan Oscroft An early 8% rise in the Ocado share price after the latest news?

his money is largely tied up in ownership stakes of his companies To buy Twitter in 2022 he leveraged his large share in Tesla and solicited investors rather than relying on liquid sums Heres where the entrepreneur holds his wealth Tesla Musk holds 411 million shares and about 304 million Tesla options totaling about $127 billion - the majority of his wealth These calculations do not include the impact of the judges order this week which would require Musk to return some of his options Musks compensation package - the largest ever at a US public company - was the crux of the Delaware Chancery Court lawsuit after a shareholder sued A judge ruled the package unfair saying that Musk had cozy relationships with two of the board members that constructed the deal and he controlled too much of the process In response Musk posted on X that he plans to hold a shareholder vote to incorporate the company in Texas But even if he does the court challenges in Delaware will not disappear Musk has repeatedly asserted his commitment to Tesla where he has served as CEO since 2008 The company has been called the crown jewel of Musks portfolio Tesla made electric cars mainstream and it has global ambitions After starting with a sporty convertible the Roadster Tesla has gradually expanded to sedans Its Autopilot technology is one of the most widespread driver-assistance systems on the market available in millions of cars on the road However Tesla recently recalled the feature to implement additional safeguards against misuse through a software update The features have ignited controversy and have been involved in numerous fatal car crashes according to Post investigations SpaceX Musks ambitions arent limited to Earth - he wants humans to land on Mars Musk founded SpaceX a private firm that builds rockets and satellites in 2002 The company has worked with NASA to conduct space launches and make trips to the International Space Station as it has pioneered reusable rockets SpaceX intends to return astronauts to the Moon - working on NASAs first human mission to the moons south pole slated for 2026 Musk has characterized SpaceX as an extension of his mission at Tesla We must safeguard the future of life by transitioning to sustainable energy on Earth & becoming multiplanetary via Mars he wrote in a tweet Its not clear how much time we have to do these things but sooner is definitely better X formerly Twitter Musk bought Twitter for about $44 billion in a controversial deal in 2022 and renamed the company X last year Since the acquisition the billionaire has laid off the majority of the companys staff and hired a new CEO Linda Yaccarino Since the acquisition X has struggled with waning advertiser confidence as brands grow wary of Musks controversial public comments Investors have also expressed concern at the companys finances X is now estimated to be worth less than half of what Twitter was valued at the time of the takeover But Musk has said that user numbers on X are growing and has dismissed concerns about waning interest in the site The Boring Company Musk is also extending his empire underground Born in 2016 from Musks exasperation with a traffic jam the Boring Company is his proposed solution to congestion: personalized mass transit via tunnels The company aims to build a network of high-speed tunnels near some of Americas most gridlocked cities In 2017 Musk tweeted that he had verbal govt approval for a Hyperloop that would connect Washington DC to New York City and could be traveled in 29 minutes No such project has taken shape The companys biggest project to date is the 17-mile loop below the Las Vegas Convention Center which has been used by more than 15 million passengers since it opened in 2021 according to the companys website with a demonstrated peak capacity of over 4500 passengers per hour and over 32000 passengers per day The Boring Co has yet to prove its theory that tunneling can solve traffic on a larger scale Critics point out that rather than increasing mobility the strategic relocation of cars underground would simply remove the traffic from view Musk is insistent however: Its either traffic forever or tunnels he once tweeted The Washington Post Related Topics: Independent Online popularly known as IOL is one of South Africa’s leading news and information websites bringing millions of readers breaking news and updates on Politics Current Affairs Business Lifestyle Entertainment Travel Sport Motoring and Technology Read more © 2024 Independent Online and affiliated companies All rights reserved"

These industry leaders dominate headlines with their vast fortunes yet the way they came into their riches might surprise you Let’s start with Musk Most people think Musk’s wealth stems from Tesla (TSLA) As the CEO of the electric vehicle (EV) company it’s no secret that TSLA has been a rocket ship for Musk’s net worth with an astonishing 3000% stock surge over the last decade But Musk’s journey to wealth began long before his tenure as Tesla’s chief executive… What’s the real story behind Musk’s billions? It’s a tale of strategic foresight during the Dot-Com Boom where a unique and rare investment vehicle turned into a goldmine for those who knew where to look This isn’t just a history lesson; it’s a blueprint for success during technological revolutions like the one we’re witnessing with AI While it is true that a significant portion of Musk’s net worth today is indeed from Tesla stock he did not initially accumulate his wealth from the company Musk was not a founder of Tesla; he was one of its first major investors and eventually took on the role of CEO Before his billionaire status through Tesla stock Musk had already built a multi-million-dollar fortune So how did Elon Musk first become wealthy? Long story short he did so through an uncommon investment that took off during the Dot-Com Boom and is now reappearing in the AI Boom This investment vehicle allowed Elon Musk to earn $12 million in 1999 at the peak of the 1990s internet boom It also enabled him to secure another $100 million in 2002 even during the Dot-Com Crash Musk’s initial $12 million in 1999 and a staggering $100 million in 2002 were the seeds that grew into his massive fortune today That $100 million windfall allowed Musk to become a significant investor in Tesla in 2004 and to launch SpaceX in 2002 Today these two companies have a combined worth of nearly $1 trillion accounting for the majority of Musk’s $240 billion net worth And it all began with that rare investment vehicle from the late 1990s The story of Musk’s wealth is not an isolated phenomenon Mark Cuban’s journey similarly underscores the potential of strategic investments amid technological upheaval Not many people are aware that Cuban started as a bartender in Dallas in the early 1980s It wasn’t until 1990 when he utilized this rare investment vehicle to earn a $2 million payday that Cuban’s wealth surged After getting a taste of this fortune-making investment vehicle Cuban craved more In 1999 during the Dot-Com Boom (and the same year Musk made $12 million) Cuban reportedly earned a billion-dollar payday through this rare investment vehicle Certainly this investment vehicle comes with risks as nothing offering the prospect of multi-million-dollar paydays is without them Yet it is one of the best ways to amass a fortune quickly It’s how Elon Musk and Mark Cuban became billionaires And now you too could potentially strike it rich Today as the world stands on the brink of an AI revolution the parallels to the early days of the internet are clear — the same opportunities Musk and Cuban had could be present for those willing to take calculated risks This investment vehicle is always available but it becomes particularly compelling and offers life-changing profit potential about once every few decades during a major new technological boom The last occurrence was during the Internet Boom when Musk and Cuban capitalized on their opportunity Could you feel the thrill of such a windfall? Today with the AI Boom this investment vehicle is reemerging with even greater profit potential than what was seen during the Internet Boom Imagine the excitement of being part of a financial leap forward the same kind that allowed Cuban to go from bartender to billionaire Yes there are risks but the rewards we’re talking about are life-changing Do you have the courage to follow in the footsteps of the bold? Well if you want in on the opportunity of a lifetime now is the time to act Because here’s the thing about these deals: They have deadlines They are open for a certain amount of time and then they close sometimes forever And the unique investment deal I have my eyes on right now closes in just 72 hours – on Wednesday Feb 7 at midnight EST So if you want in on arguably the most exciting investment deal out there right now – the same type that first made Musk and Cuban rich – you need to act before Feb 7 Learn more all the details now before its too late On the date of publication Luke Lango did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article By uncovering early investments in hypergrowth industries Luke Lango puts you on the ground-floor of world-changing megatrends Article printed from InvestorPlace Media https://investorplacecom/hypergrowthinvesting/2024/02/this-is-how-elon-musk-got-rich/ ©2024 InvestorPlace Media LLC Hot Stocks Hot Stocks Market Analysis Stocks to Buy Stocks to Buy Stocks to Buy Hot Stocks Stocks to Buy Financial Market Data powered by FinancialContent Services Inc All rights reserved Nasdaq quotes delayed at least 15 minutes all others at least 20 minutes Copyright © 2024 InvestorPlace Media LLC All rights reserved 1125 N Charles St Baltimore MD 21201 Not Yet a Premium Subscriber?
