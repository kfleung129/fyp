See what else we'll be watching! Share this: Looking ahead, it\u2019s looking like a relatively quiet week on the economic calendar, highlighted by the FOMC Meeting Minutes on Wednesday and PMI surveys on Thursday. Meanwhile, Nvidia earnings on Wednesday will be a key test for the bull market in equities (more on that below): Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday  Rising risk appetite was the theme of last week\u2019s trade, and the big question on most traders\u2019 radars is whether that relentless rally in risk assets can extend for another week. Despite the ostensible risks of inflation reaccelerating in the US, major indices all made record highs from Germany to the US to Japan, global bond yields rallied across the curve, Bitcoin \u2013 a quintessential measure of risk appetite \u2013 surged to 2-year highs, and even oil prices were able to rally up to approach their highest levels since November. Looking ahead, the biggest hurdle for bulls to watch will be Nvidia\u2019s earnings. The semiconductor giant saw its market cap eclipse fellow \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d rivals Alphabet/Google and Amazon last week, signaling elevated optimism heading into the release. The epicenter of the AI revolution, Nvidia traders at a massive multiple, but as long as it continues to deliver strong growth, traders will keep bidding it up. In addition to the usual EPS (expected at $4.18) and revenue ($20.4B expected) results, traders will also be hyper-focused on the company\u2019s guidance and outlook for the rest of the year. Following on strong results from rivals like AMD, SMCI, and TSMC, investors\u2019 sky-high expectations will be put to the test with potential for outsized volatility; looking at the implied volatility on NVDA options, we can see that investors are projecting a +/- 11% move in response to earnings, a truly massive figure for a nearly $2T company. Outside of Nvidia\u2019s earnings, the most important release will likely be the Thursday\u2019s PMI surveys from the US, UK, and Eurozone. Seen as one of the most timely measures of on-the-ground economic activity, these surveys will give traders insight into whether the strong momentum from January has carried over into this month. With traders aggressive pricing out interest rate cuts from all major central banks since the start of the year, it will take another round of strong PMI surveys to prevent near-term bearish reversals.  Source: Tradingview, StoneX The key chart to watch for the coming week will be the S&P 500. The broad index of large-cap US stocks shrugged off both the hotter-than-expected CPI and PPI reports, keeping the medium-term bullish channel intact. If Nvidia, which represents nearly a 5% weight in the index in addition to its implications for other high-value names, can deliver on its earnings report, traders may start to target the top of the bullish channel in the 5100 area next. On the other hand, a confirmed break below the bullish channel and 21-day EMA near 4950 would point to a deeper pullback toward the 50-day EMA around 4820 next. -- Written by Matt Weller, Global Head of Research Follow Matt on Twitter: @MWellerFX Share this: From time to time, StoneX Financial Pty Ltd (\u201cwe\u201d, \u201cour\u201d) website may contain links to other sites and/or resources provided by third parties.
