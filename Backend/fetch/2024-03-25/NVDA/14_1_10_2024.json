    "text": "Shares of\u00a0Nvidia Corp.\u00a0NVDA have been on a tear since the beginning of 2023, reflecting investor confidence in the chipmaker\u2019s AI capabilities. Despite this upward trend, a fund manager believes the stock is attractively valued given its growth potential. What Happened:\u00a0Nvidia reached a new high on Tuesday, rallying 1.70% during the kickoff of the 2024 Consumer Electronics Show, closing at $531.40, according to\u00a0Benzinga Pro data.\u00a0The stock outperformed the Nasdaq 100 Index (up 0.17%) and the\u00a0iShares Semiconductor ETF\u00a0SOXX, which remained nearly flat. This rally contributed to Nvidia\u2019s impressive gain of 264% since 2023. Chart courtesy of Benzinga See Also:\u00a0How to Buy Nvidia (NVDA) Stock Gary Black,\u00a0Future Fund\u00a0managing partner and co-founder, said on X that investors are recognizing Nvidia\u2019s continued affordability. Currently trading at 26.5 times the consensus adjusted earnings per share estimate for 2024, the company is expected to achieve a compounded annual growth rate of 28% in earnings per share between 2024 and 2028. Examining the reasons for this outperformance, Black, renowned for his bullish Tesla thesis, highlighted Nvidia\u2019s best-in-class products, excellent execution, a robust management team, drama-free environment, and low headline risk. Why It\u2019s Important:\u00a0Despite the impressive surge, analysts foresee additional upside for the stock. The average 12-month analysts\u2019 price target is $662.39, indicating approximately 25% potential upside from the current levels, according to TipRanks. Nvidia\u2019s\u00a0guidance for the fourth quarter\u00a0predicts revenue of $20 billion, plus or minus 2%. If the company achieves this target, it is poised to report year-over-year revenue growth of over 230%. Notably, this positive outlook comes despite the U.S. ban on exporting certain high-performance chips to China, a crucial market for Nvidia. The Santa Clara, California-based chipmaker has found success with its AI accelerator chipsets, experiencing strong demand amid the popularity of generative AI software and applications.
