You follow ETF News and Commentary - edit You follow Sanghamitra Saha - edit Sanghamitra Saha ETF News and Commentary The NVIDIA (NVDA Quick QuoteNVDA  -  Free Report)     stock is again a blockbuster this year as it jumped 44% courtesy of high hopes from artificial intelligence (AI). A surge in Hyperscale demand and a solid uptake of AI-based smart cockpit infotainment solutions are acting as tailwinds. The chip giant has witnessed an impressive 228.8% rally in its stock price over the past year. NVIDIA has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)\u00a0and\u00a0it is a growth stock as well as pricey too.\u00a0NVIDIA\u2019s P/E (ttm) ratio 76.13X versus the semiconductor industry\u2019s P/E ratio of 26.53X. NVIDIA\u2019s\u00a0expected growth rate for next year is 63.17%\u00a0versus the expected growth rate of 14% for the industry \u00a0and 4.96% for the S&P 500. Despite this remarkable run, Goldman Sachs remains bullish on the company's prospects and has raised its price target for Nvidia from $625 to $800, marking a potential upside of 21% from the previous Friday's closing price. This positive outlook has driven Nvidia's stock to new heights, with its market valuation now reaching $1.7 trillion, per a Business Insider article. Goldman Sachs analysts are confident that Nvidia's Data Center revenue will not fall in the second half of 2024, as previously anticipated. Instead, they expect a persistent uptick in Data Center revenue throughout the first half of 2025. This positive outlook is attributed to several factors, including continued investments by major cloud service providers in generative AI infrastructure, a widening customer base, and the introduction of new product cycles. Nvidia's reaffirmation of its conviction in growing Data Center revenue beyond CY2024, based on clear visibility into capital spending patterns among major cloud service providers. Goldman Sachs points to recent commentary from major cloud providers such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet as evidence that Nvidia is poised to benefit from continued spending on AI-enabling GPU chips like the H100. These cloud giants have reported increased adoption and monetization of AI-related services and products, contributing to Nvidia's growth prospects. Nvidia\u2019s competitor AMD's revised 2024 Data Center GPU revenue outlook indicates a substantial increase, further validating the market's potential. Marvell's positive comments about its optical DSP and custom compute businesses led Goldman Sachs to adjust its revenue forecasts for the Data Center segment, the IBD article indicated. Forward guidance from Super Micro suggests an acceleration in revenue growth, reflecting increased demand for Nvidia's products. Positive commentary on AI-related capital spending by hyperscalers, with Meta Platforms increasing its 2024 capex guidance is another factor that can boost Nvidia\u2019s business. Goldman Sachs anticipates that Nvidia will ramp up production of its next-gen H200 hyperscaler in the second quarter of 2024. Goldman Sachs is not alone in its optimism, as Bank of America also raised its price target for Nvidia to $800 last week, underscoring the belief that the demand for AI technologies remains in its booming stage and will continue to drive Nvidia's growth.

This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1988 it has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +24.18%  per year. These returns cover a period from January 1, 1988 through January 1, 2024. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple, equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zacks Ranks stocks can, and often do, change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available, pricing information was not collected, or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations. Zacks may license the Zacks Mutual Fund rating provided herein to third parties, including but not limited to the issuer.
