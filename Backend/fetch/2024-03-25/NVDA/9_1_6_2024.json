Nvidia\u2019s graphics cards could soon experience much leaner stock levels, if a new rumor is right \u2013 a prospect which brings with it the fear of GPU price hikes, though hopefully not to the extent that we\u2019ve seen in the past. Wccftech flagged up a report from tech site MyDrivers which claims that industry sources in Taiwan are saying that Nvidia\u2019s GeForce gaming GPUs are starting to experience lower supply levels as of Q4 2023. Be cautious about that report, of course, as with any rumor, and we aren\u2019t told which models of Nvidia graphics cards are affected in particular, although it sounds like this is more or less across the board for consumer models. This is talking about the Asian market as the likely worst hit region, but the report mentions stock shortages in the US and Europe, too, where Nvidia GPUs could also become harder to find. The expectation according to MyDrivers is that supply of Nvidia boards could be \u201cvery limited\u201d in the near future, worryingly, and there\u2019s a mention of price hikes for at least some products being possible. We\u2019ve already seen this to some extent, of course, with the RTX 4090, but that was a special case due to its ban in China (which Nvidia has sidestepped with the incoming RTX 4090 D variant, though not before a lot of vanilla 4090 stock was shipped to Chinese retailers, which had a substantial impact on global pricing of the Lovelace flagship). The worry is that other Nvidia graphics cards, or at least some Lovelace models as mentioned, could follow in those footsteps. We\u2019re told the reason why Nvidia is pulling back production and supply for GeForce GPUs is that it\u2019s prioritizing manufacturing chips for AI cards.

AI GPUs are where the big profits lie \u2013 massive profits of late, in fact \u2013 so it does make some sense. What doesn\u2019t make sense is that Nvidia is about to produce a bunch of new RTX Super refreshes: three of them are purportedly set to launch throughout this month, challenging for a place in our best graphics card rankings, after a CES 2024 reveal at the start of next week. If production capacity is being reeled back in a meaningful way, why go ahead with a bunch of new launches? Well, Nvidia needs to rejig its mid-to-upper range bracket with Lovelace, as it has made rather a hash of the GPUs available here \u2013 the RTX 4080 with its reportedly dire sales levels in particular \u2013 so it is perhaps regarded as a necessary move in that respect. Saving face against AMD in the consumer GPU market, if you will. Also, Nvidia will be scrapping the RTX 4080 and RTX 4070 Ti \u2013 they will effectively be replaced by the RTX 4080 Super and RTX 4070 Ti Super, in theory \u2013 so it\u2019s a case of swapping in and out, rather than new cards being made as such. Although that noted, the new RTX 4070 Super will run alongside the existing RTX 4070 \u2013 the latter isn\u2019t going anywhere. Furthermore, the pricing of these new RTX Super models is supposedly going to be pretty competitive, which again doesn\u2019t exactly marry with the idea of stock shortages, and therefore upward pricing pressures in the near future. On top of this, the MyDrivers article feels rather brief and sketchy, and we\u2019re not sure how much stock (pardon the pun) we\u2019ll put in it at this point. Let\u2019s hope it\u2019s off the mark, anyway, because the last thing we need is to be staring down the barrel of a fresh round of GPU prices rises from Nvidia.
