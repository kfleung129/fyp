    "text": "Samsung Electronics Co\u00a0SSNLF, led\u00a0by Executive Chairman\u00a0Jay Y. Lee, achieved a significant legal victory when a Seoul court acquitted him of stock manipulation charges. This decision enables\u00a0Lee to continue leading the conglomerate, the world\u2019s largest manufacturer of memory chips and displays, amid a global downturn and increasing competition from\u00a0Apple Inc\u00a0AAPL in smartphones and SK Hynix Inc in artificial intelligence. The\u00a0Nvidia Corp\u00a0NVDA rival targets commercializing advanced 2-nm technology chips by 2025 and 1.4-nm chips by 2027. The court\u2019s ruling dismissed the threat of imprisonment that had loomed over Lee, a key figure in South Korea\u2019s business landscape, for years, Bloomberg\u00a0reports. In 2023, South Korean prosecutors sought a jail term for Samsung\u2019s Lee Jae-yong over alleged accounting fraud and stock price manipulation. The case centered on allegations related to the 2015 merger of Samsung C&T Corp and Cheil Industries Inc, which prosecutors claimed was manipulated to strengthen Lee\u2019s control over the conglomerate. However, the judge cited significant flaws in the prosecution\u2019s case, including inadmissible evidence and a lack of proof regarding Lee\u2019s intentions or misleading shareholders. In 2022, the Samsung board approved the appointment of Jay Y. Lee as Executive Chair of the company, citing an uncertain global business environment. Lee would likely succeed to the throne after his father died in 2020. However, graft investigations and two stints in jail delayed the appointment. Lee battled bribery and corruption investigations dating back to 2017. In August, he won a presidential pardon. This legal outcome arrives at a crucial time for Samsung as the company navigates through a challenging period marked by declines in the smartphone and memory chip markets, as evidenced by its fourth consecutive quarter of profit decline. Additionally, Samsung is working to catch up with SK Hynix in the high-bandwidth memory sector, which is vital for AI model training. The company reported a 40% increase in HBM sales in the December quarter, indicating a recovery in memory demand and an expected rise in mobile shipments.
