    "text": "The S&P 500 is back at a record high, confounding the experts who expected the global economy to crash into a recession and cause widespread pain to investors. America\u2019s benchmark stock index fell 27.5 per cent between December 2021 and October 2022, but a surge in artificial intelligence stocks helped it to rally 39 per cent since. The so-called magnificent seven is made up of the smartphone maker Apple, the software firm Microsoft, the retail giant Amazon, the chipmaker Nvidia, the Google-owner Alphabet, the Facebook-owner Meta Platforms and the electric carmaker Tesla. They dominate the market and their shares are up as much as 430 per cent since October 2022. But if, like me, you aren\u2019t invested in any of them, is it too late? \u00a9 Times Media Limited 2024.
