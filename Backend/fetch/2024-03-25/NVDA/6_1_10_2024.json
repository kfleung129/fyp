Image source: Getty Images NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been rallying hard over the last 12 months. It started 2023 at $240 and rallied to $531 over the course of a year. If you\u2019d invested $10,000 in the stock at the beginning of last year and held to today, you\u2019d have $21,500 by now. If the stock keeps up its momentum in the coming months, it could overtake Amazon\u2019s market capitalization. If that were to occur, investors would experience very good returns. The problem is, there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty as to whether it can happen. NVIDIA\u2019s stock already trades at nosebleed multiples; for example, 29 times sales and 39 times book value. These multiples make NVIDIA one of the most expensive U.S. tech stocks \u2014 and that group of stocks isn\u2019t known for cheapness, to put it mildly. You can find stocks with growth rates similar to NVIDIA\u2019s without the outrageous price tag. In this article, I will explore one such stock that just so happens to be listed on Canada\u2019s own TSX Composite Index. EQB (TSX:EQB) is a Canadian bank that operates primarily online. It is known for its high-yielding Guaranteed Investment Certificates (GICs), which pay as much as 5.5%. It is also known for having much faster growth than the average Canadian bank, which is a big part of why its stock has risen over the last 12 months when most Canadian bank stocks declined in price in the same period. Apart from its high-yielding GICs, another thing EQB is known for its rapid growth. In its most recent quarter, it delivered the following metrics: These are all excellent growth metrics. EQB\u2019s sales and earnings are not growing quite as fast as NVIDIA\u2019s, but they are growing more than the average bank\u2019s sales and earnings are. And, of course, EQB is much cheaper than NVIDIA, as I\u2019ll show in the next section. One advantage that EQB has over NVIDIA stock is its valuation. Whereas NVDA trades at 29 times sales and 61 times earnings, EQB trades at the following: That\u2019s a pretty cheap valuation. In fact, it\u2019s so cheap that you might think there must be something wrong with EQB as a company for it to get so cheap. However, after looking into the matter, I concluded that EQB is a quality bank that practices sound risk management. It has a very high liquidity coverage ratio (339%), a full 239% higher than what regulators require. It also has a deposit base that\u2019s mostly made up of GICs, which are \u201clocked up\u201d for a period of time, limiting the possibility of a bank run at EQB. These factors, along with the raw growth and valuation numbers, lead me to think that EQB is a growth stock worth looking at.
