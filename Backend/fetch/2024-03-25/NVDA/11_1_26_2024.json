Preylock Holdings has scored new debt to finance Nvidia\u2019s sprawling headquarters in Santa Clara, according to a report from ratings agency KBRA. JPMorgan Chase Bank gave Preylock a $130 million senior mortgage and a $50.5 million mezzanine loan, backed by the AI software company\u2019s roughly 550,000-square-foot office and lab campus. The five-year senior loan has a fixed interest rate of 6.88 percent. The senior mortgage will probably become part of a commercial mortgage-backed securities loan, the KBRA report said. The CMBS package is set to close next month, according to data from Trepp. Preylock, based in Los Angeles, used the new debt, plus $8.5 million in equity, to pay off a $167 million loan from Natixis and fund tenant improvement reserves. Preylock bought the campus for $109 million in 2017, records show. Since purchasing the property, Preylock has worked with Nvidia to build out lab space.

Lipman said the entire seven-building campus was appraised last year at $350 million, or about $636 per square foot. Since closing the deal, Preylock has received \u201cmultiple unsolicited offers\u201d from real estate firms to buy the office campus, given the tenant and its focus on artificial intelligence, Lipman said, but said the firm\u2019s investor base is \u201cpleased with the campus\u2019 performance to date.\u201d Last year, the campus at 2220 Central Expressway was fully leased to two tenants \u2014 Nvidia, which makes computer graphics processors, and Futurewei, a research and development firm focused on open-source technology. But in December, Nvidia decided to take over about 109,000 square feet of Futurewei\u2019s 171,000-square-foot lease, according to KBRA. In June, Nvidia will take over Futurewei\u2019s remaining 62,000 square feet. Under Nvidia\u2019s lease and sublease agreements, the firm pays about $15.6 million in base rent per year and will pay a further $2 million once the June deal is in effect. Nvidia has been a stock market darling over the last year, soaring 208 percent since January 2023. Its market capitalization has skyrocketed to hit $1.5 trillion, from about $370 billion at the beginning of last year.
