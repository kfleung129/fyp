    "text": "BREAKING: Futures Fall Slightly Just when you thought Nvidia stock had everything going for it in the S&P 500, there's yet another plus for the AI champ. Turns out that Nvidia (NVDA), plus nine other S&P 500 stocks like United Rentals (URI) and Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR), routinely beat the market in the challenging month of February, says an Investor's Business Daily analysis of data from S&P Global Market Intelligence and MarketSmith. All these stocks topped the S&P 500's returns in the month of February in the past five straight years. Finding such bankable winners in February is a real asset. It's a difficult month for most S&P 500 stocks. The S&P 500 dropped in two of the past five Februarys. And it posted an average loss of 1.7% during the month on average since 2018. \"February has the reputation of being a digestion month for the S&P 500, following above-average monthly increases and frequencies of advance from October through January,\" said CFRA's Sam Stovall. February isn't just a rough month for the S&P 500 lately. Going back to 1950, the S&P 500 lost an average of 0.08% during the month, says \"Stock Trader's Almanac.\" That makes it the second-worst month for the index. But don't tell Nvidia investors. They've thrived relatively during the month. Shares of Nvidia not only beat the S&P 500 during the month for five years and running. They've skyrocketed 9.1%, on average, during the month. That makes it the best S&P 500 stock during the month. Last February was a standout, too. Shares of Nvidia jumped nearly 19% in February 2023, blowing past the S&P 500's 2.6% decline. And that's not totally out of character. Nvidia stock jumped 14.2% in February 2020 as the S&P 500 dropped 8.4%. And Nvidia is turning it on again this year already. Shares are up 42% just in 2024 so far, and February only just started. No S&P 500 stock comes even close to Nvidia this month. But there are some other winners. Take United Rentals. The stock jumped 6.8% on average in February the past five years. In February 2021, United Rentals even outperformed Nvidia jumping 14.2% in just one month. Monolithic Power is another February winner. Like Nvidia, it's in the information technology sector. And it's risen 6.3% on average during the month in the past five years. All these S&P 500 winners highlight that while the market is tough in February, it's still possible to find winners. \"What's more, of the 79 years since 1945, the S&P 500 rose in price in January and February just 37% of the time,\" Stovall said. \"However, when both months registered gains, the S&P 500 recorded a positive full-year total return 100% of the time, rising an average of 24%.\" All beat the market five-straight Februarys Learn How To Time The Market With IBD's ETF Market Strategy Find Today's Best Growth Stocks To Watch With IBD 50 Join IBD Live Each Morning For Stock Tips Before The Open 8 Hot Big Stocks Aren't In The S&P 500 \u2014 But You'll Wish They Were 3/25/2024\nNvidia has nearly doubled in 2024, but new S&P 500 stock Super Micro has more than tripled.
