    "text": "As 2023 drew to a close, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) unequivocally took center stage in the stock market spotlight. Boasting a staggering year-to-date surge of over 240%, NVDA played a pivotal role in driving the broader equity market\u2019s rally, propelling the S&P 500 to within 0.6% of its record high. With Nvidia\u2019s stock price more than tripling last year, on January 2 we turn our attention to whether Wall Street analysts anticipate the chipmaker sustaining this momentum in 2024 and, if so, to what extent. In a nutshell, analysts on Wall Street do not think Nvidia is done rallying. Despite a colossal gain last year, the average 12-month price target on NVDA currently sits at $628.59, implying a potential upside of 26.5% from the current stock price. This consensus forecast is based on analyst coverages on Nvidia\u2019s stock issued in the past 12 months. Among the Wall Street firms that are most bullish on NVDA is Bernstein. Last month, the asset manager\u2019s analysts said Nvidia is still among the cheapest AI-related stocks in spite of a 240% surge. Remarkably, the strategist said Nvidia\u2019s \u201cmassive return in the stock has arguably been disappointing\u201d and even though forward estimates have quadrupled in 2023 amid the AI boom, \u201cmultiples have compressed by almost 2/3 during the same period,\u201d they wrote. In addition, NVDA\u2019s Price to Forward Earnings (P/FE) are still sitting in the mid-20s, the cheapest since the crypto downturn at the end of 2018. P/FE refers to a valuation gauge that reflects market expectations for the company\u2019s future profitability. Other Wall Street heavyweights including Goldman, JPMorgan, and Morgan Stanley have also raised their price targets on NVDA stock recently, each higher than $600. On the other hand, UBS analysts are among those on the bearish side of the spectrum, predicting a 20-30% pullback in the company\u2019s shares in the first half of 2024. At the time of writing, shares of NVDA were sitting at $495.22, up 0.66% in the past five trading sessions and more than 6.4% across the month. The AI stock is facing a resistance zone between $504.3 and $505.48, the latter also being its all-time high. On the downside, NVDA is underpinned by near-term support levels at $480.88 and $476.09. Below that, the next major support for the stock is $457.67, where the 100-day moving average (MA) is located.
