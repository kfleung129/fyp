    "text": "Countdown to Luke Lango\u2019s \u201c2nd Trillion-Dollar A.I. Trade\u201d The U.S. govt just unlocked an $8 trillion market to move in a new direction. See how it could unleash 6,000% potential upside. Nvidia stock has reached stratospheric heights but there are good reasons for that Advertisement Source: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com Nvidia NASDAQ:(NVDA) stock was selling at $631 per share on January 30, having jumped $20 per share in just 24 hours. I was wrong to sell my Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) recently, but I\u2019m sticking with the industry leader. I had to adjust to do that, raising my price-to-sell target from $500 to unknown. How high can it go? The answer lies in looking at its two moats, beyond its strength with Cloud Czars like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)(NASDAQ:GOOG), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).nThose moats are the broader cloud market and its CUDA software. My son the biochemist is studying protein structures and using an internal cloud. To do that, he recently had to spend a whole weekend uploading data. Yes, it\u2019s a small cloud. Most research institutions now have an on-campus cloud. So, too, do most scaled enterprises, which are training their internal databases on Large Language Models, looking for valuable applications. You can also find clouds wherever clouds intersect, like at Equinix (NASDAQ:EQIX) data centers. The point is that there\u2019s a vast cloud market beyond the Cloud Czars. The public clouds, and their consumer-facing markets, may be what most of us think of as \u201cthe Cloud.\u201d But it\u2019s these thousands of private clouds, hungry for Nvidia chips, that are the greater, longer-lasting opportunity. This \u201cprivate cloud market\u201d was worth $12.8 trillion in 2022, growing at over 20% per year, and should be worth over $28 trillion in 2028. These companies aren\u2019t big enough to create their own hardware, like the Cloud Czars. They\u2019re either accepting the cost of Nvidia upgrades or looking for cheaper substitutes. To this, add Nvidia\u2019s own cloud services. Nvidia is bringing its most powerful chips, the Grace Hopper line, to the party. It\u2019s not forgetting the gamers who helped drive its graphics dominance a decade ago, either. Nvidia\u2019s cloud market, in short, has legs, which bodes well for NVDA stock. If Nvidia were just a chip company, it wouldn\u2019t be this powerful, but Nvidia is a software company first. The key to Nvidia\u2019s market dominance remains its CUDA software, seen as an essential building block to AI applications. CUDA is driving competitors crazy, especially Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). CEO Pat Gelsinger told the world in December \u201cthe entire industry is motivated to eliminate Nvidia\u2019s CUDA dominance.\u201d A month later, he had to admit in his latest earnings release Intel is nowhere near that. The earnings themselves weren\u2019t bad. But there was notable weakness in data centers. Intel\u2019s forward guidance was bad enough to send the stock down over 10% in less than an hour. That\u2019s the power of CUDA. A more open framework would benefit AMD, Intel, and Chinese chip makers. It would lower the cost of AI for everyone. But CUDA is a moving target and the market isn\u2019t going to wait for laggards. It\u2019s the old story that the leader gets 90% of the profit, the second-place company 9%, and everyone else fights for what\u2019s left. AI, and Nvidia, are now rocketing through the heart of the vast computer industry. Before they\u2019re done, every computer system you touch will be using AI, and most of them will use Nvidia software. But how high is too high? On Jan. 30 Nvidia was worth $1.54 trillion, with sales approaching $45 billion, and net income expected at about $19 billion. Amazon, which everyone loves, is worth $1.66 trillion. It has 10 times Nvidia\u2019s revenue and only 5% more net income. Nvidia is fully valued. Yes, it can go higher, and likely will over the next year or two. I can\u2019t tell you when to sell because I don\u2019t know myself. But we are getting closer.
