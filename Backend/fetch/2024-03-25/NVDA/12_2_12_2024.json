    "text": "By Dean Seal Shares of Beamr Imaging and Nvidia each touched all-time highs after the companies partnered to accelerate adoption of a new video standard, AV1. Beamr's stock, which started trading about a year ago, touched an all-time high of $14.92 in early trading. That's up more than sixfold from $2.11, where it closed last week. Nvidia's shares ticked up about 1.9% to an all-time high of $734.96. The stock is up 48% from where it started the year, and was trading at around $212.65 this time a year ago. Israel-based Beamr said Monday morning that its new AOMedia Video 1 format, or AV1, is facing slow adoption due to the complex and costly processes of upgrading existing video libraries in growing markets. Beamr and Nvidia plan to jointly present a solution to that challenge at the ACM Mile-High-Video 2024 conference this week, Beamr said. The companies will describe an automated process for transferring video libraries and repositories into AV1 and facilitating that process at scale.
