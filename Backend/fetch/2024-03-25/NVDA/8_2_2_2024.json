    "text": "Meta confirmed plans to deploy a new custom semiconductor chip, dubbed \u201cArtemis,\u201d in its data centers to enhance AI capabilities, reducing dependency on Nvidia. Own this piece of crypto history Meta, the Facebook and Instagram parent company, is preparing to deploy a new version of a custom semiconductor chip in its data centers to support artificial intelligence (AI) development. According to a report by Reuters, an internal document revealed plans for a second generation of an in-house chip, known internally as \u201cArtemis,\u201d as Meta tries to boost its computing capabilities to handle more powerful generative AI products. The Artemis chip is similar to the previous one and is only capable of \u201cinterference,\u201d through which models use their algorithm to create judgments and generate responses to user prompts. The plans were confirmed by a representative from the company who said an updated chip would be introduced during 2024 and would operate alongside \u201chundreds of thousands of off-the-shelf GPUs\u201d the company had been buying. Last month, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that by the end of the year, the company plans to acquire 350,000 flagship \u201cH100\u201d processors from Nvidia.

Nvidia is currently one of the market leaders in producing semiconductor chips used to power high-level AI models. In November, the company reported a\u00a0record $18 billion of revenue in Q3 revenue, for which it cited generative AI as a primary driver. The company\u2019s market capitalization now tops $1.56 trillion, and it plans to expand its offerings in China with a new chip and\u00a0develop a hub in Vietnam. However, Meta isn\u2019t alone in the thought of producing its own chips in-house. Last October, OpenAI, the creator of the popular chatbot ChatGPT, said it was weighing the acquisition of a chip-making firm to make its own AI chips. Later, in January 2024, Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, said the company was aiming to raise funds to create a series of semiconductor manufacturing facilities. In November, Microsoft also released its own chip called \u201cMaia,\u201d which it claimed was the \u201clast puzzle piece\u201d for infrastructure systems designed for AI tasks and generative AI.
