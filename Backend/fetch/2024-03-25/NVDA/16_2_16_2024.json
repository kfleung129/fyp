    "text": "STORY: From the rise and rise of Nvidia, to a costly typo at Lyft, this is the Week in Numbers. Just over $1.8 trillion was the market value hit by the AI chip champion Nvidia on Wednesday. That put it ahead of Google-parent Alphabet as the third most valuable firm in the U.S. Only Microsoft and Apple are worth more, with the Windows maker in top spot at over $3 trillion. 500 basis points is how much Lyft said a key profit margin metric would rise. Only, oops, that was a typo, and the real figure was 50. The mistake sparked a rollercoaster ride for the stock, and could leave the ride-hailing app facing legal action from investors who got burned. Summit Place President Liz Miller says it\u2019s an unprecedented error: \u201cI can\u2019t remember in my career, seeing that kind of mistake in a major company\u2019s earnings release.\u201d 0.4% was the surprise drop in Japanese GDP over the latest quarter, when analysts had predicted a solid increase. The fall for a second straight quarter put the country in recession. It also saw Japan lose its title as the world\u2019s third-biggest economy, with Germany overtaking. $1 trillion is the total value now invested in bitcoin. The number hit that level for the first time since late 2021, helped by flows of cash into new U.S. exchange-traded funds featuring the e-money. And 21 million is how many PlayStation consoles Sony now thinks it will sell over the full year. That\u2019s a big cut from earlier estimates, and comes after disappointing holiday-season sales. A week earlier, rival Nintendo actually raised forecasts for its aging Switch console. "
