The three major indexes ended their five-week winning streak on Friday, influenced by unexpectedly high inflation data and raising concerns that the Federal Reserve may postpone cutting interest rates.\u00a0The S&P 500 closed the week down by 0.42%, the Dow fell by 0.11% and the Nasdaq dropped by 1.34%. Inflation figures released earlier showed a 3.1% year-over-year increase, higher than the forecasted 2.9%, with core inflation also exceeding expectations at 3.9%. The release of a 0.3% monthly increase in the Producer Price Index by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, a jump from the previous month's decline, added to the anxiety about achieving the Fed's 2% inflation goal. As a result, market participants scaled back their expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts in 2024, reducing the anticipated total from 120 basis points to 95.
