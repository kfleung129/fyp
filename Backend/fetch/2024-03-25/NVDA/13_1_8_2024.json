    "text": "Nvidia Corp\u00a0NVDA, a key player in the AI chip market, is grappling with the\u00a0repercussions of U.S. regulations\u00a0that have barred the sale of its high-performance AI chips to China since October. These regulations have led Nvidia to design a new lineup of\u00a0lower-powered AI chips. Still, this shift has not been well-received by major Chinese cloud companies, some of Nvidia's most significant global customers. Companies like\u00a0Alibaba Group Holding Limited\u00a0BABA and\u00a0Tencent Holding Ltd\u00a0TCEHY have indicated their intentions to substantially reduce their orders of Nvidia's chips compared to their original plans when Nvidia offered its now-restricted products, the Wall Street Journal\u00a0reports. Also Read:\u00a0Nvidia Navigates US Tech Restrictions, Eyes Growth in China and India Markets Amidst Global Shifts This reluctance stems from a growing interest in local alternatives and in-house developments. Major Chinese firms, including AI pioneer\u00a0Baidu Inc\u00a0BIDU and\u00a0TikTok\u00a0owner\u00a0ByteDance, are also turning to domestic chip producers like\u00a0Huawei Technologies, reducing their reliance on Nvidia's offerings. Previous reports indicated companies like Tencent and Huawei promoting their AI chips as\u00a0potent Nvidia rivals. The uncertainty surrounding Nvidia's ability to continue supplying chips to the Chinese market further complicated the situation. U.S. regulators have committed to reviewing chip-export controls regularly, and further tightening performance limits are possible. This uncertainty has prompted Chinese tech firms to modify their business strategies to prepare for a future with less access to Nvidia's products. Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang has acknowledged the challenge posed by Huawei, calling it a \"formidable competitor\" in China. Despite Nvidia's efforts to adapt its products to comply with U.S. rules, the company sold over $1 billion of modified chips to Chinese customers in 2023. Chinese cloud companies, currently sourcing about 80% of high-end AI chips from Nvidia, may reduce this to 50%-60% within five years. Nvidia is working on a new lineup of less powerful processors for Chinese buyers and has recently launched the GeForce RTX 4090 D, adapted after U.S. curbs. Nvidia plans to mass-produce a new artificial intelligence (AI) chip, the H20, designed explicitly for the Chinese market in the second quarter of 2024. This move aims to adhere to U.S. export regulations, Reuters reports. Originally slated for launch in November, Nvidia postponed the H20's release to server manufacturers' integration challenges. The initial production volume will be limited, focusing on major customers' orders. The H20 is the most advanced among three China-targeted chips Nvidia developed following the October restrictions. Alongside the H20, Nvidia has also developed the L20 and L2 chips under these restrictions. In December, Nvidia released a modified gaming chip that complies with the new rules. These developments are part of Nvidia's strategy to maintain its market presence in China after the U.S. restricted exports of its advanced A800 and H800 AI chips. The H20, L20, and L2 offer cutting-edge AI features but with reduced computing power to align with the new export regulations. Nvidia stock gained over 214% last year.
