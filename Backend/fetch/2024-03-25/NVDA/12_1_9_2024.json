The annual CES trade show in Las Vegas is upon us and NVIDIA is holding a major press conference that will offer details regarding \u201ca spectrum of cutting-edge technologies.\u201d It goes down on Monday, January 8, at 8AM PT / 11AM ET, the day before CES 2024 officially kicks off. You can watch it directly on NVIDIA\u2019s website, or you can hit up the company\u2019s YouTube page or Twitch channel. So what\u2019s on the agenda for CES 2024? It\u2019s the two most beloved letters in all of tech: AI. NVIDIA will be focusing primarily on \u201cits latest advancements in artificial intelligence,\u201d including generative AI. NVIDIA has been open about AI taking center stage at the event, but it\u2019s been cagey regarding specific announcements. The company has become something of a juggernaut in the space these past couple of years, so there will likely be plenty of new information about its next-gen AI supercomputer chips. There will also be announcements involving \u201cconsumer technologies and robotics\", so AI won\u2019t be the only star of the show. NVIDIA, after all, is a multi-tentacled behemoth of a company. It\u2019s involved in industrial digitization, maintaining data centers and much more. Oh yeah. It also makes GPUs. In addition to the primary press conference, NVIDIA will be maintaining a robust presence throughout CES 2024. The company says its tech will be the focus of 14 other conference sessions, with titles like \u201cReshaping Retail \u2013 AI Creating Opportunity\u201d and \u201cCracking the Smart Car.\u201d To that end, NVIDIA promises demos with a diverse lineup of companies, from Samsung to Mercedes-Benz. NVIDIA spent a lot of time on AI during last year\u2019s keynote, but the company also unveiled new hardware like its updated Geforce GPUs and a refreshed lineup of RTX 40 series laptops. It also went into more detail regarding new and improved cloud based productivity software, among other announcements. In other words, there will very likely be some hardware reveals hidden amongst all of that AI bluster. Engadget has a large team on the ground in Las Vegas covering the event \u2014 follow along for all of our coverage. Now that the press conference is in the books, we have a sub-10-minute recap video live on our site. Key among the announcements: NVIDIA revealed its RTX 40 Super GPUs, including the $999 4080.
