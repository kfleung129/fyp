    "text": "Whether you love her or hate her, Nancy Pelosi has a knack for picking the best stocks\u2026 According to a report by Benzinga, the former speaker of the House acquired 50 call options for Nvidia with a strike price of $120, expiring on December 20, 2024. The transaction value ranged between $1 million and $5 million. Buying call options on a company mean you\u2019re bullish on its future. And the former House speaker nailed it. Benzinga reports Pelosi hauled in nearly $500,000 from her Nvidia bet. That surpasses her annual government salary of about $223,500. Pelosi is known for making big trades and winning them. And her stock trading performance ranks sixth-best in Congress. (For context, there are 535 members in Congress.) Maybe Pelosi is a stock market savant\u2026 Or maybe someone put a bug in her ear\u2026 After all, her husband, Paul Pelosi, is a major venture capitalist. We don\u2019t know\u2026 What we do know is that Daily editor Teeka Tiwari has been bullish on Nvidia since 2015, when he recommended the chipmaker to his readers. At the time, Nvidia had a market cap of $18 billion. Today, it\u2019s the sixth-largest company on the planet, with a valuation over $1.5 trillion. Here\u2019s what Teeka wrote back in 2015\u2026 In the same way that the computer defined the latter half of the 20th century, the 21st century will be defined by artificial intelligence. I\u2019ve never found a company that possessed the ability to go up as much as Nvidia will. It\u2019s poised to become the next tech giant because of its pioneering work in the field of artificial intelligence. When Teeka recommended Nvidia in December 2015, it was trading at a split-adjusted $8 per share. Today, it trades above $613 per share. That\u2019s over a 7,500% gain. The artificial intelligence (AI) trend is still huge. Consultant firm PwC Global estimates it\u2019ll create $15.7 trillion in new wealth. But unless you\u2019re willing to buy risky call options on Nvidia like Madame Speaker did, Teeka says you\u2019re unlikely to see life-changing gains from this company again. That\u2019s because Nvidia is just too big now. But there\u2019s another way to make huge profits from AI. Recently, Teeka unearthed a company he believes will end up supplying Tesla CEO Elon Musk with a key piece of technology for his new AI venture. He even traveled to the Arizona desert to see the new facility this company is building. It will be a game-changer for AI. And after his investigation, Teeka believes this AI stock has more upside than Nvidia. Click here to watch the full report.
