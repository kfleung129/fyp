In 5 minutes, you\u2019ll learn the stocks, CEOs, and money managers moving markets. South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix [000660:KS] is to build a new facility in the US state of Indiana, which will specialise in HBM chips used by Nvidia [NVDA]. This is a major boost to US efforts to onshore chip production: \u201ctogether with TSMC\u2019s Arizona fabs this means Nvidia could eventually be able to have its GPUs produced in the US,\u201d Kim Yang-paeng, a researcher at the Korea Institute for Industrial Economics and Trade, told the Financial Times. Nvidia has begun taking pre-orders for a new artificial intelligence (AI) chip tailored to the Chinese market. It will be priced at the same level as a comparable Huawei product, Reuters reported. Called the H20, it is the most powerful of three new chips Nvidia has designed for China in response to a US export ban. It will be less powerful than the firm\u2019s flagship H100 AI, but may also be less powerful than Huawei\u2019s Ascend 910B. CEO Elon Musk announced that Tesla [TSLA] shareholders will vote on whether to change the firm\u2019s state of incorporation from Delaware to Texas. Volvo [VOLV-B:ST] rocketed nearly 22% after announcing it will pull funding for its lossmaking electric vehicle (EV) arm Polestar; parent Geely [175:HKG] may take on some of its 48% share, the FT reported. Chinese automakers including Changan Auto [000625:SZ] have had to delay deliveries due to issues with Huawei-produced computing units. The market value of Indian digital payments giant Paytm [PAYTM:NS] fell by a fifth on Thursday, after the central bank told its payment bank subsidiary to stop business. It may have come as a shock to the finance and tech spheres, but this move on the part of the Reserve Bank of India follows years of non-compliance with rules, including on customer due diligence, Reuters reported. India\u2019s five million programmers are being eyed for AI talent by the likes of Microsoft [MSFT] and Alphabet [GOOGL], according to Bloomberg. The online game Palworld, a viral sensation that has been described as \u201cPok\u00e9mon with guns\u201d, has become the biggest third-party hit in the history of Microsoft\u2019s Xbox Game Pass. The open-world game has passed seven million players across Xbox and PC, reported Bloomberg. Developed by Tokyo-based Pocketpair, its success is a testament to Microsoft\u2019s new strategy of building a subscription service that offers games from both its own studio and outside developers.
