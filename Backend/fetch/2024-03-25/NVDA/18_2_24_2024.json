Invest Now On Friday, February 23, Nvidia rose to become the first semiconductor firm to hit $2 trillion in market capitalisation, making it the fourth most valuable company in the world behind Microsoft, Apple, and Saudi Aramco (Saudi Arabian Oil Company). This growth has come on the back of another quarter of bumper earnings, putting Wall Street and global markets in a frenzy and pushing up other tech stocks as well. Also read:\u00a0Good luck catching up to Nvidia Nvidia's stock and market cap have ballooned over fivefold since January 2023, when \u2018Generative AI\u2019 suddenly came to the fore in the public eye, entering the popular discourse. In an earnings call post the fourth quarter (Q4) results, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Jensen Huang, who started Nvidia in 1993, said that the demand for its newest products will continue to outstrip supply for the rest of the year as \u2018Generative AI\u2019 has kicked off a whole new investment cycle. While markets across the globe settled after a bumper rise on Thursday, the question now remains whether Nvidia can continue its upward trend. What does Nvidia do? US-based Nvidia Corp provides hardware and software. The company is known for high-end graphics processing units (GPUs) -- used for rendering high-quality graphics -- mostly used in high-performance gaming and the display of HD movies. Over the years, Nvidia has made headway into the fields of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) with solutions in generative AI, cybersecurity, data analytics, and AI learning. Its GPUs are used by data centres for deep learning, such as Tesla and the Quadro series. One of Nvidia\u2019s biggest clients is Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla (which Nvidia beat with the latest growth in market cap) and other autonomous driving players who use Nvidia\u2019s hardware and software solutions for real-time processing of data from sensors. Why the sudden rise in Nvidia stock? In its recent Q4 earnings, Nvidia reported a 265 percent year-on-year (YoY) and 22 percent sequential rise in revenue to $22.1 billion for the quarter and around $60.9 billion for the fiscal year 2024, up 126 percent from the previous year. The biggest gains in the quarter were seen in data centre revenue, which grew more than 3x to $47.5 billion. For Q4, the revenue grew to $18.4 billion, up by around 27 percent on a quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) basis and up 409 percent YoY. According to the company, this was driven by demand for the 'NVIDIA Hopper GPU computing platform along with InfiniBand end-to-end networking'. In the Q4 earnings call, Colette Kress, NVIDIA's chief financial officer (CFO), said that the demand for Hopper remains very strong and they expect their \"next-generation products to be supply-constrained as demand far exceeds supply\". Currently, around 80 vehicle manufacturers \"across global OEMs, new energy vehicles, trucking, robotaxis, and Tier 1 suppliers are using Nvidia\u2019s AI infrastructure to train LLMs and other AI models for automated driving and AI cockpit applications,\" the company said in its call. Revenue from the automotive segment grew 8 percent sequentially to $281 million but was down 4 percent on a YoY basis. Can Nvidia sustain growth? The global market for AI is expected to continue to grow. A PwC report estimates that by 2030, AI could contribute around $15.7 trillion to the global economy and boost the GDP of global economies by 26 percent. Nvidia expects to see revenue of around $24 billion in the current quarter, with sequential growth in data centres. According to Vikas Gupta, Chief Investment Strategist at Omniscience Capital, an India-based global investment management firm focused on global equity investments, NVIDIA has turned out to be the only serious alternative in the market for high-intensity AI, creating a monopoly. \"The competition for the AI workload on the cloud between Azure from Microsoft, AWS from Amazon, and Google Cloud resulted in huge demand for NVIDIA GPUs.\" This created a huge 50+ percent growth rate for NVIDIA revenues, and earnings shot through the roof.\" Gupta expects the outlook to remain at such extremes for the next three to five years. Will Nvidia face market competition? Gupta says that while the outlook continues to be positive, other peers who are currently customers of NVIDIA are also growing their technologies. For example, Google continues to work on TPU tensor processing units; Amazon works on Trainium and Inferential chips; and players like Microsoft, Apple, etc. are also working on their own proprietary AI chips. \"Eventually, the NVIDIA chips will be under threat from the main customers of NVIDIA itself,\" he adds. Reuters reported this week that, for the first time, Nvidia has publicly identified Huawei as a top competitor in several categories, such as AI chips, in a regulatory filing with the US SEC. According to the report, \u201cChina's Huawei competes in supplying chips designed for artificial intelligence, such as graphics processing units, central processing units, and networking chips.\u201d What does this mean for Indian investors?
