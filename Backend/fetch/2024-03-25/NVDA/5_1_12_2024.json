    "text": "Nvidia Corp\u00a0NVDA,\u00a0Intel Corp\u00a0INTC, and\u00a0Micron Technology, Inc\u00a0MU, prominent U.S. chipmakers, have been\u00a0summoned to testify\u00a0before Congress by the House of Representatives\u2019 China committee. The update sent the stock prices down. This request marks a notable shift in the committee\u2019s approach, intensifying its examination of companies with substantial ties to China. The committee, which hadn\u2019t previously held hearings with CEOs from any industry since its formation, now focuses on these tech giants due to their significant operations and sales in China, the Financial Times\u00a0reports. A trade and sanctions expert, Emily Kilcrease, highlighted that this hearing is part of the committee\u2019s efforts to exert political pressure on companies heavily involved in China. This increased scrutiny comes after the CEOs of Intel, Nvidia, and\u00a0Qualcomm Inc\u00a0QCOM actively lobbied against more rigid semiconductor-related export controls proposed by the Biden administration last year. These companies, which declined to comment on the letters of summons, rely on China for a considerable portion of their annual revenues. In FY17, Micron saw 50% of its $20 billion revenue coming from China, but this figure dropped dramatically to 16% in 2022, coinciding with the company shutting down its\u00a0DRAM operations in Shanghai. Meanwhile, Nvidia dominates China\u2019s AI chip market, holding as much as 90% of the market, valued at\u00a0around $7 billion. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger, Nvidia\u2019s Jensen Huang, and Qualcomm\u2019s Christiano Amon had previously met with White House officials to argue against stringent export restrictions, warning of potential long-term harm to the U.S. industry. The U.S. Commerce Department, however, tightened restrictions on exporting AI chips to China, impacting Nvidia significantly.

The House committee\u2019s move reflects broader efforts to scrutinize U.S. companies with operations in China, including firms like BlackRock. It holds implications for these companies as China becomes a focal point in the upcoming 2024 presidential election. Kilcrease emphasized that these actions signify a push towards decoupling tech supply chains, increasing the heat on America\u2019s key chip companies. Price Actions:\u00a0NVDA shares traded lower by 0.52% at $545.35 on the last check Friday. INTC shares traded lower by 1.79% at $46.78 and MU traded lower by 1.63% at $82.03.
