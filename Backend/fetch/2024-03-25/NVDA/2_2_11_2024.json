However, there might be a bit of a slowdown as WLD approaches a key breakout level that could further propel the Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based token higher. Read more on AI and Nvidia earnings - Link Worldcoin price created two local bottoms on January 23 and February 5, which hinted at a potential double-bottom pattern. WLD shot up 15% from the second swing low and is currently approaching the $2.66 hurdle, adding credibility to the said technical formation. A decisive candlestick close above $2.66 will confirm a breakout for Worldcoin price from the double-pattern. This technical formation forecasts a nearly 20% upswing to $3.19, which is obtained by adding the distance between the peak and second bottom to the breakout point. Until that happens, Worldcoin price is likely going to consolidate below $2.66, allowing sidelined buyers to accumulate WLD.

But if the results on February 21 are lackluster, it could result in a sell-off for the AI-token Worldcoin. In such a case, if WLD produces a twelve-hour candlestick close below $2.29, it will invalidate the bullish thesis. This steep correction would promote a break in the potential recovery of the altcoin and potentially trigger a near-10% correction to the January 23 swing low at $2.07.

Litecoin (LTC) price\u00a0shows strength\u00a0as it attempts to recover last week\u2019s losses. LTC faces two critical hurdles, overcoming which could result in massive gains for the altcoin. Celestia (TIA) price shows a slowdown of the\u00a0bullish momentum\u00a0after forming an all-time high (ATH), and suggests a potential reversal. If Bitcoin triggers a sell-off, it could kickstart another correction, TIA is most likely to follow its lead. Sushi (SUSHI) price shows readiness to move higher after it recently overcame a key hurdle. If the market outlook remains unchanged or improves favoring the bulls SUSHI could trigger a massive upswing. Ripple (XRP) price has breached a key hurdle into a support floor while tightly consolidating for roughly 250 days. As this range resolves, investors can expect XRP to kickstart a massive up move, similar to what many meme coins have undergone. Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) upward momentum has shown a significant decline for the past two weeks or so. This development led to a bearish signal on the weekly and an uncertain outlook on the monthly.
