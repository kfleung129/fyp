    "text": "Countdown to Luke Lango\u2019s \u201c2nd Trillion-Dollar A.I. Trade\u201d The U.S. govt just unlocked an $8 trillion market to move in a new direction. See how it could unleash 6,000% potential upside. Don't look now, but this high-flying chip stock is headed even higher Advertisement Source: Below the Sky / Shutterstock.com One of the best-performing large-cap stocks of last year, Nvidia (NVDA) stock is starting off 2024 on the right foot. Today, NVDA stock made yet another all-time high, hitting an intraday high of more than $540 per share. At its current market capitalization of over $1.33 trillion, Nvidia is by far the largest semiconductor stock in the world \u2014 and one to which investors are paying close attention. Today\u2019s move is notable in particular because it\u2019s a reflection that momentum remains strong for this chipmaker. Indeed, yesterday\u2019s fresh all-time high has already been eclipsed with yet another high. This is the sort of price action that makes investors and traders giddy. Let\u2019s dive into what continues to drive the strong performance with Nvidia and whether these catalysts can hold for the rest of the year. Nvidia is certainly among a select list of companies with the most catalysts to focus on this year, at least in terms of growth. In addition to various macro tailwinds bolstering many long-duration tech companies (most notably expectations of interest rate cuts and more robust growth this year), Nvidia\u2019s core artificial intelligence-related chips remain in the spotlight for most investors. At the 2024 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, Nvidia announced a number of new graphics processing units (GPUs), among other things. More specifically, Nvidia announced its GeForce RTX 40 Super Series GPUs. The company also announced AI software and tools aimed at both developers and users. These chips and tools accelerate the company\u2019s road map toward becoming a premier hardware/software player in this space \u2014 something investors clearly like when penciling in future margins. On top of this, I recently reported on Nvidia\u2019s AI chip offerings aimed at the Chinese market. That catalyst is still in play, which investors should be watching closely. Overall, Nvidia is a chip company that now appeals to AI-focused investors as well as those looking for software exposure. For fundamental investors seeking margin expansion and top- and bottom-line growth, there\u2019s something to like from these announcements, too. It\u2019s a little bit of everything for every investor type, meaning NVDA stock could have more room to run from here if the buying pressure continues.
