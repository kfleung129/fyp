    "text": "Antonio Bordunovi/iStock Editorial via Getty Images Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang is reportedly working with executives at Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) to address supply constraints associated with artificial intelligence chips. Nvidia shares climbed upwards of 4% during Thursday trading. Huang was said to have met with Taiwan Semi CEO C.C. Wang and company founder Morris Chang in Taipei on Wednesday to discuss the issue, which proved to be a hurdle to the AI boom last year, Bloomberg reported. Nvidia did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Seeking Alpha. One of the biggest issues facing Nvidia is US sanctions against China, which prevents the company from shipping some of its chips there. Huang has warned that these sanctions will likely prompt China to simply develop its own AI chips. Santa Clara, Calif.-based Nvidia unveiled its GeForce RTX 4090D GPU for China last month, which the semiconductor giant said offers a \"quantum leap in performance efficiency, and AI-driven graphics.\" The company is said to be working on mass production of an even more powerful AI chip designed for China, slated to come in the second quarter of 2024. Nvidia is set to report fourth-quarter results on Feb. 15 after the close of trading. A consensus of analysts expects the company to earn an adjusted $4.51 per share and $20.19B in revenue. "
