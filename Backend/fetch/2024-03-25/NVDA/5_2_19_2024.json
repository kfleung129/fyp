NEW YORK: Next week\u2019s earnings report from chipmaker Nvidia could prove a gut check for one of the market\u2019s hottest names, and for the artificial intelligence fever that has helped power gains for US stocks in recent months. Excitement over the business potential of AI has boosted Nvidia\u2019s shares by more than 46% since Jan. 1. Its $570 billion increase in market capitalization is more than triple the market value of Intel. Shares of Nvidia, whose chips are considered the gold standard in the AI industry, surged nearly 240% in 2023. The chipmaker\u2019s gains have accounted for more than a quarter of the S&P 500\u2019s increase this year. The benchmark index is up nearly 5% year-to-date, after optimism about AI helped drive the index up 24% in 2023. Now the third  most valuable  company on Wall Street after Apple and Microsoft, Nvidia has also become a bellwether for the artificial intelligence industry. Other AI-focused stocks have surged this year, including Super Micro Computer Inc, which is up 182% year-to-date, and Arm Holdings, up nearly 71%. \u201cWhen people say that the market is doing well this year, they really mean that tech is doing well, and Nvidia is at the core of that,\u201d said Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at Truist Advisory Services. \u201cThere is excitement within AI and if that optimism is not fulfilled by earnings then you could see that reverberate quickly and weigh on sentiment.\u201d Nvidia will release quarterly earnings results on Feb. 21. Wall Street expects earnings of $4.56 a share, and a rise in quarterly revenue to $20.378 billion from $6.05 billion a year ago, according to the mean estimate from 33 analysts, based on LSEG data. Given the company\u2019s size and its importance to the AI story, Nvidia\u2019s results could be pivotal for market sentiment, said Kevin Landis, a portfolio manager at Firsthand Capital. \u201cEvery time you get a big stock market rally there\u2019s a favorite stock that leads it,\u201d said Landis, who regrets selling his shares in Nvidia last year. \u201cIt\u2019s hard not to look at Nvidia and see \u2026 that\u2019s driving the psychology of the overall market.\u201d  Not surprisingly, traders are bracing for big moves in the company\u2019s shares. Nvidia options are pricing a swing of about 11% in either direction following its results, according to data from options analytics service ORATS. That\u2019s the largest expected move options traders have priced ahead of Nvidia\u2019s earnings over the last three years and well above the stock\u2019s average earnings move of 6.7% over that period, ORATS data showed. Tom Hainlin, senior investment strategist at US Bank Wealth Management, said positive updates to Nvidia\u2019s corporate outlook could fuel more AI optimism and extend a market rally that has been concentrated in the so-called Magnificent Seven group of megacap stocks, of which Nvidia is a member. Shares of Meta Platforms, another member of the group, have surged 34% this year while Apple\u2019s have fallen by 5%. Shares of Tesla have tumbled nearly 20% after the electric car maker warned of \u201cnotably lower\u201d sales growth this year and shrinking margins. \u201cRight now investors are rewarding visibility into earnings growth and that keys up well for more gains for Nvidia,\u201d Hainlin said. On the other hand, investors may use a less-than-stellar report as an opportunity to take profits. Ryuta Makino, research analyst at Gabelli Funds, believes investor enthusiasm for Nvidia is so high that its shares could fall by at least 10% if the company simply meets expectations, without exceeding them. He remains bullish on Nvidia due to rising capital expenditures from customers such as Amazon.com and Microsoft into their cloud businesses, which rely on the company\u2019s chips. A disappointing report from Nvidia could also exacerbate concerns over crowding in the market\u2019s largest stocks, said Michael Purves, head of Tallbacken Capital Advisors. Overall, investors have their highest allocation to the tech sector since August 2020, according to fund managers in the latest survey conducted by BofA Global Research. \u201cThis is the pillar of the growth for the index today, but at some point the gas tank will go empty,\u201d Purves said.
