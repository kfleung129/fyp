    "text": "Investors have gotten used to incredible year-over-year comparisons during the past several quarters for Nvidia Corp., which continues to lead the market for graphics-processing units being deployed by data centers to support their corporate clients\u2019 build-out of artificial-intelligence technology. Nvidia \n        NVDA\n       is scheduled to announce results for the fourth quarter of its fiscal 2024 next Wednesday at 5 p.m. Eastern time. The consensus among analysts polled by FactSet is for the company to report quarterly sales of $20.28 billion, up from $6.05 billion a year earlier. A year-over-year comparison of the company\u2019s sales results doesn\u2019t tell the full story. Nvidia\u2019s sales increased rapidly during each of the past three quarters as GPU sales for AI deployment \u2014 essentially a new market last year \u2014 took off. The quarterly sales number of $20.28 billion expected next week would be a 12% sequential increase from the $18.12 billion during the company\u2019s third quarter of its fiscal 2024, which ended Oct. 29. Nvidia\u2019s soaring sales and profits have set the stage for its shares to more than triple in value over the past year. So an important question for investors now is how long the company can maintain a high pace of growth for sales. To help answer that question, we screened consensus sales estimates among analysts polled by FactSet for the S&P 500 \n        .\n       We used FactSet\u2019s adjusted calendar-year numbers for the estimates, with 2023 as a baseline. So the 2023 numbers are actual for companies whose fiscal years match the calendar and that have already reported their fourth-quarter results. For other companies \u2014 about 20% of the S&P 500 \u2014 with fiscal years that don\u2019t match the calendar, the 2023 numbers are estimates based mainly on results reported last year. Based on the consensus estimates through calendar 2025, these 20 companies in the S&P 500 are expected to show the highest compound annual growth rates for sales. The sales estimates are in millions.

We have included price-to-earnings and price-to-sales figures, based on Feb. 14 closing prices and consensus estimates for calendar 2025. In comparison, the S&P 500 trades for 18.2 times the weighted aggregate consensus estimate for 2025 and 2.5 times the weighted sales estimate for that year. The S&P 500\u2019s expected two-year sales CAGR through 2025, based on the weighted consensus estimates, is 5.3%. So Nividia\u2019s price ratios based on the 2025 estimates are high, but you pay a premium for rapid sales growth. And its price-to-sales ratio is high relative to the price-to-earnings ratio because the company\u2019s marginal profit is so high for the GPUs. Let\u2019s end with a summary of analysts\u2019 opinions of these stocks. Keep in mind that most analysts working for brokerage firms set 12-month price targets, which may be considered a relatively short period for long-term growth investors. An overwhelming percentage of analysts rate Nvidia a buy or the equivalent, but the stock has gotten ahead of the consensus 12-month price target. Maybe even the analysts believe that setting one-year price targets isn\u2019t very helpful for long-term investors. Don\u2019t miss: Want your stock picks to beat index funds?
