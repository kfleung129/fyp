    "text": "To help compete against the world\u2019s dominant AI chip-maker, Rebellions is partnering with Samsung and recently raised $124 million in a Series B round, bringing its total funding to $210 million. Rebellions' AI chip. The incredible rise in Nvidia\u2019s share price last year has spurred an arms race among semiconductor startups from Silicon Valley to Seoul to raise more funds and gain a foothold in the fast-growing AI chip market. In the semiconductor hub of South Korea, a four-year-old AI chip startup led by a former Wall Street quant recently got a big boost in the funding race. Last week Rebellions, based in Seongnam, south of Seoul, announced it raised $124 million in Series B funding, bringing its total funding to $210 million\u2014more than any other AI chip startup in South Korea, according to Rebellions. \u201cThat\u2019s almost double other competitors,\u201d Sunghyun Park, cofounder and CEO of Rebellions, says excitedly in a video interview. Its competitors include Sapeon, which last raised $45 million in July from investors including Seoul-based private equity firm Ascent Equity Partners (a backer of \u201cBaby Shark\u201d creator Pinkfong), South Korean conglomerate GS Group and WE Ventures, whose portfolio includes South Korean rich lister Song Chi-hyung\u2019s crypto exchange operator Dunamu. Another competitor is FuriosaAI, which raised a $70 million Series B in 2021 from investors including D2 Startup Factory, backed by South Korean billionaire Lee Hae-jin\u2019s internet giant Naver; DSC Investment, an early backer of Seoul- and Seattle-based chip design startup MangoBoost; and Seoul-based Aion Asset Management. Rebellions\u2019 Series B round valued it at $650 million. \u201cBut the funding market is very bad at the moment\u2014interest rates are up,\u201d adds Park, who was a quant developer at Morgan Stanley in New York before starting Rebellions in 2020. \u201cSo if we were in a normal market situation, we would definitely be a unicorn company.\u201d Rebellions cofounder and CEO Sunghyun Park. The round was led by South Korean telecom operator KT and was joined by KT\u2019s data center unit, KT Cloud, and Shinhan Venture Investment, an arm of banking giant Shinhan Financial Group. Other investors in the round include Temasek\u2019s Pavilion Capital, Korelya Capital, founded and led by former French digital economy minister Fleur Pellerin who is an ethnic Korean; Japan\u2019s DG Daiwa Ventures, a joint venture between brokerage Daiwa Securities Group and early-stage investor Digital Garage; and Noh & Partners, a South Korean private equity firm whose portfolio companies include Forbes Asia 100 to Watch 2022 honoree Seoul Robotics. Rebellions\u2019 earlier investors include Kakao Ventures, the venture capital arm of billionaire Kim Beom-su\u2019s internet giant Kakao; state-run Korea Development Bank; SV Investment, a South Korean VC firm which has backed the likes of Kakao and South Korean rich lister Lee Sang-ryul\u2019s EV battery-component maker Chunbo; and IMM Investment, whose portfolio companies include billionaire Bom Kim\u2019s Coupang and Chang Byung-gyu\u2019s Krafton. Investors like Rebellions because of its team that combines research and development expertise from the U.S. and manufacturing know-how from South Korea, says Park, who earned a Ph.D. in electrical engineering and computer science from MIT and has previously worked at SpaceX, Intel and Samsung\u2019s Texas office. \u201cWe are the only AI chip company that has this mix of talent,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s why we got a lot of attention.\u201d Jinwook Oh, cofounder and CTO of Rebellions, for example, worked at IBM in New York for six years and holds a Ph.D. in electrical engineering from Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, South Korea\u2019s leading science and technology university. Park and his team will use the funds raised from the latest round to develop a next-generation AI chip for running large language models and hyperscalers, which are large cloud-computing service providers like AWS, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. Park says one of the advantages of the new chip, called Rebel, is that it\u2019s a lot cheaper than Nvidia\u2019s chips, which can go for over $30,000 apiece. \u201cWe\u2019re targeting half of Nvidia\u2019s price,\u201d he says. \u201cNvidia\u2019s margins are huge.\u201d The $1.6 trillion-market-cap company reported a gross margin of 74% for the quarter ended October 29. \u201cWhen there\u2019s a Goliath, there\u2019s going to be a David. I believe one of the David candidates from South Korea is Rebellions.\u201d The South Korean startup says it is able to lower costs by using domestic suppliers and manufacturers. \u201cBy using the Korean semiconductor ecosystem, we can significantly reduce the manufacturing cost,\u201d says Park. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t need to be a global supply chain involving Taiwan and the U.S. That takes a lot of time and money.\u201d Santa Clara, California-based Nvidia, for example, primarily uses TSMC in Taiwan, the world\u2019s leading manufacturer of cutting-edge chips. More specifically, Rebellions is using the Samsung ecosystem. Samsung, led by billionaire Jay Y. Lee, is the world\u2019s largest memory chip maker and the only other contract chip manufacturer besides TSMC capable of making today\u2019s most advanced chips. Rebellions is co-developing Rebel with Samsung and will use the tech conglomerate\u2019s high bandwidth memory chips and its 4-nanometer chip manufacturing process. \u201cWe are tightly coupled with Samsung, so that\u2019s why we can significantly reduce the manufacturing cost,\u201d says Park. Rebellions and Samsung aim to complete the development of Rebel by the end of this year and start mass production in 2025. By partnering with South Korea\u2019s largest company\u2014and with backing from some of the country\u2019s top investors\u2014Park says Rebellions can take on billionaire Jensen Huang\u2019s Nvidia. \u201cCurrently, Nvidia is king. But nobody likes it\u2014its market share is about 90%\u2014nobody likes it because it\u2019s super expensive,\u201d Park says. \u201cWhen there\u2019s a Goliath, there\u2019s going to be a David. I believe one of the David candidates from South Korea is Rebellions.\u201d He adds, \u201cWe\u2019re rebellious, it\u2019s in our team name.\u201d  "
