    "text": "At the center of today\u2019s buzzing scene of artificial intelligence are two companies, OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, and Nvidia (NVDA), which supplies the vast majority of computing chips to application developers like OpenAI. While both companies benefit hugely from the A.I. hype, their CEOs are advocates of global governance and setting guardrails in the rapidly advancing technology. Thank you for signing up!

At the World Government Summit in Dubai this week, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman proposed a regulatory sandbox approach, which encourages experimentation with A.I. and then \u201csee what makes sense and what doesn\u2019t and then write the regulation around that,\u201d Altman said in an onstage interview with H.E. Omar Al Olama, the UAE Minister for A.I., on Feb. 13. In the past year, OpenAI has become synonymous with the A.I. industry as a whole, as its flagship products ChatGPT, Dall-E and Sora, a text-to-video generator launched yesterday (Feb. 15), have exposed the world to A.I.\u2019s advanced capabilities. Altman said every country is looking to create its own regulatory environment and, at some point, a single global framework would be required to ensure countries are on the same page about the deployment and uses of A.I. An example already in practice is the International Atomic Energy Agency, an organization formed \u201cto decide what will happen with the most powerful of these systems,\u201d Altman said. Altman hinted at the possibility of open-sourcing previous iterations of OpenAI\u2019s models, such as GPT-3, as OpenAI has already done with GPT-2, to foster collaborative innovation. Also speaking at the event was Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, whose company\u2019s market cap exceeded $1 trillion last year. He called on countries to develop what he described as \u201csovereign A.I.\u201d \u201cThis is the beginning of a new industrial revolution,\u201d Huang said in an onstage fireside chat with Minister Al Olama on Feb. 12. \u201cEvery country needs to own the production of their intelligence.\u201d Emphasizing the importance of each country owning its data, Huang described, \u201c[your data] codifies your culture, your society\u2019s intelligence, your history. Therefore, you must take your data, refine it, and create your own national intelligence.\u201d The Nvidia CEO emphasized the diverse applications of A.I. across multiple domains, from biology and physics to robotics, highlighting the need for comprehensive regulatory frameworks to ensure safety and ethical standards in A.I.-driven industries. \u201cWe have to develop the technology safely, we have to apply the technology safely, and we have to help people use the technology safely,\u201d he said. \u201cWhether it\u2019s the plane that I came in, cars or medicine, all of these industries are heavily regulated today.\u201d As countries around the world navigate using A.I. to empower their growth, Altman and Huang emphasized the role of regulation in shaping the industry\u2019s future. Already,\u00a0China and Brazil have proposed drafts to regulate A.I. in specific use cases, while Israel and Japan have instituted clarifications to protect consumer data based on existing laws. Italy, which instituted a temporary ChatGPT ban over data concerns last March, is also further exploring regulations to protect consumer privacy.\u00a0In the U.S., 52 percent of Americans report feeling more concerned than excited about A.I. Much discussion has taken place about protecting artists and writers whose work is used to train A.I. models, allowing consumers to unknowingly use copyrighted work without giving credits to their original creators. Additionally, much scrutiny has come on tech companies for the emergence of deepfakes and the potential misinformation A.I. could fuel in the coming election season. While regulation is important, Huang and Altman both believe democratizing A.I. will unleash a new chapter in human creativity. For example, every person can interact with A.I. today without the barrier of learning how to code, as the language of computers has \u201cbecome human,\u201d Huang said. Altman echoed, \u201cIf you think of everybody on Earth getting the resources of a company hundreds of thousands of really competent people\u2014an A.I. programmer, an A.I. lawyer, an A.I. marketer, A.I. strategist, and not just one of those but many of each, and you get to decide how you want to use that to create whatever you want to create, the creative power of humanity with tools like that should be remarkable.\u201d We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.
