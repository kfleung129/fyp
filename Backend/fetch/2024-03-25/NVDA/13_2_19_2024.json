    "text": "As the share prices of Arm and Nvidia have demonstrated in the last month\u2014they\u2019re up 63% and 26% respectively over that period\u2014the chip sector is arguably where the action is these days. And the excitement continues to ratchet up. The biggest (in money terms) news came on Friday, when Bloomberg reported that Masayoshi Son\u2019s SoftBank planned to attack Nvidia head-on with a new AI chip venture, for which Son was hoping to raise $100 billion. Of that sum, $30 billion would apparently come from SoftBank and $70 billion from Middle Eastern institutions. The venture is reportedly codenamed Izanagi, in reference to the Japanese creator deity. SoftBank used to have a $3.6 billion stake in Nvidia, but dumped it all at the start of 2019, and now wants to create a rival. The Izanagi news sent SoftBank\u2019s share price up by nearly 5% today. If the plan comes to fruition, it will be interesting to see any alliance between it and Arm, in which SoftBank has a 90% stake. As Arm\u2019s chip designs have become crucial to chipmakers such as Nvidia, Arm risks raising antitrust concerns if it partners with any chipmakers. Just ask Nvidia, whose planned $40 billion takeover of Arm collapsed two years ago in the face of regulatory scrutiny. (Nvidia did however recently take a $147 million stake in Arm, which currently enjoys a market cap of $132 billion.) SoftBank\u2019s big chip play is yet another indicator of its pivot from funding startups\u2014which mostly turned out pretty badly\u2014to focusing on semiconductors. The company is awash with cash, thanks to both a windfall stemming from the 2020 merger of T-Mobile US with SoftBank\u2019s Sprint, and the sudden rise in Arm\u2019s fortunes. (It may or may not be worth noting at this point that SoftBank is among the rumored potential buyers for the U.K. AI-chip firm Graphcore, which is hemorrhaging money and desperately seeking a way out.) As for looking to the Middle East for the rest of Izanagi\u2019s funding\u2026well, that sounds familiar. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is doing the same thing for his proposed, supposedly multi-trillion-dollar AI-chip venture, and Bloomberg reported Friday that he\u2019s seeking the U.S. government\u2019s blessing, for a couple reasons. First, there\u2019s a likelihood of major Middle Eastern backing sparking a national-security review. Second, if this ends up being a separate venture from OpenAI but OpenAI ends up being a customer or competitor, Altman could place himself in a conflict of interest that might attract antitrust scrutiny. Speaking of the U.S. government, the Biden administration is starting to hand out the first really enormous piles of subsidies under the 2022 CHIPS Act, to stimulate semiconductor manufacturing on American soil. (Microchip Technology has already been awarded $162 million, and BAE Systems $35 million.) Today, the government announced it had signed preliminary terms with GlobalFoundries, in which the giant chipmaking contractor will receive $1.5 billion to build out and modernize its U.S. production capabilities. And Bloomberg reports that Intel may receive $10 billion to support the onshoring of some of its manufacturing. Even if the up-to-$7 trillion Altman is reportedly seeking for his chip venture is fantasy money, the real sums in play these days are eye-watering enough. More news below.

As predicted earlier this month, the European Commission has opened a formal investigation into TikTok\u2019s potential breaching of the EU\u2019s new Digital Services Act (DSA) content rules. The Commission, which enforces the new law on Big Tech firms, says it suspects TikTok may have designed its app to \u201cstimulate behavioral addictions and/or create so-called \u2018rabbit-hole effects,\u2019\u201d with possible consequences for children\u2019s rights and online radicalization. It also doesn\u2019t like TikTok\u2019s age-verification processes and other child-protection measures, nor its lack of transparency around research data and ads. DSA fines can run up to 6% of global revenues. Election interference alliance. Generative AI companies like Microsoft, OpenAI, and Adobe have banded together with social media platforms such as Meta, TikTok, and X to sign an accord aimed at countering AI disinformation in this grand slam of an election year (over half the world\u2019s population will see elections). As Reuters reports, the companies will work on tools for detecting misleading AI-generated content, and will try to educate voters about the dangers out there. A big however: There\u2019s no stated timeline for meeting these commitments. U.K. school phone bans. The British government is planning to give schools official guidance on how to implement bans on mobile phone usage, the Guardian reports. Some schools already have bans in place, but many education leaders point out that the targeted problems\u2014compulsive use, online bullying, and so on\u2014occur when the kids are out of school and therefore not subject to the bans. \u2014The OpenAI valuation at which the company has struck a deal with its workers, allowing them to sell their stakes, according to Bloomberg. The tender offer was delayed by the drama of CEO Sam Altman\u2019s ouster and return late last year.

Canada\u2019s small-claims court has forced Air Canada to honor the policy its customer-services AI chatbot made up when dealing with a grieving passenger. Air Canada\u2019s actual policy does not allow passengers to retrospectively request bereavement rates after they\u2019ve made the booking, but the chatbot told Jake Moffatt, whose grandma had just died, that he could book his flight immediately and then claim a bereavement refund within 90 days. As Ars Technica reports, Air Canada refused to issue the refund and, when Moffatt took it to Canada\u2019s Civil Resolution Tribunal, tried to argue that it wasn\u2019t responsible for what its chatbot said.
