    "text": "Morgan Stanley no longer considers Nvidia Corp. its No. 1 chip pick, and is now turning to a different part of the sector for its latest top endorsement. Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore has elevated Western Digital Corp.\u2019s stock \n        WDC,\n        +0.31%\n       to his No. 1 recommendation, bumping Nvidia\u2019s stock \n        NVDA,\n        +3.12%\n       down to second place. While artificial intelligence is the hot theme in chips these days, Moore isn\u2019t calling out AI so much as cheering the potential for more than 25% upside in shares of Western Digital, which makes computer data-storage products. He sees an \u201cextremely compelling\u201d valuation gap between Western Digital shares and peer names, and he\u2019s upbeat that an upcoming separation of the memory- and hard-drive chip company will translate to value for investors. \u201cWhile the market appeared to favor consolidation scenarios, the decision to separate the hard-disk-drive and memory assets towards the end of the year actually simplifies the story completely,\u201d Moore wrote in a Monday note to clients. He also flagged improvements in NAND memory trends as a tailwind. \u201cWe are seeing NAND prices up more than 20% [on a sequential basis in the first quarter], more in some areas,\u201d he wrote. \u201cGiven that the company had already guided to positive gross margins in the December quarter, we should already be at midcycle gross margins in the March quarter, in contrast to memory peers.\u201d Don\u2019t miss: Why Marvell just dethroned Nvidia as Citi\u2019s top chip-stock pick Admittedly, Moore has a \u201csomewhat mixed\u201d view of the longer-term NAND cycle, noting that \u201cfab utilization is quite low, and will rise imminently.\u201d That trend is \u201cbad for economics,\u201d he continued, but there have also been few new entrants into the NAND market recently. He upped his price target on the stock to $73 from $52, with the new target representing 27% upside from midday levels Monday. The stock was trading up 5.2% at last check Monday.
