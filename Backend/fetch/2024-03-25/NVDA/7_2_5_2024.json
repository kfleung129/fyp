The searing growth in the stock price \u2013 already up 34% so far this year \u2013 has made it more expensive to own relative to its peers.

Its previous price target was $625.\nThe bank also lifted its full-year 2025-2026 earnings estimates for Nvidia by 22% on an average, citing signs of robust AI server demand and improving graphics processing unit (GPU) supply.\nHari pointed to signs of AI monetization from companies including Microsoft and Meta Platforms as well as positive earnings outlook from AI server maker Super Micro Computer.\nWhile Nvidia has unlocked billions in revenue on the back of the AI frenzy, other chipmakers that are not so deeply involved in making chips for the AI, such as Intel, have seen their shares lag.\nNvidia is set to report results on Feb. 21, with analysts expecting fourth-quarter earnings per share of $4.51 and revenue of $20.19 billion, according to LSEG data.\n\n (Reporting by Sruthi Shankar in Bengaluru; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty)\nDisclaimer: This report is auto generated from the Reuters news service.
