Huang expressed enthusiasm about the collaboration, stating, \u201cWe\u2019ve been a partner of Canada since the beginning of deep learning, and so this is a very important region for us to invest in, a very important country for us to invest in.\u201d While acknowledging the global focus on AI infrastructure in countries such as Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Britain, France, and Italy, Huang emphasized the unique opportunity for Canada. He considers Canada the birthplace of modern AI, attributing this status to the contributions of AI pioneers Yoshua Bengio and Geoffrey Hinton, who conducted groundbreaking research in the country. Despite the strong AI research presence in Canada, concerns have been raised about the country\u2019s slipping global ranking in AI talent and capacity, as reported by U.K. firm Tortoise. Stephen Toope, president of the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research, expressed apprehension about the decline and emphasized the importance of government encouragement and support for young researchers.

One commentator remarked, \u201cMake Canada attractive without having to bribe these wealthy companies\u201d while another took a jab at the government\u2019s priorities, commenting sarcastically that the move could probably \u201csee if AI can solve the high grocery prices from Loblaws who hold a monopoly on the grocery sector.\u201d Information for this briefing was found via The Globe And Mail and the sources mentioned.
