The startup Figure AI \u2014 also backed by OpenAI and Microsoft \u2014 is raising about $675 million in a funding round that carries a pre-money valuation of roughly $2 billion, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the matter is private. Through his firm Explore Investments, Bezos has committed $100 million. Microsoft is investing $95 million, while Nvidia and an Amazon.com-affiliated fund are each providing $50 million. Robots have emerged as a critical new frontier for the AI industry, letting it apply cutting-edge technology to real-world tasks. At Figure, engineers are working on a robot that looks and moves like a human.
