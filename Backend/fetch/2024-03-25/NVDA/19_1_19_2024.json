    "text": "Throughout 2023, demand for next-generation GPUs and CPUs soared as companies sought to power their new AI applications. And as a result, AI chip stocks offered some of the best ways to play the emerging AI megatrend. Take Nvidia (NVDA), for example. That AI chipmaker saw its stock more than triple last year! Worried you missed out on the boom? InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Don\u2019t be. Yesterday, we received confirmation that this Chip Boom will potentially repeat on an even bigger scale in 2024. The world\u2019s largest chipmaker, Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) \u2013 also known as TSMC \u2013 just reported quarterly earnings yesterday. And those earnings were outstanding. Both revenues and earnings smashed expectations. But far more importantly, management said that 2024 will be a great year for the company (far better than even 2023) because of burgeoning demand for AI chips. In response, TSMC stock popped about 10%. And it wasn\u2019t alone. Nvidia stock rose 2%. Intel (INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) shot higher, too. Qualcomm (QCOM) popped almost 5%. Broadcom (AVGO) rose about 4%. Arm (ARM) soared nearly 7%. The entire iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX) rose almost 4%. AI chip stocks truly blasted off. And it seems they\u2019re going to stay hot for all of 2024. Our technical work suggests chip stocks could pop about 30% this year, on average. And of course, that means certain chip stocks will rise a lot more than that, too. Which look best positioned to soar in 2024? Well, we\u2019re confident it\u2019s not NVDA. We moved on from that stock last year \u2013 after we were able to score ~1,000% gains for subscribers. Now we\u2019re focused on the next batch of potential big-time AI chip stock winners.
