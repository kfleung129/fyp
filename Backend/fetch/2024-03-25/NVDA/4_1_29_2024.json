    "text": "Wall Street analyst Ed Yardeni is drawing parallels between Nvidia Corp.\u2018s NVDA current stock market rally and Cisco Systems Inc.\u2018s CSCO meteoric ascent during the 1990s tech bubble. Nvidia could potentially soar even higher before facing any risk of a downturn\u2014if such a risk materializes at all, Yardeni said. What Happened: Nvidia\u2019s stock value continues to surge as the market grapples with a critical question: Are we on the verge of another bubble, or is this the ascent of a sustainable technological boom? Since the introduction of ChatGPT by OpenAI on Nov. 30, 2022, Nvidia \u2014 the leading manufacturer of AI chips \u2014 has seen its stock soar by an astounding 265%. This surge has outpaced the S&P 500 Semiconductor Index\u2019s 108% gain over the same period. The growth trajectory, as Yardeni showed, shows a sharp upward trend. It\u2019s reminiscent of Cisco\u2019s eightfold increase before its eventual crash in the early 2000s. \u201cIs Nvidia today's Cisco? It's possible. If so, then it has a lot more upside before it crashes\u2014if it crashes,\u201d Yardeni wrote. Chart: Nvidia 2022-2024 vs. Cisco 1998-2000 According to Yardeni, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, having closely examined the tenure of his predecessors, including Paul Volcker, aims to quell inflation potentially without inducing a recession. This delicate balance has led to a market expectation of interest rate cuts, as the fight against inflation shows signs of victory.

And the possibility of asset bubbles forming is a concern that cannot be ignored. The staggering $6 trillion parked in money market mutual funds represents a vast pool of liquidity that could flood into stocks and bonds. This could potentially ignite a melt-up in the markets if interest rates are slashed, Yardeni says. If Powell and his team prematurely bask in the triumph of curbing price inflation without a recession, all while cutting interest rates, they may inadvertently stoke asset inflation. Such a scenario could inflate a bubble that, upon bursting, would likely precipitate a recession. Nvidia\u2019s fate in the coming months or years may well signal whether we are on the cusp of a groundbreaking epoch driven by growing productivity thanks to the AI revolution, or merely the reflection of a historical bubble. \u201cThe Fed's next big mistake could be inflating a speculative stock market bubble. Powell must know that. If so, then he should reiterate that he is in no rush to lower interest rates,\u201d Yardeni stated.
