    "text": "Subscriber Actions Staff Options Connect With Us With a recent market value over $1.4 trillion, Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) is one of the largest semiconductor companies around, specializing in graphic processing units (GPUs) used for gaming and cryptocurrency mining, among other things, as well as artificial intelligence (AI) technology. Its stock has boosted the wealth of many shareholders, averaging annual growth of more than 60% over the past decade. Nvidia\u2019s stock has often seemed overvalued, keeping many cautious investors away \u2013 while the stock kept rising. Recently, though, Nvidia shares, while not bargain-priced, have seemed close to reasonably valued, presenting an opportunity for risk-tolerant long-term investors. Despite its huge size, Nvidia is still growing briskly, with revenue up a whopping 206% year over year in its third quarter and net income up more than 1,250%. Such numbers are not likely to be the norm, though. Remember that stock performances are never guaranteed. Nvidia has rivals looking to take some of its market share, and its business is cyclical, rising or falling along with the economy. On top of that, the U.S. government has restricted chip exports to China and other countries, putting pressure on Nvidia. Still, the stock is worth considering, even if its torrid growth rate slows. (The Motley Fool owns shares of and has recommended Nvidia.) Q. What\u2019s the difference between swing trading and day trading? \u2013 M.T., Walnut Creek, California A. Both are short-term trading practices where folks aim to profit from changes, or swings, in a security\u2019s value over a short period. As you might guess, a day trader will buy, say, a certain stock and hold it for only a few minutes or hours, selling it by the end of the day. A swing trader is a little more patient, selling within a few weeks, at most. Both strategies will often employ \u201ctechnical analysis,\u201d which involves looking for promising patterns in graphs of stock prices without much regard for the underlying businesses. Swing traders may incorporate some \u201cfundamental analysis,\u201d too, assessing the financial health, competitive strengths, growth prospects and more of the companies whose stocks they\u2019re trading. In general, we strongly recommend favoring fundamental analysis and investing in stocks for years if not decades. Short-term trading can seem more like speculating or gambling than actual investing. The Securities and Exchange Commission has warned, \u201cDay trading is extremely risky and can result in substantial financial losses in a very short period of time.\u201d Q. What are some unusual or amusing ticker symbols? \u2013 K.B., Potomac, Maryland A. There are plenty! For example: Yum! Brands (YUM), the parent of KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut; National Beverage (FIZZ); Gibraltar Industries (ROCK); Petco Health and Wellness (WOOF); Molson Coors Beverage (TAP); Southwest Airlines (LUV); 3M (MMM); Harley-Davidson (HOG); Olympic Steel (ZEUS); Heineken (HEINY); Ferrari N.V. (RACE); and Viper Energy (VNOM). Before they were bought out, eyewear maker Oakley sported the symbol OO, mattress maker Sealy had ZZ and auction house Sotheby\u2019s had BID. My most regrettable investing move happened decades ago. I went to my broker and told him I wanted to buy stock in steelmaker Nucor in my IRA. The broker said he was expecting it to split. I bought 160 shares in October of 2004. When I looked closer at the stock, I saw that it had just split \u2013 weeks earlier. I was too late to have my shares split. My loss on 160 shares was $8,568. \u2013 L.W., Missouri The Fool responds: It seems that you might be misunderstanding how stock splits work \u2013 as many people do. The good news, though, is that you probably did not lose anything at all, because a stock split doesn\u2019t really alter the value of a stock holding. For example, imagine that you buy 160 shares of a stock for $100 each, spending $16,000. If the stock splits 2-for-1, you\u2019ll get two shares for each of your shares, and the stock price will be adjusted downward proportionately. So you\u2019ll have twice as many shares, each worth about half as much. If the split happened when the stock was still at $100, you\u2019d end up with 320 shares priced around $50 each, for a total value of about \u2026 $16,000. We hope you\u2019ve hung on to your shares, because Nucor\u2019s stock has risen more than 650% since you bought, averaging annual gains of 12% \u2013 and that\u2019s not even including its dividends.
