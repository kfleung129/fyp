    "text": "LIVE UPDATES | CONCLUDED Last Updated: Feb. 23, 2024 at 6:09 PM EST Updated 27 days ago By Adam Clark (Dreamstime) U.S. stock markets were set for a quiet opening on Friday after the previous day\u2019s strong rally. Attention is likely to continue to be on chip maker Nvidia and how far the rally driven by excitement over artificial-intelligence technology can go. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were up 70 points, or less than 0.2%. S&P 500 futures were up 0.1% while Nasdaq 100 futures were broadly flat. The S&P 500 set another record closing high on Thursday. After the Nvidia-inspired gains of the previous day, technology stocks will continue to be in focus as they dominate the rally so far this year. However, that could be partially offset by the reaction to the latest comments from Federal Reserve officials talking down the likelihood of near-term interest-rate cuts. \u201cEven though market breadth is still narrow, it's wider than it was last year, with more and more stocks this year outperforming the S&P 500. If the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates, that will likely help spark wider breadth in this market,\u201d wrote Greg Marcus, managing director of UBS Private Wealth Management, in a research note. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note stood at 4.347% early on Friday, ticking up from the previous day.
