    "text": "For the worlds of finance and tech, Nvidia is now widely viewed an historic pioneer whose time has come, a colossus bound to dominate the artificial intelligence revolution en route to lifting the productivity and profitability of businesses worldwide to new heights. That\u2019s the message underscored by the astounding liftoff that on February 22, following its big-time earnings beat, boosted its market cap in a single day by 16% or $270 billion, and by mid-morning on February 23, added another 2% to hike its valuation to over $2 trillion. Amidst the widespread drumbeat of praise, skeptical voices are few. But we\u2019ve heard many times before that the first mover in a change-the-world thrust forward will maintain its top position far into the future, only to witness the shooting stars get smothered by disruptors lured by the leader\u2019s rich profitability, and the industry\u2019s immense promise. So to get a perspective on the likelihood that Nvidia likely faces that fate, I asked two veterans who\u2019ve seen super-hot innovators rise and fall to provide their take to Fortune. I put the question first to an expert who spans the worlds of academic finance and capital markets. Rob Arnott is founder and chairman of Research Affiliates, a firm that oversees investment strategies for $139 billion in mutual funds and ETFs. Arnott, alongside RA\u2019s CEO Chris Brightman, personally manages Pimco\u2019s $13 billion All Asset Fund. He\u2019s the father of \u201cfundamental indexing,\u201d an approach that weights companies in a portfolio by sales, net worth and other metrics measuring their size in the economy rather than by market cap, so that investors aren\u2019t trapped into putting more and more of their savings into the most expensive stocks. Arnott, who also served as editor-in-chief of the Financial Analysts Journal, oversees a group of PhDs at RA who conduct groundbreaking research, and consults regularly with the top minds at universities and business schools on ideas to refine RA\u2019s playbook. In an email to Fortune, Arnott notes that the notion underpinning Nvidia\u2019s rise, that a single or even a couple of trailblazers that initially rule a new technology will maintain overwhelming leadership and deserve epic valuations, is another in a long series of \u201cbig market delusions.\u201d He says that today\u2019s situation mirrors the early days in everything from hand-held devices to personal computers to eCommerce to laying pipes for The Internet. The AI frenzy, he declares, recalls such crazes as \u201cthe dot.com bubble in 1999 and EVs in 2021.\u201d For Arnott, when apparent breakthroughs first appeared and attracted strong investor backing you could usually count on three things: \u201cFirst, an exciting new industry is taking shape. Second, it will show impressive growth in the years ahead and probably change the world. Third, at the start, there\u2019s a handful of companies dominating this exciting new landscape.\u201d So in most cases, the promise eventually paid off. But that doesn\u2019t mean those who led the way greatly profited over the years ahead. \u201cIt was usually not true that first, the new technology brought on change nearly as rapid as the markets predicted,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd second, it was often not true that these will be the dominant players 5 or 10 or even 20 years in the future.\u201d Most of all, he adds, it\u2019s wrong to think that \u201cWe can pay any price because these companies can achieve stupendous profits in due course. That\u2019s usually not true.\u201d Arnott describes the herd mentality that\u2019s so swelled Nvidia\u2019s stock price as \u201cthe classic nature of bubbles. Disruptors change the world in wonderful ways, but they cannot succeed unless their customers are succeeding even more than they are, and disruptors are often themselves disrupted.\u201d He points to Palm, dominant in handheld technology in 2000 losing out to BlackBerry in 2003, then BlackBerry losing to Apple\u2019s iPhone in 2008. Arnott\u2019s point is that competition eventually drives down a new industry\u2019s initially sterling profitability. The chief beneficiaries are the customers that bank big productivity gains from advances in software or online advertising algorithms, and the sectors\u2019 enduring champs are the players that keep innovating so that their products help customers work faster, better and cheaper.

In his view, the risk Nvidia will follow so many others that have fallen from glory is much too great to justify its current PE (now at nearly 70). \u201cNvidia\u2019s priced for perfection,\u201d he says. \u201cIts valuation leaves no room for shocks. Never short-sell bubble stocks when they\u2019re on a roll. But you don\u2019t have to own them, either.\u201d Jack Ciesielski, former author of the Analyst\u2019s Accounting Observer, has long been one of the most astute commentators on trends in the financial markets. And he agrees with Arnott that the same forces that hammered the early winners in other great leaps forward could well stymie Nvidia. \u201cRemember what happened in word processing and early PCs,\u201d he says. \u201cFirst, you had the likes of WordPerfect, Ami Pro and Lotus, along with Commodore, Radio Shack and Eagle. But they lost, and the prizes went to Apple and Microsoft. It was the same in the early days of The Internet. The companies that laid the cable such as UUNET and Lucent got big valuations, and are no longer with us. But those that thrived turned out to be the Amazons, Googles and companies that used the pipes.\u201d Ciesielski observes that, \u201cIt\u2019s not the first movers who usually win, it\u2019s the second movers\u201d who follow on with better strategies for winning customers and hatching the best new products. Plus, Nvidia is far from alone right now in minting AI software. Today, AMD and Intel are rolling out their own AI chips. As Arnott and Ciesielski both note, Nvidia\u2019s created a rage that all the software giants want ardently to join. Its takeoff is luring a herd of competitors set on winning their places as the princes or kings of AI. By attracting an onslaught, Nvidia\u2019s sorcerous success may be planting the seeds of its decline. \u00a9 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.
