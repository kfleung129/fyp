    "text": "The remarkable surge in NVIDIA Corp NVDA stock price is causing a widespread fear of missing out (FOMO) in the market, according to Evercore ISI\u2018s Julian Emanuel. This has led to concerns about a potential market correction. What Happened: Emanuel, the senior managing director at Evercore ISI, has observed a growing FOMO sentiment among his clients, particularly those who experienced the dot-com boom and bust. This is a cause for concern, as reported by CNBC on Monday. He pointed out that this is the first time such a sentiment has been observed since 2021, raising an \u201calarm bell.\u201d In a note to his clients, Emanuel highlighted parallels to the Y2K phenomenon, with the current excitement revolving around artificial intelligence and the belief that the U.S. will avoid a recession. \u201cThe sentiment is very, very bullish. The bears have been eliminated,\u201d Emanuel said, adding, \u201cIt's time to think more about risk than reward until we get just a little cooling off.\u201d Despite the market\u2019s record highs, Emanuel predicts a potential 13% pullback this year, which he considers normal during a non-recession period. He advises clients to consider their buying position at that point.

Why It Matters: Nvidia\u2019s stock has been on a meteoric rise, with a 46% increase so far this year and a 239% surge over the past year. This rally has sparked concerns about the stock\u2019s valuation, with some analysts suggesting a potential pause in its upward trajectory. Despite these concerns, Nvidia\u2019s AI capabilities have continued to attract investors, with the stock being considered attractively valued by some, given its growth potential. Moreover, analysts have predicted that Nvidia will lead a double-digit semiconductor stock rally in 2024, further fueling investor interest in the company. However, the stock\u2019s high price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio has sparked a debate on Reddit about its long-term investment potential. Despite this, Nvidia\u2019s CEO, Jensen Huang, has emphasized the importance of AI development and the company\u2019s efforts to make AI more accessible.
