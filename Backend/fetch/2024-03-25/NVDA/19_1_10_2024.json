    "text": "Nvidia Corp.\u2019s stock chart shows that, after the stock\u2019s continued surge into record territory, it is now technically the most overbought it has been in six months \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t mean the rally is over. In fact, some chart watchers believe the stock\u2019s recent breakout marks the beginning of the next leg of the uptrend, which could propel the stock above the $600 level. Katie Stockton, technical analyst at Fairlead Strategies, said the breakout was a \u201cbullish medium-term development,\u201d as it resolved a four-month trading range with a definitive up move. \u201cThe breakout resumes [Nvidia\u2019s] long-term uptrend for an initial projection of ~$602,\u201d Stockton wrote in a recent note to clients. The semiconductor and artificial-intelligence play\u2019s stock \n        NVDA,\n        +3.12%\n       rose 2.1% in afternoon trading Wednesday, toward a fifth straight gain and a third straight record close. It has soared 14% over the past five sessions, the best five-day performance since it went up 14.7% over the five-day stretch that ended on June 14. The rally comes as the company this week announced expanded partnerships with drug-discovery companies and said a number of China-based electric-vehicle makers have chosen Nvidia\u2019s centralized car computer to power their fleets. Read: Nvidia tops the list of Wall Street\u2019s 20 favorite stocks for 2024 On the stock\u2019s chart, the Relative Strength Index (RSI), a momentum indicator that compares the magnitude of recent gains with the magnitude of losses, has climbed 72.03, according to FactSet data. Many chart watchers believe RSI readings above 70 are a sign of overbought conditions. Nvidia\u2019s RSI is now at the highest reading since the stock reached 74.77 on July 18. In addition, the stock is trading 2.5% above the top line of the Bollinger Bands indicator ($529.39), which also suggests an overbought condition. The Bollinger Bands indicator consists of three lines that are overlaid with the price chart. The middle line is usually a 20-day moving average, and the top and bottom lines are two standard deviations away from the middle line. Read more about Bollinger Bands here. But keep in mind that while overbought indicators show that Nvidia\u2019s stock has rallied more than what history suggests would be normal, that doesn\u2019t mean the rally is over. Some observers even interpret some overbought signs as an ability rather than a condition, with the view that the ability to become overbought is a sign of underlying strength. And as DataTrek Research co-founder Jessica Rabe wrote, even though Nvidia\u2019s stock is at an all-time high, it has \u201cyet to reach statistically significant overbought levels.\u201d As the above RSI chart shows, some previous similarly high readings may have prompted brief pauses in the stock\u2019s rally, but they didn\u2019t derail the uptrend. The same holds for the last times the stock was as far above the top Bollinger Bands line as it is now. Rabe noted that momentum is a powerful tool. Basically, she said, she won\u2019t be tempted by an unusually big rally into overbought territory to bet on a pullback. \u201cWe stick by our cardinal rule to \u2018never short a new high,'\u201d she wrote. There\u2019s the potential for more beat-and-raise quarters, plus opportunity in sovereign AI, analysts say.
