This week, Tracey is joined by Neena Mishra, Zacks Director of ETF Research, to discuss how to get exposure to the Magnificent 7 stocks, either through ETFs or just by owning the individual stocks themselves. With the Mag 7 now making up 29% of the S&P 500 index, and many of the Mag 7 stocks hitting new highs, why not just own the Mag 7 stocks and call it a day? Neena has her favorite ETFs that will get you plenty of Mag 7 exposure, or you can buy individual stocks as well. 1. NVIDIA Corp. NVDA NVIDIA is one of the largest companies in the world with a market cap of $1.5 trillion. Shares of NVIDIA are hitting new all-time highs in 2024, gaining 212% in the last year. It\u2019s not cheap. NVIDIA trades with a forward P/E of 48 but it\u2019s expected to grow sales by 53% in fiscal 2025. Should you own NVIDIA in your portfolio? 2. Microsoft Corp. MSFT Microsoft is a $3 trillion market cap company, making it one of the largest companies in the world. Shares of Microsoft keep hitting new all-time highs in 2024 and are up 64.4% over the last year. Microsoft is trading with a forward P/E of just 35.8, which makes it look cheap compared to NVIDIA. However, sales are expected to rise just 14.4% in fiscal 2024, which is considerably less than the blockbuster growth expected of NVIDIA. Should you own Microsoft in your portfolio? Growth stocks other than the Magnificent 7 have been hitting new highs in recent months as well. You can own those stocks in Invesco\u2019s NASDAQ NextGen ETF, which tracks the 101 to 200th largest companies in the NASDAQ. Or you can own the individual components. 3. Super Micro Computer, Inc. SMCI Super Micro Computer is the third largest position in the Invesco NASDAQ NextGen ETF. It has a market cap of $26 billion. Shares of Super Micro Computer are up a whopping 520% over the last year. Yet Super Micro Computer is still trading with an attractive forward P/E of just 26.7. Sales are expected to jump 53% in fiscal 2024. Should a smaller tech company like Super Micro Computer be on your short list instead of the Mag 7? 4. Tractor Supply Co. TSCO Tractor Supply is also a top holding of the Invesco NASDAQ NextGen ETF. But it\u2019s not seeing the big returns of some of the technology names. Shares of Tractor Supply are up just 6% over the last year. It trades with a forward P/E of just 22 but earnings are expected to rise just 3.3% in 2024. Should investors consider growth stocks like Tractor Supply even if they\u2019re not in technology? 5. Ulta Beauty, Inc. ULTA Ulta Beauty has a market cap of $23.2 billion. It\u2019s also a top position in the Invesco NASDAQ NextGen ETF. Shares of Ulta Beauty are down 4.1% over the last year. It\u2019s the cheapest of these NextGen stocks with a forward P/E of 18.8. Earnings are expected to rise 6.4% in fiscal 2025. Should a retailer like Ulta Beauty be on your list of must-own growth stocks? Tune into this week\u2019s podcast to find out.
