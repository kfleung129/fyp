    "text": "Countdown to Luke Lango\u2019s \u201c2nd Trillion-Dollar A.I. Trade\u201d The U.S. govt just unlocked an $8 trillion market to move in a new direction. See how it could unleash 6,000% potential upside. Stock up on AVGO stock and collect those juicy dividends every three months Advertisement Source: Sasima / Shutterstock.com Go ahead \u2014 pick a reason, or two or three, to buy Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) stock. Maybe you\u2019re seeking portfolio exposure to artificial intelligence (AI) hardware. Or, perhaps you\u2019re a passive-income investor or just want to balance growth and value. By taking a share position in Broadcom, you can get all of the above with just one technology stock. Indeed, Broadcom is a company that ought to be mentioned more often in the financial press. Granted, Broadcom isn\u2019t part of the so-called \u201cMagnificent Seven,\u201d but it\u2019s a magnificent idea to start a position in AVGO stock before $1,000 is just a distant memory. While the press is busy talking about the massive gains in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock last year, they\u2019re overlooking a semiconductor-devices stock that also provided stellar returns. Specifically, AVGO stock rode the AI hardware wave in 2023 from $600 to $1,000. Despite this share-price growth, Broadcom isn\u2019t extremely overvalued. Notably, Broadcom\u2019s GAAP-measured trailing-12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is 32.1x. That\u2019s not too elevated when compared to Nvidia\u2019s trailing P/E ratio of 62.66x and the valuations of some other \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d companies. It\u2019s not only AVGO stock that\u2019s growing. Broadcom\u2019s financials are also growing, with the company\u2019s fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 net revenue increasing 4% year over year. Plus, for all of fiscal year 2023, Broadcaom\u2019s revenue grew 8% year over year to a company record\u00a0of $35.8 billion. Broadcom CEO Hock Tan attributed this and other positive quarterly results to \u201cinvestments in accelerators and network connectivity for AI by hyperscalers.\u201d On top of all that, Broadcom offers a forward annual dividend yield of 1.76%. That\u2019s an added bonus \u2014 and by the way, some \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d companies don\u2019t offer any dividends at all. Like I said earlier, Broadcom doesn\u2019t receive a lot of coverage in the financial media. So, I was glad to see a strategist, Laffer Tengler Investments CEO Nancy Tengler, discussing Broadcom recently. Yet, I was shocked to hear Tengler call Broadcom the \u201cpoor man\u2019s Nvidia.\u201d Tengler also acknowledged that Broadcom is a \u201cleader in AI.\u201d Still, I must object to the idea that Broadcom is just a lesser version of Nvidia. Broadcom is a disruptor and innovator in its own right. For instance, Broadcom is collaborating with Caltech, a world-renowned institute of technology and science. Together, Broadcom and Caltech will work to advance research in quantum science. In addition, Broadcom supplies components for the likes of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet\u2019s (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google. So, it\u2019s not really fair to characterize Broadcom as a \u201cpoor man\u2019s\u201d version of another company. Broadcom stock will, sooner or later, trade at much more than $1,000. Remember, this is a world-class company that will ride the AI hardware wave higher, just like Nvidia has done. It\u2019s also a nice bonus that Broadcom pays a dividend and isn\u2019t extremely overvalued. In the final analysis, investors should take a close look at AVGO stock and seriously consider a buy-and-hold position today.
