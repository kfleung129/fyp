    "text": "MORE New York: Chip-maker Nvidia\u2019s market capitalisation (mcap) rose to $1.83 trillion on Wednesday, nudging past Alphabet\u2019s $1.82 trillion market cap, a media report said. Santa Clara-based chipmaker\u2019s shares rose 2.5 per cent to $739, while Alphabet shares ended the session at $145.94, CNN reported. Earlier this week, Nvidia surpassed Amazon, closing with a higher market cap on Tuesday for the first time since 2002. Nvidia shares have been on a tear since 2023, when investors swept up in AI hype bought up shares of Big Tech stocks, spurring a bull market against a backdrop of sky-high interest rates and leading the S&P 500 index to jump 24 per cent last year. Nvidia has been the biggest beneficiary of the AI mania dominating Wall Street. \u00a9 Copyright 2024 | Powered by Hocalwire \u00a9 Copyright 2022 | Powered by Hocalwire "
