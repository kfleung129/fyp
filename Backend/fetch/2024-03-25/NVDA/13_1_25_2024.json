    "text": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has captivated the world \u2014 but also spurred fears of industry capture. After all, while AI has the potential to make information, tools and resources more accessible to a wider range of people, in order to effectively democratize access to information, access to AI systems themselves needs to be democratized. And while AI in the United States is advancing rapidly, opportunities to pursue cutting-edge AI research and new AI applications are often inaccessible to researchers. The National Science Foundation (NSF) on Wednesday (Jan. 24) announced an ambitious federal program designed to increase access to AI resources, including tools, data and computing infrastructure, beyond just the world\u2019s most valuable tech businesses. The pilot program, called the\u00a0National Artificial Intelligence Research Resource\u00a0(NAIRR), comes after the White House\u2019s\u00a0executive order\u00a0mandating that barriers to entry to AI infrastructure be lowered. \u201cBy creating an equitable cyberinfrastructure for cutting-edge AI that builds on-ramps for participation for a wide range of researchers and communities, the NAIRR could build AI capacity across the nation and support responsible AI research and development, thereby driving innovation and ensuring long-term U.S. competitiveness in this critical technology area,\u201d\u00a0said\u00a0NSF Director Sethuraman Panchanathan. Of course, the world\u2019s most valuable tech businesses will be participating in the program themselves, with Google, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Meta, Microsoft, NVIDIA, Intel, IBM, OpenAI and Anthropic, among others, providing resources, funding and tools alongside 11 federal agencies. \u201cThe NAIRR is a vision of a national research infrastructure that will provide access to computing, data, models and software to empower researchers and communities,\u201d\u00a0said\u00a0Katie Antypas, director of the Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure at the NSF. \u201cSmaller institutions, rural institutions, institutions serving underrepresented populations are key communities we\u2019re trying to reach with the NAIRR. These communities are less likely to have resources to build their own computing or data resources,\u201d Antypas added. \u201cAI is increasingly defining our era, and its potential can best be fulfilled with broad access to its transformative capabilities,\u201d said NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang in\u00a0statement. The NAIRR pilot will run for two years, until 2026.

Contributions range from access to, and use of, the DOE\u2019s Summit supercomputer, to datasets from NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, to access to foundational AI models from OpenAI, Anthropic and Meta, and tens of millions in credits to cloud and infrastructure platforms and resources from Microsoft, NVIDIA and others. Shaunt Sarkissian, founder and CEO at\u00a0AI-ID, told PYMNTS in June that industry players should approach\u00a0lawmakers\u00a0with the attitude of, \u201cWe know this is new, we know it\u2019s a little bit spooky, let\u2019s work together.\u201d Read also:\u00a0Who Will Power the GenAI Operating System? The launch of the NAIRR pilot on Wednesday meets a goal outlined in the White House\u2019s October 2023 executive order directing the NSF to launch a pilot for the NAIRR within 90 days. The pilot will focus on four areas, NAIRR Open, NAIRR Secure, NAIRR Software, and NAIRR Classroom. NAIRR Open, led by the NSF, will support open AI research by providing access to diverse AI resources; while NAIRR Secure, which will be co-led by the NIH and DOE, will support AI research requiring privacy and security-preserving resources as well as assemble \u201cexemplar\u201d privacy-preserving resources, per the NAIRR site. NAIRR Software, another focus area led by the NSF, will facilitate and investigate interoperable use of AI software, platforms, tools and services for NAIRR pilot resources; while NAIRR Classroom will reach new communities through education, training, user support and outreach. PYMNTS\u00a0reported\u00a0earlier this week (Jan. 23) about how colleges and universities are increasingly weaving AI into their lesson plans.  We\u2019re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors. "
