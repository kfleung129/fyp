Nvidia has been a top beneficiary of technology companies\u2019 race to build AI into their products and services, and the latest gain in its stock comes a day after it ended a session with a market capitalization above Amazon\u2019s for the first time in two decades.\nNvidia controls about 80% of the high-end AI chip market, a position that has sent its stock up 47% this year after more than tripling in 2023. Customers face shortages of Nvidia\u2019s top-of-the line components while AI developers face months-long waiting lists to use its processors through cloud-computing providers.\nTechnology-related companies, including Microsoft and Meta Platforms, have also rallied to record highs on AI optimism.\nNvidia\u2019s quarterly report next Wednesday will be one of Wall Street\u2019s most closely watched events of the week. Analysts expect another blowout quarter and outlook, and anything less could deflate Wall Street\u2019s AI rally, some investor warn.\n\u201cThe market recognizes Nvidia as the AI king.

State oil giant Saudi Aramco is the world\u2019s third most valuable publicly-listed company, according to LSEG.\nAnalysts, on average, see Nvidia\u2019s January fiscal quarter revenue more than tripling to $20.37 billion, fueled by demand for its top-shelf AI chips, according to LSEG data. Analysts see its adjusted net profit surging over 400% to $11.38 billion.\nNvidia is trading at around 34 times expected earnings, up from about 24 in early January, and down from over 50 a year ago, according to LSEG.\n (Reporting by Noel Randewich in Oakland, Calif., and by Medha Singh in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur and Nick Zieminski)\nDisclaimer: This report is auto generated from the Reuters news service.
