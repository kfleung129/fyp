    "text": "SENSEX SENSEX  In a monumental stride for the tech industry, Nvidia, the California-based chip giant, has ascended to the prestigious club of USD 2 trillion market capitalization last week, marking a watershed moment in its trajectory. With this feat, Nvidia not only solidifies its position as a trailblazer in the chipmaking realm but also etches its name in the annals of financial history alongside titans like Apple and Microsoft, as one of the select few US companies to breach this remarkable threshold. This meteoric rise to glory can be attributed to Nvidia's unwavering dominance in the burgeoning AI chip market, where its cutting-edge technologies continue to redefine the boundaries of possibility. The company's market cap soared from USD 1 trillion less than a year ago to a staggering USD 2 trillion, leaving behemoths like Amazon and Alphabet trailing in its wake.
