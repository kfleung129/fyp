    "text": "The Financial Express The market capitalisation of Reliance Industries (RIL) at the end of Friday\u2019s trading was Rs 20.2 trillion. That\u2019s humongous, considering that the gap with the second-largest Indian company \u2014 Tata Consultancy Services\u00a0 \u2014 is over Rs 5.5 trillion. But RIL\u2019s total m-cap was less than what Nvidia\u2019s shares gained in just one day. The heavyweight chipmaker added $277 billion (Rs 22 trillion) in stock market value on Thursday, after the company\u2019s quarterly report beat expectations and reignited a rally fuelled by optimism about artificial intelligence. In dollar terms, RIL\u2019s m-cap is less than $250 billion. The one-day increase in the stock market value of Nvidia, which controls about 80% of the high-end AI chip market, was also the largest in Wall Street\u2019s history, easily beating a record $196 billion gain by Meta Platforms on February 2 after the Facebook parent declared its first dividend and posted robust results. Thursday\u2019s dizzying rise of the stock catapulted Nvidia\u2019s chief executive officer Jensen Huang to the 21st position on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. His wealth jumped $9.6 billion to $69.2 billion. As recently as early last year, he was\u00a0 ranked 128th with a net worth of $13.5 billion. The rise in Nvidia\u2019s market value on Thursday eclipsed the entire value of Coca-Cola, at $265 billion. Its gain made Nvidia the US stock market\u2019s third-most valuable company, pulling ahead of Amazon and Alphabet after jockeying with the two tech powerhouses in recent weeks. Microsoft and Apple, valued at $3.06 trillion and $2.85 trillion, respectively, are Wall Street\u2019s two most valuable companies. Nvidia reported a Q4 revenue jump of more than threefold from a year ago to $22.10 billion and beat all expectations. At least 17 brokerages raised their price targets after the results. Among the most bullish, Rosenblatt Securities raised its price target to $1,400 from $1,100, implying a $3.5 trillion stock market value, Reuters reported. Nvidia\u2019s stock has now climbed 58% in 2024, accounting for more than a quarter of the S&P 500\u2019s increase year-to-date. That makes Nvidia\u2019s outlook crucial not just for direct shareholders, but for owners of index funds widely held in retirement savings accounts.
