    "text": "Stock Analysis NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) has had a great run on the share market with its stock up by a significant 49% over the last three months.   Given the company's impressive performance, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely as a company's financial health over the long-term usually dictates market outcomes.      Specifically, we decided to study NVIDIA's  ROE in this article. ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders.  In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. View our latest analysis for NVIDIA The formula for ROE is: Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity So, based on the above formula, the ROE for NVIDIA is: 57% = US$19b \u00f7 US$33b (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2023). The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months.  Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.57 in profit. Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits.  We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or \"retains\" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company.  Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don\u2019t share these attributes. First thing first, we like that NVIDIA has an impressive ROE.   Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 14% also doesn't go unnoticed by us.   Under the circumstances, NVIDIA's considerable five year net income growth of 28% was to be expected. As a next step, we compared NVIDIA's net income growth with the industry and found that the company has a similar growth figure when compared with the industry average growth rate of 27% in the same period. The basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth.  The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in.   This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future.    Is NVIDIA fairly valued compared to other companies? These 3 valuation measures might help you decide. NVIDIA has a really low three-year median payout ratio of 5.4%, meaning that it has the remaining 95% left over to reinvest into its business.  So it seems like the management is reinvesting profits heavily to grow its business and this reflects in its earnings growth number. Additionally, NVIDIA has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders.      Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to drop to 0.6% over the next three years.   The fact that the company's ROE is expected to rise to 77% over the same period is explained by the drop in the payout ratio. In total, we are pretty happy with NVIDIA's performance.      Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth.       On studying current analyst estimates, we found that analysts expect the company to continue its recent growth streak.
