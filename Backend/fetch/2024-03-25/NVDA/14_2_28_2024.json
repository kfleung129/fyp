    "text": "Justin Sullivan/Getty Images News Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is continuing to gain traction in the data center space, as more than 85% of its total sales are projected to come from the space, compared to roughly 25% five years ago, Bank of America said. GPU silicon units sold during the fourth quarter 2023 breached 900,000, more than double the number sold in the same quarter in 2022. Nvidia accounted for 95% of the market share, Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya said. The Hopper, H100/HGX platform accounted for the bulk of Nvidia's data center revenue. Meanwhile, AMD (AMD) is also experiencing a data center GPU revenue surge of its own. AMD's GPU silicon unit sales more than tripled quarter over quarter, Arya said. Arya reiterated his Buy ratings on Nvidia and AMD, as he projects more growth in the nearly $90B accelerator market. Nvidia and AMD both slipped about 1% during premarket trading Wednesday. While gaming-related sales for both companies look to cool during the first-quarter, Arya is expecting a turnaround later in the year. This could extend into calendar year 2026 based on the three-year upcycles witnessed in the past, Arya said. Seeking Alpha analysts rate Nvidia a HOLD, while Wall Street analysts maintain a STRONG BUY rating. Seeking Alpha's quant system, which regularly beats the market, rates it a HOLD. AMD has a HOLD rating from Seeking Alpha analysts, but a BUY rating from Wall Street analysts. Seeking Alpha's quant system rates it a HOLD. "
