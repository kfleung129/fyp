NVIDIA\u2019S shares scaled a new peak on Monday (Feb 5) after Goldman Sachs raised its price target for the high-flying chipmaker\u2019s stock in anticipation of a major boost to its earnings from the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. The stock rose about 4 per cent to US$689.21 and looked set to add about US$70 billion to the company\u2019s market capitalisation. Nvidia was valued at US$1.63 trillion as of Friday\u2019s close. Nvidia has emerged as a poster child of the AI frenzy and saw a record monthly jump in its market value in January. The searing growth in the stock price \u2013 already up about 39 per cent so far this year \u2013 has made it more expensive to own relative to its peers. Nvidia\u2019s shares trade at 31.4 times the company\u2019s forward earnings estimate, compared with the industry average of 22.9. Still, Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari sees more room for growth. \u201cWe believe Nvidia will remain as the industry gold standard for the foreseeable future, given its robust hardware and software offerings and, importantly, the pace at which it continues to innovate,\u201d Hari said. The hottest news on all things startup and tech to kickstart your week. Goldman Sachs analysts raised their price target for Nvidia to US$800, the third highest among US analysts covering the stock and indicating a 21 per cent upside from current levels, according to LSEG data. Its previous price target was US$625. The bank also lifted its full-year 2025/2026 earnings estimates for Nvidia by 22 per cent on an average, citing signs of robust AI server demand and improving graphics processing unit (GPU) supply. Hari pointed to signs of AI monetisation from companies including Microsoft and Meta Platforms as well as positive earnings outlook from AI server maker Super Micro Computer. While Nvidia has unlocked billions in revenue on the back of the AI frenzy, other chipmakers that are not so deeply involved in making chips for AI, such as Intel, have seen their shares lag. Nvidia is set to report results on Feb 21, with analysts expecting fourth-quarter earnings per share of US$4.51 and revenue of US$20.19 billion, according to LSEG data. REUTERS BT is now on Telegram!
