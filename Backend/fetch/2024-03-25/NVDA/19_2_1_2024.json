    "text": "The AI story has driven incredible growth in companies such as\u00a0NVIDIA Corp NVDA and Microsoft Corp MSFT, but analyst Marc Chaikin of Chaikin Analytics shared an outside-the-box way to play the increase in demand for AI. Chaikin told Benzinga\u2019s PreMarket Prep that he liked\u00a0IT technology stocks, as consulting firms will help companies transition into using more AI in their operations. The Stocks:\u00a0Chaikin mentioned a few different IT stocks that could see growth from AI. The names include IBM IBM and Accenture plc\u00a0ACN. \u201cI think the play in AI in addition to chips\u2026 are IT service companies. They\u2019re just indicative of who\u2019s going to benefit now \u2026 These are two stocks I really like on weakness. The reason is consulting companies are going to get a big chunk of business because of AI.\u201d Chaikin also mentioned Gartner Inc IT, another stock in the IT space. If more companies hire consulting firms to help them implement more AI, chances are these IT names will also see a bump in demand and sales, Chaikin argues.

But the gains are more subdued than chip names like Nvidia, which is up\u00a0200% in the past year. The IT stocks, on the other hand, are up about 30% in the past year, underperforming the Invesco QQQ Trust QQQ in the same time frame. Watch the full interview with Marc Chaikin here.
