With 67% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn). And as as result, institutional investors reaped the most rewards after the company's stock price gained 5.9% last week. The gains from last week would have further boosted the one-year return to shareholders which currently stand at 214%. In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of NVIDIA. Check out our latest analysis for NVIDIA Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing. As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in NVIDIA. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at NVIDIA's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters. Institutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. NVIDIA is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 8.2% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 7.3% of common stock, and FMR LLC holds about 5.0% of the company stock. In addition, we found that Jen-Hsun Huang, the CEO has 3.5% of the shares allocated to their name. Our studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.

Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily. The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.

However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.
