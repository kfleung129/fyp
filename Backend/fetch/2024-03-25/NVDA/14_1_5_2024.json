The AI research assistant allows users to narrow the search domain and tailor search queries with custom follow-up questions. \u201cIt removes the burden of prompt engineering and does not require users to ask perfectly phrased questions to get the answers they seek. This enables users to gain more relevant and comprehensive answers than other AI chatbots, traditional search engines, or research tools,\u201d Srinivas stated in a blog released with the funding announcement. Srinivas has claimed that since the launch of Perplexity, the AI search engine app has grown within the past one year to 10 million monthly active users and resolved more than a half-billion queries in 2023. The company app was also installed more than a million times during this period across iOS and Android.
