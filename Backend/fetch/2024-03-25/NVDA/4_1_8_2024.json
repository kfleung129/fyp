Chinese tech companies refused to settle for run-of-the-mill chips, forcing US chipmaker Nvidia to play at being average for once. What does this mean? The US is determined to be the first country to make next-level artificial intelligence systems, so it\u2019s banned semiconductor companies from selling their smartest chips to China. That\u2019s been a non-stop blow for Nvidia: big-money Chinese customers Alibaba and Tencent aren\u2019t willing to accept second-best wares, slashing their orders for this year. So while Chinese cloud companies currently source around 80% of their high-end chips from Nvidia, experts predict that a prolonged ban could bring that number closer to 50% over the next five years. Why should I care? For markets: Shop local. Nvidia\u2019s smartest chips are a cut above the rest, but the type it\u2019s allowed to export to China aren\u2019t much better than local alternatives. That means Chinese tech companies might as well get their fix from domestic firms like Huawei, especially if that extra funding means they can make smarter chips faster. Layer on the prospect of increasingly fraught relationships between major economies, and the Chinese market could be Nvidia\u2019s one that got away. The bigger picture: Hail Mary. Despite the US\u2019s best efforts, China is plowing ahead with plans to dominate the artificial intelligence market. The country\u2019s dedicated data agency has carved out a three-year plan that should see the faltering economy benefit from cutting-edge smarts. The outline depends on China successfully developing large-language models \u2013 the type of tech behind ChatGPT \u2013\u00a0to stay on track, although that could take longer to materialize than the stumbling country would like. ai alibaba geopolitics nvidia semiconductors tencent stocks china us airlines alaska airlines ai alphabet Disclaimer: These articles are provided for information purposes only.
