    "text": "Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images UBS has raised its estimates and price target on Nvidia's (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares to $850 ahead of the chipmaker's fourth quarter results on Feb. 21. The analysts said that customer discussions confirm that Nvidia's lead times have come in substantially over the past few months (now about three to four months), meaning shipment slots are still available in the second half of 2024. The analysts added that normally, this is bad, but demand for AI compute capacity is still so strong, in the near term, they think this points to significant upside potential to shipments/revenue, such that they believe Nvidia beats on data center by about $2.5B to $3B (Fourth quarter UBS' estimate of Data Center revenue of $19.5B versus Street $16.8B, and total revenue about $23B versus Street around $20.2B). Given supply chain work, the analysts see enough capacity for Nvidia (NVDA) to guide $25B to $26B on total revenue. On Monday, Nvidia (NVDA) briefly overtook Amazon's (AMZN) market cap to become the fourth most valuable U.S. company. Nvidia (NVDA) has a Hold rating at Seeking Alpha's Quant Rating system, which consistently beats the market. The Seeking Alpha authors' average rating is also Hold, but the average Wall Street analysts' rating is more positive with a Strong Buy. "
