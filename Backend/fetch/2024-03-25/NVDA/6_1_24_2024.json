    "text": "A startup that has developed an automated platform to test AI models has just secured $4.7 million in fresh funding. San Francisco-based RagaAI, which has come out of stealth mode, was launched by Gaurav Agarwal, an ex-Nvidia staffer who has also previously worked at Indian mobility firm Ola. RagaAI has developed a way to gauge the safety and reliability of AI models, and diagnose any issues instantly. Its platform screens AI issues across large language models (LLMs), videos, and audio to structured data. The aim is to automate the detection of any problems and immediately flag them to users. \"At Ola and Nvidia, I saw the significant consequences of AI failures due to lack of comprehensive testing,\" Agarwal said. \"Our vision is to liberate AI from the constraints of human interventions, and foster continuous improvement.\" The startup works with a range of clients across sectors such as e-commerce to the auto industry. An example use case included a product team using Raga's tool to identify hallucinations in its chatbot. RagaAI makes its money by charging clients for recurring subscriptions. The round was led by early-stage venture capital firm Pi Ventures, with additional participation from Anorak Ventures, TenOneTen Ventures, Arka Ventures, and Mana Ventures. With the fresh funding, the team will focus on expanding its engineering, data, and product headcount, invest more into its research and development, and set up shop in the EU, said Agarwal.
