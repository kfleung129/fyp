This ambitious initiative is set to transform Telenor\u2019s business model, embedding AI into its network operations and creating AI-driven solutions for its customer base. The collaboration is backed by a substantial investment, with Telenor committing close to 100 million kroner (approximately US$10 million) in the first year for Nvidia\u2019s advanced technology. This financial pledge underlines Telenor\u2019s commitment to the partnership, hinting at a long-term collaboration aimed at harnessing AI\u2019s potential across various aspects of its business. By leveraging Nvidia\u2019s state-of-the-art hardware and AI software, Telenor aims to pioneer a range of AI applications. This strategic move not only strengthens its position as a technology-forward telecom operator but also promises to enhance network performance through innovative solutions. The partnership specifically focuses on the development of software-defined, high-performance network solutions, utilizing Nvidia\u2019s Aerial SDK to combine 5G RAN and AI technologies on a unified platform. Amol Phadke, EVP and GCTO at Telenor Group, emphasized the collaboration\u2019s role in driving customer-centric innovations, operational efficiency, and the growth of the Nordic AI ecosystem. The initiative includes ambitious plans for a green AI center in Norway, aiming for minimal environmental impact while fostering AI research and development. This center is expected to serve as a hub for AI innovation, offering infrastructure to businesses and academia and promoting sustainable and responsible AI practices. Telenor\u2019s vision of becoming an AI-first company aligns with broader industry trends towards embracing generative AI for operational efficiency and sustainability. This partnership with Nvidia, alongside a previous agreement with Ericsson focusing on energy management and ethical AI, positions Telenor at the forefront of leveraging AI for transformative change in the telecom sector.
