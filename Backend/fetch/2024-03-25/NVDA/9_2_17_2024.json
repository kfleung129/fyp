    "text": "NEW YORK (Feb 17): Next\u00a0week\u2019s earnings report from chipmaker Nvidia could prove a gut check for one of the market\u2019s hottest names, and for the artificial intelligence (AI) fever that has\u00a0helped power\u00a0gains for US\u00a0stocks in recent months. Excitement over the business potential of AI has boosted Nvidia\u00a0shares by more than 46% since Jan\u00a01.\u00a0Its US$570 billion (RM2.72 trillion) increase in market capitalisation is more than triple the market value of Intel. Shares in Nvidia, whose chips are considered the gold standard in the AI industry, surged nearly 240% in 2023. The chipmaker's gains have accounted for more than a quarter of the S&P 500's increase this year. The benchmark index is up nearly 5% year-to-date, after optimism about AI helped drive the index up 24%\u00a0in 2023. Now the third\u00a0most valuable\u00a0company on\u00a0Wall\u00a0Street\u00a0after Apple\u00a0and Microsoft, Nvidia has also become a bellwether of the AI industry. Other AI-focused stocks have surged this year, including\u00a0Super Micro Computer Inc, which is up 182%\u00a0year-to-date, and Arm Holdings, up nearly 71%. \"When people say that the market is doing well this year, they really mean that tech is doing well, and Nvidia is at the core of that,\" said Keith Lerner, the chief market strategist of Truist Advisory Services. \"There is excitement within AI, and if that optimism is not fulfilled by earnings, then you could see that reverberate quickly and weigh on sentiment.\" Nvidia will release quarterly earnings results on Feb\u00a021.\u00a0Wall\u00a0Street\u00a0expects\u00a0earnings of US$4.56 a share, and a rise in quarterly revenue to US$20.378 billion from US$6.05 billion a year ago, according to the mean estimate from 33 analysts, based on LSEG data. Given the company's size and its importance to the AI story, Nvidia\u2019s results could be pivotal for market sentiment, said Kevin Landis, a portfolio manager at Firsthand Capital. \"Every time you get a big stock market rally, there\u2019s a favourite stock that leads it,\" said Landis, who regrets selling his shares in Nvidia\u00a0last year. \"It's hard not to look at Nvidia and see...that's driving the psychology of the overall market.\" Not surprisingly, traders are bracing for big moves in the company\u2019s shares.\u00a0Nvidia options\u00a0are pricing a swing of about 11% in either direction following its results, according to data from options analytics service ORATS. That's the largest expected move options traders have priced\u00a0ahead\u00a0of Nvidia's earnings over the last three years, and well above the stock's average earnings move of 6.7% over that period, ORATS data showed. Tom Hainlin, a senior investment strategist at US\u00a0Bank Wealth Management, said positive updates to Nvidia's corporate outlook\u00a0could\u00a0fuel\u00a0more\u00a0AI optimism and extend a market rally that has been\u00a0concentrated\u00a0in the so-called Magnificent Seven group of megacap stocks, of which Nvidia is a member. Shares in Meta Platforms, another member of the group,\u00a0have surged\u00a034% this year, while Apple\u2019s have fallen by 5%. Shares in Tesla have\u00a0tumbled\u00a0nearly 20% after the electric car maker warned\u00a0of \"notably lower\" sales growth this year and shrinking margins. \"Right now, investors are rewarding visibility into earnings growth, and that keys up well for more gains for Nvidia,\" Hainlin said. On the other hand, investors may use a less-than-stellar report as an opportunity to take profits. Ryuta Makino, a research analyst at Gabelli Funds, believes investor enthusiasm for Nvidia is so high that its shares could fall by at least 10% if the company\u00a0simply meets\u00a0expectations, without exceeding them. He remains bullish on Nvidia due to rising capital expenditures from customers such as Amazon.com and Microsoft into their cloud businesses, which rely on the company\u2019s chips. A disappointing report from Nvidia could also exacerbate concerns over crowding in the market\u2019s largest stocks, said Michael Purves, the head of Tallbacken Capital Advisors. Overall, investors have their highest allocation to the tech sector since August 2020,\u00a0according to fund managers in the latest survey\u00a0conducted by BofA Global Research. \"This is the pillar of the growth for the index today, but at some point, the gas tank will go empty,\" Purves said.
