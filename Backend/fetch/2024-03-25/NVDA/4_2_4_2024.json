    "text": "The artificial intelligence (AI) craze of 2023 fomented a surge in many semiconductor stocks, even those not directly contributing to the rise of generative AI models. In 2024, I believe there will be a continued focus on chipmakers who can take advantage of this burgeoning market. Wall Street, of course, prefers some semiconductor stocks over others. Below are three semiconductor stocks with Strong Buy ratings.

The GPU maker\u2019s shares have risen 28% since the start of trading in January. The company, as many already know, has been riding high on the booming demand for its AI solutions. Nvidia dominates in both gaming GPUs and AI chips. Nvidia had an 81% market share of AI chips used in cloud and data centers. Moreover, despite a lack of access to China\u2019s huge market, Nvidia has turned to another growing economy: India. Recently, Nvidia announced a $1 billion deal to provide India-based companies with its AI chips. Some of these Indian companies include staple conglomerates like Tata Group and Reliance Industries, both of which are focusing on large language models and cloud infrastructure.

The fabless chipmaker initially made a name for itself after it dethroned Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) in the CPU market. AMD is now poised to challenge and siphon market share away from Nvidia, its prime competitor in the GPU chip market. In the second half of 2023, the chipmaker announced it expected to sell $2 billion in AI chips in 2024. As a follow-up, AMD unveiled the Instinct MI300X accelerator and the Instinct M1300A accelerated processing unit (APU) in December, which will work to train LLMs. AMD also released the specs for its new Ryzen gaming GPU and announced the Ryzen AI Software Platform, allowing developers to train AI models on Ryzen-powered laptops. As AMD gets ready to enter the AI market, investors should get excited at the number of prospects for the company.

What makes ACM Research unique is its focus on the China semiconductor market. While some may see this as a weakness, investors should recognize that China\u2019s semiconductor space has come a long way and has even surprised U.S. policymakers with its resilience. It turns out that attempting to make the playing field lopsided only made China\u2019s domestic industry more competitive. Companies supplying manufacturing machinery to this burgeoning semiconductor sector could benefit tremendously in the long run. ACM Research\u2019s earnings results throughout 2023 were admittedly impressive and beat Wall Street\u2019s estimates. As a result, ACM\u2019s share price skyrocketed more than 153% in 2023. In the current calendar year, its stock price has begun to trend downward, but I think investors should view this as a potential buying opportunity, as ACMR\u2019s valuation still looks cheap. Analysts expect China\u2019s government to roll out more stimulus measures, which would have a positive effect on both its economy and the global economy at large. Companies like ACMR will benefit as the world\u2019s second-largest economy recovers.
