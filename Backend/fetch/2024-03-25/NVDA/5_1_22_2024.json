    "text": "The trading activities of U.S. Representative Nancy Pelosi are closely monitored within Congress. On December 20, the California Democrat engaged in stock and options trading while in office, focusing on the prominent artificial intelligence (AI) and semiconductor company NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA). This acquisition involved procuring 50 call options for Nvidia, featuring a strike price of $120. The recorded transaction value falls from $1 million to $5 million. These call options expire on December 20, 2024, as revealed in a filling provided in an X post by stock trading tracker congresstrading.com on December 22. Pelosi bet millions on $NVDA in November using call options. Using a deceptive tactic, she purposely disclosed this on the Friday before Christmas weekend to avoid media coverage. pic.twitter.com/HR3KvynbPI A call option constitutes an agreement between a buyer and a seller, enabling the buyer to acquire a specified stock at a predetermined price until a specified expiration date. The recent stock performance by NVDA has been impressive in recent months, especially in the recent period, and exactly a month since the acquisition by Pelosi, NVDA stock has risen by more than 21% in value. To be more precise, the California Democrat has made nearly $500,000 in this period, which is more than double her government annual salary, which is around $223,500, as of the time of writing. And if the recent performance is a sign of what will come, this bet might be a real performer for the former Speaker of the House of Representatives. At the time of press, NVDA stock was trading at $594.91, after a 4.17% increase since the previous closure and a gain of 8.96% in the last five trading sessions. Since the start of 2024, this stock has added 23.51% to its value. As for the technical indicators, they award this stock with the highest rating of \u2018strong buy\u2019 at 17. With moving averages concurring at \u2018strong buy\u2019 as well at 14. Oscillators recommend a \u2018buy\u2019 at 3. With insider trading being a hot topic, especially in U.S. politics, it is no wonder this kind of trade attracts such attention. It makes investors wonder what information politicians have that ordinary people don\u2019t.
