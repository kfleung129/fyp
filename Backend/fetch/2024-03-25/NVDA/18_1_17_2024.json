Super stock is now live It\u2019s D-Day for the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Super, and the revamped graphics card is now available at various retailers. First unveiled at CES 2024, the mid-range contender is the first of three souped-up cards slated to arrive on the scene this month, but you\u2019ll need to be quick on your feet if you want to grab the Founder\u2019s Edition GPU. In many ways, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Super is arguably the best graphics card contender that should have arrived back in 2023. Instead, its dialled back sibling, the original GeForce RTX 4070, showed up with 20% fewer cores, meaning it wasn\u2019t quite an RTX 3090 replacement. Now that the new beefier card is available and armed with 7,168 CUDA cores, more gaming PC owners may finally take the plunge and upgrade their rigs, resulting in a high demand scenario that may catch laid back players off guard. At the moment, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Super Founder\u2019s Edition is still available direct from the GPU giant. However, upon adding one to my basket, I was placed in a queue of over 600 people, which suggests the card is already pretty sought after. It\u2019s worth noting that custom variants, including stock cards priced at $599, are readily available at Newegg, so we\u2019re not talking about a complete wipe out like a few years ago. Still, the FE model isn\u2019t grab and go right now, and Nvidia caveats that \u201cbeing in the queue does not guarantee a purchase\u201d when it comes to its own RTX 4070.  Nvidia\nThe $599 RTX 4070 Super Founder's Edition is still available direct from Nvidia, but you will need to wait in a queue to get one. Waiting times seem to top out at five minutes, but that could change depending on how demand pans out. Newegg\nThere's a variety of RTX 4070 Super models ready to ship at Newegg right now starting at $599, ranging from the stock Zotac Twin Edge model to a rather pricey Asus TUF \u00a0overclocked card. Best Buy\nRTX 4070 Super stock hasn't quite landed at the big box store, but we suspect it'll become available to buy soon. Nvidia\nUnlike the US, the UK Nvidia store is fresh out of RTX 4070 Super cards right now, but checking back for stock is worthwhile. Currys\nA small selection of RTX 4070 Super models are currently available at Currys, including a \u00a3599 custom card by Gigabyte. Overclockers UK\nYou'll find a hearty selection of custom RTX 4070 Super cards at Overclcokers UK right now, but the \u00a3599 models are apparently selling fast.  At the moment, the GeForce RTX 4070 Super is one of the best value mid-range Nvidia GPUs, especially since its lower spec sibling still costs $549. For an extra $50, you\u2019re getting a graphics card that feels more like a suitable replacement for an RTX 3090, and it\u2019s going to run rings around older flagship RTX cards. That said, it\u2019s worth noting that it\u2019s still armed with the same 12GB GDDR6X VRAM, and that could be an issue if you\u2019re looking to enjoy the new release well into the future. Typically, more memory is required when games offer up higher resolution textures, with 16GB proving to be somewhat of a sweet spot in some scenarios. Of course, if you\u2019re looking for a true 4K experience, you\u2019re going to want to opt for something like the RTX 4080 Super instead anyway, as Nvidia\u2019s mid-range selection really relies on AI trickery like DLSS 3.5 to pull off any sort of UHD action.

Weekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more I\u2019ve been messing around with PCs, video game consoles, and tech since before I could speak. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I kickstarted my relationship with technology by jamming a Hot Wheels double-decker bus into my parent\u2019s VCR, but we all have to start somewhere. I even somehow managed to become a walking, talking buyer\u2019s guide at my teenage supermarket job, which helped me accept my career fate. So, rather than try to realise my musician dreams, or see out my University degree, I started running my own retro pop culture site and writing about video games and tech for the likes of TechRadar, The Daily Star, and the BBC before eventually ending up with a job covering graphics card shenanigans at PCGamesN. Now, I\u2019m your friendly neighbourhood Hardware Editor at GamesRadar, and it\u2019s my job to make sure you can kick butt in all your favourite games using the best gaming hardware, whether you\u2019re a sucker for handhelds like the Steam Deck and Nintendo Switch or a hardcore gaming PC enthusiast.
