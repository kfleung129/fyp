    "text": "In the quest to discover new applications for artificial intelligence, major IT industry players have been investing in a company that has been creating robots that resemble humans. Figure AI Inc., a startup supported by Microsoft Corp. and OpenAI, has been seeking to raise approximately $675 million in a funding round with a pre-money valuation of roughly $2 billion. Jeff Bezos has committed $100 million through his company Explore Investments LLC, while Microsoft has contributed $95 million. Nvidia and an Amazon-affiliated fund have each contributed $50 million. Other tech corporations have also been involved. The venture capital division of Intel Corp. has contributed $25 million, LG Innotek has contributed $8.5 million, and Samsung's investment group has made a $5 million pledge. Venture capital firms Parkway Venture Capital and Align Ventures are also among the backers, contributing $100 million and $90 million, respectively. Since the widespread adoption of OpenAI's ChatGPT chatbot in November 2022, investors have been investing in artificial intelligence businesses. They see potential in these upstarts and are placing bets that they could outperform more established competitors. The Apple iPad (9th Generation) Tablet, with its powerful A13 Bionic chip, 10.2-inch Retina Display, 64GB of RAM, Wi-Fi, and smooth Android integration, offers a dependable platform for experimenting with cutting-edge AI applications. At a current price of $249, it is discounted by 24% on Amazon. Bloomberg, Reuters, Fortune "
