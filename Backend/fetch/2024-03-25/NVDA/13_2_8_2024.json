To that end, let\u2019s explore chip stocks Marvell Technology (MRVL), NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA), and ChipMOS TECHNOLOGIES (IMOS), poised for substantial growth in 2024. Read on\u2026. Feb 8, 2024 The importance of semiconductors in today\u2019s tech-reliant society cannot be understated. The chip industry is anticipated to thrive amid lucrative government investments and continuous technological innovation, leading to the creation of advanced chips that cater to diverse industry requirements. Given the industry\u2019s promising prospects, in this piece, we assessed three chip stocks to determine how they can help investors tap into the industry\u2019s tailwinds. While chip stock ChipMOS TECHNOLOGIES INC. (IMOS) could be a wise portfolio addition in 2024, I think Marvell Technology, Inc. (MRVL) and NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) should be kept on one\u2019s watchlist for better entry opportunities. Before delving deeper into the fundamentals of the three stocks possessing substantial growth potential, let\u2019s take a quick look at the industry landscape. The semiconductor industry demonstrated remarkable resilience during the latter part of 2023. According to the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA), global semiconductor sales stood at $526.80 billion in 2023, and market growth is expected to reach double digits in 2024, attesting to the industry\u2019s strength in the current year. Significant benefits, observed from recent subsidies announced by the Biden administration, have significantly boosted chip production within the U.S., helping the country maintain a competitive edge globally. The subsidies, a part of the Chips and Science Act, aim to allocate $53 billion to support the construction of the chip manufacturing plants. This move enables companies to develop finer semiconductors, thereby enhancing sectors like AI and military technology. Recent mergers and acquisitions have significantly broadened the industry\u2019s product range, reinforced the market presence of companies, and significantly augmented chip market growth. Furthermore, expansions in cutting-edge logic and foundry capacity, applications in generative AI and high-performance computing (HPC), and resurgent end-demand for chips expand the opportunity window for further expansion in the chip industry. 2024 STOCK MARKET OUTLOOK The global semiconductor chip market is anticipated to reach $1.12 trillion, growing at a CAGR of 7.1% by 2032.
