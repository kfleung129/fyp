    "text": "Countdown to Luke Lango\u2019s \u201c2nd Trillion-Dollar A.I. Trade\u201d The U.S. govt just unlocked an $8 trillion market to move in a new direction. See how it could unleash 6,000% potential upside. Even after a stellar performance in 2023, NVDA stock is surprisingly cheap Advertisement Source: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com Nvidia\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0took the spotlight on Wall Street last year as the demand for artificial intelligence\u00a0hardware soared. Don\u2019t assume that another company has to take Nvidia\u2019s place in 2024, though. NVDA stock\u00a0fully deserves an \u201cA\u201d grade as a prime momentum play that\u2019s actually a good value, as well. The idea here isn\u2019t to try to pick the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d stock that will outperform all the others this year. You don\u2019t need to play the prediction game or have a crystal ball if you own a few shares of Nvidia\u00a0stock. It\u2019s important to learn about Nvidia, listen to tech experts, and stay invested if you believe in its growth prospects. Nvidia was certainly a darling of the financial market in 2023. The skeptics and worry warts were wrong last year about Nvidia. They discovered the hazards of opportunity costs when investors fail to understand market trends and growth stories. They\u2019ll continue to be wrong in 2024, no doubt. The critics will claim that Nvidia stock is too pricey to buy now. Bernstein analyst Stacy Ragson has a message for them: \u201cToday Nvidia is in fact\u00a0the cheapest\u00a0of the \u2018AI narrative\u2019 stocks out there.\u201d Ragson calculates that Nvidia trades at 25 times the company\u2019s forward earnings, which represents the company\u2019s lowest forward earnings multiple since the end of 2018. Yet, Ragson isn\u2019t the only Wall Street expert that emphasizes Nvidia\u2019s surprisingly reasonable valuation. In a similar vein, Baron Capital\u2019s Michael Lippert recently estimated that Nvidia \u201cis trading at mid-20 times one-year-forward estimated earnings.\u201d Lippert is essentially echoing Ragson\u2019s argument here. Lippert\u2019s reasonable conclusion is that NVDA \u201cisn\u2019t an expensive stock.\u201d Furthermore, Lippert emphasized that AI isn\u2019t a \u201chype cycle,\u201d and that the \u201cbusiness has exploded, and everyone is trying to focus on the sustainability of that new level of business\u201d (presumably, referring to AI hardware and Nvidia\u2019s business in that industry). Some investors don\u2019t appreciate Nvidia\u2019s value proposition, but many analysts do. As more experts brace themselves for another solid year of returns with Nvidia stock, you can determine whether you want to add a few shares now to your portfolio. Just to provide another bullish argument, consider the commentary of Bank of America Global Research analyst Vivek Arya. Nvidia\u2019s \u201csolid [free cash flow] generation creates optionality,\u201d Arya remarked. This argument certainly passes the common-sense test. After all, Nvidia\u2019s FCF allows the company to invest in product upgrades and entirely new products, among other areas. In any case, Arya expects Nvidia to \u201cconsider assets that help it create a more meaningful recurring revenue profile.\u201d Perhaps the most optimistic assessment of all, however, comes from Wedbush analyst Dan Ives.  He believes that the \u201cnew tech bull market has begun\u201d even though the first few trading sessions of 2024 didn\u2019t favor technology stocks. Of course, the \u201cnew tech bull market\u201d will heavily depend on the AI hardware industry\u2019s continued growth. Much like Lippert\u2019s remark on this topic, Ives insists, \u201cThis is not hype.\u201d Even beyond that, Ives believes that the technology market is on the cusp of a \u201c1995 moment.\u201d Just look at how tech stocks performed from 1995 through 1999, and you\u2019ll see how bullish Ives\u2019 assessment is. There\u2019s no denying that Nvidia\u00a0is a fast-growing business because of the demand for AI-enabled processors and accelerators. Yet, there\u2019s also a convincing argument that Nvidia stock offers a good value. If you\u2019re a skeptic who missed out on last year\u2019s rally in AI-focused stocks, don\u2019t fret. Think about the opportunity cost that you might incur if you continue to sit on the sidelines. When all is said and done, NVDA stock earns an \u201cA\u201d grade and is a sensible way to prepare your portfolio for a potential \u201c1995 moment\u201d in 2024.
