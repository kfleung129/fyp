A leading Tesla analyst weighs in on what the ruling means and what's next for Tesla. The Tesla Analyst: Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives has an Outperform rating on Tesla and a price target of $315. The analyst recently lowered the price target from $350 after Tesla's fourth-quarter earnings report.

Ives said the next move is in the hands of Tesla's board of directors. Tesla's board can appeal the decision, create a new compensation package that replaces the 2018 one or create an entirely new compensation package that includes getting Musk back to the 25% voting share he recently requested. \"We ultimately believe this decision will be a catalyst for the board to take the situation into its own hands and come up with a new comp package that could satisfy both shareholders and Musk helping put this 2018 comp package noise in the rear-view mirror.\" Ives added that he expects a statement from the Tesla board in the next 24 hours to respond to the judge's ruling and what could be next. \"Musk is Tesla and Tesla is Musk and shareholders need Musk locked into Tesla through this next phase of the EV growth and AI endeavors over the coming years.\" Ives recently shared 10 ideas that could help Tesla stock after the fourth-quarter earnings report. One of the points was creating a new compensation plan that locks Musk in as the CEO of Tesla through 2030.
