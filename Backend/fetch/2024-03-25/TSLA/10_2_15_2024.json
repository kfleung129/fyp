The move, confirmed in a filing to the Texas Secretary of State, marks a significant shift for the company, aligning its legal domicile with its operational headquarters.

The judge\u2019s decision, which favoured a shareholder\u2019s challenge of the package as excessive, could potentially impact Musk\u2019s assets by over $51 billion pending any appeals. Delaware has long been a favoured destination for corporate incorporation in the United States due to its business-friendly legal and tax environment, including its reputation for facilitating mergers and adjudicating disputes. However, Musk\u2019s recent legal setback has prompted him to reconsider the state\u2019s advantages, leading to SpaceX\u2019s relocation and a similar move by his other venture, Neuralink, to Nevada. In a statement on social media, Musk advised against incorporating companies in Delaware and recommended Nevada or Texas as preferable alternatives, particularly for those who prioritise shareholder input in decision-making processes. Following the SpaceX announcement, Musk initiated a public poll on social media platform X, querying whether Tesla should also shift its registration from Delaware to Texas, where the EV company is already headquartered. The response was overwhelmingly in favour of Texas, with over 87 per cent of approximately 1.1 million respondents endorsing the move. As Musk navigates the legal and logistical implications of these corporate relocations, including seeking shareholder approval for Tesla\u2019s incorporation in Texas, the billionaire entrepreneur continues to reshape the corporate landscape in pursuit of his vision for the future of technology and space exploration.
