    "text": "Following a victorious 2022, Tesla short-sellers endured a brutal 2023. Over the course of the year, Tesla short-sellers watched their bets against the electric carmaker implode to the tune of $12.2 billion, the most of any company last year, as per analytics firm S3 Partners. Tesla stock more than doubled in value over 2023. Short-sellers as a whole did not have a good 2023. US stock indices ended the year near record highs, resulting in short sellers across the board being hit with estimated losses of $194.8 billion. From this number, Tesla\u2019s blow against short-sellers stood out, as it dwarfed the combined losses inflicted by large tech companies such as Microsoft and Meta. To be fair, Tesla has always attracted the attention of short-sellers, many of whom have maintained their critical stance against the EV maker until today. Shorts even had a huge year in 2022 as they made a profit of $15.9 billion amidst Tesla stock\u2019s 65% decline during the year. Yet as per S3 Partners data, Tesla shorts have still lost significantly more than they gained through the years. BREAKING \ud83d\udea8Short Sellers\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 U.S. Stock Short Sellers lost a combined $195 billion last year. Complete wipeout!Sc : S3 partners & Fin watch pic.twitter.com/IribJrP0N9 Since Tesla went public in 2010, short-sellers have suffered a net loss of $61.8 billion. In a comment to\u00a0CNN, Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director at S3 Partners, joked that short-sellers definitely felt the pain over the years. \u201cThat\u2019s going to leave a mark,\u201d Dusaniwsky noted. While Tesla is undoubtedly the market\u2019s leader in all-electric vehicles today, the company still has a dedicated group of short-sellers who are dedicated to betting against the electric vehicle maker. Dan Ives, an analyst with Wedbush Securities, noted that every year, bears remain attracted to Tesla. \u201cEvery year, the bears come out of hibernation mode and think, \u2018This is the year that Tesla shares collapse.\u2019 The bears view it as an automobile company that should trade at a valuation a multiple of GM or Toyota. The bulls such as myself believe it\u2019s a disruptive technology company. And that\u2019s the Wall Street consensus view,\u201d Ives said. Elon Musk, for his part, has expressed his disdain for short-sellers in the past. He has expressed these sentiments directly on X, then known as Twitter, and through more humorous means, such as dedicated \u201cshort shorts\u201d merchandise in the official Tesla Shop.
