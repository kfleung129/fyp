    "text": "The relationship between Musk and his directors was disclosed by the publication a month after another report claimed that the billionaire's excessive drug habit had affected his work Elon Musk's habit of\u00a0taking \"illegal drugs\" has been known to some serving and former directors of Tesla and SpaceX but none took any action as they didn't want to lose the social currency that the billionaire's circle brought, a report in the Wall Street Journal has claimed. Several directors at Tesla and SpaceX have money ties with Musk which may have bought their silence on his drug issues. The Tesla CEO has reportedly invested in entities linked to venture capitalists Antonio Gracias, Ira Ehrenpreis, tech magnet Larry Ellison and former media executive James Murdoch. In turn, these people\u00a0have invested money in at least one of\u00a0six companies belonging to Musk\u00a0(Tesla, SpaceX, The Coring Co., X,\u00a0Neuralink and xAI).\u00a0Notably, Ellison, while being a director, also owned a significantly sizeable 1.5 per cent stake in Tesla as of 2022. Apart from investments, the newspaper claimed that Musk\u00a0also provided career support to the likes of\u00a0\u00a0Steve Jurvetson, who stepped down from his firm DFJ Venture Capital in 2017 after being accused of sexual harassment. Despite the allegations, Tesla retained him as an independent director till he resigned in 2020 \"Some current and former Tesla and SpaceX directors have knowledge of Musk\u2019s illegal drug use but haven\u2019t taken public action, according to people who have witnessed the drug use or were briefed on it,\" the newspaper reported.
