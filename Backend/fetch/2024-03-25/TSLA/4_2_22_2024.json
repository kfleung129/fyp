    "text": "Elon Musk is not surprised by the bad news hitting Tesla rival Rivian. He\u2019s been warning about it for some time. On Wednesday, Rivian announced a disappointing quarter and outlook and said it would cut its salaried workforce by roughly 10%. Shortly after, Musk wrote on X that the rival maker of electric vehicles would go bankrupt in about six quarters on the current trajectory, adding, \u201cMaybe that trajectory will change, but so far it hasn\u2019t. \u201cThey need to cut costs massively, and the exec team needs to live in the factory or they will die,\u201d he wrote. Musk, having gone through \u201cproduction hell\u201d and \u201csleeping at the factory\u201d himself at Tesla, should know. The billionaire has warned about Rivian\u2019s challenges before. In June 2022, he said his advice for the company would be \u201cto cut costs immediately across the board dramatically or they\u2019re doomed.\u201d Read more: Apple buying Rivian? Nissan with Fisker? Tesla rivals\u2019 woes spark speculation as EV growth slows After markets opened on Thursday, Rivian shares fell by as much as 26%, their biggest drop and lowest level since the company went public in 2021. Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe pointed to high interest rates as one of the EV maker\u2019s key challenges, something Musk has described as hampering Tesla as well. \u201cOur business is not immune to existing economic and geopolitical uncertainties, most notably the impact of historically high interest rates, which has negatively impacted demand,\u201d Scaringe said on an earnings call. That\u2019s not the only challenge. Sales growth of EVs, while still strong, has recently slowed, spurring Ford and GM to pare back their production plans. This is partly because early EV enthusiasts have already bought their vehicles, and regular car shoppers are more likely to be turned off by the higher prices, range anxiety, and poor resale value associated with EVs, among other concerns. Tesla, in a call with investors, warned of \u201cnotably lower\u201d sales growth this year after a disappointing fourth quarter. Musk said his EV maker is \u201cbetween two major growth waves\u201d as it aims to start production of a more affordable model late next year. Meanwhile Toyota, the world\u2019s top carmaker for four years running, and other legacy automakers are enjoying surging sales of hybrid vehicles, which many car buyers see as a more practical alternative to EVs. On March 7, Rivian will unveil its R2, a midsize SUV that will take on Tesla\u2019s popular Model Y and be priced at around $50,000. The model will be smaller and cheaper than what Rivian has offered so far. \u201cThere is a lack of choice of highly compelling EV products in that $45,000 to $55,000 price range, recognizing the average price of a new vehicle transaction was around $48,000,\u201d Scaringe said. \u201cWe remain very bullish on the R2 segment and the R2 product itself.\u201d But the R2 is expected to launch in 2026. Asked on CNBC whether a capital raise would be required to get to R2 production, Scaringe replied, \u201cWe are very confident in the capital we have supporting operations through the end of 2025.\u201d He added the company is \u201cdriving efficiency into everything we do\u201d and expected a fourth-quarter gross profit later this year. But Rivian has a long way to go. It accounted for 4.2% of EV sales in the fourth quarter last year, compared with Tesla at 55.1%, according to Kelley Blue Book estimates. The Tesla Model Y alone had 33.2% of the market. And Tesla itself, of course, was recently topped in global EV sales by China\u2019s BYD, chief among the Chinese EV makers striking fear into legacy automakers with their low production costs and rapidly expanding exports. Musk, in another post following Rivian\u2019s earnings call, wrote: \u201cTheir product design is not bad, but the actual hard part of making a car company work is achieving volume production with positive cash flow.\u201d Read more: The BYD of Vietnam just reported a huge loss for 2023\u2014a whopping $2.4 billion \u00a9 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.
