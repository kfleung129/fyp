Directors and board members at the companies, many of whom have significant financial stakes in Musk's companies, are said to have\u00a0participated in drug use with the billionaire,\u00a0according to The Wall Street Journal. This has reportedly led to a culture where declining to use drugs with Musk could result in fears of losing wealth and social standing.
