    "text": "Wall Street took a break from rally on Monday, with all three major indexes dipping slightly Shares of Tesla (TSLA) continue to drop as the EV maker struggles with overall performance, issues with leadership culture, and rising profitability concerns from Wall Street. Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi joins the Live show to deep dive into the key issues and narratives pushing Tesla stock lower. For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live. Editor's note: This article was written by Nicholas Jacobino SEANA SMITH: 10 first stocks to watch, and it's Tesla among the top trenders on \"Yahoo Finance.\" Once again, this morning, shares are sliding in pre-market trading, off just about 3.5% year to date. It's been ugly for the stock, with shares off about 27%. Soz, you got to look for us here on what we could see-- excuse me, pre-market trading off just about 1.7%, lost over 3% yesterday. It's going to turn it around? BRIAN SOZZI: I was looking for a really bad pun like Tesla's stock downshifts to neutral. But you don't really shift in a Tesla, right? It's just an electric vehicle. Nonetheless, here are three reasons why Tesla stock is still tanking. Let me fire these off here really. Performance for Tesla has just not been good. You look at that last earnings report, earnings have been softer than expected for six straight quarters. So the Street is getting concerned about the company's performance. Number two, Wall Street profit estimates on Tesla are actually starting to fall. If you go over to \"Yahoo Finance,\" you click on the Analysis section on the left rail, you can see some of the earnings trends for Tesla over in recent days. Over the past 30 days, 2024 EPS estimates for Tesla have fallen for this year by about $0.72. Now keep in mind, Tesla shares are still valued about 56 times forward earnings. Not a good scenario when you see earnings estimates declining and your price is still priced for perfection or a growth stock. And then lastly, I have questions about Elon Musk here, the human being. The \"Wall Street Journal\" dropped its second story over the weekend, digging into his potential or reported drug use. Who else is running in his sphere? And I think this has begun to weigh on sentiment around Tesla. So you have all that. And then, really a nifty chart, I think, is also relevant to the Tesla story here as well. It comes from the folks over at Car Gurus. And you can see the continued downtrend in used Tesla prices for various reasons, whether it is quality concerns or people just don't want these things. They have range anxiety. Whatever it is, prices for Tesla continue to fall, which I would argue is putting pressure to even-- for Tesla to continue to lower prices on its newer vehicles, which puts pressure on profits and potentially sets it up for a seventh straight disappointing quarter when it reports three months from now. BRAD SMITH: Well, the other issue, too, is that you have the issue of so many of the rental car companies that are now putting some of their EVs back into the market too. So that hits on the Tesla selling proposition for a brand new one that somebody can say, all right, just for me to test out this EV landscape right now, why don't I just get into a used one for a fraction of the cost? BRIAN SOZZI: You can pick them on those Toyota hybrids. I know you're big-- you're a big fan. I really got a lot of pushback on my Toyota boring call, but-- BRAD SMITH: I'm just saying they got the Lexus division. SEANA SMITH: Well, you work from the market. I didn't think it was that much cooler than what Toyota was offering. BRIAN SOZZI: Sorry, Taylor. The former president delivered a rambling performance as his legal battles heat up.
