    "text": "Countdown to Luke Lango\u2019s \u201c2nd Trillion-Dollar A.I. Trade\u201d The U.S. govt just unlocked an $8 trillion market to move in a new direction. See how it could unleash 6,000% potential upside. TSLA stock traders can wait, as the next buying opportunity could be great Advertisement Source: Rokas Tenys / Shutterstock.com Negative news stories surrounding electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer\u00a0Tesla\u00a0(NASDAQ:TSLA) can be off-putting for investors. As the old saying goes, volatility can bring opportunity. As you encounter seemingly worrisome developments with Tesla, we encourage you to consider potential dip-buying strategies for TSLA stock. For the foreseeable future, there will always be issues and controversies with Tesla and its mercurial chief executive, Elon Musk. Tesla stock gets a \u201cB\u201d grade and if the price is right, level-headed investors might soon have time to own shares at a discount. As you may have noticed, EV stocks and technology stocks didn\u2019t start off the year with a rally. Tesla stock is a perfect example of how the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d stumbled in early 2024, as it dropped 5% in the year\u2019s first few trading sessions. Not to toot our own horns, but we basically told you this would happen. In late December, we warned stock traders to expect \u201cnever-ending drama\u201d with Tesla. Share-price volatility will be the norm with TSLA stock for a while, and investors need to accept this. Late last year, we mentioned that Tesla had trouble manufacturing enough batteries for its Cybertrucks. It\u2019s important to be aware of these issues, but sometimes the media is almost gleeful in reporting on Tesla\u2019s and Musk\u2019s problems. For instance, CNN recently declared in a large-font headline, \u201cTesla recalls 1.6 million cars in China to reduce risk of collisions.\u201d That\u2019s ominous-sounding, but it\u2019s not the end of the world for Tesla. In reality, it\u2019s not a traditional vehicle recall. It just requires a software upgrade for certain Tesla vehicles. The customers don\u2019t even need to go to a Tesla store to get the required upgrade. Sometimes, it almost feels like the media is trying to get people to panic-sell Tesla stock. For example, you may have heard that Tesla adjusted the range of its Model Y vehicle lower. It\u2019s really not earth-shattering news, as Tesla only lowered the vehicle\u2019s estimated range by 6%. Besides, estimated vehicle-range adjustments\u00a0aren\u2019t unheard-of events. In another example, the media reported that a Chinese automaker, BYD (OTCMKTS:BYDDY), surpassed Tesla as the world\u2019s best-selling EV manufacturer. That\u2019s a great story to get people\u2019s attention, but it doesn\u2019t significantly affect Tesla\u2019s long-term growth story. Lest we forget, Tesla\u00a0delivered a record 484,507 vehicle deliveries in 2023\u2019s fourth quarter, beating Wall Street\u2019s consensus estimate of 483,173 EV deliveries. Moreover, Tesla met its full-year 2023 target of delivering 1.8 million vehicles. More specifically, the company delivered 1.81 million EVs last year, representing 38% year-over-year growth. That should be the real headline story, and it\u2019s not really constructive to obsess over which EV maker is in the number-one spot. Tesla is a powerhouse and a leader in the U.S. EV industry. Globally, Tesla is still among the leaders even if another company took the number-one spot. Sure, Tesla\u00a0and Musk will continue to provide fodder for sensationalism in the financial media. That\u2019s par for the course with disruptive and innovative businesses. Despite the drama, TSLA stock deserves a confident \u201cB\u201d grade. If the negative headlines cause Tesla stock to dip 5% to 10% from here, investors might consider buying a few shares. After all, volatility is normal and even \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d stocks can\u2019t just go up without taking breaks.
