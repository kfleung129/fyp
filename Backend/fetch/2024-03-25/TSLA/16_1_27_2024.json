    "text": "Tesla, Inc. TSLA stalled its post-earnings sell-off on Friday and ended modestly higher for the session. As the stock bounces around an eight-month low, Cathie Wood\u2019s Ark Invest continued to pile into the stock. What Happened: Ark\u2019s flagship exchange-traded fund, the Ark Innovation ETF ARK, and the Ark Next Generation ETF ARKW accumulated 182,541 Tesla shares Friday. At Friday\u2019s close of $183.25, the purchase is valued at $33.45 million. On Thursday, after the stock\u2019s 12%+ drop, Ark beefed up its Tesla stake by 177,870\u00a0shares or $32.48 million. The aggregate purchase for the week was $65.93M worth of Tesla shares.

The weakness continued into the new year as the broader market rally stalled in early January amid apprehensions over whether the Fed will cut rates. Even as the other mega-cap tech stocks, collectively called \u201cMagnificent Seven,\u201d recovered in the second half of the month amid earnings optimism, Tesla continued to sag. Ahead of Wednesday\u2019s earnings report, traders chose to remain on the sidelines amid uncertainty over the company\u2019s fourth-quarter performance. Tesla reported a double miss and spooked investors further by flagging the prospect of a significant slowdown in volume growth in 2024. Wood, on the other hand, is still bullish on Tesla and sees the stock hitting $2,000 by 2027, with a majority of the estimated enterprise value likely coming from the yet-to-be launched robotaxi service. Tesla is the second-biggest holding of ARKK and the sixth-biggest holding of ARKW. ARKK closed Friday\u2019s session up 0.22% at $45.92, according to Benzinga Pro data.
