    "text": "Well-known tech analyst\u00a0Dan Ives\u00a0has urged Tesla Inc.\u2019s TSLA board to secure Elon Musk\u2018s position in the company with a new compensation package. What Happened:\u00a0On Thursday, in a post on X, formerly Twitter, Ives emphasized that it was time for Tesla\u2019s board to take action regarding the ongoing compensation dispute involving Musk. Posting a clip on X from his interview with CNBC, he suggested that Musk should be offered a new compensation package, ensuring his continued leadership role with the company, particularly in the areas of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Full Self-Driving (FSD) through 2030. During the interview, Ives was heard stating, \u201cMusk is the heart and lungs of Tesla. Tesla is Musk, Musk is Tesla. \u201c Ives also commented on Tesla moving headquarters from Delaware to Texas and Musk getting 25% of the shareholder voting rights. He noted that the Tesla board needs to take these steps in order to keep AI in-house. \u201cIt's a pivotal point to make sure that Musk stays at Tesla through 2030,\u201d he added.

A Delaware court\u2019s decision to nullify Musk\u2019s $56 billion stock compensation plan has stirred up activist investors who are now pushing for significant governance changes at Tesla. This court ruling could potentially reshape Tesla's corporate governance, thereby limiting Musk's influence. These investors have been advocating for changes at Tesla's annual shareholder meetings, such as director term lengths and voting thresholds for new bylaws. However, these efforts have so far seen little success. In a\u00a0recent note, Ives raised an alarm stating, \u201cWe believe the Tesla narrative is as negative we have seen in the last few years with Musk and Tesla getting attacked by the bears from all directions.\u201d Read Next:\u00a0Elon Musk Almost Sold Tesla To Google for $11 Billion \u2014 But He Called The Deal Off When He \u2018No Longer Needed A Savior\u2019 After Sales Surged Image made via pictures on Shutterstock Engineered by Benzinga Neuro, Edited by \nPooja Rajkumari The GPT-4-based Benzinga Neuro content generation system exploits the extensive Benzinga Ecosystem, including native data, APIs, and more to create comprehensive and timely stories for you.\n            Learn more. \u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.
