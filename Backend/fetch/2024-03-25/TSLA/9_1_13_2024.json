Get features like As India moves closer to drafting a new electric vehicles (EV) policy, Tesla is in advanced talks to make an entry into the country and may be open to committing nearly $30 billion in investments, directly and indirectly, over the next five years in a manufacturing plant, and battery ecosystem and ancillary industries, people closely involved with the company\u2019s official business plans said. This may include a direct and immediate investment of $3 billion to produce a new small car from an Indian plant for the wider developing world, a $10 billion commitment from other partners to support this manufacturing venture, and a cumulative $15 billion in the battery industry ecosystem over a five-year period, the people added.

Simultaneously, Tesla may also invest in a factory in India to roll out the first small car within two years, with the facility completed within three years. The pricing structure of the car hasn\u2019t been determined but it is likely to be a cheaper model that the usual Teslas to cater to the demands of countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America. This factory, with a high degree of local made-in-India content, may cater partially to the Indian market and substantially focus on exports, the people cited above indicated. \u201cIf it works out, this will the biggest foreign direct investment commitment in India. Tesla will invest $3 billion in the plant and other partners in its manufacturing ecosystem will invest another $10 billion. In parallel, there will be another $5 billion investment in batteries that will grow to $15 billion. We are looking at a total of $30 billion,\u201d said a person close to the company and involved in discussions on the project. The person added this could well be \u201cSuzuki moment\u201d for India\u2019s EV industry - alluding to how Maruti-Suzuki ushered in a small car revolution in the 1980s \u2014 and the \u201cApple plus moment\u201d for India\u2019s manufacturing aspirations \u2014 alluding to Apple\u2019s more recent foray into production in India. \u201cBut unlike Apple, Tesla brings everything in one go. Don\u2019t think of Tesla as just an auto company. It is a tech company. It is a critical minerals mining and refining company. It makes its own semiconductors. It is a design company. It brings in a huge ecosystem. The spillover from this to other industries is enormous.\u201d Also read: Elon Musk's X shed 1,000 employees across team tasked to combat online hate Tesla did not officially comment on its specific plans for India. While not specifically commenting on the case of Tesla, a senior government of India official working in an economic ministry said, \u201cIndia will consider providing incentive to all players in the EV sector. No company specific incentive will be given in any sector.\u201d But this indicates that the door for import duty concessions, as a part of a wider policy, remains on the table. The ministry of road transport and highways has launched the EV30@2030 campaign, aiming to ensure that 30% of newly registered private cars, 40% of buses, 70% of commercial cars, and 80% of 2-wheelers and 3-wheelers will be electric by 2030. An official said that while there was no single India EV policy, the government\u2019s \u201cvarious policy measures and supportive actions\u201d indicated a strong commitment to promoting EV adoption in the country. Like other American majors, Tesla\u2019s India plans are a part of its wider diversification strategy beyond China. While Tesla is continuing to explore other Asian countries as a possible manufacturing location, those familiar with the company\u2019s thinking said that Tesla founder Elon Musk admires both India and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whom he met last June in New York, and remains committed to expanding Tesla\u2019s presence in India. \u201cMusk really admires what Modi has done for India and his energy. He spoke to Modi about his interest in Indian spirituality and meditation and expressed an interest in traveling there,\u201d said the person quoted above familiar with Tesla\u2019s thinking. Within India, Tesla is considering four major auto manufacturing hubs to set up its plant -- Haryana (which will help cater to the biggest market in NCR), Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, and Gujarat. But given the major plans for export, it is likely that, if it does invest, Tesla may opt for a coastal state in the west or south.

Tesla\u2019s manufacturing module is predicated on a high degree of local content, with those close to the company pointing out that in its Berlin factory, the local content in Tesla\u2019s EVs is higher than in that of Mercedes, a German company, while in Shanghai, its degree of localisation is 95%. Tesla\u2019s investment, say advocates of the project, will help serve several of India\u2019s goals on local manufacturing, the battle against the climate crisis, integration into new global supply chains, and the wider strategic partnership between India and the US.
