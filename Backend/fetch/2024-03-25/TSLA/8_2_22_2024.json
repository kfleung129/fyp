    "text": "When Tesla CEO Elon Musk finalized his purchase of Twitter in Oct. 2022, many wondered why he chose to buy it \u2014 the famed social media website was losing millions, with many of its original users having already taken off for TikTok before his takeover. Musk expressed more than once that he intended to use Twitter to create X, an ambitious project he had previously called his \"everything app\". He changed Twitter's name to X in July 2023, effectively killing a 17-year-old brand which led to\u00a0bigger declines in overall traffic.

However, one Tesla bull has a theory about what's behind Musk's moves. And while it's a bold one, it certainly gives a new perspective on the billionaire's line of thinking.

Munster cites Twitter's data as the \"best source of real time intention\" and says he believes Musk will use it to train\u00a0xAI to be a \"top three Foundation Model\" (foundation models are what power ChatGPT). Michael Owens/Getty Images In January, Musk was reported to be involved in talks about raising $6 billion in funding for xAI. Despite voicing his reservations about AI in an open letter, Musk continues to press forward with his own project, which he says will be a safer AI system that is both\u00a0\"curious\" and \"truth-seeking\" \u2014 a claim AI experts don't exactly agree with. \"It\u2019s getting more clear. @elonmusk is 80% genius, 20% master of good luck.\" - Do you agree with @munster_gene's latest hot take on X?
