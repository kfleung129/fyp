The Giving Pies, a fixture in San Jose\u2019s Willow Glen district, has become a small-business David going up against a corporate Goliath that now appears to have shifted gears into full mea culpa mode after the tech titan\u2019s order cancellation that left the local merchant in a financial squeeze. \u201cI got contacted by Tesla to cater two of their events on March 5 and 7 for 1,800 pies each day, individually wrapped,\u201d\u00a0 Voahangy Rasetarinera, owner of The Giving Pies, said in an email she sent to this news organization. \u201cThey also offered to pay the $2,000 loss that I experienced because of the cancellation.\u201d Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk entered the fray after the corporate behemoth encountered a firestorm of disdain due to the company\u2019s cancellation of the huge order of mini pies. \u201cJust hearing about this,\u201d Musk stated in a tweet on Feb. 23. \u201cWill make things good with the bakery.\u201d At the time of the tweet, Tesla wasn\u2019t offering any specifics as to how the company would accomplish a \u201cmake good\u201d for the canceled order. Until now, apparently. \u201cI was really surprised that it had reached him,\u201d Rasetarinera said in the emailed comments, referring to the unexpected turn of events that caused the controversy to wind up on the radar screen of Musk, one of the world\u2019s wealthiest captains of industry.

The next step was what action would Musk take. \u201cHe (Musk) didn\u2019t have to get involved,\u201d Rasetarinera said in the email. \u201cBut I understand that in the face of so much pressure, he had to put a stop to it by getting involved and showing some type of care.\u201d The debacle began when The Giving Pies received a phone call on Feb. 14 from \u201cLaura at Tesla\u201d who wished to place an order for 2,000 mini pies that would be delivered the following week, Rasetarinera disclosed in a post on the bakery\u2019s Facebook page. \u201cComplications arose when the payment process was redirected through Tesla\u2019s vendor, City Flavor,\u201d Rasetarinera stated in a Facebook post. \u201cDespite this hurdle, I remained optimistic as I awaited payment. Yet, when payment failed to materialize, I grew concerned.\u201d Next, on Feb. 15, Laura from Tesla contacted the bakery again. Laura apologized for the mixup and promptly doubled the order to 4,000 pies. The Giving Pies staffers told Rasetarinera that they would be able to scramble to fill the dramatically increased request from Tesla. The Giving Pies sent Tesla an invoice on Feb. 16 that reflected the revised order, but soon after that, Laura texted the bakery shop owner that Tesla was going to cancel the order \u2014 yet again. \u201cThis abrupt reversal left me reeling, realizing the extent of the impact on my small business,\u201d Rasetarinera stated in the Facebook post. \u201cI had invested time, resources, and effort based on assurances from Tesla, only to be left high and dry.\u00a0In a heartfelt message to Laura, I expressed the profound disappointment and damage inflicted on my business.\u201d Customers, new and old, also have flocked to The Giving Pies, in person, on the phone and via the Internet to help buoy the bakery\u2019s fortunes in the wake of Tesla\u2019s blunders regarding the mini pie order. The deluge of demand is reflected in the bakery\u2019s voicemail message. \u201cDue to the overwhelming support\u201d from customers \u201cwe are unable to answer all incoming calls,\u201d The Giving Pies voicemail states. \u201cPlease note, if you come to the store, we might have already sold out of all of our pies.\u201d The reaction by customers stunned Rasetarinera, she said. \u201cI was blown away,\u201d Rasetarinera said in her emailed comments. \u201cIt feels so overwhelming.\u201d  Copyright \u00a9 2024 MediaNews Group "
