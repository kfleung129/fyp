    "text": "Bosses promise to go back to drawing board while carmaker faces industrial action from another union in Sweden The people of a small German town where Elon Musk has built a Tesla factory have thrown a spanner in the works by rejecting plans to expand the complex. The majority of residents of Gr\u00fcnheide in Brandenburg, an hour\u2019s drive south-east of Berlin, voted against proposals to build new infrastructure intended to improve access to the site and allow easier transport of the finished vehicles, including a freight depot and warehouses. A kindergarten for employees\u2019 children was also part of the plans, which propose expanding the 300-hectare (740-acre) factory site by 170 hectares and felling about 100 hectares of pine forest in the process. Voter turnout was 76%, with 3,499 people voting against the plans, 1,882 in favour. The referendum is not legally binding, but should \u201cserve as an orientation\u201d for local decision-makers and Tesla bosses who have lobbied hard for the \u201cgigafactory\u201d. The mayor of Gr\u00fcnheide, Arne Christiani, and bosses of the carmaker said the vote result would now prompt them to return to the drawing board. Plans for the original plant were first announced by Musk in November 2019. Vehicle production began in March 2022, with the first electric cars rolling off the conveyor belt almost immediately. Central to objections from the start, led by a local citizens\u2019 initiative, is the estimated 1.8m cubic metres of groundwater required by the plant to produce between 300,000 and 500,000 cars a year. The Brandenburg region has been beset by drought for several years. Tesla has repeatedly pledged to keep water use to a minimum and to recycle its water rigorously. But local people say they fear in particular the contamination of drinking water if groundwater levels drop too low. The citizens\u2019 initiative, which is backed by ecologists, point out that part of the planned area of expansion is in a water protection area. Christiani, an independent, told the German broadcaster RBB that he regretted the referendum\u2019s outcome and blamed negative publicity for the result. \u201cSeemingly it has not been possible to convey to people that further important infrastructure projects, such as a new B-road or a railway station forecourt, [need the Tesla expansion]. Now the municipality has the considerable task of trying to find solutions to this.\u201d Alexander Schirp, the managing director of the Berlin-Brandenburg business association (UVB), also expressed his disappointment, saying: \u201cThe Tesla investment is a lucky break for Gr\u00fcnheide and the whole of the state of Brandenburg. \u201cWe think that rather than the risks involved, it should be the chances this investment brings with it which should be the main focus, and that includes environmental concerns.\u201d The gigafactory, the first Tesla operation of its kind in Europe, employs about 12,500 workers. In a statement after the announcement of the referendum result, Tesla described its expansion plans as \u201ca big win for the community\u201d, adding that it would \u201cseek dialogue with all participants to decide on further steps\u201d. The company said its goal was to \u201cenable a significant transfer of the HGV-traffic on to rail as well as generally ensuring a speedy expansion of existing infrastructure around the factory\u201d. Tesla added that the increase in warehouse capacity would help to increase the efficiency of delivering its cars. The company had to stop production for about two weeks recently because of supply chain delays caused by attacks by Houthi rebels on commercial shipping in the Red Sea. Last month, a strike by Tesla workers in Sweden over collective bargaining rights became the country\u2019s longest-running stoppage in nearly 80 years. The strike by members of the IF Metall trade union is being portrayed as the largest attempt to save Sweden\u2019s union model from global labour practices in decades. IF Metall has more than 300,000 members across various industries in Sweden. According to the National Mediation Office, about a third of Tesla workers in the country have taken part in the strike since it began on 27 October, resulting in the loss of an estimated 1,936 days of Swedish labour. The industrial action has attracted multiple secondary, or sympathy, strikes by unions representing among others postal workers, dock workers, electricians and painters. It has been described as \u201cinsane\u201d by Musk and prompted Tesla to launch legal action. In neighbouring Denmark, Norway and Finland, Tesla cars have been blocked at ports. On Wednesday, the Swedish trade union Seko also announced sympathy measures, saying it would stop maintenance, repairs and service of Tesla charging stations and block new connections, preparation and planning. Seko\u2019s president, Gabriella Lavecchia, said: \u201cIF Metall\u2019s fight is also our fight. By refusing to comply with the rules of the game here in Sweden, Tesla is trying to gain competitive advantages by giving the workers worse wages and conditions than they would have with a collective agreement. It is of course completely unacceptable. \u201cThe fight that IF Metall is now taking is important for the entire Swedish collective agreement model. That is why we have chosen to issue another sympathy notice and increase the pressure on Tesla.\u201d "
