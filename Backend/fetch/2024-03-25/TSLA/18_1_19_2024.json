Please give us a call at 520-458-9440 Copyright \u00a9  \u2022 Wick Communications Terms of Use | Privacy Policy  Elon Musk is interviewed at the 2023 New York Times DealBook Summit, in Manhattan on Nov. 29, 2023. Musk has demanded that Tesla\u2019s board give him shares worth more than $80 billion if it wants him to continue developing products based on artificial intelligence. Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, demanded that the company\u2019s board give him shares worth more than $80 billion if it wants him to continue developing products based on artificial intelligence. Musk said Monday on X, the social media site formerly known as Twitter that he owns, that he needed to own 25% of Tesla to avoid takeovers and have enough control of the company as it develops robots and other AI technology. Musk owns 13% of Tesla after selling a substantial portion of his stake to finance his $44 billion acquisition of Twitter. The social media site has struggled under his leadership and plunged in value. An additional 12% of Tesla would be worth $82 billion at the current share price, effectively recouping Musk\u2019s investment in Twitter \u2014 which he has said he regrets \u2014 and then some. \u201cI am uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in AI &amp; robotics without having ~25% voting control,\u201d Musk wrote on X. \u201cEnough to be influential, but not so much that I can\u2019t be overturned.\u201d He went on: \u201cUnless that is the case, I would prefer to build products outside of Tesla.\u201d But he also said the board would take no action until a Delaware judge rules in a lawsuit brought by a Tesla shareholder challenging an earlier compensation plan that was instrumental in making Musk the richest person in the world. Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The demand by Musk underlined the extent to which Tesla, which sold 1.8 million vehicles last year and is the world\u2019s most valuable carmaker, is subject to his impulses. Tesla\u2019s success forced traditional carmakers to begin offering electric vehicles, which are essential in reducing greenhouse gas emissions from transportation. But Musk\u2019s behavior and statements have weighed on the share price and gotten him into trouble with regulators. Tesla shares fell when Musk sold some of his stake to buy Twitter. The shares also suffered after Musk said in 2018 that he had the money to take Tesla private and delist it from the stock exchange. Musk was unable to execute the plan. The company\u2019s stock has fallen about 14% this year but is up about 60% over the last 12 months. Musk did not specify which products he might develop outside the company. He has already started a separate AI business called X.AI, which last year released the Grok chatbot to selected users. Tesla is developing a robot called Optimus, which, according to a video posted on X by Tesla on Monday, can fold a shirt. Tesla also uses AI in its driver-assistance and self-driving systems. On X, some of Musk\u2019s fans applauded his statement, saying he earned the money. But others said it was his own fault his stake in the company has fallen. \u201cThey didn\u2019t make you sell your shares,\u201d one user wrote, adding, \u201cwhy should the board do anything to rectify this for you?\u201d A stake of less than 15% of the company, Musk said, \u201cmakes a takeover by dubious interests too easy.\u201d We're always interested in hearing about news in our community.
