    "text": "Elon Musk\u2019s drug use has worried executives and board members at businesses he runs, the Wall Street Journal\u00a0reported, citing unidentified people familiar with the billionaire and the companies. Musk has used LSD, cocaine, ecstasy and psychedelic mushrooms, often at private parties, the Journal said, citing unnamed witnesses and others with knowledge of the matter. People close to the\u00a0Tesla Inc.\u00a0and SpaceX chief executive officer told the newspaper his drug use is ongoing, and that in particular he\u2019s consuming ketamine. Musk\u00a0said\u00a0in August he has a prescription to use the drug as an antidepressant. After Musk puffed on a blunt containing marijuana on\u00a0Joe Rogan\u2019s podcast in September 2018, the Pentagon reviewed the federal security clearance tied to his role as CEO of Space Exploration Technologies Corp., which is certified to launch military spy satellites, Bloomberg News first\u00a0reported\u00a0in March 2019. \u201cAfter that one puff with Rogan, I agreed, at NASA\u2019s request, to do 3 years of random drug testing,\u201d Musk, 52,\u00a0posted\u00a0Sunday on X, the social media company he owns. \u201cNot even trace quantities were found of any drugs or alcohol.\u201d Read more: Elon Musk took drugs with Tesla board members: Report Musk didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment from Bloomberg News.\u00a0Alex Spiro, an attorney for the billionaire, told the Journal that his client is \u201cregularly and randomly drug tested at SpaceX and has never failed a test,\u201d and referred to \u201cfalse facts\u201d in the article but didn\u2019t detail them. SpaceX is now the only US company approved to transport NASA astronauts to and from the International Space Station. The Pentagon also has stepped up purchases of launches from the closely held company in recent years, and in June contracted with SpaceX\u2019s satellite communications business Starlink to\u00a0support Ukraine\u2019s military. The Journal reported that\u00a0Linda Johnson Rice, who became a Tesla director in 2017, didn\u2019t stand for reelection two years later out of frustration with Musk\u2019s behavior and her concerns about his drug use. Musk oversees six companies: Tesla, SpaceX and X, the social media company formerly known as Twitter; the tunneling venture The Boring Co.; brain implant developer Neuralink; and artificial intelligence startup xAI. His $219.4 billion net worth ranks No. 1 on the\u00a0Bloomberg Billionaires Index. \u00a9 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.
