    "text": "Tesla, Inc.\u00a0TSLA is\u00a0recalling\u00a0199,575 units of Model S, X, and Y vehicles in the U.S. as software instability may prevent the rearview camera image from displaying, according to a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) document. Per NHTSA, a rearview image that does not display while in reverse decreases the driver\u2019s\u00a0visibility and increases the risk of a crash. The recall covers certain 2023 Y, S, and X model vehicles. All of these vehicles are equipped with \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d computer 4.0 and run software version 2023.44.30 through 2023.44.30.6 or 2023.44.100. As a remedy to the recall, Tesla has released an over-the-air (OTA) software update, free of charge.\u00a0Owner notification letters are expected to be mailed March 22,\u00a02024. Earlier this month, Tesla recalled more than 1.6 million vehicles in China due to\u00a0concerns related to the misuse of autosteer features. This action comes on the heels of\u00a0a similar recall\u00a0initiated by the electric vehicle giant in the U.S. last month, affecting over 2 million vehicles equipped with all versions of Autosteer. It has been a rough week for Tesla so far, with the electric vehicle giant falling short of revenues in the fourth-quarter earnings. The revenue of $25.17 billion missed a Street consensus estimate of $25.62 billion, according to\u00a0data from Benzinga Pro. The earnings report and weak growth forecasts for the coming year played a significant role in the stock\u2019s decline.\u00a0Tesla\u2019s earnings call was also criticized, with one analyst labeling it a\u00a0\u201ctrain wreck.\u201d The decline also impacted CEO\u00a0Elon Musk\u2019s\u00a0net worth, sliding by $18 billion or 8.3% to $198 billion by the close of trading on Thursday, marking the first time since late October that the billionaire\u2019s wealth fell below this level, as\u00a0per\u00a0Bloomberg\u2019s Billionaire\u2019s Index.
