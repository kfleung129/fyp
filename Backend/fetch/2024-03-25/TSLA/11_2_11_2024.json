But if this Tesla owner\u2019s experience is anything to go by, many more will be making the switch sooner rather than later. X user @Tesla_GTownTX recently shared a screenshot of what he claims is the first time he\u2019s had to actually pay a bill to charge his Tesla in a whole year. READ MORE! Tesla owners have run into trouble amid freezing temperatures That alone is staggering \u2013 but the total owed is what\u2019s really left people shocked. According to the screenshot, which shows an email received from Tesla, the balance due is just $2.37. Like ourselves, you were probably expecting it to cost hundreds of dollars to charge an EV regularly over a month. First time i\u2019ve had a bill within the last 12 months. this sucks. pic.twitter.com/OSGdu1QbcN But a quick look at their X profile gives you a pretty big clue as to why they likely only paid a few dollars to charge their EV over the past year. Their cover photo is of a Tesla Powerwall, which is essentially a massive battery you can buy and loop into your home\u2019s power to store charge. It\u2019s at its most useful when paired with solar panels, to create a potentially self-sufficient power loop. This not only means that the solar panels will power your home, they can also store excess charge in your Powerwall, which can then be used to keep your Tesla topped up when you plug it in. While this sounds like a dream scenario, it requires a pretty high investment to set up, between the panels, the battery and the Tesla EV itself. There are environmental factors to take into consideration, too. @Tesla_GTownTX appears to be based in the Texas area, which normally gets lots of sunshine to bank plenty of power, but the ongoing cold snap will have slowed that right down. \u201cFirst time I\u2019ve had a bill within the last 12 months. This sucks,\u201d the X user jokingly captioned their post. People were quick to respond with plenty of jokes, including a Tiger King meme, where Joe Exotic says: \u201cI am never going to financially recover from this.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s horrible. My condolences,\u201d one user replied. \u201cDamn my dude post a GoFund Me the community will rally around you I\u2019m sure,\u201d another joked.
