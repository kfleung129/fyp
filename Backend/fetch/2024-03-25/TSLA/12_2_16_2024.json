    "text": "Countdown to Luke Lango\u2019s \u201c2nd Trillion-Dollar A.I. Trade\u201d The U.S. govt just unlocked an $8 trillion market to move in a new direction. See how it could unleash 6,000% potential upside. Here are just a few of the hottest EV stocks to buy and hold today Advertisement Source: shutterstock.com/Nixx Photography EV stocks have been struggling thanks in large part to high interest rates. Look at Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), for example. Since the year began, the EV giant sank from about $265 to a low of $175, all after\u00a0warning that growth would be notably lower than in 2023, when sales were up 39%. CEO Elon Musk even said that Chinese rivals \u201cwill pretty much demolish most other car companies in the world\u201d unless trade barriers are put in place,\u201d\u00a0as noted by the BBC. We\u2019ve even seen a scale-back of EV models from\u00a0General Motors\u00a0(NYSE:GM) and\u00a0Ford\u00a0(NYSE:F) because\u00a0the demand just isn\u2019t there. However, while Tesla is struggling, there are other EV stocks you may not want to ignore at the moment. That includes: Rebounding well off recent lows,\u00a0Li Auto\u00a0(NASDAQ:LI) could be one of the top EV stocks of the year. Just in January, the company\u00a0delivered 31,165 EVs, which is a 105.8% improvement year over year. Cumulative deliveries of LI vehicles are also up to 664,529 at the close of January, with a good deal of upside remaining. Xiang Li, chairman and chief executive officer of Li Auto said, \u201c2024 will be an\u00a0unprecedented year of growth for us, and we will establish a portfolio of eight competitive models, including four EREVs and four BEVs, to satisfy the evolving demands of our family users. Our 2024 launches will kick off in March with the official release and commencement of deliveries of our high-tech flagship family MPV, Li MEGA, alongside the rollout of the 2024 Li L7, Li L8, and Li L9,\u201d as noted in a company press release. We\u2019ll learn more about Li\u2019s progress when the company posts financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2023 before the U.S. market opens on Monday, Feb. 26. We can also look at\u00a0XPeng\u00a0(NYSE:XPEV), whose\u00a0January 2024 Smart EV sales soared 58%\u00a0to 8,250. The company also launched its X9 Ultra Smart Large Seven-seater MPV, delivering 2,478 units across 100+ Chinese cities. Better, the X9 Max is already dominating with 70% of all orders. In December, the company delivered 20,115 EVs, a 78% jump year over year. For the fourth quarter of 2023, it delivered 60,158 vehicles\u2014a 171% year-over-year jump. For all of last year, it delivered 141,601 vehicles, a year-over-year improvement of 17%. The company expects to expand in three new markets across Europe this year.\u00a0As noted by Electrek.co, \u201cXPeng is planning to expand to markets in Germany, France and Britain in 2024. Those entries will begin with the aforementioned G9 SUV and P7 sedan, as well as the automaker\u2019s most recent model to reach production, the G6.\u201d For the second consecutive year,\u00a0BYD (OTCMKTS:BYDDF) overtook Tesla as the world\u2019s top selling electric automaker. Helping, the company sold about 3.02 million EVs in 2023, an improvement of about 62% year over year. According to CNBC,\u00a0\u201cThe sales comprise 1.6M battery-electric vehicles (BEVs) and approximately 1.4M plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). The\u00a0company sold 526,409 fully electric vehicles in Q4, with EV and hybrid sales totaling 340,178 in December, including 190,754 all-electric cars, driven by aggressive end-of-year discounting.\u201d The company is also looking to open a plant in Mexico as part of its global push. That\u2019s because BYD sees Mexico as a key market with big potential. It opened plants in Thailand and announced plans to build a production facility in Hungary. Plus, it has plans to build a plant in Brazil and is now selling EVs in Indonesia. Better, BYDDF wants to get more aggressive in the U.K., Denmark and Norway.
