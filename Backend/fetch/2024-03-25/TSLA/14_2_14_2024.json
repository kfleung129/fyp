    "text": "Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. Elon\u00a0Musk\u00a0and the Tesla shareholder\u00a0who won a verdict last month\u00a0voiding the CEO\u2019s\u00a0$56-billion pay package\u00a0will ask a judge to pause her ruling until an appeal is resolved, according to a Tuesday letter to the court from the shareholder\u2019s attorney. Greg Varallo, the shareholder\u2019s attorney,\u00a0told Reuters the two\u00a0sides will agree to a stay if they can reach a deal on an appeal bond. The letter is the first indication that\u00a0Musk\u00a0intends to appeal the ruling, which the billionaire has criticized on social media,\u00a0saying he will\u00a0seek shareholder approval\u00a0to move Tesla\u2019s\u00a0state of incorporation to Texas, where it has its headquarters. Before\u00a0Musk\u00a0can appeal, the two sides will propose a final order for approval by the judge,\u00a0Kathaleen McCormick, which will include a petition for a legal fee. That fee will be paid by Tesla and given the enormous verdict, it is likely to be among the largest ever. It will likely be opposed by Tesla. Musk\u00a0and the shareholder will tell the court their position on fees by March 1, according to the court filing. If McCormick approves the fee and final order,\u00a0Musk\u00a0would have 60 days to file an appeal with the Delaware Supreme Court, which would likely take at least six months to resolve. An attorney for\u00a0Musk\u00a0did not immediately respond to a request for comment. An appeal bond protects a plaintiff who prevailed in court by ensuring that the losing party will pay up if they fail to overturn the verdict. The Jan. 30 ruling rescinded\u00a0Musk\u2019s\u00a0$56-billion pay package, which consisted of stock options.\u00a0Musk\u00a0has not exercised the options, which allow him to buy Tesla stock at a deeply discounted price. Once he buys the stock he must hold it for five years. The case was brought by\u00a0shareholder Richard Tornetta, who was pursuing it on behalf of Tesla. Shareholders benefited from the return of the stock options to Tesla. McCormick said in her ruling that\u00a0Musk\u00a0improperly controlled the pay negotiation process and that the shareholders lacked information when they voted in 2018 to approve the package.
