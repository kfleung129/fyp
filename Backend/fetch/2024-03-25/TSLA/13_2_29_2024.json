A majority of citizens in Gr\u00fcnheide have spoken out against the planned expansion of the Tesla factory \u2013 an activist group has now occupied the area of \u200b\u200bforest that was intended for the expansion. You don\u2019t trust that politicians will adhere to the people\u2019s vote. Around 80 activists from the \u201cStop Tesla\u201d initiative have occupied a forest near the company\u2019s car factory in Gr\u00fcnheide to protest against the planned factory expansion. They also want to support the vote of the citizens of Gr\u00fcnheide, who voted against the corresponding development plan in a residents\u2019 survey, as the initiative announced on Thursday. The group built tree houses on the approximately 120 hectare forest that is to be cleared to expand the site. Environmental activists said the occupation near Fangschleuse train station was planned for an indefinite period of time. \u201cOur main concern is the drinking water protection area,\u201d said activist Caro Weber of the German Press Agency. The initiative does not trust that politicians will follow the will of the residents, since the existing plant was already built with special permits. Part of the Tesla site is located in the drinking water protection area. Tesla also built its factory using early approvals. also read The company\u2019s expansion plans for the car factory were largely rejected by the citizens of Gr\u00fcnheide. Almost two thirds voted against the plans last week. The vote is not legally binding. The local council still has to approve a development plan. The electric car manufacturer wants to build a freight station, warehouses and a company kindergarten in addition to the existing 300-hectare factory site. To achieve this, more than 100 hectares of forest will be cleared. Conservationists and citizens\u2019 initiatives, among others, are against the expansion.
