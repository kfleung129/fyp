(Bloomberg) \u2014 Tesla Inc.\u2019s frequent prices cuts are \u201cpoison\u201d for the used electric-car market , which is holding up better for manufacturers that handle discounting through dealers, according to global lease firm Ayvens.  \u201cHaving a list price that goes up and down is poison for residual values,\u201d the fleet manager\u2019s Chief Executive Officer Tim Albertsen said Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s quite damaging for the market, and I think for the long term, it\u2019s damaging for Tesla the way they do it.\u201d Subscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.

Tesla spent much of 2023 slashing prices, including a nearly 30% cut to the sticker of the top-selling Model Y in just over three months. Meant to stoke demand, the practice has devastated used-car values, prompting rental firms Hertz Global Holdings Inc. and Sixt SE to ditch Teslas from their fleets as depreciation is among their biggest risks to manage.

The cuts immediately flow through to residual values, Albertsen said, which isn\u2019t the case for carmakers that sell through dealer networks.  \u201cTesla is a difficult animal,\u201d he said. The company is \u201cvery keen to keeping working with us and all the bigger players in the market so they are coming up with solutions.\u201d  Read More: Weak Demand for Used EVs Is Making It Tougher to Sell New Ones  While other carmakers like Volkswagen AG likely have offered even deeper EV discounts, this transpires during individual sales conversations, Albertsen said, making effects on used cars more manageable.  The slump in secondhand EV values is outstripping declines for combustion-engine vehicles. While this makes used EVs more affordable, it\u2019s painful for early adopters and has negative consequences for the car industry, including making new leases more expensive for consumers.  The issues with pre-owned cars \u2014 in addition to higher energy prices and insurance premiums \u2014 is undermining the assumption that EVs would be cheaper to run, a central claim in stoking demand. As buying incentives are being rolled back, adoption rates have started to slow.  The transition to electrification is \u201cstructural\u201d but the path \u201cmay not be as linear as initially expected,\u201d Albertsen said.
