There was a time when the backing of some of the world\u2019s deepest pockets and the mere ambition to sell electric cars was enough to inspire confidence in the stocks of upstarts Rivian Automotive Inc. and Lucid Group Inc. Now investors have all but thrown in the towel on the shares. All it took was a fresh dose of reality from the two companies this week around cooling demand for EVs. Rivian, which makes electric utes, SUVs and delivery vans and counts Amazon.com Inc. as its top shareholder, said its production will stay flat at last year\u2019s levels. Shares of California-based Rivian are down by about 44 per cent since Tesla\u2019s October warning.Credit: AP It also announced plans to shrink its workforce again. Lucid, majority-owned by Saudi Arabia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, projected only a slight increase in output over 2023. Both forecasts fell far short of analysts\u2019 expectations. For investors, the sense of gloom has been building since October, when Tesla Inc. warned of sagging interest in EVs. Though shares of the EV giant have fared poorly since then, losing around 20 per cent and massively underperforming the broader market, the impact on smaller rivals like Rivian and Lucid has been nothing short of disastrous. \u201cIf you are a hyper-growth company in what is seen as a disruptive industry, and you are not growing your topline, you are in trouble,\u201d said David Mazza, chief strategy officer at Roundhill Investments. \u201cHaving an anchor investor like Amazon or the Saudis gives them a longer runway from a capital perspective, but their growth will still be slower and margins thinner than what was once expected.\u201d Shares of California-based Rivian are down by about 44 per cent since Tesla\u2019s October warning \u2013 the first in a series of grim outlooks from global EV-makers and suppliers \u2013 and closed Friday at a record low. California-based Lucid has dropped some 33 per cent in the same period, and isn\u2019t far above its own nadir. Still, had it not been for their wealthy backers \u2013 Amazon has a 17 per cent stake in Rivian, and Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund holds roughly 60 per cent of Lucid, data compiled by Bloomberg show \u2013 the stocks could be looking far uglier. \u201cThe presence of these names is a comfort to investors and a cushion to the price,\u201d Mazza said. \u201cIf these stocks were just relying on the EV hype, then they will be down much worse.\u201d Amazon in an emailed statement said that the recent results from Rivian don\u2019t change anything about the e-commerce company\u2019s \u201cexisting investment, collaboration, or order size and timing\u201d. Rivian has a deal with Amazon to sell it 100,000 electric delivery vans by 2030. Saudi Arabia\u2019s PIF didn\u2019t respond to an email seeking comment outside the fund\u2019s regular business hours on Friday. Overall, the biggest concern is that these cash-burning, unprofitable companies will struggle to sell cars at a time when even industry leader Tesla \u2013 by far the biggest seller in the US market \u2013 is cutting prices to boost demand. And while Tesla\u2019s profits and large-scale production allow it to compete by lowering prices, Rivian and Lucid have neither of those advantages. \u201cFor these car manufacturers, investors want to see demand,\u201d said David Wagner, portfolio manager at Aptus Capital Advisors. Rivian\u2019s latest results suggest it will take several quarters to emerge from its production stoppage with a leaner cost structure and a redesigned platform, he said. \u201cIn the meantime, I think sceptics will be scrutinising the cash balance and ringing alarm bells,\u201d Wagner said. \u201cSo if there is no multiple expansion and no growth \u2013 what else is the stock supposed to do?\u201d Both Rivian and Lucid are worth a fraction of the prices they fetched at their public-market debuts in 2021. Rivian\u2019s market value is around $9.6 billion, and Lucid\u2019s is about $6.9 billion. That\u2019s a long way down from their $153 billion and $91 billion valuation peaks, respectively, in 2021. Wall Street analysts are losing confidence as well. Analysts\u2019 average 12-month price targets for Rivian and Lucid fell nearly 20 per cent just this week. Meanwhile, the outlook for EVs broadly just keeps getting worse. Global sales of EVs are estimated to grow 20 per cent this year, to about 16.7 million units, according to BloombergNEF\u2019s most recent analysis. That\u2019s a marked cooling from the 33 per cent jump seen in 2023. \u201cTrying to be the \u2018next Tesla\u2019 is turning out to be an expensive strategy,\u201d Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas wrote in a note Friday. \u201cAs EV start-ups turn into restructuring stories, whoever finds a sponsor has the best chance.\u201d Bloomberg Copyright \u00a9 2024 "
