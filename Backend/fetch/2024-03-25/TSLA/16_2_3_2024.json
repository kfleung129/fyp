    "text": "A Journal of Analysis and News  By Binoy Kampmark When is the acquisitive nature of open frontier capitalism too much?\u00a0 When Elon Musk is told that US$56 billion as a pay package is unfair.\u00a0 This, at least, was the finding by Delaware Court of Chancery by Judge Kathaleen McCormick regarding the spellbinding 2018 compensation package for the planet\u2019s wealthiest human being. McCormick and Musk already have inked some judicial history.\u00a0 The same judge presided over the Twitter suit against Musk that eventually resulted in him parting with US$44 billion to acquire the company that is now sliding into merry decay as the platform X. In her sharp ruling, daring to \u201cboldly go where no man has gone before\u201d, let alone a Delaware court, McCormick observed that Tesla, a company of Musk\u2019s own creation, \u201cbore the burden of proving that the compensation plan was fair, and they failed to meet their burden.\u201d\u00a0 The question of fairness first arose in 2019, when Tesla shareholder Richard Tornetta filed a suit challenging the validity of the 2018 performance-based equity compensation plan, the largest of its type in the history of public markets. Tornetta\u2019s primary contention was that Musk was hardly showing much devotion to the carmaker, his duties and interests spread, as it were, across a number of other corporate entities: SpaceX, OpenAI, Neuralink and the Boring Company.\u00a0 Tornetta\u2019s legal team argued that the 2018 package did nothing to focus the billionaire\u2019s interest on Tesla and, it followed, the interests of its shareholders.\u00a0 The agreement, for instance, made no mention of any such requirements as time allocation.\u00a0 \u201cIndeed,\u201d reads the lawsuit, \u201cMusk testified that since the Grant\u2019s approval, he has spent a little more than half his time on Tesla matters and has dedicated substantial time and attention to various other endeavours.\u201d The judgment acknowledges that any decision by the board of directors on what to pay a company CEO \u201cis the quintessential business determination subject to great judicial deference.\u201d\u00a0 Delaware law, however, recognised \u201cunique risks inherent in a corporation\u2019s transactions with its controlling stockholder.\u201d\u00a0 When it came to dealing with \u201cconflicted-controller transactions,\u201d the \u201cpresumptive standard review \u2026 is entire fairness.\u201d Here, the defendants proved \u201cunable to prove that the stockholder vote was fully informed because the proxy statement inaccurately described key directors as independent and misleadingly omitted details about the process.\u201d\u00a0 Even by the judge\u2019s own reasoning, the task left to the defendants was an \u201cunenviable\u201d one, and \u201ctoo tall an order.\u201d For the court, there were critical problems with the process leading to the approval of the compensation plan.\u00a0 The judgment paints a picture of Musk essentially negotiating with himself through devotees, flunkeys and friends.\u00a0 The adversarial atmosphere was never present; the \u201ccontrolled mindset\u201d all powerful. The theme of the entrepreneurial God King holding his courtiers in thrall streaks McCormick\u2019s observations.\u00a0 Musk, for instance, maintained \u201cextensive ties with the persons tasked with negotiating on Tesla\u2019s behalf.\u201d\u00a0 The chair of the compensation committee, Ira Ehrenpreis, had known Musk well for 15 years.\u00a0 Another member of the same committee, Antonio Gracias, had an enduring two-decade business relationship with Musk \u201cas well as the sort of personal relationship that had him vacationing with Musk\u2019s family on a regular basis.\u201d The entanglements do not stop there.\u00a0 There is General Counsel Todd Maron, the main negotiating link between the committee and Musk.\u00a0 Maron had acted as divorce attorney for Musk and admired him so much he was \u201cmoved \u2026 to tears during his deposition.\u201d With a flawed process, things did not get much better with the negotiated price.\u00a0 Again, the defendants argued that, for Tesla to continue to grow, Musk\u2019s continued leadership was indispensable.\u00a0 Keeping Musk as the main helmsman meant a rise in stockholder value.\u00a0 In one estimate, offering Musk a chance to increase his ownership of Tesla from 21.9% to 28.3% would mean \u201c6% for (US)$600 billion of growth in stockholder value.\u201d Such arguments did not convince McCormick.\u00a0 Musk already owned 21.9% of the company when the plan was approved.\u00a0 He had every incentive to push the company \u201cto levels of transformative growth\u201d seeing what he stood to gain from it: \u201c(US)$10 billion for every (US)$50 billion in market capitalization increase.\u201d\u00a0 The arrangements also came with no conditions on how much time Musk would devote to Tesla.\u00a0 \u201cSwept up by the rhetoric of \u2018all upside,\u2019 or perhaps starry eyed by Musk\u2019s superstar appeal, the board never asked the (US)$55.8 billion question: Was the plan even necessary to retain Musk and achieve its goals?\u201d\u00a0 The answer: plainly not. Such observations would have stung and made good the judge\u2019s promise to go where no previous Delaware court had dared tread.\u00a0 Here was a punchy assessment about the comfortable, clique-ridden tribalism of corporate non-governance.\u00a0 Musk, riled and ruffled, took to the platform X (formerly Twitter) to vent.\u00a0 \u201cNever incorporate your company in the state of Delaware,\u201d were his words of advice. By no means does this end matter.\u00a0 Musk is hardly going to be out of pocket, nor is he going to leave the company from which he continues to handsomely profit from via stocks he owns.\u00a0 Fairness operates in otherworldly dimensions here.\u00a0 A new compensation package, according to the judge, will have to be worked out with Tornetta.\u00a0 An appeal is also possible.\u00a0 \u201cThe judge\u2019s ruling should be a wakeup call (for Tesla shareholders) that things have gotten out of hand,\u201d remarks Andrew Poreda, who also invests in Tesla through exchange-traded funds.\u00a0 In this overgrown corporate jungle, it is questionable whether things were ever really in hand.
