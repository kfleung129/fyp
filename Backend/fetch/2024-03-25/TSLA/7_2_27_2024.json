    "text": "Tesla Inc\u00a0TSLA Investor Relations Vice President\u00a0Martin Viecha on Tuesday recommended that shareholders who hold the EV giant\u2019s shares jump to a different broker if their current one doesn\u2019t allow voting at the annual shareholder meeting. What Happened: \u201cEveryone who owns TSLA shares through a broker can vote at every annual meeting,\u201d Viecha clarified in a post on X (formerly Twitter) while adding that voting requires no registration with Tesla investor relations. However, some brokers in Europe don\u2019t allow voting, the executive noted. \u201c...If that\u2019s the case, consider moving your TSLA shares to another broker,\u201d Viecha wrote. He was responding to a Tesla enthusiast who enquired on voting status ahead of Tesla\u2019s 2024 shareholder meeting wherein they expect shareholders to vote on \u201csensitive subjects.\u201d Everyone who owns TSLA shares through a broker can vote at every annual meeting. No need to be registered with Tesla IR. I'm aware that some European brokers don't allow voting, if that's the case, consider moving your TSLA shares to another broker. Why It Matters: Tesla\u2019s annual shareholder meeting in 2023 was held on May 16 at Gigafactory Texas. The date for the current year is not confirmed as of now. Tesla CEO Elon Musk\u2018s new compensation might be one of the proposals that shareholders vote for this year given that he is no longer covered by any compensation package. Furthermore, Musk\u2019s 2018 compensation plan with a maximum value of about $56 billion was struck down by a Delaware judge last month as an \u201cunfathomable sum.\u201d Check out more of Benzinga's Future Of Mobility coverage by\u00a0following this link.
