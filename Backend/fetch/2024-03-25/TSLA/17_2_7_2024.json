    "text": "EV giant Tesla Inc\u2018s TSLA high-end version of the Model Y SUV is now eligible for C$5000 (~$3,717) in zero-emission vehicle incentives in Canada after the recent price cut. What Happened: Tesla cut prices on Model Y Performance in Canada by 5.8% or C$4,300 (~$3,196.6) on Tuesday. The vehicle is now priced at C$69,990\u00a0(~$52,030.20) as compared to the earlier starting price of C$74,290 (~$55,226.80) For higher-priced trims of electric SUVs to be eligible for incentives in Canada, they must be priced below a price threshold of C$70,000 (~$52,037.70), which the Performance version now fits into. The vehicle will now start at C$64,990 (~$48,313.20) after incentives. Why It Matters: Currently, all three versions of the Model Y qualify for an EV incentive in Canada, similar to the U.S. where all vehicle trims qualify for a federal EV tax credit of $7,500. According to information listed on the federal institution Transport Canada\u2019s website, Tesla\u2019s Model 3 rear-wheel drive and Long-range versions are also eligible for C$5000 in Canada unlike in the U.S. where neither versions of the lower-priced sedan qualify for EV tax credit.
