Crypto lobbyists, along with nine state attorneys general, pushed back in a flurry of court documents Thursday. The Blockchain Association and DeFi Education Fund filed a joint amicus brief in which they derided the SEC argument that cryptocurrencies amount to \u201a\u00c4\u00fainvestment contracts\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 because the digital assets exist within ecosystems that founders and developers are actively trying to improve. The industry lobbyists were joined by state attorneys general from Montana, Arkansas, Iowa, Mississippi, Nebraska, Ohio, South Dakota, and Texas. An amicus, or friend of the court, is a legal document offering support or information on legal cases from parties not directly involved. The brief was filed in support of crypto exchange Kraken, which is being sued by the SEC for commingling customer funds with its own and for acting as an unregistered securities exchange, broker, dealer, and clearing agency. The SEC\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s argument is akin to mistaking a company\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s product for the company itself, Marisa Coppel, the Blockchain Association\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s top lawyer, told DL News, echoing an argument made in the lobbyist group\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s brief. That Tesla, the electric car manufacturer, is building its own network of chargers doesn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t mean the cars themselves should be treated like stocks and bonds. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWhen you buy a Tesla, you\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re relying on the company to maintain and create its charging network, because otherwise you wouldn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t be able to use your car,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faBut that doesn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t make the Tesla a security.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The SEC is charged with policing the US securities markets to protect investors from fraud and abuse. Since the collapse of crypto exchange FTX in November 2022, the SEC has cracked down on the crypto industry, suing players large and small for offering unregistered securities. Chair Gary Gensler has said the \u201a\u00c4\u00favast majority of crypto assets are investment contracts and thus subject to the federal securities laws.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The industry has treated the crackdown as something of an existential crisis, arguing that shoehorning crypto assets into existing securities laws would amount to a death sentence given their unique features and the cost of complying with government regulations. In March 2023, crypto exchange Kraken agreed to pay a $30 million fine and end its staking program in the US to settle an earlier SEC lawsuit alleging the staking program was itself an unregistered security. But the regulator returned in November, suing Kraken in federal court in San Francisco. Supposed securities available on Kraken include Solana\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s SOL, Polygon\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s MATIC, Cardano\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s ADA, and several other tokens, according to the SEC. The SEC holds that an investment contract exists if there is an investment of money in a \u201a\u00c4\u00facommon enterprise\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 with a \u201a\u00c4\u00fareasonable expectation of profits derived from the efforts of others\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00ee criteria known as the \u201a\u00c4\u00faHowey Test\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 for the landmark 1946 case SEC v. W.J. Howey Co. \u201a\u00c4\u00faA reasonable investor would have understood the offer and sale of each of the Kraken-Traded Securities as offers and sales of investment contracts,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the SEC said in its complaint against Kraken. \u201a\u00c4\u00faPurchasers of the Kraken-Traded Securities would reasonably have expected to profit from the efforts of these issuers and promoters to grow and maintain the technology platforms and blockchain ecosystems associated with these crypto assets because such growth or operations could in turn increase the price of the underlying crypto asset and/or provide increased value to holders of the Kraken-Traded Securities.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Coppel said it was \u201a\u00c4\u00faabsurd\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and an overly broad interpretation of the Howey Test. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIn my reading of Howey and all the other cases that set forth a precedent in this area, that\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s just not the law,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Coppel said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIt disregards certain elements of Howey, and only focuses on the expectation of profit.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 She called the participation of state attorneys general a \u201a\u00c4\u00fapowerful\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 move that could get the court\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s attention. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThey don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t weigh in on every single case, even if the case could potentially impact people in their state. I think a judge would look at an amicus brief by any other government organisation slightly differently. Like maybe give that a little bit more weight.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The industry has put much of its faith in courts after a series of victories last year. But Coppel believes industry developers are still nervous about running afoul of the SEC. \u201a\u00c4\u00faPeople tend to be more bullish and more willing to take risks in a bull market,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faAs the market shifts, I think the risk calculation also shifts, but I don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t think that\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s due to any anxiety ease from the SEC.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Aleks Gilbert is a DeFi correspondent for DL News.
