See how it could unleash 6,000% potential upside. Don't let every scary-sounding headline steer you away from TSLA stock Advertisement Source: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com Do you want to be a beginner or a professional? Beginners get shaken out of perfectly good stock positions with each and every headline. Meanwhile, professional investors know that\u00a0Tesla\u00a0(NASDAQ:TSLA) is a leader among\u00a0electric vehicle manufacturers. They stand by their investments, and I encourage you to buy and hold TSLA stock\u00a0when it dips even if the headlines are sometimes scary. EV stocks\u00a0and\u00a0technology stocks\u00a0had a rough start to 2024. Tesla stock was no exception, but that\u2019s not necessarily bad news. If anything, it\u2019s just an opportunity to decide for yourself whether it\u2019s time to add to your Tesla share stake. Most times, the headline risk surrounding Tesla is overblown and big-picture thinkers end up winning practically every time. From a technical standpoint, it\u2019s very interesting that TSLA stock\u2019s 52-week high is $299.29. Is there some mysterious force that\u2019s preventing the stock from breaking above $300? There\u2019s no need to get into conspiracy theories when the negative pressure on Tesla stock can be explained. Technology stocks fell in early 2024, so that\u2019s one contributing factor. Tesla\u2019s trailing price-to-earnings ratio probably needed to come down from its high level. Tesla\u2019s GAAP trailing P/E ratio was around 73x in mid-January, so it wouldn\u2019t be too shocking if Tesla stock dipped for a little while longer. There were also scary headlines to shake out beginner stock traders. Here\u2019s a sampling of the negative news items: That list doesn\u2019t even include the controversial things that Musk says and does. There\u2019s an overarching theme here: assume that volatility is par for the course if you\u2019re going to buy and hold Tesla stock. Now, I can add two more items to the list of things to worry about. First, Tesla\u00a0reduced the prices of its vehicles in China again. Specifically, the automaker lowered the prices of its Model Y\u00a0and\u00a0Model 3\u00a0vehicles in China by 3% to 6%. Like the other items on the \u201cthings to worry about\u201d list, I don\u2019t consider Tesla\u2019s latest round of price cuts to be a deal-breaker. Tesla is doing what\u2019s necessary to be competitive in China. None of this negates the fact that Tesla reached its EV-delivery target and beat Wall Street\u2019s delivery estimate in the company\u2019s most recently reported quarter. Finally, I\u2019ll give you one more scary headline: Tesla\u00a0halted EV production at its German factory because of supply-chain disruptions in the Red Sea. This, like many other of Tesla\u2019s issues, is temporary and probably won\u2019t substantially alter the company\u2019s long-term growth story. It\u2019s important to be aware of these news stories. You don\u2019t have to let them scare you out of a perfectly good investment. Remember, there were plenty of off-putting headlines pertaining to Tesla in 2023, but Tesla stock still went up sharply. It makes sense to hold a core position in TSLA stock and then add to that position if the share price drops 5%, 10% or more. That\u2019s a sensible strategy if you believe that Tesla will continue to produce and deliver plenty of EVs. So, don\u2019t obsess over the headlines too much, and try to adopt the mindset of a professional instead of a beginner.\u00a0And when it\u2019s falling \u2013 or even when it\u2019s not falling \u2013 consider adding some shares of Tesla stock in your long-term holdings.
