    "text": "Tesla Inc TSLA is reportedly filming its new Model 3 variant in Spain and X users are contradicted whether it is a Plaid or a Performance. What Happened: Tesla enthusiast Desmond Wisley took to X, formerly Twitter, on Sunday to share short videos of the new Model 3 that he captured. The company was filming the vehicle for an advertisement in Valencia, Wisley said in posts on X. The X user caught two vehicles being filmed, one in red and the other in solid black body paint. New model 3 Plaid being Filmed in Valencia Spain @garyblack00 @WholeMarsBlog @Teslaconomics @teslaownersirl pic.twitter.com/N1du5ERjoy Model 3 ludicrous being unveiled for an advert today being filmed for an advert today in Valencia spain @elonmusk @TeslaBoomerMama @TeslaBoomerMama @teslaownersirl @SawyerMerritt @WholeMarsBlog pic.twitter.com/VP9qH7EaTD While Wisley initially termed the new variant a Plaid, several X users noted that the badging on the rear of the vehicle is a Ludicrous badge and not a Plaid badge. Ludicrous is an acceleration mode available on Performance All-Wheel Drive Tesla vehicles. Tesla currently offers Plaid versions on only its higher-end Model S and Model X vehicles. Why It Matters: Tesla unveiled the refreshed Model 3 in the U.S. in January. The company listed two variants of the car, namely the rear-wheel drive and long-range. The Performance variant, however, was no longer listed. Tesla initially launched the\u00a0refreshed Model 3 in China\u00a0in late August.\u00a0Even in the Asian country, the EV giant listed only the rear-wheel drive and long-range versions, giving rise to speculations on the future of the Performance variant. However, in January, Tesla\u2019s head of Investor Relations Martin Viecha confirmed the release of a\u00a0refreshed Model 3 Performance variant. \"You should get the Performance one, once that comes out,\" Viecha wrote to television presenter\u00a0James May\u00a0who had recently bought a new Model 3.
