    "text": "Ford Motor Co. is working on inexpensive, small electric vehicles to stem its electric vehicle losses and take on Tesla Inc. and Chinese automakers. Chief Executive Officer Jim Farley revealed the plans to analysts Tuesday after the automaker announced adjusted earnings per share of 29 cents, more than double the 13 cents analysts expected on average. Fourth quarter revenue of $46 billion surpassed the $40.3 billion analysts expected. Ford is recalibrating its EV strategy to move away from large, expensive EVs because high prices are the biggest barrier to convincing mainstream car buyers to go electric, Farley said. \u201cWe\u2019re also adjusting our capital, switching more focus onto smaller EV products,\u201d Farley told analysts on a conference call. He said Ford \u201cmade a bet in silence two years ago\u201d to develop a team to create a low-cost EV platform. The small team is being led by\u00a0Alan Clarke, executive director of advanced EV development, who came to Ford two years ago after more than 12 years developing models for Tesla. The new EV platform will be the basis of \u201cseveral types of vehicles,\u201d Farley said, which should generate a profit. Ford\u2019s current battery powered models lost $4.7 billion last year, and projects the losses will grow to as much as $5.5 billion this year. \u201cWe are nowhere near our earnings potential,\u201d Farley said. \u201cAll of our EV teams are ruthlessly focused on cost and efficiency in our EV products because the ultimate competition is going to be the affordable Tesla and the Chinese\u201d model EVs. As\u00a0electric vehicle sales slow, Farley is attempting to thread the needle between\u00a0scaling back\u00a0the company\u2019s EV spending by\u00a0$12 billion\u00a0while dialing up output of traditional internal combustion engine models, which generate profits needed to fund future growth.\u00a0Play Video For the current year, Ford forecast earnings of $10 billion to $12 billion before interest and taxes, compared with $10.4 billion on that basis in 2023. That result was on the high end of the $10 billion to $10.5 billion the company\u00a0predicted\u00a0in November, when it lowered guidance following a\u00a0six-week strike\u00a0the by the United Auto Workers union. As part of that initiative to wring out more profits, the carmaker plans $2 billion in cost cuts, targeting areas such as materials, freight and manufacturing operations.

Ford shares rose 5.5% at 9:39 a.m. in New York. Through Tuesday\u2019s close, the stock was down 1% on the year. The automaker is giving investors a supplemental dividend of 18 cents a share, in addition to the regular 15-cent quarterly dividend, both payable on March 1 to shareholders of record on Feb. 16. In December, the automaker\u00a0halved production\u00a0of electric F-150 Lightning pickups, while\u00a0boosting\u00a0output of its highly profitable\u00a0Bronco\u00a0sport-utility vehicles and\u00a0Ranger\u00a0pickup trucks. Chief Financial Officer John Lawler told analysts the company no longer expects to reach its\u00a08% margin goal\u00a0on EVs by 2026. Ford\u2019s 2023 EV deficit translated to a loss of roughly $28,000 on each battery powered model it sold, according to an analysis by Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Joel Levington, who noted those losses are \u201cunsustainable.\u201d A bright spot is hybrid gas-electric vehicles, which Ford has\u00a0pivoted\u00a0to in response to strong consumer demand. Farley said he expects sales of hybrid models to grow 40% this year, up from last year\u2019s 25% jump in sales of those powertrains. The Dearborn, Michigan-based automaker also faces higher labor costs than its crosstown rival General Motors Co., which\u00a0wowed\u00a0Wall Street last week with a 2024 forecast of $12 billion to $14 billion in earnings before interest and taxes. GM has said the contract it struck with the UAW will add about $575 in costs per car, while Ford predicts an increase of up to\u00a0$900\u00a0per vehicle due to the\u00a0record deal\u00a0that increases workers\u2019 wages by\u00a033%\u00a0over four-and-a-half-years. \u201cGM is better set up to absorb those labor costs because they already had a healthier cost base in North America,\u201d David Whiston, an analyst with Morningstar Inc. in Chicago, said in an interview before Ford posted results. \u201cAnd Ford has more UAW employees in the US than GM.\u201d In its traditional internal combustion engine business, known as Ford Blue, the company earned $813 million before interest and taxes in the fourth quarter, less than the $866.5 million analysts expected. Ford\u2019s US sales rose less than 1% in the fourth quarter as the UAW strike cost it production of high profit models such as the F-Series\u00a0Super Duty\u00a0pickup truck and the\u00a0Explorer\u00a0SUV. In its commercial business, known as Ford Pro, the automaker earned $1.81 billion before interest and taxes, more than the $1.43 Billion analysts expected. Bloomberg Intelligence predicts Ford Pro will see\u00a0margins expand\u00a0this year while its Ford Blue unit will experience margin pressure as pricing drops because dealers have replenished their lots with inventory after pandemic-related shortages. \u201cFord profit is on a tightrope as the transition to electric vehicles takes longer than expected, requiring right-sizing to cut EV losses while managing increased pricing competition for Ford Blue,\u201d BI analysts Steve Man and Peter Lau wrote in a Feb. 2 note. \u201cOur scenario sees US electric-vehicle sales climbing 9% this year after growing at a compounded annual rate of 65% over the past three years.\u201d \u00a9 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.
