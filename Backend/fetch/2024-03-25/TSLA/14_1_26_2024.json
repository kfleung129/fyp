    "text": "Tesla, Inc.\u00a0TSLA shares witnessed a significant plunge on Thursday as\u00a0investors opted for a sell-off, driven by concerns over the EV maker\u2019s future outlook. What Happened:\u00a0The decline also impacted CEO\u00a0Elon Musk\u2018s net worth, sliding by $18 billion or 8.3% to $198 billion by the close of trading on Thursday, marking the first time since late October that the billionaire\u2019s wealth fell below this level, as\u00a0per\u00a0Bloomberg\u2019s Billionaire\u2019s Index. The primary catalyst for Musk\u2019s wealth erosion was Tesla\u2019s fourth-quarter results, which fell below Street expectations. The company\u2019s guidance indicating significantly lower volume growth for 2024 contributed to the negative sentiment. During the earnings call, Musk and his management team emphasized long-term revenue and margin-driving projects without providing clear insights into near-term fundamentals. Despite the stock plunge, it\u2019s noteworthy that Musk remains the world\u2019s wealthiest man, even as his net worth experienced a significant decline. Trailing behind Musk in the billionaires\u2019 list is\u00a0Jeff Bezos, whose net worth stood at $183 billion at Thursday\u2019s close. See Also:\u00a0Everything You Need To Know About Tesla Stock Why It Matters:\u00a0It\u2019s crucial to recognize that a substantial portion of Musk\u2019s wealth is intricately tied to Tesla, with additional contributions from his ownership in ventures like\u00a0SpaceX,\u00a0Starlink,\u00a0The Boring Company, and the social media platform X, acquired in October 2022. As of May 2023, Musk owned 411,062,076 Tesla shares, constituting just\u00a0under a 13% stake\u00a0in the company. If he exercises options vested with 303,960,630 shares, his stake could exceed 20%. Musk has been clamoring for greater control in Tesla to make the company into an AI and robotic powerhouse. This month, he expressed his desire for\u00a0a 25% voting control\u00a0in the company. Musk justified this request by suggesting that proxy advisory firms could potentially take control of the company, thereby endangering its technological trajectory. In contrast, a significant part of Bezos\u2019 net worth is derived from his stake in Amazon. The e-commerce giant is set to report its quarterly results, and a strong performance could potentially boost Amazon\u2019s stock, positively impacting Bezos\u2019 overall wealth. As Tesla enters a low-growth phase and faces challenges in its strategies and macro fundamentals, the stock may continue to be under pressure in the near to medium term. Tesla ended Thursday\u2019s session down 12.13% at $182.63, according to Benzinga Pro data.
