    "text": "Chinese automaker BYD (BYDDY) dethroned Tesla (TSLA) to become the world\u2019s top seller of electric vehicles last year. To get to that position, BYD has relied on its home market of China for more than 80% of its sales. But now, with China\u2019s EV boom projected to slow for a second straight year, the company is eyeing rapid international expansion. Just don\u2019t expect an entry into the US anytime soon. \u201cWe\u2019re not planning to come to the US,\u201d Stella Li, executive vice president of BYD and CEO of BYD Americas, told Yahoo Finance Live (video above). \u201cIt\u2019s an interesting market, but it is very complicated,\u201d she added, citing growing political pushback on Chinese companies and the slowing rate of growth for EV adoption. Chinese carmakers, faced with a 27.5% tariff on car imports from China, have largely been shut out of the US market. But BYD\u2019s rapid growth in Mexico and plan to build out a factory there has raised alarms among Western competitors worried that the company may be positioning itself for a US entry by establishing an export hub in Mexico that would help it avoid high tariffs. Li dismissed that speculation, saying the company\u2019s plant would be located within 200 miles of Mexico City to focus solely on Mexico's domestic market. An official announcement on the plant is expected in the second half of this year, she said. \u201cWe\u2019re not even considering any northern state [in Mexico],\u201d Li said, alluding to brands that typically set up operations near the US-Mexico border to target the American market. \u201cWe are targeting the local market. That is the BYD strategy.\u201d In recent weeks, executives at Western car companies have warned that they would be unable to match Chinese carmakers' price advantages should they enter the US. During Tesla\u2019s (TSLA) most recent earnings call, CEO Elon Musk said Chinese carmakers would \u201cpretty much demolish most other car companies in the world\u201d without trade barriers in place. Meanwhile, Stellantis CEO (STLA) Carlos Tavares likened the impending entry of Chinese companies to that of Japanese and South Korean automakers in the 1970s and 1990s. \u201cThe Chinese are the major threat right now because they are the only guys that can sell [battery-electric vehicles] at the price of ICE [vehicles],\u201d Tavares said, referring to gas-powered cars. According to Tom Narayan, lead equity analyst at RBC Capital Markets, BYD's cost advantage amounts to roughly 40%, compared to Stellantis. The vertical integration of its business has helped drive costs lower. Roughly 75% of the parts and components that go into its vehicles are manufactured in-house, allowing the company to control costs and timelines, according to Li. \u201cThe threat isn\u2019t small,\u201d Narayan said. \u201cChinese [original equipment manufacturers] have some very compelling products.\u201d On Friday, the Alliance for American Manufacturing released a report warning about \u201cChina\u2019s existential threat to America\u2019s auto industry.\u201d The report characterized Chinese investments in Mexico as \u201can effort to gain backdoor access to American consumers by circumventing existing policies that are keeping China\u2019s autos out of the U.S. market.\u201d \u201cI think they are a little bit [overreacting],\u201d BYD's Li said. \u201cA little bit too scared about Chinese competition. I never believe that trade protection will help any company.\u201d Regardless, Congress and the White House are monitoring Chinese investments. Representatives Mike Gallagher and Raja Krishnamoorthi have called on US Trade Representative Katherine Tai to raise existing tariffs on Chinese car imports while Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen visited Mexico in December to discuss ways to strengthen cooperation on screening of foreign investments in North America. Founded in 1995 as a battery manufacturer for cellphones and other consumer electronics devices, BYD has undergone rapid expansion since 2019, growing from 500,000 deliveries to more than 3 million in 2023. Government subsidies and tax breaks in China have also played a key role in BYD's expansion. The US has looked to counter that through President Biden's landmark climate and energy law, which set aside billions of dollars in incentives to spur EV adoption while also aiming to bring the manufacturing of EV parts and components back to the US. But the country still trails well behind China and Europe in the transition to go all electric. New electric vehicles sales accounted for just 7.6% of the overall market, according to data from Kelley Blue Book. The EV penetration rate in China climbed to 35.7% despite a slowdown, according to data from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. \u201cThe Chinese make EVs predominantly \u2014 full electrics,\u201d Narayan said. \u201cAnd in the US, full electric penetration is slowing. ... It's not as robust as it is in Europe. ... I'm less worried about the US for the Chinese threat. More worried for Europe.\u201d Li said BYD\u2019s focus remains firmly on expanding market share outside of the US. The firm has already announced the establishment of new factories in Hungary, Thailand, and Uzbekistan. BYD exported roughly 243,000 cars out of the 3 million vehicles sold last year, with Australia, Brazil, and Israel among its biggest markets. \u201cThe Chinese market is the most competitive market,\u201d Li said. \u201cIf you are the winner in the most competitive market why [can\u2019t you win] in other [countries]? It\u2019s just a timing issue.\u201d Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance Related Quotes "
