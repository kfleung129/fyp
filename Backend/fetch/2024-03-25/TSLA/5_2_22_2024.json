    "text": "Submit \u0394 Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. A California bakery owner was left \u201chigh and dry\u201d after electric car maker Tesla placed an order for $16,000 worth of pies \u2014 only to cancel just before the delivery went out the door. Voahangy Rasetarinera, owner of The Giving Pies in San Jose, received the order on Valentine\u2019s Day for 4,000 pies from a rep at the Elon Musk-owned company, she told NBC Bay Area. The Tesla worker reportedly told the black business owner \u2014 beloved by other Silicon Valley heavyweights \u2014 that the company wanted the pies delivered the following week for an event to commemorate Black History Month. Rasetarinera sent Tesla a quote, which the company rep approved, she said. But Tesla\u2019s vendor did not send payment. The next day, Rasetarinera said she inquired with Tesla about the lack of payment. \u201cShe said, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m so sorry that vendor hadn\u2019t paid you yet, I think they\u2019re kind of new\u2019,\u201d Rasetarinera said. \u201c\u2018And I have a question for you, can we double the order?'\u201d Rasetarinera agreed, though her staff had to work around the clock to complete the job. The bakery owner said that to accommodate Tesla, she had to cancel other orders as well as buy more ingredients. After taking on the heavier workload, Rasetarinera then said she received a text message from the Tesla rep, which read: \u201cIt unfortunately sounds like we will be changing plans and will not be needing this order. Thank you so much for your support I appreciate it.\u201d Rasetarinera said that her business suffered a loss in excess of $16,000 as a result of the last-minute cancellation. \u201cThis abrupt reversal left me reeling, realizing the extent of the impact on my small business,\u201d Rasetarinera wrote on her Facebook page. \u201cI had invested time, resources, and effort based on assurances from Tesla, only to be left high and dry.\u201d When she inquired with Tesla about the cancellation, she was told the decision came from upper management. The \u201cattempt to shift blame to upper management only compounded the betrayal I felt,\u201d she said \u201cTo me, it was clear that Tesla\u2019s corporate culture prioritized convenience over accountability, disregarding the livelihoods of small business owners like myself,\u201d she wrote on her Facebook page. The Post has sought comment from Tesla. Advertisement "
