If you\u2019re building a list of the most important stocks in the market, Tesla has to be on it. Or does it? That\u2019s part of a growing debate on Wall Street, where shares of Elon Musk\u2019s electric-vehicle maker are tanking as the rest of the market rallies \u2014 and the company is warning that things may not get better for a while. An original member of the so-called Magnificent Seven tech stocks that have been driving the S&P 500 Index to new heights, traders are now wondering if Tesla\u2019s name belongs next to those other powerhouses. The storm clouds are gathering for Tesla.Credit: Reuters After doubling last year, Tesla\u2019s stock price is down 22 per cent to start 2024. Compare that to Nvidia Corp.\u2018s 46 per cent surge or Meta Platforms Inc.\u2019s 32 per cent gain since the beginning of the year and it\u2019s easy to see where the questions are coming from. Indeed, it\u2019s by far the worst performer in the Magnificent Seven Index this year. The problem for the EV-maker is six of those seven companies are benefiting from the enthusiasm surrounding burgeoning artificial intelligence technology. The group hit a record 29.5 per cent weighting in the S&P 500 last week even with Tesla\u2019s decline, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. But despite Musk\u2019s efforts to position his company as an AI investment, the reality is Tesla faces a unique set of challenges. \u201cAlthough Elon Musk would probably disagree, investors don\u2019t see Tesla as an AI play like most of the other Magnificent Seven stocks,\u201d said Matthew Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak + Co. \u201cWe have a much different backdrop for Tesla and the others in the Mag Seven \u2014 the demand trend for Tesla products is fading, while it\u2019s exploding higher for those companies that are more associated with AI.\u201d At the heart of this divide is the dimming outlook for electric vehicles. Demand is expected to slow in 2024, and perhaps beyond, raising doubts about Tesla\u2019s ability to grow at the rapid pace investors are accustomed to seeing. Roughly a third of the analysts covering Tesla recommend buying the stock, compared to an average of 85 per cent for the rest of the Magnificent Seven. Moreover, analysts have cut their average 2024 profit estimate for Tesla nearly in half over the past 12 months, while earnings expectations for the others have risen or stayed flat. \u201cThe challenge is that Tesla has become a one-product company \u2014 the Model Y, with every other initiative either not a meaningful contributor to revenue and earnings or still a bit of a science project,\u201d said Jeffrey Osborne of Cowen. \u201cBeing a one-product company and mismanaging the timing of product cycles can create periods of pain, which is what we are in now until the next generation vehicle comes out next year or in 2026.\u201d While other Magnificent Seven companies such as Nvidia are soaring this year, Tesla has struggled.Credit: AP The double trouble of slowing EV demand and shaky AI credentials make it hard for investors to swallow Tesla\u2019s sky-high valuation. Even with this year\u2019s selloff, the stock trades at over 60 times forward earnings. The second-most expensive Magnificent Seven stock is Nvidia at around 36 times forward earnings, while the rest trade between the low twenties and low thirties. \u201cDuring the year, others in the Mag Seven were able to show how AI was driving real, profitable business growth,\u201d Brian Johnson, former auto analyst with Barclays and founder of Metonic Advisors, said in an interview. \u201cTesla investors just got some random Optimus videos, Musk\u2019s admission Dojo was a moon shot and yet another full-self-driving release that may be an improvement but still a long ways from robotaxi capability.\u201d \u201cThe demand trend for Tesla products is fading, while it\u2019s exploding higher for those companies that are more associated with AI.\u201d In contrast, the rest of the mega-cap technology companies boast of diverse and stable revenue streams, which in most cases translate into slightly slower growth, but also less volatile shares. Tesla believers say the company\u2019s unique position as the only profitable, large-scale, pure-play EV maker earns it a seat in the elite club. Even though demand is expected to fall in the near-term, experts widely expect electric cars to eventually come dominate the auto industry. For anyone willing to bet on that future, Tesla is still the only real game in town, which also explains its lofty market valuation and the all-or-nothing nature of the company\u2019s stock price \u2014 soaring 50 per cent in 2021, plunging 65 per cent in 2022, and then leaping 102 per cent in 2023. \u201cI can understand traders being short-term negative on the stock,\u201d said Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management. \u201cBut long-term investors are likely more positive given that no other EV maker can profitably produce the volume of units that Tesla does, in the pure EV space.\u201d Bullish Tesla investors also point out that the company\u2019s revenue growth beyond 2024 is expected to surpass all of the Magnificent Seven other than Nvidia Corp. Its earnings are also projected to bounce back in 2025 after dropping this year, and will be climbing at a faster pace than most other mega-caps. Still, Tesla\u2019s heavy exposure to the cyclical automotive industry makes it stand out among the Magnificent Seven, particularly in light of the uncertainty around the technology of self-driving cars. Though Musk has often claimed that a future where the so-called robotaxis will be a common thing is not far off, most industry experts believe it\u2019s still years, if not decades, away. \u201cTesla is one of the riskier companies we cover because the underlying business is cyclical and the autonomy piece is binary,\u201d said Ivana Delevska, chief investment officer of Spear Invest. \u201cThey will either crack the code on autonomy or this will drag for many years before anyone has a solution.\u201d Bloomberg The Business Briefing newsletter delivers major stories, exclusive coverage and expert opinion.
