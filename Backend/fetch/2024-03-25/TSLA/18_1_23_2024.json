CEO of Ark Invest, Cathie Wood, was one of the first to bet big on Tesla back in 2018. She forecast that Tesla stock prices would skyrocket from $350 at the time to a high of $4,000 (however, her lower bet was a more modest $600). READ MORE!

Tesla\u2019s value has indeed done as she predicted \u2013 predictions that went against more modest and conservative estimates at the time. While an element of luck is necessary, the savvy CEO certainly makes a good case for investing in Tesla being a savvy financial move, per financial news outlet, Benzinga. Shares are currently trading at around $210-220 each. Wood believes that the price will skyrocket to $2,500 by 2027. Worst-case scenario they\u2019ve set at $1,400. Taking their top prediction, investing $1,000 today could return $11,625. That\u2019s a 1,062% increase on the original investment. While this is speculation, Tesla remains a \u201cfavorite stock\u201d of Wood and Ark Funds. Her reasoning is that\u00a0Tesla\u00a0is diversifying even more smartly compared to a half-decade ago \u2013 with the Tesla Cybertruck  and its surprisingly high cost just one part of the puzzle. In fact, a Chinese company has overtaken Tesla as the top EV maker globally. While Tesla sold nearly 2 million vehicles last year, this still wasn\u2019t enough to beat the best-selling EV brand, BYD. BYD stands for \u2018Build Your Dreams\u2019. In 2023, BYD sold around 3 million vehicles, while Tesla \u2018only\u2019 sold 1.8 million. BYD, an automaker that in the past was mostly focusing on its domestic market in China, is now\u00a0expanding\u00a0rapidly. In 2024, you can buy a BYD in just about any country where you can buy a Tesla.
