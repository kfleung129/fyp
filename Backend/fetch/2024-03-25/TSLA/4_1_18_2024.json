(Rendering/McMillan Pazdan Smith Architecture)  Jason Thomas\t\t\t\t\t\t//January 18, 2024// Tesla will open a regional distribution center in Fountain Inn in Greenville County in early 2024, according to a news release from the Greenville Area Development Corp. The center is believed to mark Tesla\u2019s first major investment in operations in South Carolina, the release stated. The facility will be located in Fox Hill Business Park \u2014 the Class A business and industrial park that came online in 2020 as the first major business park developed in Greenville County in well over a decade, according to the release. Fox Hill Business Park, located on 172 acres in the city of Fountain Inn, is being developed by The Sudler Cos., a family- and veteran-owned and operated development firm based in Chatham, N.J., according to the release. The Tesla facility in Greenville County will mark the second such venture between Tesla and The Sudler Cos. in 2023, the duo having announced a similar project near Tampa in 2023. \u201cTesla\u2019s commitment to Fox Hill Business Park in Greenville County is a testament to the continued strength of our company\u2019s partnership with Tesla and to the indisputable drivers that make the park and the Upstate a force in the logistics world,\u201d said Brian Sudler, principal with The Sudler Cos., in the release. \u201cAccess to world-class labor, a friendly business environment, quality of life and proximity to more than 90 million people within one day\u2019s drive combine to make Greenville County the vital and dynamic area it is known to be.\u201d Related content: Sitework at Scout plant in Blythewood resumes after delay Related content: Electric vehicle battery manufacturer announces $810M expansion in Florence Related content: Work begins on $700M BMW Manufacturing battery plant in Woodruff Tesla\u2019s work in Greenville will focus strictly on distribution of vehicle parts regionally and will not include manufacturing, officials report, the release stated. Tesla will absorb all of Fox Hill\u2019s Building 3, comprised of 251,100 square feet. Depending on final development strategies, the Fox Hill Business Park campus can accommodate up to 2.5 million square feet of manufacturing, distribution, and warehousing activity across multiple buildings. Total investment and planned job additions by Tesla have not been made public. Late in 2023, Tesla posted a hiring notice for a training leader to support and train employees at the new facility in Greenville County. A company focused on accelerating the world\u2019s transition to sustainable energy, Tesla is committed to building a world powered by solar energy, running on batteries, and transported by electric vehicles that charge with clean energy, the release stated. Tesla operates six vertically integrated factories across three continents and employs over 100,000 employees who design, build, sell and service Tesla products in-house. The Tesla announcement is the latest major announcement for Fox Hill, which also saw the recent addition of Sage Parts Plus, a global leader in replacement parts for aviation ground support equipment, according to the release. Sage Parts opened new distribution operations in Fox Hill Business Park in mid-2023, leasing a 103,049-square-foot building to accommodate distribution operations along with its new global headquarters that houses its leadership team, purchasing, finance, customer service, HR, product management and other support departments. The Sudler Cos. are a vertically integrated development firm that includes construction and property management departments and owns and manages over 12 million square feet of commercial real estate across America, according to the release. \u201cThe addition of the Tesla brand to Greenville\u2019s business ecosystem is another example of the important role that speculative development plays in today\u2019s competitive environment, and exactly why Greenville County was so supportive of The Sudler Companies and Fox Hill Business Park,\u201d said Kevin Landmesser, interim CEO of the Greenville Area Development Corp. \u201cOur market is extremely strong thanks to quality investment by organizations like The Sudler Companies, and we will continue to support site development to attract more high-quality companies to Greenville County.\u201d Share this!
