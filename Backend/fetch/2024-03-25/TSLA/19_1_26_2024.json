Musk said growth would be \u201cnotably lower\u201d as Tesla focuses on a cheaper, next-generation electric vehicle to be made at its Texas factory in the second half of 2025, which is expected to spark the next boom in deliveries. But his remarks fell flat with investors, with Tesla set to lose about $70 billion in market value, if losses hold. That would push its market capitalization loss for the month to about $200 billion. \u201cThe Tesla headlines have essentially gone from bad to worse,\u201d said TD Cowen analysts, noting that the fourth-quarter revenue and profit were also below expectations.Shares of other EV makers also fell, with Rivian Automotive Inc (RIVN.O), Lucid Group (LCID.O), and Fisker (FSR.N), down between 4.7 per cent and 8.8 per cent. The EV industry has been grappling with a slowdown in demand for more than a year and the price cuts by Tesla will likely worsen the pressure on the startups and automakers such as Ford (F.N). \u201cThe problem for Tesla is any significant attempt to boost sales from here on will probably need to be achieved at the cost of further falls in operating margin, due to having to compete with BYD in China, as well as increased competition elsewhere,\u201d said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets. At least, nine brokerages downgraded the stock, while seven raised their ratings. The company, on average, has a \u201chold\u201d rating with a median price target of $225, nearly 9 per cent higher than the share\u2019s last closing price. Tesla short sellers have made $3.45 billion so far this year, making it the most profitable US short trade, according to data and analytics firm Ortex. The company\u2019s stock trades at nearly 60 times its 12-month forward earnings estimates, according to LSEG data. That gives it a more premium valuation than the other \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d stocks \u2013 a group that includes Apple, Microsoft and Nvidia. Some analysts said valuation could become tough to justify if Tesla\u2019s sales growth and margin weaken further. \u201cTesla is increasingly looking like a traditional auto company,\u201d said Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi.
