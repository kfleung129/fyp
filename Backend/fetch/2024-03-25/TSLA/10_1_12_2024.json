RED BANK, NJ \u2014 Each January, Business Facilities, a leading publication for corporate site selectors, recognizes economic development organizations for their work in securing significant corporate relocation, expansion, or retention projects. The annual Business Facilities Deal of the Year Awards focus on capital investment, jobs creation, and innovation. While entries for the Business Facilities 2023 Deal of the Year awards included corporate relocation and expansion projects across a vast array of industries, it was clear 2023 was the year the electric vehicle (EV) industry supercharged its forward momentum. As evaluated by the judging panel and Business Facilities editors, three of the four 2023 Deal of the Year award winners are in the burgeoning EV sector. Economic development organizations submitted entries for projects announced or taking place between September 2022 through 2023. The Business Facilities 2023 Deal of the Year Awards are as follows: \u201cThis year\u2019s Deal of the Year winners represent billions of dollars in capital investment and thousands of jobs for the communities where these companies have chosen to establish operations or to expand on their success,\u201d said Anne Cosgrove, Business Facilities Editorial Director. \u201cThe significance of these investments will be seen for years to come. We congratulate the economic development teams that worked to bring these projects to fruition.\u201d In addition to the four Deal of the Year awards above, Business Facilities editors also select a number of projects from the pool of entries for recognition for the magazine\u2019s Impact Awards. The 2023 Platinum Deal of the Year Award\u00a0recognizes the State of North Carolina for supporting the growth of Toyota\u2019s EV manufacturing operations. This support culminated most recently in the company announcing an $8 billion investment to expand its Greensboro-Randolph megasite. This expansion in Liberty, NC will bring total investment at the Toyota Battery Manufacturing North Carolina (TBMNC) to nearly $14 billion since 2021. Slated for completion in 2025, direct job creation will total 3,000. As Toyota continues its drive toward global vehicle electrification, the company\u2019s significant investment in North Carolina over several years is testament to the strides it is making at this location. The 2023 Gold Deal of the Year Award winner is the Nevada Governor\u2019s Office of Economic Development (GOED) for its work to secure Tesla\u2019s expansion of its gigafactory in Storey County in northern Nevada. In January 2023, the company announced a capital investment of $3.6 billion to build two factories at the site: a battery cell factory with capacity to produce batteries for 1.5 million light-duty EVs annually, and Tesla\u2019s first Semi factory, a fully electric combination truck. The expansion project is expected to create 3,000 direct jobs. Since 2014, Tesla\u2019s capital investment in Nevada totals $6.2 billion with the construction and operation of the 5.4 million square foot gigafactory in Storey County. The 2023 Business Facilities\u2019 Silver Deal of Year Award recognizes the South Carolina Department of Commerce, along with Richland County, South Carolina, for successfully attracting Scout Motors to Blythewood, SC. Owned by Volkswagen AG, Scout Motors is undergoing a relaunch to market, and the company\u2019s $2 billion investment for a new manufacturing facility in South Carolina is a linchpin of that strategy. Located outside of Columbia, SC in an industrial park along I-77, the company plans to create 4,000 jobs at the site where it will build all-electric trucks and rugged SUVs. The Business Facilities Bronze Deal of the Year Award recognizes the Virginia Economic Development Partnership for its work to secure Amazon Web Services\u2019 (AWS) continued expansion of its data center campuses across the Commonwealth. In 2023, the Amazon subsidiary announced it will invest $35 billion by 2040 to build data center facilities in Virginia. Between 2011 and 2021, AWS invested nearly $52 billion in the state, with more than 8,700 employees at more than 50 data centers. With the 2023 investment announcement, AWS plans to add 1,000 jobs in the coming years. Along with Business Facilities\u2019 editors, the\u00a02023 Deal of the Year judges are John Boyd, Principal, The Boyd Company, Inc.; Linda Burns, Incentives Practice Leader, WDG Consulting; and Dana Crater, Director of Technical Assistance, International Economic Development Council (IEDC). As part of the Deal of the Year Awards, Business Facilities editors select a number of projects from the pool of entries for recognition for the magazine\u2019s Impact Awards.
