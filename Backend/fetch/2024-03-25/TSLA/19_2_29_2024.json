Even though Elon Musk's company reimbursed the shop for expenses it lost after Tesla placed an order for 2,000 mini pies to the tune of $6,000 in early February, business is still booming. Owner Voahangy Rasetarinera told FOX Business that her shop, situated off the beaten path in San Jose, typically saw 30 to 40 people a day. Now, after her issue with Tesla went public, there are upward of 200 people that are stopping by on a daily basis to show their support. \"We're not in a very busy street, so if people come it's because they want pie,\" she said.

ELON MUSK ANNOUNCES MAJOR SHAREHOLDER VOTE \"If I had that problem with another company and would not have blown up this way,\" she said. \"Tesla is associated in people's mind with Elon Musk. And you either love him or hate him\u2026 so when people saw that it was Tesla, I think it stirred strong emotions.\" The mayor of San Jose, Matt Mahan, showed up in support, as well as some Tesla employees, who came to apologize in person for the mishap stemming from Valentine's Day. On Feb. 14, Rasetarinera\u00a0got a call from the company requesting 2,000 mini pies for an event the following week. After the company had approved her quote, she sent over an invoice that same day, and her staff of five got to work. She was told that a third party vendor, City Flavor, was going to be sending her the payment. Rasetarinera\u00a0proceeded to buy the materials and started the order, which she described as very labor-intensive given that it's all made by hand. A day later, and still with no payment, Rasetarinera\u00a0got another call from the company, asking them to double the order. They apologized for the delay in the payment from the vendor and assured her that payment was not going to be an issue. FOX Business reached out to City Flavor and Tesla for comment.

She wanted the company, if anything, to reimburse her for the $2,000 she invested. When that didn't come, she turned to Facebook to tell her story, which subsequently went viral and even caught the attention of Musk. \"To fulfill the order, I had turned down other Black History Month catering inquiries, purchased supplies, and prepared for a demanding production schedule,\" she wrote. \"This abrupt reversal left me reeling, realizing the extent of the impact on my small business. I had invested time, resources, and effort based on assurances from Tesla, only to be left high and dry.\" After Musk got word of the ordeal, he posted on X that he would \"make things good with the bakery.\" \"People should always count on Tesla trying its best,\" he added. Rasetarinera said while she never spoke with Musk, she received a payment of $2,000 on Tuesday, roughly two weeks after this started.
