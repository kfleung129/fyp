Published: 13:57 09 Jan 2024 EST Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)\u00a0has reduced its range estimates for a variety of its electric vehicles in response to new US regulations on vehicle testing. The regulations are designed to make sure that listed mileage ranges accurately represent real-world performance. Tesla has had issues with this in the past, with a Reuters investigation last year finding that the company rigged the algorithm behind its dashboard range estimates to give longer range estimates. The investigation also uncovered a secret team at Tesla that suppressed driver complaints and canceled service appointments related to the issue. Tesla dropped the range estimates for its X, S, Y and 3 models, according to reports. For instance, the Model Y now has a listed range of 310 miles on Tesla\u2019s website, down from 330 miles. The most dramatic change was the Model S Plaid, a luxury sport sedan, which had its range estimate lowered from 396 miles to 359 miles, according to a comparison of Tesla\u2019s current site to an archived version. Specifically, the new regulations require tests be conducted in \u201cdefault\u201d mode, rather than more finely tuned modes that optimize efficiency or power. Tesla models have a feature called \u201cChill\u201d mode that emphasizes efficiency and range and a \u201cDrag Strip\u201d mode that focuses on acceleration. Shares of Tesla fell 2.4% Tuesday afternoon to $234.66.
