(TSLA) fell Monday morning after The Wall Street Journal on Saturday outlined the blurry personal and professional boundaries between Chief Executive (CEO) Elon Musk and the directors responsible for overseeing his work. \u201cSeveral current or former directors at Tesla and SpaceX attend parties with him, go on exotic vacations and hang out at Burning Man, the Nevada arts and music festival,\u201d according to the Journal. They also have \u201camassed shares worth hundreds of millions of dollars from their seats over the years, significantly more than what board members at other companies make for their service.\u201d The report comes just days after a Delaware court struck down Musk\u2019s 2018 compensation package, which was valued at up to $55.8 billion. \u201cThe process leading to the approval of Musk\u2019s compensation plan was deeply flawed,\u201d wrote Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick, who cited his professional and personal ties to the directors with whom he negotiated the pay package. In response, Musk said in a post on X (formerly Twitter) that Tesla would hold a shareholder vote on transferring its state of incorporation to Texas from Delaware. The company relocated its corporate headquarters to Austin, Texas, from Palo Alto, California, in 2021 after Musk criticized California\u2019s tax and regulatory environment. Adding to the bad news for Tesla investors Monday, German software giant SAP SE (SAP) will stop purchasing Tesla vehicles for its corporate fleet due to unpredictable deliveries and price swings, according to German newspaper Handelsblatt. It follows German rental company Sixt, which in December dropped Tesla from its fleet because the company\u2019s price cuts on new vehicles were devaluing its used fleet. U.S. rental company Hertz said in January that it would reduce the size of its Tesla and electric vehicle (EV) fleet due to weak demand and price instability. Tesla shares fell almost 4% to $180.80, nearly an eight-month low, in intraday trading at 12:32 p.m. ET Monday.
