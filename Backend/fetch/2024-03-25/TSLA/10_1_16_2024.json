    "text": "This is a special episode of the Electrek podcast in which we dive into Elon Musk\u2019s comments from last night requesting a 25% stake in Tesla in order to advance AI at the company, which he himself described as an AI/robotics company. The Electrek podcast is generally live every Friday at 4 PM ET, but we are making a special episode today to discuss a strange situation. If you want a primer before the podcast, you can read my article from last night: Elon Musk complains about his smaller stake in Tesla after wasting it on buying Twitter. In a new tweet, Musk seems to admit to a serious conflict of interest and possibly even a breach of fiduciary duty toward Tesla shareholders. I am uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in AI & robotics without having ~25% voting control. Enough to be influential, but not so much that I can\u2019t be overturned.Unless that is the case, I would prefer to build products outside of Tesla. You don\u2019t seem to understand\u2026 The CEO says that he prefers building AI products at his new startup rather than at Tesla unless he receives a new compensation plan that would give him control over 25% of the company\u2019s shares. Is this blackmail? Is this a conflict of interest? Join us live to discuss the situation. The episode will start recording live at 11:15 AM ET.
