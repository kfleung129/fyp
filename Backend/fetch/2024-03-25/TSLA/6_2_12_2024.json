    "text": "A U.S. agency has condemned the use of its seal in one of two anti-Tesla Super Bowl commercials from The Dawn Project, claiming that Tesla\u2019s Autopilot and Full Self-Driving (FSD) beta are dangerous and need to be boycotted. In a press release on Monday, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said that The Dawn Project could not use its seal in one of the two anti-Tesla commercials that were aired during the Super Bowl. The agency also sent a letter to the company, which is run by Green Hills Software founder and Tesla and FSD beta critic Dan O\u2019Dowd, demanding that the company stop using the seal immediately to help protect the agency\u2019s reputation as a federal regulator. \u201cContrary to Federal law, you did not obtain, and the NTSB did not grant, permission to use the NTSB Seal in your Super Bowl LVIII commercial or on any other materials,\u201d writes the agency in the letter. \u201cMoreover, your unauthorized use of the NTSB\u2019s seal spuriously implies endorsement of your company and/or message by the NTSB. Accordingly, the NTSB demands that you cease any further unsanctioned use of the NTSB Seal, and that the NTSB\u2019s Seal be immediately removed from your website and YouTube page, as well as any further airings of the offending commercial. We further request that you notify us in writing when all changes have been made.\u201d The NTSB also points to its web page dedicated to highway safety investigations of Level 2 automated vehicles for safety recommendations. The advertisement displaying the NTSB seal said that the \u201cfeds demanded that Autopilot be restricted to freeways,\u201d alleging that tragic accidents had occurred after Tesla refused this request and continued to let Autopilot be used in improper areas. Both commercials also encouraged viewers to \u201cboycott Tesla to keep your kids safe,\u201d alleging that the automaker\u2019s FSD beta would run over a child crossing the street. You can see the NTSB\u2019s full letter to The Dawn Project below, along with the screenshot included in the letter and the full anti-Tesla Super Bowl commercial in question. Credit: NTSB Credit: NTSB  Tesla sent a similar cease and desist to The Dawn Project in 2022, after one of the company\u2019s ads said that the FSD beta would \u201cmow down children.\u201d The Dawn Project also aired a Super Bowl commercial last year with similar claims, and O\u2019Dowd has been incredibly outspoken in opposition to Tesla in the past. His claims about Autopilot and the FSD beta have been debunked multiple times and Tesla warns drivers using both systems that they do not make the vehicle autonomous, adding that they \u201crequire a fully attentive driver who is ready to take immediate action at all times.\u201d Tesla FSD Licensing update from Elon Musk: \u2018We\u2019ve had some tentative conversations, but \u2018they don\u2019t believe it\u2019s real\u2019  What are your thoughts?
