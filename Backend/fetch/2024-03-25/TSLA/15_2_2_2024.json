    "text": " Now that a Delaware business court has nixed Elon Musk\u2019s almost $56 billion compensation package, the Tesla CEO is saying he wants to pick up stakes and reincorporate the EV company in Texas. Tesla is currently incorporated in Delaware, as are around two-thirds of the Fortune 500. Delaware\u2019s reputation as being the place to incorporate goes back more than a century; that means the state has a lot of experience with corporate law. It also has that specialized business court, known as the Court of Chancery, with judges who know that law inside and out. \u201cThere is very little that they haven\u2019t seen,\u201d said Charles Elson, the founder of the Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware. The state\u2019s experience with business is a business itself: Corporate taxes and fees brought Delaware about $2 billion in revenue in 2022. Other states would like to see some of that, said Tulane law professor Ann Lipton. \u201cTexas has sort of loudly announced that it wants to challenge Delaware. I think Nevada has to some extent,\u201d she said. Those states have to be attractive to a company\u2019s leadership, but also to its investors, she added. \u201cThe theory is that investors will not buy shares of your company if they are uncomfortable with the corporate law you have selected.\u201d Other states have tried to challenge Delaware before, Lipton noted \u2014\u00a0but they didn\u2019t have the same track record. There\u2019s a lot happening in the world.\u00a0 Through it all, Marketplace is here for you.
