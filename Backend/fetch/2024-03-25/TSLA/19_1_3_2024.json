BYD overtook Tesla as the world\u2019s top seller of electric vehicles (EV) at the end of last year, crowning an extraordinary rise for the Chinese carmaker. It delivered more fully electric cars than Tesla for the first time in the three-month period to December 31, and slashed the sales lead held by Elon Musk\u2019s company over the year as a whole. So how did a little-known Chinese battery maker grow so quickly to become Tesla\u2019s biggest rival? Based in the Chinese megacity of Shenzhen, BYD was founded in 1995 by Wang Chuanfu, a low-key former academic who still runs the company. Wang says the letters BYD don\u2019t stand for anything in particular. He said he chose a \u201crather strange\u201d name to set it apart from other startups. It is China\u2019s top EV producer and exports electric taxis, buses and other vehicles to the rest of the world, including Europe, South America, Southeast Asia and the Middle East. Unlike Tesla (TSLA), it also makes plug-in hybrids. Israel and Thailand currently count as BYD\u2019s major overseas markets, where the Chinese company ranks number one in EV sales. Its best-selling passenger cars are the Qin and Song models. The Qin is a compact sedan available as a plug-in hybrid or an all-electric car. The BYD Song is a series of compact crossover SUVs. Compared to Tesla, BYD is known for offering more affordable cars, which helped it attract a wider group of consumers. Its entry-level model sells in China for just over $10,000; the cheapest Tesla Model 3 costs more than $32,000. BYD\u2019s passenger cars are not yet available in the United States. But its electric buses \u2014 made in Lancaster, California \u2014 are sold in the country. Wang, an engineer, first moved to Shenzhen in the early 1990s to run a battery making business for a Beijing-based government research institute, according to his official resume in the company\u2019s filings. Government posts in China at that time were considered \u201ciron rice bowls,\u201d a popular term for a job for life. But Wang soon quit and founded BYD. The start of his entrepreneurial journey coincided with the opening of the Chinese economy to the world. China\u2019s former leader Deng Xiaoping had set up the country\u2019s first special economic zone in Shenzhen, which encouraged hundreds of manufacturing businesses to flock to the city, lured by its liberal economic policies and cheaper labor and land costs. By 1997, Wang had grown his small workshop to a medium-sized cellphone battery maker with more than 100 million yuan ($14 million) in annual sales. That year, the Asian financial crisis provided a growth opportunity as plunging battery prices pushed many competitors out of business. Wang\u2019s company was able to survive due to its cost advantage, according to the Southern Weekly newspaper. By 2003, BYD had become the world\u2019s largest producer of nickel-cadmium batteries, which were widely used in mobile phones. But Wang wanted more. Eyeing the future growth of EVs, Wang ventured into the car industry in 2003, acquiring a state-owned automaker in the city of Xi\u2019an for 269 million yuan ($38 million). While that surprise decision angered the company\u2019s strategic investors and triggered a 21% plunge in the company\u2019s Hong Kong-listed shares, as Wang later described, he  remained steadfast. \u201cI build cars because I am optimistic about the future development of electric vehicles,\u201d he said defiantly after the share price plunge, according to state-owned Beijing Business Today. Just five years later, in 2008, Wang was vindicated when he received a $230 million investment from his most famous backer, Warren Buffett, who paid about $1 per share for a stake of around 10%. That vote of confidence helped boost the company\u2019s stock by as much as 1,370% over the next year. BYD launched its first plug-in hybrid model at the end of 2008. Since then, BYD has taken off as an EV manufacturer, partly thanks to the Chinese government\u2019s support for the industry. Buffett has been gradually trimming his stake in BYD since 2022, taking some of the enormous profits he has made. According to the most recent filing by Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway, the firm held nearly 8% of BYD as of late October. Those shares are now worth 18.28 billion Hong Kong dollars ($2.3 billion). BYD has dominated the Chinese EV industry since 2015, when it surpassed its domestic and overseas rivals in the world\u2019s biggest car market. One of its key advantages against Tesla, the number two player in China, is price. Tesla\u2019s four models \u2014 the Model 3, Model Y, Model S and Model X \u2014 have price tags ranging from $40,000 to $120,000 in the United States.\u00a0In China, the cheapest Tesla model, the base Model 3, has a starting price of 229,900 yuan ($32,375). It has a range of 272 miles on a full charge and a top speed of 140 miles per hour. By contrast, the BYD Seagull has a starting price of 73,800 yuan ($10,392) in China. It has a top speed of 81 miles per hour.\u00a0The Seagull is available with two battery packs.\u00a0The smaller battery has a range of 190 miles, while the larger battery has a range of 251 miles. Both Tesla and BYD vehicles have received safety ratings from international organizations. In 2022, Tesla\u2019s Model Y and BYD\u2019s Atto 3 received a five-star Australasian New Car Assessment Program (ANCAP) rating respectively. Since 2020, BYD has been making its lithium iron phosphate battery (LFP) \u201cBlade Batteries\u201d for use\u00a0in its own cars and for sale to other auto makers, such as Toyota. The company\u00a0says\u00a0the blade-shaped battery is thinner and longer than conventional lithium iron cells, and thus can maximize the use of available space within the battery pack. It\u2019s also less likely to catch fire even when it\u2019s severely damaged, according to BYD. Tesla also reportedly uses BYD Blade Batteries for its Y cars produced in the Berlin Gigafactory, according to German media. In March 2023, Elon Musk denied a media report saying Tesla was ending cooperation with BYD on battery supply. Most stock quote data provided by BATS.
