    "text": "Electric vehicle maker Tesla, Inc.\u2019s TSLA stock fell in premarket trading on Wednesday after a Delaware Chancery Court Judge ruled to nullify CEO Elon Musk\u2019s 2018 compensation plan. The decision comes more than a year after the end of the trial, which looked into the merits of a shareholder lawsuit challenging the $55 billion compensation plan the board approved for Musk. Tesla can appeal the ruling in the Supreme Court of Delaware and eventually in the Supreme Court. The development creates uncertainty at a time when Tesla is navigating fundamental challenges. Musk has aggravated fears further by commenting on the verdict on X, a social-media platform he owns. Even as the repercussions of the \u201cfunding secured\u201d tweet in 2018 linger, the billionaire lamented the perils of being a public company. \"The parasitic load of being a public company has become extremely high,\" he said. Souring of sentiment toward big techs following some high-profile disappointments and apprehensions ahead of Wednesday\u2019s Fed decision could also be weighing down on the stock. In premarket trading, the stock fell 2.79% to $186.25, according to Benzinga Pro data. Check out more of Benzinga\u2019s Future Of Mobility coverage by\u00a0following this link.
