    "text": " Tesla is currently the weakest stock on the Nasdaq 100 this year, facing slowing growth and shrinking profits. However, David Baron, a fund manager, is betting on a significant turnaround for Elon Musk\u2019s company. Baron, managing the Baron Focused Growth Fund, is placing his confidence in Musk to navigate Tesla through these challenges. \u201cWhile he may not be growing 50% a year as the company thought,\u201d Baron said in an interview with Bloomberg, \u201cthis year in a tough environment he\u2019s still growing volume by 15% to 20% per year and making us $7,000 per car of gross profit.\u201d His optimism remains high despite Tesla\u2019s recent warning of a \u201cnotably lower\u201d growth pace this year, which led to a 12% drop in the stock. Tesla\u2019s market value has seen a significant decrease, losing about $209 billion this month. Despite this, Baron\u2019s fund, which saw a 28% growth last year, beating both the Russell 2500 Growth Index and the S&P 500, maintains strong faith in Tesla\u2019s brand and future prospects. Baron expects Tesla\u2019s stock to reach $1,200 by 2030, a 550% increase from its current level, and around $300 in about 12 months, a significant rise from Thursday\u2019s close of around $183. In 2023, Tesla delivered 1.8 million cars, marking a 38% increase from the previous year. Wall Street analysts are projecting a 17% increase in unit sales for the current year. Tesla\u2019s performance is a key component of Baron\u2019s goal to grow his fund\u2019s assets to $2 billion this year from $1.3 billion as of December 31. Baron\u2019s investment philosophy, echoing his father and Wall Street veteran Ron Baron, focuses on companies whose leaders have significant stakes and the potential to double market value in five to six years. This approach reflects a compounded growth of 15% per year. \u201cWe are OK if that capital is not generating a return for the company in the near-term, as long as we believe there is a path to generating strong returns over time,\u201d David Baron stated, emphasizing his long-term investment strategy. The fund\u2019s performance is partly attributed to its substantial holdings in Tesla and SpaceX, Musk\u2019s privately held space and satellite company, valued at more than $175 billion. David Baron projects SpaceX\u2019s valuation to rise 20% in a year, double within three years, and triple within five. However, Tesla\u2019s current market situation raises concerns among investors. Analyst Toni Sacconaghi from Sanford C. Bernstein noted, \u201cMore investors are beginning to increasingly question the company\u2019s growth narrative.\u201d He added that while Tesla bulls often cite innovation as a sustaining factor for the company\u2019s cost advantage and strong margins, \u201cthe counterargument is that the automotive industry is hyper-competitive, and carmakers have historically been unable to sustain cost advantages.\u201d Despite the challenges, Baron remains focused on companies with leaders significantly invested in their businesses and the capacity for substantial market value growth, with Tesla and Musk being central to his portfolio. \u201cHis interests are aligned with ours,\u201d Baron asserted. \u201cHe\u2019s not going to do anything stupid to change the trajectory of the companies.\u201d "
