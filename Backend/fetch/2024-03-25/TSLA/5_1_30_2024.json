Delaware Chancery Court Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick, who oversaw the bench trial that concluded in November 2022, ruled Tuesday\u00a0that Musk and the Tesla board \u201cbore the burden of proving that the compensation plan was fair, and they failed to meet their burden.\u201d The 303 million split-adjusted stock options that Musk had received as part of the package are worth $51 billion today, when calculated using Tuesday\u2019s closing price, less the modest exercise price of $23.34 a share. The case was argued in Delaware, where Tesla and many other major US corporations are incorporated. While Musk did not have an immediate comment on the decision, he did tweet Tuesday, \u201cNever incorporate your company in the state of Delaware.\u201d Attorneys for the shareholders who brought the suit had argued that the package of stock options was excessive and that the directors on Tesla\u2019s board were not truly independent and were too close to Musk to protect shareholders\u2019 interests. They also argued that the financial targets the company had to hit for Musk to qualify for each of the 12 separate blocks, or \u201ctranches,\u201d of stock were not the \u201cstretch performance goals\u201d as the company told shareholders when seeking their approval of the package. Instead, they argued the milestones were essentially the same as the company\u2019s internal growth projections that were being shared with banks and rating agencies. Attorneys for Musk and the Tesla board argued the pay package was approved by a shareholder vote. Excluding the votes owned by Musk and his brother, 73% of the shares voting in that election supported the pay package.

The company\u2019s market cap was valued at $54 billion at the time the pay package was approved. It had risen to $607 billion as of the close of trading Tuesday, a gain of more than 1,000%. The Tesla attorneys argued that Musk was a key to that rise in the company\u2019s value and that the pay package was therefore reasonable compensation. The Tesla attorneys also argued that Musk, who does not receive a cash salary or bonus, would be uncompensated if the package was thrown out. But McCormick rejected the argument that Musk would be uncompensated if the package was thrown out, writing, \u201cMusk\u2019s preexisting equity stake provided him tens of billions of dollars for his efforts.\u201d The decision can be appealed to the Delaware Supreme Court.
