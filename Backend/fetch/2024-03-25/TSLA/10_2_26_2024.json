Tesla paid a California bakery $2,000 to cover the costs of a canceled pie order after the car company\u2019s billionaire owner, Elon Musk, caught wind of the debacle and promised to \u201cmake things good.\u201d The owner of the Giving Pies \u2014 which has seen a boom in business since the ordeal made headlines last week \u2014 confirmed to the Guardian that Tesla paid the outstanding bill on Monday. The San Jose bakery originally received a request for 2,000 mini pies from Tesla before that order was doubled. But a rep with Musk\u2019s company canceled on the bakery at the last minute just as the treats were set to be shipped, the business owner previously claimed. \u201cTo me, it was clear that Tesla\u2019s corporate culture prioritized convenience over accountability, disregarding the livelihoods of small business owners like myself,\u201d owner\u00a0Voahangy Rasetarinera\u00a0said in a Facebook post last week. After Musk, the CEO of Tesla, apparently became aware of the issue through media coverage, he said he would make sure Rasetarinera got paid. \u201cJust hearing about this. Will make things good with the bakery,\u201d Musk said in an X post on Friday. \u201cPeople should always be able to count on Tesla trying its best.\u201d Rasetarinera told the Guardian by email three days later, \u201cTesla just paid the $2k that I was out of.\u201d The payment covers the cost of ingredients the company had purchased to fulfill the canceled order, KGO reported. \u201cWhen you\u2019re a big corporation, $2,000 is pocket money, it\u2019s nothing,\u201d Resetarinera told the outlet. \u201cBut for us, it\u2019s a lot.\u201d Over the weekend, hundreds of patrons lined up to order pies from the bakery in a show of support following the Giving Pies\u2019 scathing review of Tesla. \u201cOh my gosh, it\u2019s incredible,\u201d Rasetarinera told NBC Bay Area. \u201cI am blown away. I\u2019m like, \u2018I didn\u2019t do it for that.\u2019 I\u2019m so grateful. It\u2019s amazing. People are amazing.\u201d While she told the station Tesla offered her a new catering gig for a women\u2019s day celebration in March, she turned it down because of a shortage of crust following the onslaught of new orders.
