Now, investigators from the European Commission will visit Chinese EV makers as part of a probe into whether they have an unfair advantage thanks to government subsidies. In the coming weeks, the EU investigators will visit BYD, Geely, and SAIC, according to Reuters. Their visits will help determine whether the EU imposes higher tariffs to protect European carmakers. BYD recently overtook Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla as the global leader in sales of electric vehicles. Backed by Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway, the carmaker keeps its costs low partly by owning the entire supply chain of its EV batteries, significant since a battery accounts for roughly 40% of an electric vehicle\u2019s price. But as the existence of the EU\u2019s anti-subsidy investigation suggests, many worry there\u2019s more than supply-chain efficiencies behind the low prices of Chinese EVs. The visits promise to be central to the EU probe, announced in September and set to run for 13 months. \u201cTheir price is kept artificially low by huge state subsidies. This is distorting our market,\u201d European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in September of Chinese EVs. \u201cAnd as we do not accept this distortion from the inside in our market, we do not accept this from the outside.\u201d Earlier this month, Beijing, in what appeared to be a tit-for-tat move, launched an anti-dumping probe into brandy imported from the EU, sending shares of France\u2019s Remy Cointreau and Pernod Ricard tumbling. The move, which might be the first of many, appeared to be aimed at France, which has pushed for the EV investigation. An Allianz Trade report last year said that China\u2019s EV makers pose a significant threat to Europe\u2019s carmakers, particularly the \"automotive-dependent economies of Germany, Slovakia and Czech Republic.\u201d The report called for higher tariffs on Chinese EVs, estimating they could cost Europe\u2019s carmakers 7 billion euros a year in lost profits by 2030. In the EU, Chinese-made EVs typically sell for 20% less than those made in the bloc, and their share of the EV market, which has grown to 8%, could reach 15% by 2025, according to Reuters. \u201cNo one can match BYD on price. Period,\u201d Michael Dunne, CEO of Asia-focused car consultancy Dunne Insights, told the Financial Times earlier this month. \u201cBoardrooms in America, Europe, Korea, and Japan are in a state of shock.\u201d Tesla CEO Elon Musk has gone from laughing about the quality of BYD cars in 2011 to suggesting recently that Chinese companies will emerge as dominant players in the global automotive industry. In the EU, Chinese EV makers face 10% tariffs, versus 27.5% in the U.S. That\u2019s encouraged them to target Europe as their home market gets increasingly crowded, although they\u2019re also growing in Southeast Asia, Mexico, Australia, and elsewhere. Indeed, China has recently overtaken Japan as the world\u2019s largest car exporter. This month, BYD\u2019s first chartered cargo ship\u2014dubbed the BYD Explorer No. 1\u2014embarked on its maiden voyage. Capable of carrying 7,000 cars, its destination is, predictably, Europe.
