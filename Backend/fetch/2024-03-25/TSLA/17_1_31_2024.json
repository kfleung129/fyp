    "text": "Stock Analysis With its stock down 23% over the past month, it is easy to disregard Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).   However, a closer look at its sound financials might cause you to think again. Given that fundamentals usually drive long-term market outcomes, the company is worth looking at.     In this article, we decided to focus on Tesla's  ROE. Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors\u2019 money.  In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. View our latest analysis for Tesla The formula for return on equity is: Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Tesla is: 24% = US$15b \u00f7 US$64b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023). The 'return' is the yearly profit.  One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.24 in profit. So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability.  Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or \"retain\", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits.  Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics. Firstly, we acknowledge that Tesla has a significantly high ROE.   Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 14% also doesn't go unnoticed by us.   As a result, Tesla's exceptional 66% net income growth seen over the past five years, doesn't come as a surprise. As a next step, we compared Tesla's net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 24%. Earnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation.  It\u2019s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline).  Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous.    One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if Tesla is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry. Given that Tesla doesn't pay any dividend to its shareholders, we infer that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits to grow its business. In total, we are pretty happy with Tesla's performance.      Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth.       With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down.
