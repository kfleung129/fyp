    "text": "MarketBeat There\u2019s perhaps never been a divergence like it. While the tech-heavy Nasdaq index has tacked on almost 10% since the first week of January, shares of electric vehicle (EV) giant\u00a0Tesla Inc TSLA\u00a0have sunk more than 20%. And the worst part for Tesla investors is that it hasn\u2019t been just a flash in the pan, where shares opened up that far down on the back of unexpected bad news. No, instead, it\u2019s been a slow but steady drift south since last summer in what is increasingly looking like a\u00a0downtrend from 2021\u2019s high, as Tesla finds itself catching a cold as the EV winter has set in. For a stock that could seemingly do no wrong for a long time, it\u2019s an unfortunate turn of events but one that shows no company is immune from a dramatic change in its fortunes. Some of the main headwinds that CEO Elon Musk and his company have been tackling include a weak margin outlook and ongoing price cuts\u00a0amid stiff competition\u00a0from China. A\u00a0weak earnings report\u00a0from last month spooked investors, and there\u2019s a good bit of work to be done in order to restore investor confidence. Considering the upside potential But for those of us on the sidelines, you have to be wondering at what point Tesla becomes\u00a0too cheap to ignore. Already, we\u2019re seeing some of the heavyweight names in the tech space come to its defense, with the likes of ARK\u2019s Cathie Woods acknowledging that it\u2019s having a bad time right now but also saying we\u2019re close to seeing the low in its cycle. For Woods, there are just too many tailwinds and\u00a0key industry catalysts\u00a0waiting around the corner for Tesla to remain unwanted. She mentioned autonomous taxi networks as an example of a new industry just waiting to take off in the coming years and one that Tesla is positioned well to capitalize on. There\u2019s every reason to think we\u2019ll see a strong bounce in their margin performance as the company reaccelerates into growth mode. Wedbush\u2019s Dan Ives has also come to Tesla\u2019s defense in recent weeks. In particular, he pushed back hard on the bears who are going around acting as if the EV evolution is dead and over, writing in a note to clients that \u201cwe could not disagree more with the ultra negative Tesla narrative building and forming a black cloud over the stock.\u201d Like Woods, he\u2019s not expecting an immediate turnaround, with some industry-wide headwinds still to be navigated, but in the long term, you nearly couldn\u2019t pick a better stock. By the end of the decade, Wedbush expects somewhere around 20% of all cars to be EVs, with autonomous driving an almost basic feature for consumers at that point. Long term outlook Ives and his team reiterated their Outperform rating on Tesla shares at the end of last month and gave them\u00a0a fresh price target of $315. Considering Tesla closed at $184 on Tuesday night, that\u2019s a targeted upside of some 70%, which is not to be sniffed at. The Piper Sandler team has also come out bullish on Tesla\u2019s prospects over the long term and, just last week reiterated their own Overweight rating on the stock. For those of us considering a position, getting involved here will require an iron stomach and a desire to hold for a while. The recent bout of price cuts has damaged the company\u2019s margins beyond what many were expecting, and there\u2019s an ugly dispute emerging between Musk and the board over voting control. But for a stock that once commanded a four-digit price-to-earnings (PE) ratio, seeing it trade with a PE ratio of just 42 is almost hard to believe. With its stock back trading at 2020 levels and interest rates looking like they\u2019ve topped out, we\u2019re inclined to say these prices won\u2019t be around for much longer. If you\u2019re a believer in the EV industry, then this could be the time to start backing up the truck. Traders and investors use our platform.
