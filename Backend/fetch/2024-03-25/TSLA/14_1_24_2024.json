    "text": "A senior executive at BYD Co. has stoked the Chinese automaker\u2019s rivalry with Tesla Inc., warning Elon Musk that he\u2019ll face challenges in intelligent driving systems. BYD is \u201cvery strong now,\u201d Zhao Changjiang, the head of sales for the firm\u2019s Denza joint venture with Mercedes-Benz AG,\u00a0wrote\u00a0on Chinese social media platform Weibo on Wednesday, saying he was responding to a comment made online earlier this month. While Zhao didn\u2019t name Tesla or Musk specifically, he appeared to make reference to a post made by Musk on his X platform in early January. In his response to a discussion comparing Tesla and BYD, Musk said his company was an artificial intelligence firm, not an automaker. Tesla is an AI/robotics company that appears to many to be a car company Zhao also warned Tesla may lose market share. \u201cYou\u2019ll face serious challenges in advanced driver-assistance system and car models in 2024, such as Denza\u2019s N7 changing the landscape of the auto market and triumph over the \u2018Y\u2019 model!\u201d Zhao said, referring to Tesla\u2019s sports utility vehicle crossover, the Model Y. BYD\u2019s rapid ascent has seen it threaten Tesla\u2019s long-held title as the world\u2019s biggest EV maker. The Shenzhen-based company outsold Musk\u2019s firm for the first time ever in the fourth quarter, though hasn\u2019t yet managed to repeat the feat across a full year. Tesla, which is due to report results after the market close on Wednesday, is facing growing pressure from stalling global demand for EVs and needing to maintain margins. It slashed prices in China as competition in the world\u2019s biggest auto market continues to intensify, while doubts from investors saw more than\u00a0$94 billion\u00a0wiped from its market valuation in just the first two weeks of this year. \u00a9 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.
