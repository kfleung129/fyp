    "text": "Wall Street took a break from rally on Monday, with all three major indexes dipping slightly Written by Brian Paradza, CFA at The Motley Fool Canada In the ever-electrifying world of Canadian tech stocks, few rival the audacity of Shopify\u2019s (TSX:SHOP) ascent over the past decade. From its humble beginnings as founder Toby Lutke\u2019s snowboarding gear online store in 2006 to a $269 billion behemoth powering millions of businesses by 2021, Shopify became synonymous with e-commerce enablement. But can the $141 billion Canadian growth stock, which is recovering from a significant drawdown in 2022, keep pace with the likes of Elon Musk\u2019s US$610 billion ($805 billion) Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), and even surpass it in the next decade? Several factors are likely to propel Shopify stock\u2019s market cap growth trajectory over the next decade. Shopify is a significant player in a fast-growing global e-commerce market. A late 2023 research report by the Boston Consulting Group forecasts that e-commerce could capture 41% of global retail by 2027, up from just 18% in 2017 \u2013 to mark a decade of strong growth. Shopify is participating in this growth as it powers all sizes of merchants\u2019 businesses. Most noteworthy, Shopify is employing generative artificial intelligence (AI), the latest breakthrough technology that could significantly increase customer retention through \u201ccompelling\u201d product recommendations and cross selling. Further, the company\u2019s omnichannel dominance should propel revenue growth forward. Shopify bridges the gap between physical storefronts and e-commerce. Brick-and-mortar stores\u2019 adoption of Shopify\u2019s \u201cBuy Online, Pick Up In-Store\u201d meets the Gen Z and Gen X evolving consumer preferences. The company\u2019s platforms are increasingly more relevant in an evolving business landscape. Lastly, Shopify\u2019s subscription-based business model generates predictable recurring revenue \u2013 a valuable stock attribute in volatile markets. The company\u2019s cash flows may show less cyclicality. Bay Street analysts project a 50.8% long-term earnings growth rate for Shopify. While Tesla is still a leader in the electric vehicle (EV) industry revolution, the company\u2019s path forward is increasingly fraught with significant hurdles. Competition is intensifying. Telsa recently lost its number one position as the biggest seller of electric vehicles by volume to Chinese EV maker BYD. Traditional automakers are rapidly ramping up their EV offerings, and some have already surpassed Tesla in battery technology, cost, and range. A new wave of EV superpowers is emerging from unlikely sources \u2013 mostly Chinese. Resultantly, Tesla\u2019s market share is under attack from left, right, and centre. Secondly, potential recessions and global geopolitical scuffles could dampen consumer demand for Tesla\u2019s high-priced vehicles. Most noteworthy, Tesla\u2019s high valuation defies traditional metrics and could be vulnerable to a correction if market sentiment sours. Tesla stock fetches a price-to-sales (P/S) multiple of 6.9 while an average car manufacturer is valued at a comparable multiple of 0.7. The EV leader\u2019s premium could be attached to its high-tech innovation track record, and the \u201cElon Musk factor.\u201d However, competitor Mercedes Benz beat Tesla to a licensed Level 3 autonomous driving vehicle in 2023. And Elon Musk could still leave the company at some point. Wall Street analysts forecast a 15.6% average long-term growth rate on Tesla\u2019s earnings \u2013 a much slower rate compared to Shopify\u2019s 50.8%. This writer has no crystal ball, but here\u2019s a possible scenario: On one hand, Shopify\u2019s e-commerce advantage, industry growth, and a resilient revenue base could propel its value higher. Its AI-powered e-commerce and payments platforms should continue to gain global traction and break language barriers, solidifying SHOP\u2019s dominance in the global e-commerce space, resulting in sustained revenue, earnings and cash flow growth \u2013 and a steadily rising stock price. On the other hand, Tesla\u2019s maturing business and its recent loss of the EV crown might decelerate revenue growth and dampen investor enthusiasm. Increasing competition, geopolitical risks, and macroeconomic headwinds may put pressure on Tesla stock\u2019s valuation. Will Shopify stock\u2019s market capitalization surpass Tesla\u2019s by 2034? It\u2019s a bold claim, but not an entirely improbable one. Explosive growth in e-commerce, sustained innovation, and a recurring revenue model could propel Shopify stock to unprecedented heights over the next decade. Meanwhile, Tesla is losing its crown, and may face the headwinds of a maturing market and intensifying competition. That said, the race to the top could be a thrilling spectacle. The valuation gap between the two contenders is still wide, and Tesla will remain a moving target that can rally ahead if the EV pioneer embarks on another AI- and tech-driven innovation marathon. Both stocks are capable investments to add to a diversified growth-oriented retirement plan portfolio.
