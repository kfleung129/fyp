Current owners and lessees can reserve the complimentary NACS adapter until June 30, 2024. After that, future owners will pay $230. Countless automakers have agreed to adopt Tesla's NACS charge port, and most have pledged to offer adapters for existing CCS-type plugs. UPDATE 2/29/24: Ford today has opened orders for a NACS adapter that will allow people who own or lease an F-150 Lightning or Mustang Mach-E to access Tesla's Supercharger network in Canada and the United States. The adapter is free of charge for those who are enrolled in Ford's BlueOval Charge Network and order one by June 30, 2024. After that point, customers will have to pay $230 for the adapter, which uses Tesla's proprietary NACS outlet. Ford is just one of the many automakers that plan to start building new EVs that feature Tesla's proprietary charge port, which is known as the North American Charging Standard\u2014or NACS, for short. Like most other companies, Ford plans to make the switch starting sometime in 2025, and it has pledged to offer an adapter for some existing electric models with a CCS-style plug. While Ford isn't alone in promising an adapter, the company looks to be one of the first to deliver one to customers. Ford CEO Jim Farley today posted on his social media accounts that customers will soon be able to reserve a complimentary fast-charger adapter. That will give Ford F-150 Lightning and Mustang Mach-E owners who live in Canada and the U.S. access to Tesla's vast Supercharger network. When we announced @Ford EVs would get access to @Tesla Superchargers, I said we'd send customers a Fast Charging Adapter. I'm pleased to confirm that eligible #MustangMachE & #F150Lightning owners in the U.S. + Canada can reserve a complimentary adapter starting soon.

Farley later followed up on his original post by explaining that all current Lightning and Mach-E owners are eligible to receive an adapter and that reservations will be validated by their vehicle identification number. Of course, only one adapter will be provided for each VIN. Ford will also cover the cost of shipping. Car and Driver also reached out to Ford directly to ask whether the adapters will be standard or optional when customers buy a new electric F-150 or Mustang SUV. The response we got was that more information about that will be revealed at a later date.
