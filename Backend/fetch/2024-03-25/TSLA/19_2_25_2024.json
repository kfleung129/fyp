    "text": "BYD, the Chinese carmaker that recently overtook Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla in global sales of electric vehicles, has struck fear into legacy automakers. That\u2019s primarily because of its low production costs and inexpensive vehicles, which has the likes of Ford and Stellantis scrambling to become more competitive on price. But BYD, backed by Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway, is more versatile than many might realize. The carmaker produces not only ultra-affordable vehicles, but also models all along the price spectrum. That includes luxury models, such as those under its Yangwang brand. This weekend, BYD officially launched the Yangwang U9, a high-end electric sports car designed to rival Ferrari and Lamborghini. The vehicle\u2014priced at 1.68 million yuan ($233,450)\u2014can reach 100 km/h (62 mph) in 2.36 seconds and reach a top speed of 309.19 km/h, the company said. It can also spin in place and enter dance mode, as videos posted on social media showed. BYD officially launched its pure electric flagship sports car, the YANGWANG U9, today. Its air suspension system offers a wide range of dance modes, while the adoption of four electric motors allows it to spin in place. pic.twitter.com/IHhhTKDCSW \u2014 Yan Chang (@cyfoxcat) February 25, 2024 The car will be available only in China for now, though traders taking advantage of a loophole have been selling luxury Chinese EVs to overseas customers who view them as status symbols\u2014even in markets where they\u2019re not yet officially available. On the other end of the spectrum, BYD unveiled this week a lower-priced version of its popular Dolphin hatchback. In 2023, BYD sold 367,419 Dolphin models, up 79% from the previous year. The new version\u2019s starting price is $13,865. Of course, BYD needs to do more than produce a wide range of vehicle types to survive. It faces price wars, a saturated market, and slower EV growth within China. And as it expands internationally, the host of challenges includes trade barriers, regulatory hurdles, and customers\u2019 loyalty to legacy automakers. While it's working to establish manufacturing in places including Hungary, Thailand, and possibly Mexico\u2014which thanks to a free-trade agreement could serve as a back door to the U.S., much to the alarm of trade groups and lawmakers\u2014in doing so it might encounter labor and supply-chain challenges that are less of an issue in China. But Musk, who laughed at BYD\u2019s vehicles in 2011, admitted last year that \u201ctheir cars are highly competitive these days.\u201d And last month, he said of Chinese automakers in general, \u201cIf there are no trade barriers established, they will pretty much demolish most other car companies in the world.\u201d The late Charlie Munger\u2014Buffett\u2019s right-hand man\u2014led the decision for Berkshire to invest in BYD. He then watched the value of Berkshire\u2019s 2008 investment in the carmaker surge from $230 million to $9.5 billion 14 years later. Munger attributed much of BYD\u2019s success to founder and chairman Wang Chuanfu, whom he described as a \u201ccombination of Thomas Edison and Jack Welch,\u201d marveling that he could \u201clook at somebody\u2019s part in the morning\u2026and in the afternoon he could make it.\u201d \u201cHe is a natural engineer and a get-it-done-type production executive,\u201d Munger added, \u201cand that\u2019s a big talent to have in one place.\u201d This story was originally featured on Fortune.com Related Quotes "
