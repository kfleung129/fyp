The decision comes more than a year after the trial concluded. Disgruntled Tesla shareholders initiated the lawsuit, challenging the board\u2019s approval of Musk\u2019s substantial pay package, a majority of which comprises granted options.

A Tesla influencer suggested the federal government is the ultimate loser in the whole affair as Musk would have paid taxes on all the options.
