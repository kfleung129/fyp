Elon Musk\u2019s favorite social media playground is buzzing again; this time, it\u2019s not about meme coins, SpaceX, or cryptic tweets. Tesla\u2019s Model Y just aced its safety exams, earning the highest possible score from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS). The notoriously picky IIHS even made the tests tougher this year, but the Model Y still rolled out with that coveted \u201cTop Safety Pick+\u201d rating. Elon Musk, ever the hype man, wasted no time sharing the news on X ( the social network formerly known as Twitter). His post, \u201cTesla Model Y receives the highest possible safety rating,\u201d set off a digital fist-pumping party. Tesla Model Y receives highest possible safety rating https://t.co/6LDqVU3Qi4 Fans chimed in with praise like \u201cThis is an incredibly kick-ass car\u201d and \u201cThere\u2019s a reason the Model Y is the best-selling vehicle on earth.\u201d Safety-conscious buyers were out in force, too. \u201cMy number one priority in buying a new car was safety. That\u2019s why I went with my Model S. I have two young kids,\u201d one commenter shared. Tesla is not the only winner \u2013 Hyundai Motor Group, which includes Genesis, Hyundai, and Kia brands, has emerged as the leader in the 2024 safety awards, earning six \u201cTop Safety Pick+\u201d and ten \u201cTop Safety Pick\u201d awards, totaling 16 awards. Toyota Motor Corp., which includes Toyota and Lexus brands, is a close second with one \u201cTop Safety Pick+\u201d and \u201cTop Safety Pick\u201d award. Mazda, on the other hand, is the brand with the highest number of Top Safety Pick + awards, having earned five, in addition to one Top Safety Pick. The IIHS is doing everything correctly when it comes to safety. For 2024, they upped the safety testing protocols with tougher crash tests and stricter standards for protecting pedestrians and backseat passengers. Despite the challenge, a whopping 71 vehicles managed to grab a Top Safety Pick or Pick+ award, with 22 of those earning the elite \u2018plus\u2019 designation. Tesla\u2019s no stranger to the safety spotlight. The Model Y joins a lineup of Teslas known for their crashworthiness. Another EV, the Hyundai IONIQ 6, also snagged the top safety prize. Rivian\u2019s R1S SUV and R1T pickup truck weren\u2019t left out in the cold, each earning the \u201cTop Safety Pick\u201d award. In a press release, IIHS President David Harkey noted that the safety agency is determined to push automakers to raise the bar in vehicle safety. \u201cWe continue to raise the bar for vehicle safety with another significant update to our award criteria. This year\u2019s winners represent the pinnacle of automotive safety, demonstrating exceptional protection for both occupants and vulnerable road users,\u201d he said. The IIHS\u2019 safety evaluations now include a tougher side crash test. A heavier barrier travels at a higher speed, closer to the weight of a conventional SUV. Vehicles need an \u201cAcceptable\u201d or \u201cGood\u201d rating in the revised pedestrian front crash prevention test and the updated moderate front overlap test, which now includes a dummy in the back seat to test back seat safety, to qualify for the safety awards. If safety is your jam, the Tesla Model Y just got even sweeter. And if you\u2019re an Elon Musk fanboy, well, today\u2019s a good day to be online. "
