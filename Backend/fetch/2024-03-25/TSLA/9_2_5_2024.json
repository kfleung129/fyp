See how it could unleash 6,000% potential upside. This investment vehicle is risky but can lead to quick wealth accumulation Advertisement Key Takeaways: Source: KLYONA / Shutterstock.com Editor\u2019s note: \u201cThis Is How Elon Musk Got Rich\u201d was previously published in December 2023. It has since been updated to include the most relevant information available. Have you ever wondered how industry giants like Elon Musk and Mark Cuban built their empires? These industry leaders dominate headlines with their vast fortunes, yet the way they came into their riches might surprise you. Let\u2019s start with Musk. Most people think Musk\u2019s wealth stems from Tesla (TSLA). As the CEO of the electric vehicle (EV) company, it\u2019s no secret that TSLA has been a rocket ship for Musk\u2019s net worth, with an astonishing 3,000% stock surge over the last decade. But Musk\u2019s journey to wealth began long before his tenure as Tesla\u2019s chief executive\u2026 What\u2019s the real story behind Musk\u2019s billions? It\u2019s a tale of strategic foresight during the Dot-Com Boom, where a unique and rare investment vehicle turned into a goldmine for those who knew where to look. This isn\u2019t just a history lesson; it\u2019s a blueprint for success during technological revolutions, like the one we\u2019re witnessing with AI. While it is true that a significant portion of Musk\u2019s net worth today is indeed from Tesla stock, he did not initially accumulate his wealth from the company. Musk was not a founder of Tesla; he was one of its first major investors and eventually took on the role of CEO. Before his billionaire status through Tesla stock, Musk had already built a multi-million-dollar fortune. So, how did Elon Musk first become wealthy? Long story short, he did so through an uncommon investment that took off during the Dot-Com Boom and is now reappearing in the AI Boom. This investment vehicle allowed Elon Musk to earn $12 million in 1999 at the peak of the 1990s internet boom. It also enabled him to secure another $100 million in 2002, even during the Dot-Com Crash. Musk\u2019s initial $12 million in 1999 and a staggering $100 million in 2002 were the seeds that grew into his massive fortune today. That $100 million windfall allowed Musk to become a significant investor in Tesla in 2004, and to launch SpaceX in 2002. Today, these two companies have a combined worth of nearly $1 trillion, accounting for the majority of Musk\u2019s $240 billion net worth. And it all began with that rare investment vehicle from the late 1990s. The story of Musk\u2019s wealth is not an isolated phenomenon. Mark Cuban\u2019s journey similarly underscores the potential of strategic investments amid technological upheaval. Not many people are aware that Cuban started as a bartender in Dallas in the early 1980s. It wasn\u2019t until 1990, when he utilized this rare investment vehicle to earn a $2 million payday, that Cuban\u2019s wealth surged. After getting a taste of this fortune-making investment vehicle, Cuban craved more. In 1999, during the Dot-Com Boom (and the same year Musk made $12 million), Cuban reportedly earned a billion-dollar payday through this rare investment vehicle. Certainly, this investment vehicle comes with risks, as nothing offering the prospect of multi-million-dollar paydays is without them. Yet, it is one of the best ways to amass a fortune quickly. It\u2019s how Elon Musk and Mark Cuban became billionaires. And now, you too could potentially strike it rich. Today, as the world stands on the brink of an AI revolution, the parallels to the early days of the internet are clear \u2014 the same opportunities Musk and Cuban had could be present for those willing to take calculated risks. This investment vehicle is always available, but it becomes particularly compelling and offers life-changing profit potential about once every few decades during a major new technological boom. The last occurrence was during the Internet Boom, when Musk and Cuban capitalized on their opportunity. Could you feel the thrill of such a windfall? Today, with the AI Boom, this investment vehicle is reemerging with even greater profit potential than what was seen during the Internet Boom. Imagine the excitement of being part of a financial leap forward, the same kind that allowed Cuban to go from bartender to billionaire. Yes, there are risks, but the rewards we\u2019re talking about are life-changing. Do you have the courage to follow in the footsteps of the bold? Well, if you want in on the opportunity of a lifetime, now is the time to act. Because here\u2019s the thing about these deals: They have deadlines. They are open for a certain amount of time, and then they close, sometimes forever. And the unique investment deal I have my eyes on right now closes in just 72 hours \u2013 on Wednesday, Feb. 7, at midnight EST. So, if you want in on arguably the most exciting investment deal out there right now \u2013 the same type that first made Musk and Cuban rich \u2013 you need to act before Feb. 7.
