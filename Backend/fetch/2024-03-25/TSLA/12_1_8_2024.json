Fact Checked The Tesla Solar Roof is a first-of-its-kind alternative to solar panels installed atop your roof. Instead of panels, the roof contains glass solar tiles (among regular roofing tiles) that harness energy from the sun to power your home. While they look sleek and come with an extensive warranty, a Tesla Solar Roof costs considerably more than solar panels\u2014and may not be worth the investment for some homeowners.\nFeatured PartnerAdvertisementTHIS IS AN ADVERTISEMENT AND NOT EDITORIAL CONTENT.

Installing a 12.57 kW Tesla Solar Roof costs an average of $154,000, including roof replacements costs and two Tesla Powerwalls. This is the price before  incentives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSize (in square feet)\tNumber of Floors\tkW\tEnergy Storage\tTotal Est. Cost\n\n\n\n1,000Single story6.311 Powerwall$87,635 \n\n2,000Two-story12.572 Powerwalls$154,000 \n\n3,000Three-story18.833 Powerwalls$222,000 Tesla Solar Roofs include a combination of solar glass tiles and corrosion- and weather-resistant steel tiles. The amount of solar versus. regular tiles needed for a roof can vary depending on your energy needs, roof design and roof size, but 35% solar tiles is a good estimate. (That\u2019s three or four solar tiles for every six or seven steel tiles.) In addition, at least one Powerwall is required with a Tesla Solar Roof installation. A Tesla Powerwall battery costs  a minimum of $11,500  for a single unit, though the price per unit goes down as you add more to your order. In addition to the tiles, other roofing materials (vent covers and ridge caps) and Powerwall, your Tesla Solar Roof cost will include a Tesla Solar Inverter and the roof installation labor, which can vary depending on where you live and whether your current roof needs to be replaced. The more energy you need your Tesla Solar Roof to generate, the higher your total expense will be. Why? A home requiring more energy will require a higher ratio of glass solar tiles to non-solar steel tiles. In general, the more stories your home has, the more difficult installation can be. Expect higher labor costs associated with a taller structure. In addition, taller, larger homes typically require more energy, so you may need a larger percentage of your roof to consist of the more expensive glass solar tiles, and you may need to purchase more Tesla Powerwall batteries. The size of your roof directly impacts the cost of converting it to solar. As you\u2019d expect, larger roofs will have higher material and labor costs (and the cost to remove the existing roof may also cost more). The square footage of your home may also be an indicator of energy usage. For larger homes with more occupants, you\u2019ll need a higher ratio of solar glass tiles to regular roofing tiles. Tesla requires a Tesla Powerwall with every Solar Roof installation. The energy capacity of a single Powerwall is 13.5 kWh. Tesla will analyze your home and energy consumption to determine if you\u2019ll likely need additional Powerwalls, at an additional cost. Several factors can impact how much you spend on a Tesla Solar Roof, including: Tesla will complete an on-site assessment before finalizing your quote for a Tesla Solar Roof. During this assessment, Tesla looks for several \u201ccomplexity factors,\u201d including the mounting planes, pitch and obstructions of your roof. For instance, American Home Contractors, one of Tesla\u2019s Certified Installers, says that a traditional 6/12 roof pitch would come with typical pricing. Steeper roofs\u2014such as those with an 8/12+ pitch or a 16/12+ pitch, will be more expensive to install. Here\u2019s how roof pitch can impact average costs, before incentives:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTesla Solar Roof Installation6/12 pitch (standard)8/12 pitch (steep)16/12 pitch (very steep)\n\n\n\n1,000 square feet, 6.31 kW, 1 Powerwall$87,600$88,500$89,300 \n\n2,000 square feet, 12.57 kW, 2 Powerwalls$154,000$156,600$158,300 \n\n3,000 square feet, 18.83 kW, 3 Powerwalls$222,000$224,800$227,300 In general, the more complex\u2014and the larger\u2014your roof, the more it will cost to install a Tesla Solar Roof. Theoretically, you might not have to pay to replace your roof before installing a Tesla Solar Roof. Tesla says it will install its solar roofs on top of some single-layer roofs. In most cases, however, you\u2019ll need to have your roof removed. In all our Tesla Solar Roof cost calculations in this guide, we\u2019ve assumed the existing roof is being removed, so this cost is already built into our estimates. On average, replacing a roof costs  $11,500. The removal itself is generally $1 to $5 per square foot. You\u2019ll need to get a permit when installing a Tesla Solar Roof. The cost of a building permit varies by municipality, so check with your local codes to see what permits are required and how much they\u2019ll cost. Note:  Tesla handles the permitting process for you. Right now, the federal government is offering a 30% solar investment tax credit. This non-refundable tax credit applies to the installation of a Tesla Solar Roof. If you spend $154,000  on a new solar roof in 2023, you would qualify for a $46,200  tax credit when filing your return in 2024. You may qualify for additional rebates, tax credits and incentives through your state, city or utility district. Check out our guide to solar tax credits by state  to determine how much you can save. Note:  The federal tax credit is non-refundable. If the credit is larger than your overall tax liability, you will not receive additional cash. For instance, the latest data from the IRS (2020) shows that the average federal income tax liability was $16,615, meaning that the credit would not exceed that amount for the hypothetical household. However, households installing a Tesla Solar Roof are likely to make more than the average taxpayer\u2014and be taxed at a higher rate due to America\u2019s progressive tax system. Depending on the current infrastructure of your home, you may need to invest in additional electrical upgrades during installation. You can ask about such upgrades during the on-site assessment and determine whether you should hire a local electrician to handle the work. The cost of a Tesla Solar Roof can be quite prohibitive for the average homeowner. Much like when you purchase a Tesla EV, you have the option of applying for financing directly through Tesla. Applying for financing requires a credit check like any traditional loan, and it\u2019s only available to homeowners in the following states: Alternatively, you can seek solar financing  as you would for any other home renovation project, like through a large personal loan, a home equity loan or a home equity line of credit (HELOC).\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHIS IS AN ADVERTISEMENT AND NOT EDITORIAL CONTENT.

Consider Equipping Your Home With Solar Panels The Tesla Solar Roof installation process is straightforward, though it can take some time at each step. Tesla details the following steps on its website: On average, the whole process ranges from six to eight months. The cost of a Tesla Solar Roof is a tremendous out-of-pocket expense, but theoretically, you\u2019ll save money down the line because of reduced utility costs. So what are the benefits long-term, and are there still costs to consider? The top benefit of installing any type of solar power is your reduced reliance on electricity produced through coal and natural gas. As we continue to experience climate change, it will take moves like this\u2014from individual consumers, governments and corporations\u2014to reduce humankind\u2019s impact on the environment. Another benefit: The Tesla Solar Roof gives you energy independence. With the Tesla Powerwall battery that stores excess energy, you can effectively go off the grid\u2014and maintain power even when everyone else in your area is experiencing an outage. (Power outages are expected to be more common as climate change produces more significant weather events.) Financially speaking, the Tesla Solar Roof provides a few benefits. Like solar panels, they do reduce your utility bills, and you may also earn money toward bills through net metering, in which you sell excess energy back to the grid. In some states, you may also be eligible for solar renewable energy credits (SRECs). Finally, solar panels can increase your home\u2019s value  by more than 4%, according to a recent Zillow study. Though there\u2019s no data to support it, a Tesla Solar Roof may offer even more perceived value to prospective home buyers since they are visually more appealing. Given the high upfront cost of a Tesla Solar Roof, it\u2019s likely that many homeowners will choose to finance their installation. This could mean ongoing monthly payments for decades. In addition, Tesla recommends routinely hiring a local professional roof cleaner to maintain your Tesla Solar Roof. On average, professional roof cleaning costs  $765.\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHIS IS AN ADVERTISEMENT AND NOT EDITORIAL CONTENT.

Tesla has made significant progress in renewable energy with its Solar Roof and solar panel options. These choices provide homeowners with access to solar power, but they have differences in design, installation and usage. The Tesla Solar Roof combines solar power and roofing material with the more traditional and efficient Tesla solar panels. The Solar Roof by Tesla is built to mimic the appearance of conventional roofing materials like slate or asphalt shingles but with solar cells seamlessly integrated into the tiles. These solar cells are discreetly embedded within the roofing tiles, making them less noticeable than standard solar panels. Tesla also guarantees that the solar roof is resilient and can endure severe weather conditions like high winds, rain and hail. In addition, Tesla offers a range of styles and colors to cater to different styles, allowing homeowners to customize their roofs according to their preferences. Unlike the Solar Roof\u2019s integrated design, Tesla solar panels are more noticeable since they are mounted on top of the existing roof, featuring a sleek and low-profile design. They are generally considered a cost-effective choice, with pricing varying depending on factors like the system\u2019s size and the installation\u2019s complexity. These panels are engineered to efficiently convert sunlight into electricity, allowing customers to select the system size based on their energy requirements. Alongside solar panels, Tesla often offers Powerwall, a home battery storage solution that enables homeowners to store surplus energy for later use or during power outages. Tesla Solar Panels  are considerably more affordable than a Tesla Solar Roof. Outfitting a home with 8.16 kW Tesla Solar Panels costs $26,900  before incentives, on average. A home with a 6.31 kW Tesla Solar Roof costs $87,600  on average. That\u2019s 3.25 times as expensive. Why do Tesla Solar Roofs cost so much more? The technology is less widely adopted, the installation is more involved (it\u2019s a full roof replacement) and you must purchase at least one Tesla Powerwall. The tradeoff: Tesla Solar Roofs are much sleeker. To the untrained eye, it just looks like a typical, high-quality roof. Note:  While you can save money with Tesla Solar Panels, you can save even more money by considering other companies entirely. Some of the best solar companies  include options priced well below Tesla Solar Panels.\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHIS IS AN ADVERTISEMENT AND NOT EDITORIAL CONTENT.

To help keep your solar roof working as long as possible, be sure to keep up with maintenance and address any issues ASAP. Going solar is certainly worth it. It\u2019s great for the environment, increases the value of your home, reduces your utility bills and minimizes your reliance on the grid. But is the Tesla Solar Roof worth it? That depends on your preferences. Most people would probably prefer to save a significant chunk of change by installing solar panels instead, but if you like the sleek, unassuming look afforded by the Tesla Solar Roof (and were planning to replace your entire roof soon anyway), it could be worth the investment. Another pro of the Tesla Solar Roof: Because each glass solar tile is 72 W, it\u2019s much more customizable to your home\u2019s specific energy needs.\nBest Solar Companies By StateAlabamaAlaskaArizonaArkansasCaliforniaColoradoConnecticutDelawareFloridaGeorgiaHawaiiIdahoIllinoisIndianaIowaKansasKentuckyLouisianaMaineMarylandMassachusettsMichiganMissouriMontanaNebraskaNevadaNew HampshireNew JerseyNew MexicoNew YorkNorth CarolinaNorth DakotaOhioOregonPennsylvaniaRhode IslandSouth CarolinaSouth DakotaTennesseeTexasUtahVermontVirginiaWashingtonWest VirginiaWisconsinWyoming Best Solar Companies By State  You cannot install your own Tesla Solar Roof. When you purchase a Tesla Solar Roof through Tesla, a Tesla crew will handle the install; it\u2019s included in the price. If you live in an area where Tesla does not directly provide the service, Tesla will connect you with a Tesla Certified Installer, which purchases your roof and installs it for you. In general, solar panel systems increase the value of your home by just over 4%. While there\u2019s no specific data about the Tesla Solar Roof, it\u2019s likely that it would also boost your home\u2019s value\u2014maybe by even more since the system is sleeker and less noticeable atop your home. The actual installation of a Tesla Solar Roof takes five to seven business days on average, but the full process\u2014which includes a site visit, permit process, utility sign-off and a PTO (permission to operate from your electric utility)\u2014can take six to eight months. The Tesla Solar Roof has a 10% to 20% efficiency rating, give or take. That means that 10% to 20% of sunlight that hits the solar panel gets converted into electricity. A Tesla Solar Roof\u2019s solar glass tile has a maximum output of 72 watts. How much electricity your Tesla Solar Roof generates depends on the number of solar tiles on your roof. But because the power output of each panel is so small, it\u2019s much easier to customize a Tesla Solar Roof to your exact needs, compared to Tesla Solar Panels, where each new panel adds more than 400 W. Tesla offers a \u201cGo Off-Grid\u201d option within the mobile app that allows you to disconnect your Powerwall from the grid. This allows you to simulate your system\u2019s energy independence during power outages.
