    "text": "As\u00a0Tesla, Inc.\u2018s TSLA\u00a0core electric vehicle business\u00a0faces challenges, sell-side analysts are shifting their focus to the company\u2019s ancillary ventures. On Thursday, an analyst from RBC Capital Markets pointed out a particular segment that could potentially surpass Tesla\u2019s car business. What Happened: Following a \u201cBattery Storage Facility Tour,\u201d RBC analyst\u00a0Tom Narayan\u00a0emphasized the potential of Tesla\u2019s Megapack utility-grade battery storage business. He noted, \u201cTesla\u2019s Megapack utility-grade battery storage business could be worth substantially more than its standalone car business.\u201d Tesla envisions a need for 2 Terawatt-Hours of annual battery storage on a large scale by around 2040, according to the analyst. He estimated the battery storage industry\u2019s annual revenue at $600 billion, with Tesla\u2019s specific storage revenue projected at $90 billion, assuming a 15% market share. \u201cApplying a 15x cap goods EBITDA multiple results in a $345B EV for Tesla\u2019s Megapack business, and discounting this back to 2024 from 2040 results in a $120B valuation,\u201d he said. Despite this promising outlook for the battery storage business, Narayan reiterated that autonomy remains central to Tesla\u2019s investment case. He anticipates the launch of a new affordable model, expected to commence production in the second half of 2024 or 2025, to serve as the next catalyst for Tesla\u2019s shares. Narayan maintained an Outperform rating and a $297 price target for Tesla stock. See Also:\u00a0Everything You Need To Know About Tesla Stock Why It\u2019s Important:\u00a0Tesla\u2019s automotive sector has faced significant pressures over the past year, with subdued EV demand and consumer caution amid economic uncertainty. Aggressive price cuts by Tesla in an attempt to gain market share further complicated matters. Piper Sandler analyst\u00a0Alexander Potter\u00a0highlighted the\u00a0rising importance of battery-related revenue\u00a0for Tesla\u2019s overall profitability. He anticipates an increase in Tesla\u2019s market share in global stationary battery deployments by 2024, driven by contributions from the Megafactory in Lathrop, California. Potter projected that by the 2030s, Tesla\u2019s energy business could generate ten times the revenue expected from Cybertrucks. He suggested that over half of Tesla\u2019s net profit growth between 2023 and 2025 could stem from the sales of stationary batteries. Tesla ended Thursday\u2019s session down 0.08% at $201.88, according to Benzinga Pro data. Check out more of Benzinga\u2019s Future Of Mobility coverage by\u00a0following this link.
