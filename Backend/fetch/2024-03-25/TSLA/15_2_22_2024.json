    "text": "The Financial Express Tesla founder Elon Musk has been nominated by the Norwegian Minister of Parliament Marius Nilsen, for Nobel Prize 2024 as he explains as \u201cadamant defense of dialogue, free speech and (enabling) the possibility to express one\u2019s views, in a continuously more polarized world.\u201d MP praised Elon Musk\u2019s companies for their contribution to global connectivity and safety, while the identities of Nobel Peace Prize nominees remain undisclosed even after the award ceremony. Nilsen acknowledged the role of Musk\u2019s satellite internet constellation, Starlink, highlighting its deployment in Ukraine to aid resistance fighters in communication, coordination, and resilience against Russia\u2019s ongoing aggression. In a recent update from Elon Musk\u2019s Neuralink project, Musk announced a milestone achievement: the successful demonstration of a brain implant allowing a human patient to control a computer mouse with their thoughts. Musk described the patient\u2019s recovery as full, with no adverse effects, and highlighted ongoing efforts to expand the capabilities of the brain-computer interface beyond basic mouse control. Meanwhile, another Norwegian MP has nominated Julian Assange for the big award. Sofie Marhaug has cited his exposure to Western war crimes as a contribution to peace. Marhaug emphasized the importance of truth in preventing conflicts, noting Assange\u2019s revelations of torture and mistreatment of prisoners of war.
