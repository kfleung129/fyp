In a post on X, the Tesla CEO said the automaker would offer a $1,000 discount on the Model Y through February because people \u201cdon\u2019t love to buy cars in the middle of winter.\" \u201cThis is the essential quandary of manufacturing: factories need continuous production for efficiency, but consumer demand is seasonal,\u201d he added. Related stories The price cut applies to the Model Y rear-wheel drive and long-range versions sold in the US, which now cost\u00a0 $42,990 and $47,990 respectively, but not to the \u201cperformance\u201d variant, per Tesla\u2019s website. It's a temporary discount, however. Model Y prices will rise again on March 1. The Model Y, which Tesla first unveiled in 2019, is the company's most popular model and accounted for around one-third of all EV sales in the US last year, per data from Kelley Blue Book. Tesla has cut prices several times in the past year as EV demand slows and it attempts to fend off competitors. The latest price cut kicks off a pivotal year for the automaker. Elon Musk warned investors in last month\u2019s earnings of a sales slowdown. And the company is also preparing to ramp up production of an affordable mass-market EV codenamed \u201cRedwood.\u201d The billionaire warned Tesla workers to expect a grueling version of the firm\u2019s famed \u201cproduction hell\u201d and that they would need to sleep and live on the line to build the car. The push to make its cars cheaper comes as Tesla faces the looming threat of real competition in the form of Chinese automaker BYD. The Warren Buffett-backed company overtook Tesla as the world\u2019s top seller of electric vehicles at the start of the year, and is now eyeing expansion into Europe, one of Tesla\u2019s key markets. Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider, made outside normal working hours. Read next Jump to "
