    "text": "Countdown to Luke Lango\u2019s \u201c2nd Trillion-Dollar A.I. Trade\u201d The U.S. govt just unlocked an $8 trillion market to move in a new direction. See how it could unleash 6,000% potential upside. There's no need to ditch TSLA stock following this slide Advertisement Source: Arina P Habich / Shutterstock.com As you may know, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock was trending lower ahead of this week\u2019s quarterly earnings release. But instead of shares surging back upon the unveiling of positive surprises/\u201dless bad\u201d results, the market reacted negatively to the company\u2019s latest financials, and to updates to guidance provided by CEO Elon Musk. Still, even as shares have experienced a post-earnings sell-off, and said sell-off could morph into a continued slide in the near-term, that\u2019s not necessarily a reason to bail on this EV winner.As I\u2019ll explain below, there is a path back to higher prices, based upon more positive news/developments also recently revealed. On Jan. 24, Tesla announced earnings for the quarter ending Dec. 31, 2023. For the quarter, revenue came in at $25.1 billion, representing a 3% increase from the prior year\u2019s quarter. Non-GAAP earnings per share came in at 71 cents, down 40% year-over-year. These numbers came in slightly below sell-side forecasts, but that\u2019s not the main reason TSLA stock tanked to the tune of 12.1% the first trading day following the earnings report. Rather, this double-digit sell-off resulted from discouraging guidance from CEO Musk. As Barron\u2019s reported Jan. 25, Musk stated that vehicle volume growth \u201cmay be notably lower\u201d in 2024 compared to 2023. For reference, Tesla increased its vehicle delivery volume by 38% last year. Even as the market has expected a growth slowdown, Musk\u2019s concurring rather than assuaging of growth concerns was not what the market wanted to hear. Although there could be a silver lining (lower expectations about growth may mean Tesla feels less pressure to cut vehicle prices in order to meet delivery guidance), it\u2019s still very possible that this slowdown in demand growth is coupled with further weakness with margins/profitability. Admittedly, with TSLA stock sporting a rich forward earnings multiple (54.8). It goes without saying that the prospect of slowing growth is not a good sign. As you know, while the market may pay up for growth, it\u2019s apt to punish growth stocks that enter a slowdown period. With this in mind, I wouldn\u2019t rule out the possibility that the TSLA slide carries on. The extent of the potential share decline is uncertain. Positives such as the expected lowering of interest rates later this year could help soften the blow. Instead of making a full retreat to the stock\u2019s late 2022 multi-year low (a little over $100 per share), a move back down to $150 or $125 per share. Yet while even this price forecast suggests that the best course of action is to sell/avoid now, this may not fully be the case. Sure, if you\u2019ve yet to buy, taking your time is likely a wise move. If you currently own TSLA, however, the catalysts I hinted at above (including one connected to interest rates) should give you good reason to stay put in your positions. Similar to what played out between late 2022 and early 2023, between now and later this year, Tesla could go back to full charge once again. If interest rates do indeed start coming down, that\u2019s great news for the company, not just the stock. Lower rates could help fuel a rebound in EV demand growth. Along with his downbeat remarks about 2024, Musk also hinted that a growth re-acceleration could kick off starting in 2025. According to a Reuters exclusive, 2025 may also be the year Tesla launches its much-awaited mass market EV model. The launch of this vehicle, for now codenamed \u201cRedwood,\u201d could help the company get back into high-growth mode. With such promising potential catalysts on the horizon, when it comes to TSLA stock, hold onto existing positions, and seize any opportunity to enter/increase a position.
