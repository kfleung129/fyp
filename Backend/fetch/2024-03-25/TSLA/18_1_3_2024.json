    "text": "Shares of Tesla Inc. \n        TSLA,\n        +5.71%\n       dropped 1.4% in premarket trading Wednesday, to put them on track for a fourth straight decline. The stock had slid 5% over the past three days, as the Global X Autonomous & Electric Vehicles ETF \n        DRIV,\n        +0.45%\n       gave up 3.5% and the S&P 500 \n        SPX,\n        +0.29%\n       eased 0.8% over the same time. The losing streak for Tesla\u2019s stock, which is headed for the longest since the four-day stretch that ended Dec. 4, comes as the electric vehicle giant reported fourth-quarter deliveries that beat expectations, but was surpassed as the EV-selling leader by BYD Co. \n        BYDDY,\n        +0.67%\n1211,\n        +2.37%,\n       which is based in China. Tesla\u2019s stock has edged up 0.8% over the past three months through Tuesday, while the S&P 500 has run up 12.1%. The New York Stock Exchange on Monday said it would begin the delisting process for Fisker Inc. stock \u2014 a move the struggling electric-vehicle maker said would trigger an \u201cevent of default\u201d on some of its convertible debt due next year.
