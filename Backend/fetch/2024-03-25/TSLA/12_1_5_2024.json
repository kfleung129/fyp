The Austin-based self-driving vehicle company already has real estate in the north Austin suburb. The company submitted plans to the City of Hutto to modify the interiors of the 35,000-square-foot building back in December 2023. According to a news release from the City of Hutto, Tesla is expected to spend an estimated $1.5 million on the renovations. Construction is set to begin this month, pending formal permits. It\u2019s unclear what type of work will be done at the Hutto location, with more information becoming available once construction begins. Ashley Bailey is the director of development services for the City of Hutto, and calls the news a win for the East Williamson County area. \u201cWith the substantial technology investments continuing to come to Hutto and our neighbors, East WilCo is becoming the place to be for future-focused development,\u201d Bailey said. It\u2019s not the first time tech companies have their eyes on Hutto. The city is set to be home to a Skybox Datacenters campus, as well as the Titan MegaTech Center. Suppliers to the Samsung facility are currently being built in nearby Taylor. "
