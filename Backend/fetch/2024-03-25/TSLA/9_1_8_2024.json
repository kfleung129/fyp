    "text": "Elon Musk has grown Tesla Inc. into one of the world's most recognizable brands \u2014 and not just in the automotive space. But while Tesla has been the top dog in the U.S. electric vehicle (EV) market, BYD Auto Co. Ltd., a publicly listed Chinese multinational manufacturing company, has been making noise overseas. Chinese automaker BYD \u2014 a company that Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. owns about 6% of \u2014 beat out Tesla to become the leader in global electric car sales in the fourth quarter of 2023. Tesla and BYD were both startups. Investing in the hot startups of today could make you a very wealthy person in the future. Here are some of the top offerings of 2024. Don't Miss: Airbnb was worth $47 billion at IPO. This startup is automating the trillion-dollar hospitality market. Elon Musk reportedly bought 6,000 acres of land outside of Austin. Here\u2019s how to invest in the city\u2019s growth before he floods it with new tech workers. The fourth quarter of 2023 saw BYD surpass Tesla in global EV sales, delivering 526,409 cars compared to Tesla\u2019s 484,507. Despite Tesla\u2019s higher annual sales of 1.8 million vehicles against BYD\u2019s 1.57 million, this quarterly achievement signals a potential shift in the EV market. That's especially true if BYD someday finds itself making a dent in the U.S. market. While these two EV giants continue their battle for dominance, U.S. manufacturer Rivian Automotive Inc. continues to struggle. The company reported a 10% decrease in deliveries from the previous quarter, totaling 13,972 EVs, which fell short of expectations. There's sure to be a battle between Tesla and BYD in 2024 and beyond. However, these companies don't control their own fate. There are other factors at play, such as changes in U.S. tax credit eligibility that have already affected popular EV models including the Tesla Cybertruck All-Wheel Drive and some Tesla Model 3s. Keep a close eye on demand for EVs in 2024, as a loss of momentum could impact sales across Tesla, BYD, Rivian and other manufacturers.
