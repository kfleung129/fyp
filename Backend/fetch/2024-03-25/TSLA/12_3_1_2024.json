    "text": "Nathan Howard Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk filed a lawsuit late Thursday against the artificial intelligence research organization, OpenAI, and its CEO Sam Altman, for allegedly putting profit ahead of benefiting humanity, according to Bloomberg. In the suit filed in San Francisco, Musk reportedly said that the company's original mission of creating open-source technology that is not subject to corporate priorities has been undermined with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) being the largest investor in OpenAI. \"Mr. Musk's complaint further alleges that OpenAI's reconstituted board is ill-equipped \"by design\" to determine when artificial general intelligence has been attained, which would place all post-AGI IP outside the scope of Microsoft's IP license,\" the analysts wrote. \"Mr. Musk argues that OpenAI's new board was hand-picked by Mr. Altman and blessed by Microsoft to provide OpenAI with more flexibility for profit-driven growth and to subjectively determine when the AGI threshold has been crossed.\" Musk, who co-founded OpenAI but no longer owns a stake in the company, is said to be raising money for a competing venture called xAI.
