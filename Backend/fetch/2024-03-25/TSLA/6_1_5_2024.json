(NASDAQ: TSLA)\u00a0is considering a cost-effective solution for its planned entry-level car, specifically aimed at\u00a0the price-sensitive Indian market. The\u00a0company is mulling over the use of smaller, quick-charging batteries, a strategy already implemented in China, to significantly lower the vehicle's price. According to a report by\u00a0Mint, the feasibility of these smaller batteries depends on the accessibility of an extensive network of fast chargers. In\u00a0recent discussions with the Indian\u00a0government, Tesla executives underscored the necessity of such an infrastructure and requested support for the development of chargers and battery production.

The Model 3 comes with\u00a0a 57.5-kilowatt-hour battery, offering a\u00a0range of approximately\u00a0435km. The new strategy would\u00a0focus on smaller batteries that would need\u00a0frequent charging at public stations,\u00a0similar to refueling conventional vehicles. However, India's current charging infrastructure, with merely\u00a0about 9,300 public chargers compared\u00a0to over 138,000 in the\u00a0US, presents a considerable challenge. There's an urgent need for a broader\u00a0and faster charging network for\u00a0EV adoption in India. Some existing chargers can add\u00a0180-200km range to a Tata\u00a0Nexon EV in about an\u00a0hour; however, Tesla's\u00a0existing fast chargers and potential\u00a0new technologies promise even speedier charging times. Tesla's plans for India accelerated post\u00a0Elon Musk's\u00a0meeting with Indian\u00a0Prime Minister Narendra Modi in\u00a0June. The company is willing\u00a0to invest up to $2\u00a0billion in an Indian factory,\u00a0provided there's a reduction in\u00a0import duty rate for its\u00a0cars. Discussions with Indian authorities are ongoing\u00a0as Tesla navigates the complexities\u00a0of entering an emerging yet challenging EV market.
