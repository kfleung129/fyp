    "text": "By Tomi Kilgore Tesla tops estimates, Rivian's stock sinks as 2023 deliveries miss views and Nio's stock drops as quarterly deliveries decelerate Shares of electric-vehicle makers traded lower Tuesday, as delivery data failed to spark investor interest following a stellar 2023 for the group. The Global X Autonomous & Electric Vehicles ETF DRIV dropped 1.8%, after soaring 24.2% in 2023. The ETF underperformed the S&P 500 index SPX, which slipped 0.6% on Tuesday. Meanwhile, Tesla Inc.'s stock (TSLA) finished the day fractionally lower, after wobbling during regular trading hours. The \"former\" global EV leader said earlier that it delivered 484,507 EVs in the fourth quarter, up 19.5% from a year ago and above the FactSet consensus of 473,000. \"This was an important quarter for Tesla to show strong deliveries with clear momentum into 2024 as demand has upticked since 3Q, based on all our global checks,\" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in a note to clients. The stock saw some weakness earlier, as the data confirmed that Tesla ceded the EV delivery title to BYD Co. (BYDDY) (HK:1211), which is based in China. BYD reported on Sunday that it delivered 190,754 EVs in December, which brought the fourth-quarter total up to 526,409 EVs, or 8.6% above Tesla's total.
