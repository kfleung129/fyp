(NASDAQ:TSLA) Q4 earnings are on tap after the market close on Wednesday January 24, closing up a year in which aggressive price cuts helped the automaker top Q4 delivery estimates reach a new record and narrowly beat its 1.8 million volume target. Tesla\u2019s continued actions to improve vehicle affordability throughout the year have been detrimental to margins, as average selling price is falling quicker than production costs. We covered in the past how Tesla\u2019s lower selling prices in China are having a detrimental effect on margins, as well as assessing how low Tesla\u2019s margins could go. We reiterated after Q3 earnings that this continual decline in margins highlights a broader concern for investors in that Tesla has provided no concrete guidance on how far margins will decline. Tesla kicked off Q4 with price cuts in the U.S. for some Model 3 and Y versions after Q3 deliveries missed expectations, though it raised prices later in October for the Model Y Long Range and X Plaid AWD. Tesla also increased the price of the Model 3 and Y in China in Q4, reportedly due to rising production costs. Given these pricing trends, ASPs look set to remain pressured in Q4 while production costs may decline marginally, a combination likely to cause margins to slip again. It is imperative for the bull case that operating margins show sequential improvement in Q1 should it fall to the low 7% range in Q4. Assuming a ~10% QoQ increase in operating expenses, about in line with historical trends, Q4\u2019s operating margin is projected to be ~7.2%, for a ~40 bp sequential decline. The analysis below looks at what investors need to know moving into Q4, and equally important, a few red flags we see going into Q1 and Q2 to keep an eye on. While the promise of full autonomy and its potential value entice some investors, the core story remains margins heading into the Q4 release. Notably, margins topped in Q1 2022, and shares have returned (41.0%) since the end of that quarter. YCharts YCharts Automotive gross margin excluding regulatory credits topped in Q1 at 30.03%, before slumping to 16.33% in Q3 2023. Quarterly operating margin peaked at 19.21%, before falling to 7.6% in Q3 2023. Wall Street continues to search for a bottom in margins, which look set to decline again based on current trends in ASP and production costs per vehicle. TESLA, AUTHOR CALCULATIONS TESLA, AUTHOR CALCULATIONS Aggressive price cuts pulled ASPs below $45,000 in Q3, a level likely to stay in play as recent price hikes for certain models are unlikely to aid pricing given the pace of cuts throughout 2023. Looking forward to Q4, ASP is projected to decline (1%) to (1.5%) sequentially, impacted by recent price cuts and a slightly higher mix of retail sales in China in the quarter, at just over 35% in Q4 compared to 32% in Q3. Production costs were reported to have risen slightly in China during the quarter, resulting in a price hike, but Tesla likely enjoyed favorable tailwinds to battery pack cost optimization, as lithium prices continued to fall through the quarter. In addition, BloombergNEF estimated lithium-ion battery pack prices declined 14% YoY in 2023 to $139/kWh, with passenger BEV batteries falling to $128/kWh. Based on favorable tailwinds from raw materials prices and headwinds from reports of increased production costs, COGS is estimated to have declined between (0.5%) to (1%) sequentially. As seen in the scenario analysis below, the incremental effects to gross margin from a 0.5% change in production costs are ~42 bp compared to ~50 bp for a 0.5% change in ASP \u2013 therefore, it is critical to margins bottoming that production costs decline faster and/or further than prices, or selling prices begin to increase. AUTHOR CALCULATIONS AUTHOR CALCULATIONS Our current assumptions point to a slightly larger sequential decline for ASP, an unfavorable combination for margins. For Q4, automotive gross margin is projected at ~15.1%, excluding regulatory credits and operating leasing; including operating leasing, automotive gross margin would project to 15.71%, pointing to a ~60 bp sequential decline from Q3\u2019s 16.33%. AUTHOR CALCULATIONS AUTHOR CALCULATIONS A sequential decline in automotive margin likely spells another sequential decline for operating margins, though there is increasing evidence that operating margins might be approaching a bottom in Q4. We highlighted in late August via a competitive analysis framework that we believe Tesla\u2019s Q3 operating margins can decline to a level between Honda and VW (HMC, VWAGY), or between 7.8% to 9.6%. However, if operating margins were to reach a level closer to \u2014 or below General Motors (GM) \u2014 that could be a sign they\u2019re close to the bottom. This highlights the broader concern for investors in that Tesla has not provided any parameters nor guidance to assess how low margins may go. YCharts YCharts Q3\u2019s actual operating margin came in below that level, at 7.6%, landing between Honda\u2019s 8.5% and VW\u2019s 6.2%, while still sitting above GM\u2019s 6.8% margin. With automotive gross margin estimated at ~15.7%, company-wide gross margin is expected to hover around 17.5%, assuming a ~180 bp benefit from regulatory credits and positive impact from Energy Storage and Services. Assuming a ~10% QoQ increase in operating expenses, about in line with historical trends, Q4\u2019s operating margin is projected to be ~7.2%, for a ~40 bp sequential decline. At that level, the spread between Tesla\u2019s operating margin and GM\u2019s would be less than 40 bp, adding evidence that operating margins are approaching a bottom. Aggressive price cuts look to be easing, a tailwind for ASP inflection, while declining lithium and Li-ion battery prices would add production cost reduction, a second tailwind for margins. It is imperative for the bull case that operating margins show sequential improvement in Q1, should it fall to the low 7% range in Q4. This is crucial for earnings estimates to begin seeing upwards revisions once more, as forward earnings estimates have fallen significantly over the past six months: Q1\u2019s trajectory, from pointing to over 20% YoY growth to now suggesting a low single-digit YoY decline raises red flags for Q2\u2019s growth forecast, even after a 2100 bp revision lower. Weaker than expected margins in Q4 and/or Q1 could quickly see Q2\u2019s adjusted EPS figure revised lower for another YoY decline. The bull case would need to have concrete evidence of margins bottoming in Q4/Q1 in order to avoid multiple quarters with YoY declines for EPS. Tesla has already cut prices twice in January, by (3%) to (6%) on the Model 3 and two Model Y variants in China, followed by (4%) to (8%) cuts on Model Y variants across Europe. This raises the risk that ASPs fall much further than COGS in Q1, driving a sequential decline in margins and adding more uncertainty to when and where margins will bottom. CEO Elon Musk emphasized in Q2 that Tesla is focusing on volume growth at the detriment of margins, based on his view that unlocking full autonomy will lead to a substantial increase in the value of each vehicle and therefore for Tesla: \u201cit does make sense to sacrifice margins in favor of making more vehicles because we think in the not too distant future, they will have a dramatic valuation increase.\u201d CFO Vaibhav Taneja reiterated this in Q3, saying Tesla is \u201cfocused on reducing costs, maximizing delivery volumes, and continuing making investments in the future.\u201d Q4\u2019s production of 494,989 took FY23\u2019s total production to 1.85 million vehicles, while deliveries of 484,507 took the full year\u2019s total to 1.81 million vehicles \u2014 this represented delivery growth of 38% YoY and production growth of 35% YoY. This focus on volume growth via price cuts comes as Tesla is increasingly at risk of losing its title as the world\u2019s largest BEV manufacturer on an annual basis, after losing the title on a quarterly basis this quarter to BYD Company (BYDDF, BYDDY). BYD has extended its lead against Tesla in China, especially so in Q4, proving that it can\u2019t be ignored as a fierce competitor on the global stage. BEV sales for BYD increased 22% QoQ in Q4 to reach 526,409 vehicles, almost 9% higher than Tesla\u2019s total. BYD had nearly matched Tesla\u2019s deliveries in Q3 as both held ~18% of the global BEV market that quarter, and BYD\u2019s rapid growth allowed it to take the throne in Q4. Annually, BYD\u2019s BEV sales came in at 1.57 million, +73% YoY, putting it on track to challenge Tesla\u2019s annual volumes in 2024. Many of the FAANGs are in the final throes of very mature long-term, uptrend patterns, some of which started in 2009. Many FAANGs are either at all-time highs, or just shy of them; however, Tesla trades roughly 50% lower than its 2021 highs, which signals relative weakness compared to other FAANGs. TRADINGVIEW TRADINGVIEW It\u2019s worth noting the head and shoulders pattern that is close to confirming. This is the red count above, which implies that if Tesla breaks below $203, then the lower target will be sub-$100, as we likely press below the January 2023 lows. If Tesla is going to have any chance at a sharp uptrend, it would need to break above $264 and $280 in a vertical manner. If this happens, we can start discussing the possibility of $345 - $400. This is the green count in the chart, and it has a low probability of manifesting. The problem with this scenario is that no FAANG supports this type of move. This would be a 60% - 80% move higher in Tesla. Most FAANGs look like they have topped or have one more minor swing higher before topping. Even the strongest FAANGs are suggesting a final push higher that doesn\u2019t fit with the above green count. Meta Platforms (META), being one of the stronger FAANGs, only has room for a 4% - 10% move higher before completing a mature 5 wave pattern off the January low completes. Nvidia (NVDA), being the strongest FAANG, only has room for a 5% - 18% move, at most, before it becomes a better buy at lower levels. Therefore, neither the fundamentals, nor the technicals support this type of large move higher in Tesla, which makes the red count more likely at this time. The main story for Tesla, Inc. through 2023 and now entering 2024 has been when and where margins will find a bottom. Margins have declined significantly, as Tesla prioritized growing delivery volumes via aggressive price cuts \u2013 automotive gross margin has fallen nearly 1400 bps in six quarters, while operating margin has pulled back to the mid-7% range. The two are both projected to slip again in Q4, as price cuts are expected to offset any incremental margin benefits from lowering vehicle production costs. This rather rapid decline in margins is having a direct impact on forward earnings estimates, with Tesla now expected to report a single-digit YoY decline in fiscal Q1 and almost zero growth in fiscal Q2, compared to prior views for >20% YoY growth. Operating margins are nearing a level where we believe it will find a bottom, while more constructive pricing action through the rest of 2024 and/or continued improvements in lowering production costs will also help aid margin recovery.
