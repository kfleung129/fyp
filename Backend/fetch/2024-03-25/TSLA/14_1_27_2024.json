Own this piece of crypto history Tesla\u2019s refusal to \u201chodl\u201d Bitcoin (BTC) have resulted in a missed opportunity of over $300 million in profits. Tesla\u2019s initial foray into Bitcoin began in February 2021 with a groundbreaking $1.5 billion investment. At the time, BTC\u2019s price was around $36,000. Since the first reported BTC balance on Feb. 8, 2021, Tesla\u2019s stock price is down roughly 40% against Bitcoin, specifically: However, in a surprising turn, Tesla sold about 10% of its holdings in March 2021. Then, in the second quarter of 2022, the company sold approximately 75% of its Bitcoin reserves. As Tesla CEO Elon Musk noted, these sales intended to demonstrate Bitcoin\u2019s liquidity and to bolster Tesla\u2019s balance sheet during uncertain financial periods. Had Tesla retained its entire Bitcoin investment, the company could have seen a hypothetical profit of over $300 million, considering the current Bitcoin value of approximately $41,500. Nonetheless, the company\u2019s remaining Bitcoin holdings, estimated at around 9,720 BTC, have remained steady in recent quarters, reflecting a more conservative approach in what traders anticipate to be a bullish year for Bitcoin.

It is the cash that a company generates after spending the money required to maintain or grow its business operations. For example, in the first quarter of 2021, Tesla\u2019s sale of Bitcoin, valued at $272 million, constituted a staggering 93% of the company\u2019s free cash flows during that period. Similarly, in Q2 2022, Tesla\u2019s 73% reduction in free cash flows coincided with its Bitcoin sales.

He may not need to employ the same strategy now, however, given Tesla\u2019s increasing free cash flows throughout 2023. In Q4, 2023, for example, Tesla\u2019s free cash flow was strong at $2.1 billion, contributing to a total of $4.4 billion for the year. $TSLA Tesla Q4 FY23:\u2022 Revenue +3% Y/Y to $25.2B ($0.6B miss).\u2022 Gross margin 18% (-6pp Y/Y).\u2022 Operating margin 8% (-8pp Y/Y).\u2022 Capex +24% Y/Y to $2.3B.\u2022 Free cash flow +45% Y/Y to $2.0B.\u2022 Non-GAAP EPS $0.71 ($0.03 miss).\u2022 Deliveries +20% Y/Y to 485K.\u2022 FY24: Volume\u2026 pic.twitter.com/pnOzZkCAde Numerous analysts forecast a rise in Bitcoin\u2019s value in 2024,\u00a0attributing their optimism to the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the United States and the anticipated impact of the upcoming Bitcoin halving\u00a0event as key drivers behind their predictions.
