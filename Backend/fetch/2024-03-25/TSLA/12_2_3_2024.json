    "text": "Whisper it, but the time may have finally come for Tesla\u2019s board to nudge Elon Musk towards stepping down as CEO, experts suggest. Advocates argue that the visionary entrepreneur should relinquish day-to-day operations, allowing him to zero in on his forte\u2014innovating new products. It\u2019s an approach he\u2019s already adopted at his social media platform X, where\u00a0Linda Yaccarino\u00a0is in charge of running the company while Musk focuses on driving innovation. By doing so, he would take himself out of the firing line during a challenging juncture when Tesla\u2019s growth is\u00a0starting to falter\u00a0and its stock price has languished\u2014in part due to a flawed governance culture, for which he is responsible.

The wealth manager argues Tesla needs to find someone like Google\u2019s Eric Schmidt or Facebook\u2019s Sheryl Sandberg, who can professionally manage the company under the overarching strategic direction of Musk. Zack Kirkhorn,\u00a0described\u00a0by the\u00a0Wall Street Journal\u00a0as the \u201cexecutive who keeps Tesla rolling\u201d, might have been exactly that individual. But the highly respected finance chief abruptly departed in August with\u00a0no explanation\u00a0given. Thus far the only individual to work with him noiselessly over a long period is SpaceX president\u00a0Gwynne Shotwell. Normally the idea of replacing Musk as CEO might sound foolhardy given he is the most influential entrepreneur of his generation, someone blessed with an uncanny drive to succeed, an ability to recruit the\u00a0best talent\u00a0to his cause, and a gift for predicting what trends will shape society. But he also comes with a lot of sharp edges that make it challenging to run a publicly traded megacap like Tesla. A 200-page court opinion from a Delaware judge this week sheds light on Musk\u2019s degree of consideration for governance. The document reveals how he crafted his own $56 billion compensation package in 2018, as Tesla\u2019s directors dared not reject it. Randall Peterson, a professor at the London Business School whose research centers on CEO personalities and boardroom dynamics, told\u00a0Fortune\u00a0the ruling was a \u201cpretty damning critique\u201d of Musk\u2019s board and believes Tesla would be better off with him in a supporting role where he could devote himself to creating new products. \u201cCould they find some kind of accommodation that keeps Elon in the atmosphere but takes him out of day-to-day management of the rest of Tesla?\u201d says Peterson, who co-authored a 2022 book on\u00a0dysfunctional boards. \u201cIf they can come to that, then they\u2019re in business. If not it\u2019s a huge risk.\u201d Last year, Musk went on the record saying he did not care whether his investors lost money because he might promote unsubstantiated conspiracy theories. In November, he then told Bob Iger to \u201cgo f*** yourself\u201d after the Disney CEO pulled his advertising over concerns his brand might not be safe on X. \u201cHe\u2019s a compliance officer\u2019s nightmare because he shoots from the hip,\u201d McDonough tells\u00a0Fortune. Musk also ruffled feathers after he decided to negotiate in public over his upcoming pay package, saying he will no longer develop artificial intelligence within Tesla unless the board ensures he can gain a 25% blocking minority\u2014essentially a power to veto certain decisions of shareholders. This demand came even though Musk seamlessly moved onto the\u00a0third part\u00a0of his\u00a0Master Plan\u00a0this March without arguably accomplishing any of the four main targets laid out in the\u00a0second one. While there is some sympathy given he watched his non-profit OpenAI become a\u00a0commercial appendage\u00a0of Microsoft, the petulant attitude and unvarnished attempt to blackmail his directors only served to undermine his case. \u201cThe way he phrased it is dangerous because it\u2019s holding the board hostage,\u201d says Philippe Houchois, a veteran auto analyst with investment bank Jefferies. \u201cIf you start building something inside the company, you cannot just threaten to take it out.\u201d Contemplating a Tesla in which he is not CEO seems impossible in part because he has been the public face of Tesla for years, and the stock price has in part been juiced by his visionary leadership. But Wall Street isn\u2019t helping Musk\u2019s case any longer either. While Tesla enjoyed a stellar pandemic year, the share has dropped 20% since the start of 2021 while the Nasdaq 100 has gained 35% during the same period. Other companies like Nvidia, Microsoft and Meta have marked all-time highs in recent days, by comparison. \u201cThere have been a number of investment decisions made in the last two years that have put Tesla off track, and that is the issue for the board,\u201d says Jefferies analyst Houchois. \u201cAt what point do you decide Tesla is bigger than Musk?\u201d The entrepreneur has repeatedly claimed he\u00a0never wanted to be CEO\u00a0and hoped to step back and serve as chief product architect once the initial problems manufacturing the Model 3 were solved during the critical launch over six years ago. Tesla director James Murdoch even testified that\u00a0a successor had been identified. Now the board has a unique chance to reassert its authority, ease the burden on the 52-year-old and overhaul its acute governance shortcomings before Tesla suffers its next courtroom defeat. The chief editor of EV-friendly media website Electrek, who himself voted as Tesla shareholder in favor of Musk\u2019s $56 billion pay package, argued this was the time for the charismatic yet mercurial CEO to step down to advance his vision as a product architect. \u201cYou know who first thought of that plan?\u201d he\u00a0wrote\u00a0on Wednesday. \u201cA guy called Elon Musk.\u201d \u00a9 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.
