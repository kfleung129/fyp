    "text": "Americans have some concerns about self-driving car technology \u2014 93% of them do \u2014 according to a new survey. The idea of the self-driving car took a particularly severe hit when Tesla \n        TSLA,\n        +5.72%\n       was forced into a pair of high-profile recalls of the systems it calls Full Self-Driving and Autopilot last year. Those are the results of a new survey from Forbes Legal, which interviewed 2,000 Americans \u201cto better understand attitudes toward self-driving cars.\u201d Many automakers are researching how to build cars that drive themselves. But none offer such a system today. Manufacturers use what many consider misleading names to describe their early attempts at\u00a0autonomous\u00a0driving. Kelley Blue Book refers to these technologies as advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) because they always require the driver\u2019s active supervision. But automakers market them under names like Autopilot or Full Self-Driving (Tesla), ProPilot Assist (Nissan \n        NSANY,\n        -2.82%\n      ), and Pilot Assist (Volvo \n        VLVLY,\n        +1.25%\n      ), which may imply that the driver can just let the car drive.

It works only under specific conditions and at limited speeds. Last year, a coalition of car safety groups called for industry standards on the names to avoid confusing consumers. Just 12% of survey respondents described themselves as \u201cvery trusting\u201d of self-driving technology. Another 22% described themselves as \u201csomewhat trusting.\u201d Twenty-five percent chose \u201cvery untrusting,\u201d making that the most common response. Just 20% hadn\u2019t made up their minds. \u201cSkepticism and concern are the two leading emotions Americans feel surrounding self-driving cars, with nearly half (45%) of all consumers expressing one of these emotions,\u201d Forbes Legal says. \u201cBy contrast, just 16% of consumers are excited, and just 8% have an overall positive outlook about these vehicles.\u201d Read: Self-driving cars: Are we there yet? Here\u2019s an explainer on the types of technology and what the future holds. Tesla was forced into two high-profile recalls of its ADAS last year. Tesla markets its systems under three names. Full Self-Driving, its most advanced system, is a $12,000 option on all Tesla products. The company considers the system to be in \u201cbeta testing,\u201d like unfinished software, but has allowed tens of thousands of owners to use it on public roads if they sign waivers. Plus: Authorities reportedly probing crash between Waymo driverless car and bicyclist Last year, the federal government\u2019s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)\u00a0forced Tesla to issue a recall making changes to the software\u2019s behavior\u00a0but declined to order the company to stop public beta testing. Autopilot, a less-advanced system, is standard on every Tesla product.\u00a0NHTSA likewise forced a safety recall of Autopilot last December. Autopilot is still on the road, but the updated software prompts drivers to intervene more often and shuts off their access to it if they don\u2019t. The publicity, Forbes Legal finds, \u201cprompted significant consumer concerns, with 62% of survey respondents indicating they are not confident in Tesla\u2019s technology following the recalls.\u201d Despite negative reactions toward the current technology, almost a third of respondents said they were \u201cvery likely\u201d or \u201csomewhat likely\u201d to \u201cuse or own a self-driving car in the next five years.\u201d Twenty-nine percent said they would pay a premium to own the technology. \u201cAmong consumers who do see positives, however, most believe the biggest benefits will be enhanced mobility for the elderly and people with disabilities, as well as increased efficiency in transportation logistics,\u201d the researchers say.
