    "text": "A prominent analyst has proposed a new strategy for Tesla Inc's board of directors to enhance its operations. Over the past decade, Tesla and its CEO, Elon Musk, have faced numerous criticisms. These include claims that electric vehicles are a passing trend and that Tesla would not be able to revolutionize the automotive industry. The analyst has suggested three measures to address the current situation concerning Tesla's stock. These include the introduction of a new compensation package and the relocation of Tesla's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. Furthermore, tech analyst Dan Ives has urged Tesla Inc.\u2019s board to solidify Elon Musk's role within the company through a new compensation package. Ives emphasized the need for the board to address the ongoing compensation disagreement involving Musk. He proposed that Musk should be given a new compensation package to ensure his ongoing leadership, particularly in the fields of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Full Self-Driving (FSD) until 2030.
