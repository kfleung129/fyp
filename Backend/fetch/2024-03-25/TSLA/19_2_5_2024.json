Michelle Abner, who uses her TikTok account (@thesouthernrealtor) to highlight her realty business, The Southern Realtor, has given some video real estate to the futuristic Tesla truck she and her husband now own. One video, getting more than 2.9 million views as of Monday, shows her sitting in the truck talking about the experience of owning it and having people gawk at her. \u201cWanna know what it\u2019s like to have a Cybertruck?\u201d she begins. \u201cEverywhere you go, people want to know about this truck. It\u2019s crazy.\u201d She then congratulates controversial Tesla CEO Elon Musk, saying, \u201cYou did good, Elon. You did good.\u201d After that, she notes, \u201cWe have been stopped at stoplights already and people want to talk to us about it. The cops want to know about it. We already talked to two different cops in Burleson,\u201d referring to her hometown in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex. \u201cWe\u2019re at Lowe\u2019s right now picking up some lumber,\u201d she explains, noting, \u201cIt is a truck,\u201d before concluding the video by saying, \u201cPeople just want to know about this thing.\u201d The truck has received a lot of attention for its unconventional shape and not conforming to long-established expectations of a typical truck performance. A reviewer for Top Gear noted in a Dec. 24 article, \u201cIt appears to have been drawn by a six-year-old child who just discovered the joys of a ruler. It refuses to comply with any sort of car design convention and normal development protocols\u2014namely, you don\u2019t usually design a concept car then point at it and say \u2018I want that one\u2019 because it causes designers and engineers several years\u2019 worth of migraines, but Elon Musk did.\u201d But the reviewer also noted, \u201cI like how it looks, I really do. It\u2019s mesmerizing. It\u2019s lumpen and fridge-like from some angles, and the panels look rippled in direct sunlight and it\u2019s bloody massive, but you can\u2019t take your eyes of it, and plonked in the real world it makes you smile. Most of all I like that, on supersized US roads at least, it\u2019s just a useful car. The lockable bed cover, the dinky frunk, back seats that flip up to give you another massive six-foot long storage area, all those lovely over-priced accessories \u2026\u201d Despite its fans, others feel it\u2019s worthy of ridicule, and commenters came in to dunk on the TikTok creator. \u201cWanna know what it\u2019s like to have a cyber truck,\u201d one mocked, using Abner\u2019s own words. \u201cIt is a truck.\u201d \u201cI think people are trying to figure out why you got one,\u201d another observed. \u201cSo informative,\u201d said another sarcastically. \u201cGlad you shared your story.\u201d Others marveled over the Cybertruck\u2019s weirdness, with one pointing out, \u201cIt looks like a Roblox 3D printed car.\u201d Someone else, indicating the video did the opposite of what Abner might have intended, remarked, \u201cYou sold me on what car not to get.\u201d One commenter, though, enjoyed the discourse around it, observing, \u201cThe comments didn\u2019t disappoint.\u201d The Daily Dot has reached out to Abner via email.
