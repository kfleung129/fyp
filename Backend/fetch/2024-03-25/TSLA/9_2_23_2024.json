    "text": "SAN JOSE, Calif. (Gray News) - A small California bakery is out thousands of dollars after Tesla unexpectedly canceled a 4,000 pie order at the last minute. Voahangy Rasetarinera, who owns Giving Pies in San Jose, said the bakery got a last-minute order on Valentine\u2019s Day from Tesla, the electric car company co-owned by Elon Musk. Rasetarinera told KTVU that Tesla contacted her to make 2,000 mini pies for about $6,000, with half to be delivered on Tuesday and the other half on Thursday. According to the owner, that\u2019s short notice for the business; but she agreed. After not hearing back, she reached out again and sent the invoice multiple times to multiple people. The company apologized for the delayed payment and asked to double the order to 4,000 pies, KRON4 reported. \u201cSo I contacted my staff, and they\u2019re like \u2018Yes, we can work on Saturday, on Sunday, on Monday. We can get it done. No problem,\u2019\u201d she said. Raseterinera said she and her staff got to work. However, after submitting a new invoice, she never received the payment. The next day, the Tesla representative canceled the order, telling the owner that \u201cit, unfortunately, sounds like we will be changing plans and will not be needing this order.\u201d Frustrated and angry, she posted about her experience. In an Instagram post, she said she turned down other catering gigs and purchased supplies to prepare. Tesla saw the post and reached out. They offered to find a way to still buy pies from her by catering for other events. However, they have yet to approve the request. Copyright 2024 Gray Media Group, Inc. All rights reserved. "
