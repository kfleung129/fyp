    "text": "Electric vehicles (EVs) have gained significant traction in the market, but it wasn\u2019t always commonplace to see them wearing the badges of every top automaker. It\u2019s no secret that Tesla led the charge, dominating the EV landscape while its competitors floundered to catch up. Texas-based Tesla has a unique history as a U.S.-born automotive startup that scaled to 1.81 million vehicles delivered in 2023. The company\u2019s roots go back to 2003 when two engineers  \u2014 Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning  \u2014 joined forces to develop the Tesla Roadster. After initially participating in funding efforts for Tesla, Elon Musk joined the company in 2008 as CEO and product architect. As the company grew, so did its product offerings. Today, the company has six models under its belt, including an SUV and a truck known as the Cybertruck. More importantly, Tesla has invested millions in honing technologies, including motors, batteries, security systems, and autonomous driving capabilities. The company even has a humanoid robot in development \u2014 a move that it says will support future factory automation ambitions. Tesla has grown its American factory footprint and workforce immensely over its two decades in business. In 2010, Tesla employed fewer than 1,000 workers. Last year, its workforce reached more than 127,000 thanks largely to several factory expansions and new builds. These include gigafactories in Nevada, New York, and Texas, along with the original Tesla plant in Hawthorne, California, which has been expanded and upgraded multiple times since production began. As of 2023, Tesla continues to break company records for vehicles produced and delivered and leads the industry in EV infrastructure, boasting the most charging stations catering to U.S. drivers of any automotive OEM in the country. In December 2023, the White House endorsed Tesla\u2019s Supercharger as the industry standard. "
