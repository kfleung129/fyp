Netflix shares have gained 18.8% week-over-week after the streaming giant reported the addition of 13.1 million new subscribers in the fourth quarter and issued bullish guidance. Tesla, on the other, has seen its share price tumble 13.8% this week as the electric vehicle maker projected a slowdown in production. Intel\u2019s shares also fell more than 12% on Friday on weaker-than-expected guidance despite its fourth quarter earnings coming in ahead of estimates. Catch up on this week\u2019s biggest earnings reports: Levi\u00a0Strauss & Co has unveiled plans to cut jobs in its corporate division after reporting a fall in net income during 2023. Between 10% and 15% of the denim giant\u2019s global corporate workforce will be cut under the move, which will aim to reduce costs and simplify organisation across the business. Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC, ETR:INL) shares plunged after Thursday\u2019s closing bell as\u00a0the PC maker issued weaker-than-expected guidance for the first quarter. For 1Q, Intel expects adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.13 on revenue in the range of $12.2 billion to $13.2 billion, below Wall Street estimates of EPS of $0.35 on revenue of $14.3 billion, according to Zacks Consensus Estimate. Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA, ETR:CTP2) on Thursday reported estimate-topping fourth quarter and full year financial results sending its shares more than 4% higher. The telecommunications and media conglomerate reported 4Q revenue of $31.25 billion, ahead of estimates of $30.41 billion. Alaska Air Group (NYSE:ALK) expects its profits to take a $150 million hit from the grounding of Boeing Co (NYSE:BA, ETR:BCO)'s 737 Max 9 aircraft which was taken out of service after a January 5 incident which blew a hole in the side of an Alaska Airlines plane. The two-week grounding significantly impacted the airline which has 65 of these jets in its fleet. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) ruled on Thursday the planes could re-enter service. American Airlines Group Inc (NASDAQ:AAL, ETR:A1G) said it is projecting a 2024 profit that surpasses Wall Street expectations, benefiting from robust demand for international travel. The Texas-based carrier forecasts full-year adjusted earnings per diluted share between $2.25 and $3.25, exceeding Bloomberg consensus estimates of $2.22. Data storage company Seagate Technology PLC (NASDAQ:STX) disclosed a year-on-year decline in revenues but a marked gross margin improvement in today\u2019s second-quarter trading update. Top-line sales for the quarter totalled $1.56 billion, down 17% from last year\u2019s second quarter, but operational efficiencies propelled gross margins up from 13% to 23.3%. Humana (NYSE:HUM) shares tumbled more than 10% in early trade as the Kentucky-based health insurance firm warned its 2024 profits are expected to be impacted by higher costs associated with its Medicare Advantage offering. The company guided adjusted earnings per share (EPS) guidance of approximately $16, assuming higher Medicare Advantage costs experienced during the fourth quarter will persist throughout this year. International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM) shares moved more than 5% higher in afterhours trade after the hardware and software provider reported better-than-expected fourth quarter results and estimate-topping full-year revenue guidance. For 4Q, the company reported a 4% year-over-year increase in revenue to $17.4 billion, ahead of estimates of $17.29\u00a0billion. Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) reported 4Q financial results that fell short of expectations, causing concern among investors and highlighting challenges in the electric vehicle (EV) market. Tesla's sales figures indicate that demand for its vehicles is slowing more than anticipated, amidst increased competition from both traditional automakers and Chinese EV companies. SAP\u2019s US-listed shares gained more than 7% on Wednesday morning after the German-headquartered\u00a0software company unveiled a restructuring plan that would impact 8,000 jobs along with the release of its fourth quarter and full-year 2023 earnings. The company said the planned transformation program reflects the company\u2019s focus on the scalability of its operations and its Business AI offering. Kimberly-Clark Corporation hit the top end of its internal guidance in 2023, with net sales of $20.4 billion resulting in 5% year-on-year organic growth on a 34.4% gross margin for the maker of Kleenex and Huggies products. However, a substantial foreign exchange impact and the exit of its tissue and K-C Professional business in Brazil resulted in 1% actual growth, though this was also within internal guidance. Texas Instruments Inc (NYSE:TXN) stock was on the backfoot in Wednesday\u2019s early premarket trade, down 3.64% at $168, after the semiconductor firm gave a disappointing revenue and earnings outlook. Revenue dropped to $4.08 billion for the fourth quarter, down 13% from the same period last year, and was broadly in line with expectations. Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) shares are heading for a near-9% gain on Wednesday after the video streamer\u2019s fourth-quarter growth in subscribers and revenues exceeded expectations, with a bullish outlook for 2024. Revenue of $8.83 billion topped Wall Street analyst expectations of $8.72 billion. This year-over-year growth of 13.2% was attributed to Netflix\u2019s paid-sharing model, recent price changes, and its strong content slate. United Airlines Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:UAL) shares traded more than 6% higher as the airline\u2019s warning that its losses this quarter will be greater than expected due to the latest grounding of Boeing jets was outweighed by investor optimism over the company\u2019s prospects for the remainder of the year. The airline said that due to the Boeing problems, it now expects a loss in the range of $0.35 to $0.85 per share in its first quarter of 2024, assuming its MAX 9 planes are grounded until the end of January. 3M Co (NYSE:MMM) shares are set to open at a six-week low on Tuesday following the release of a 2024 profit outlook that fell well below forecasts. The disappointing outlook for the consumer goods manufacturer overshadowed fourth-quarter results that surpassed expectations. RTX (NYSE:RTX)\u00a0shares moved higher in pre-market trade Tuesday after the aerospace and defence\u00a0firm reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter results. The company, formerly known as Raytheon Technologies, reported a 10% jump in its 4Q revenue to $19.9 billion, above Wall Street estimates of $19.8 billion. The industry challenges faced by Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) were on display in today\u2019s full-year 2023 results presentation. The company's total operating revenue for the fourth quarter was reported at $35.1 billion, marking a 0.3% decrease year-over-year, while full-year revenue saw a sharper decline of 2.1%, totaling $134 billion. Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) Corp on Tuesday reported improved fourth-quarter earnings\u00a0on sales that were little changed, and forecast further top-line growth in 2024.

Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) (P&G) on Tuesday raised its estimate for core earnings for the year\u00a0after reporting a modest increase in sales, although second-quarter earnings were hit by an impairment charge for Gillette.
