    "text": "With Tesla\u2019s margins under pressure and an uncertain 2024 outlook, here\u2019s what we think of its stock. Tesla TSLA is set to release its fourth-quarter earnings report on Jan. 24, 2024, after the close of trading. Here\u2019s Morningstar\u2019s take on Tesla\u2019s earnings and stock. With its 3-star rating, we believe Tesla\u2019s stock is fairly valued compared with our long-term fair value estimate. Our fair value estimate is $210 per share. We use a weighted average cost of capital of just under 9%. Our equity valuation adds back nonrecourse and non-dilutive convertible debt. In the longer term, we assume Tesla will deliver around 5 million vehicles per year in 2030. This includes fleet sales, an expanding opportunity for the firm. Our forecast is well below management\u2019s aspirational goal of selling 20 million vehicles by the end of this decade. However, it is nearly 4 times the 1.31 million vehicles delivered in 2022. Our forecast assumes Tesla increases its Model 3 and Model Y deliveries, that the Cybertruck is a success, and that the company ramps up volumes over several years. We also believe Tesla will ramp up semi-truck volumes over time. Further, we forecast that Tesla will launch its sports car and eventually its affordable sedan and SUV platforms in the second half of the decade. We think the company will successfully continue to reduce its manufacturing costs on a per-vehicle basis. Combined with a shift to producing a greater proportion of higher-priced Model Y vehicles, we forecast segment gross margins will expand to roughly 30%, near the 29% level achieved in 2022, as automotive profit growth grows faster than revenue over the medium and long term. We assume revenue growth and margin expansion from autonomous software sold on a subscription basis. We also assume the successful growth of the insurance business and increased profits from the charging business result in long-term profit growth and margin expansion in the \u201cservices and other\u201d segment. Read more about Tesla\u2019s fair value estimate. We award Tesla a narrow moat, stemming from its intangible assets and cost advantage. The company\u2019s strong brand cachet as a luxury automaker commands premium pricing, while its EV manufacturing expertise lets it make vehicles more cheaply than competitors. We think Tesla\u2019s moat sources will persist, letting the firm generate excess returns on capital. We see the potential for it to outearn its cost of capital over at least the next 20 years, which is the measurement we use for a wide moat rating. However, the second 10-year period carries significant uncertainty for both Tesla and the broader automotive industry, given the rapid advancement of autonomous driving technologies, which could transform how consumers use vehicles. As such, we view a narrow moat rating, which assumes a 10-year excess return duration, as more appropriate. Read more about Tesla\u2019s moat rating. We assign Tesla a Very High Morningstar Uncertainty Rating, as we see a wide range of potential outcomes for the company. The automotive market is highly cyclical and subject to sharp demand declines based on economic conditions. As the EV market leader, Tesla is subject to growing competition from traditional automakers and new entrants. As new lower-priced EVs enter the market, Tesla may be forced to continue to cut prices, reducing its industry-leading profits. With more EV choices, consumers may view Tesla less favorably. The company is investing heavily in capacity expansions that carry the risk of delays and cost overruns. It is also investing in R&D to maintain its technological advantage and generate software-based revenue, with no guarantee these investments will bear fruit. Tesla\u2019s CEO owns a little over 20% of the company\u2019s stock and uses it as collateral for personal loans, which raises the risk of a large sale to repay debt.
