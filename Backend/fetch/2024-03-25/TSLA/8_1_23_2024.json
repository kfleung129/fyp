Published: 10:06 23 Jan 2024 EST Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s\u00a0fourth quarter earnings report due Wednesday will see investors\u2019 eyes on the company\u2019s margins and its 2024 unit guidance, analysts at Wedbush believe. In a note to clients, the analysts wrote that the electric vehicle (EV)-maker\u00a0will importantly be giving investors their first glimpse of its 2024 guidance outlook. \u201cAfter a very strong 2023 in which price cuts from Tesla were\u00a0the right poker move that enabled healthy demand in China and globally now [CEO Elon] Musk and Tesla face a key strategic decision ahead:\u00a0Keep cutting prices with a glut of EVs and competition flooding the industry or hold serve and maintain price and margin stability for 2024 through this softer EV demand storm,\u201d they wrote. \u201cWhich pricing path Tesla takes will be a foundational move for the future of Tesla over the coming years in our view.\u201d Investors will also be looking out for Tesla\u2019s view of global customer demand for its Models Y and 3 and early production and demand signs for its Cybertruck, the analysts wrote. Wall Street analysts will expect 2.1 to 2.2 million units about 20% unit growth in 2024. \u201cWe still anticipate Tesla to maintain its long-term 50% unit growth which is more procedural at this point rather than true guidance for the coming year,\u201d the Wedbush analysts wrote. The analysts noted that Tesla\u2019s 3Q earnings call left investors and bulls with many questions and few answers, which has been an overhang on the stock since late October. \u201cThe line in the sand around margins must be drawn tomorrow to give investors the hittable bogeys and targets for 2024 and then start the next phase of the Tesla growth story through this near-term period of supply glut and uncertainty for EVs,\u201d they wrote. They maintained their \u2018Outperform\u2019 rating on the company and $350 price target. Tesla shares traded hands at US$212 in early trade on Tuesday. The company will report its 4Q results on Wednesday, January 24, after the stock market closes with analysts on average expecting the company to report earnings per share of $0.74 on revenue of $25.9 billion.
