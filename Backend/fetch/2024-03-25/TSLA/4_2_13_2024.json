    "text": "Tesla CEO\u00a0Elon Musk\u00a0is still smarting from the legal fallout that\u00a0overturned his massive 2018 compensation plan, and on Monday, he expressed his frustration by urging companies to relocate out of Delaware. What Happened: Reacting to CNBC\u2019s interview with former SEC Chair Jay Clayton on the matter, Musk stated, \u201cMove your company out of Delaware before they lock the doors, as they just did with Tripadvisor.\u201d Clayton mentioned that Tesla\u2019s board is likely to appeal the decision of the Delaware Chancery Court. When asked if the ruling might prompt other companies to leave the state, Clayton pondered whether a flawed process could nullify a sound substance, assuming the original substance of the decision was sound. \u201cIf the Supreme Court of Delaware confirms the substance was sound and the process flawed, then that\u2019s acceptable,\u201d he remarked. Regarding Tesla\u2019s shareholder vote on the pay plan, Clayton noted that although it was an exceptional and disproportionate package, shareholders reaped the benefits of the significant rise in the stock price. \u201cWhere are you gonna go? Validate the decision and then find some way to post hoc compensate which is going to be anywhere close. Are you gonna say, look, terrible process? This is not a board that\u2019s functioning the way it should but on balance, the substance of the decision was right,\u201d he said.

Despite two-thirds of shareholders supporting the move, the plan was thwarted when two minority shareholders sued the company in Delaware, according to a Wall Street Journal\u00a0report. The Delaware court ruled in favor of the minority shareholders, asserting that excluding the votes of\u00a0Greg Maffei, the company\u2019s chairman, resulted in only 5.4% support for reincorporation. Maffei, holding 56% of the vote at Tripadvisor, primarily through supervoting shares, wielded significant influence. TripAdvisor\u2019s parent company, Liberty TripAdvisor Holdings LTRPA LTRPB, faced a similar dilemma. The rationale behind TripAdvisor\u2019s filing argued that relocating to Nevada would yield tax savings of $250,000 annually, reduce legal expenses, and \u201cpotentially greater protection from unmeritorious litigation for directors and officers.\u201d Unlike Delaware, known for imposing stricter standards on companies pursuing transactions favoring a controlling shareholder, Nevada reportedly provides broad protections for directors and officers in many scenarios. Musk recently transferred the incorporation of\u00a0his brain chip implant company,\u00a0Neuralink, from Delaware to Nevada.
