    "text": "SpaceX has moved its incorporation location from Delaware to Texas, according to a Texas Secretary of State filing. \u201cSpaceX has moved its state of incorporation from Delaware to Texas!\u201d SpaceX CEO Elon Musk announced on X on Feb. 14. \u201cIf your company is still incorporated in Delaware, I recommend moving to another state as soon as possible.\u201d The latest decision by Mr. Musk comes after a Delaware court voided his Tesla pay package late last month in a lawsuit filed by a Tesla shareholder. The package is worth $56 billion in stock options and is considered the world\u2019s biggest pay package for an executive. The move also follows Neuralink, one of Mr. Musk\u2019s companies, switching its registration to Nevada from Delaware. The lawsuit was filed five years ago by Richard Tornetta, a Tesla shareholder, who claimed the pay package was excessive and marred by conflicts of interest and other factors. On Jan. 30, Delaware Chancery Court Judge Kathaleen McCormick wrote in her 200-page ruling that the electric carmaker\u2019s board of directors had failed to prove \u201cthat the compensation plan was fair.\u201d Flowing the court\u2019s ruling, Mr. Musk responded to the ruling in a post on X: \u201cNever incorporate your company in the state of Delaware.\u201d Later, he added in another X, \u201cI recommend incorporating in Nevada or Texas if you prefer shareholders to decide matters.\u201d Tesla was incorporated in Delaware before Mr. Musk joined the company. Delaware is a common destination for incorporation because of its business-friendly laws and low corporate taxes. Mr. Musk then promised to move Tesla\u2019s registration from Delaware to Texas and hold a shareholder meeting to vote on the relocation. The decision came after 87 percent of X users said \u201cYes\u201d in a poll when he asked, \u201cShould Tesla change its state of incorporation to Texas, home of its physical headquarters?\u201d Reacting to the poll results, Mr. Musk wrote: \u201cThe public vote is unequivocally in favor of Texas! Tesla will move immediately to hold a shareholder vote to transfer state of incorporation to Texas.\u201d It\u2019s unclear whether Mr. Musk plans to appeal the ruling to the Delaware Supreme Court regarding his compensation package. If the ruling remains effective, he will lose stock options, but retain stakes he already owned. Before the court\u2019s ruling, Mr. Musk moved his business incorporation location out of Delaware. After completing the $44 billion buyout of Twitter in 2022, he moved its business incorporation location to Nevada and renamed it X. Following the Delaware court\u2019s ruling, Mr. Musk also moved the business incorporation site of his brain implant company Neuralink from Delaware to Nevada, according to Bloomberg. Neuralink, which has its physical headquarters in Fremont, California, officially became a Nevada company on Feb. 8, according to state records. Delaware records also list the company\u2019s legal home as Nevada. Mr. Musk said last month that Neuralink had implanted a chip in a human patient for the first time, and the \u201cinitial results show promising.\u201d Neuralink said it aims to create the world\u2019s first neural implant that will allow users to control a computer or mobile device anywhere they go using their thoughts. Mr. Musk has expressed his desire for his company to assist individuals suffering from severe spinal cord injuries and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. He believes that brain implants could potentially treat other conditions, such as obesity, autism, depression, and schizophrenia. He is also optimistic about the technology\u2019s potential to enable telepathy and web browsing. Tom Ozimek, Caden Pearson, and the Associated Press contributed to this report.
