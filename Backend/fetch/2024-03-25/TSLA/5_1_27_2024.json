    "text": "Providing stock analysis for investors of the Canadian junior markets  In a bold move on January 24, David Portnoy, the founder of Barstool Sports acquired call options ahead of Tesla\u2019s (NASDAQ: TSLA) earnings report. However, these investments have taken a hit, with Portnoy witnessing a substantial decline in the value of his options. The Barstool Sports magnate bought $220 and $240 call options for March, aligning his investments with Tesla\u2019s future performance. Unfortunately, the immediate aftermath was not favorable for Portnoy, as his $220 calls were down by a significant 70%, while the $240 calls plummeted by 75% by the next morning following the cratering of the equity post-earnings. Yesterday, David Portnoy of Barstool Sports bought $220 and $240 $TSLA calls for March before earnings.He is down 70% on his $220 calls, and down 74% on his $240 calls this morning.Tesla has hit its lowest level in eight months.You can see all his plays on Unusual Whales. https://t.co/52CnxX3d3P This downturn in Tesla\u2019s stock value is noteworthy, as the electric vehicle (EV) giant hits its lowest level in eight months. The automaker closed the week out at $183.25, down 13.64% over the last five sessions. The decline in Tesla\u2019s stock is attributed to its recent earnings report, which fell short of expectations. Analysts had anticipated a slight increase in Tesla\u2019s gross profit margins to 17.7% in Q4, but the reported figures were significantly below the high margins achieved in 2022. Investors were keen on understanding CEO Elon Musk\u2019s vision for demand, future sales growth targets, and profit margins. Despite delivering 1.81 million vehicles with 38% year-over-year growth and producing 1.85 million units in 2023, Tesla\u2019s start to 2024 has been tumultuous. Challenges such as recalls and supply chain disruptions, particularly due to the conflict in the Red Sea impacting German factories, have hindered operations. Additionally, Musk\u2019s desire for more voting control over the company, particularly in leading Tesla\u2019s AI and robotics initiatives, has sparked discussions within the industry.
