    "text": "TOP FUNDS: These Mutual Funds Beat Benchmarks Over A 10-Year Span     Tesla (TSLA) fell modestly Tuesday night as a judge voided CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion stock compensation plan. A Delaware judge voided Elon Musk's $56 billion compensation plan, siding with plaintiffs who argue that Tesla's board acted improperly in setting the pay deal. The problem wasn't the unprecedented size of the 2018 compensation plan, but improper disclosures and conflicts of interest by the Tesla board, which has never shown much independence vs. Musk. \"Musk launched a self-driving process, recalibrating the speed and direction along the way as he saw fit,\" Delaware Chancery Court Chief Judge Kathaleen McCormick wrote in her ruling. \"The process arrived at an unfair price. And through this litigation, the plaintiff requests a recall.\" On the one hand, voiding the compensation plan reduces potential dilution for shareholders. So arguably the news could be viewed as a positive for TSLA stock. The Tesla board could craft a new compensation plan for Musk in a relatively short order. Meanwhile, Musk recently called for a big jump in voting power to 25%, above and beyond the now-voided compensation plan. He threatened to move AI and robotics tech from Tesla to another company if he doesn't get that added control. Following the verdict, Musk posted on X, \"Never incorporate your company in the state of Delaware.\" Judge McCormick oversaw the Musk vs. Twitter case, which ended with the billionaire acquiring the social site for $44 billion. Tesla stock fell 3% early Wednesday. In Tuesday's trade, shares rose 0.35% to 191.59. TSLA stock hit an eight-month low of 182.63 on Jan. 25 following disappointing Tesla earnings and guidance.
