    "text": "The numbers are in, and earnings last year from Tesla and Mercedes-Benz were almost identical. The legendary German automobile maker said it earned \u20ac14.26 billion ($15.47 billion) in 2023, a decline of 1.7% from last year. Tesla, meanwhile, earned $15 billion, a 19% improvement. What\u2019s different, of course, is valuation. Heading into Thursday, Mercedes \n        MBG,\n        -0.20%\n       was valued at \u20ac71 billion, or about $78 billion. Tesla \n        TSLA,\n        +5.76%,\n       meanwhile, is valued at $617 billion, even amid a 22% stock-price decline this year. Mercedes\u2019s stock was climbing on Thursday, thanks to a new stock-buyback plan of up to \u20ac3 billion. Granted, analysts are expecting a lot more sales growth out of Tesla. Tesla\u2019s sales are seen rising 81% by 2027, compared with 11% for Mercedes, according to FactSet. Tesla also doesn\u2019t have Mercedes\u2019s problem of what to do with factories for combustion-engine cars, even as the switchover to EVs is taking a lot longer than many imagined. Mercedes-Benz CEO Ola Kaellenius said Thursday that that the German company will be able to produce combustion engines well into the next decade, according to Reuters. The EV company had been in talks with a big carmaker about a potential transaction, but that company has terminated negotiations.
