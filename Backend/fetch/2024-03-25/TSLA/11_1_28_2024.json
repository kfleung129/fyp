    "text": "Countdown to Luke Lango\u2019s \u201c2nd Trillion-Dollar A.I. Trade\u201d The U.S. govt just unlocked an $8 trillion market to move in a new direction. See how it could unleash 6,000% potential upside. Nio stock once had tremendous potential. It\u2019s not looking so good in 2024 Advertisement Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com I read two articles recently about Nio (NYSE:NIO) stock that made me wonder if it\u2019s a buy now, at its lowest point since June 2020. The first headline was, Could Nio stock rise 1,000% in 10 years? The second asked, Will Nio Be a Trillion-Dollar Stock by 2050? That\u2019s pretty heady stuff. I definitely wouldn\u2019t want to miss out on such massive profits. Based on its current share price of $6.07, were the first headline to come true, that would be a 25.9% compound annual growth rate. If I invested $1,000, that would be $10,000 in a decade from now, a true 10-bagger. If the second headline were to happen, the present value calculator suggests Nio would need a market capitalization of $84 billion today to reach the $1 trillion mark. It\u2019s currently $10 billion. With BYD (OTCMKTS:BYDDY) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) controlling 36% of China\u2019s battery-electric vehicle market as of September 2023 it seemed they\u2019re the better bet. Nio\u2019s share of the BEV market was 2.3%. At this point, a Hail Mary pass is in order. However, if you\u2019re convinced Nio will be the best sub-$10 stock you\u2019ve ever bought in your lifetime of investing, do yourself a favor and explore using options to get the deed done. Here\u2019s why. The 1,000% gain in NIO stock mentioned in the intro would increase its shares from $6.07 to $60.70. But that\u2019s over a decade. Assuming it gets halfway there by 2029, that brings us to a more reasonable target of $30. Nio\u2019s share price traded at $30 as recently as January 2022, 24 months ago. And 12 months before that, it was over $60, the 2034 target. Looking at Barchart.com\u2019s option prices, I see the furthest-out expiration date is Jan. 16/2026, 24 months from now. The highest strike price is $20. The current ask price on the call is $0.87, a down payment of 4.4% on Nio\u2019s stock. I\u2019m not an expert in options, but that seems a little high, given the improbability of its stock reaching that mark in two years. Dialing it back to Jan. 17, 2025, a $30 strike is available with an ask of $0.12, a down payment of just 0.4%. There\u2019s a reason for this discount: you\u2019ve got 12 fewer months to ride a resurgence in Nio\u2019s fortunes. But the price is right. Furthermore, the delta is 0.07198. You can double your money on the call by selling it when and if the share price reaches $7.74 before next January. That\u2019s a 28% gain over the next 10-12 months. That\u2019s doable. If, for some reason, good news shines down upon Nio in 2024, and its share price increases by more than 28%, all the better, and if it goes in the toilet, you\u2019ve spent the equivalent of a cheap bottle of wine. You keep buying cheap calls with 1-2 years to expiry, hoping to get lucky at some point. But if you buy 100 shares at $6.07 a share, that\u2019s $607 out of pocket instead of $12. And neither is a guarantee. In the trailing 12 months ended Sept. 30, Nio had a loss of 21.4 billion Chinese yuan ($3.02 billion) on revenue of 54.6 billion Chinese yuan ($7.70 billion). That\u2019s 39 cents in losses for every dollar of sales. Or, as The Motley Fool\u2019s Leo Sun put it in his article from the intro about Nio becoming a trillion-dollar stock, its vehicle margin had fallen to 11% in Q3 2023 from a peak of 20.1%. In Q3 2023, Tesla\u2019s automotive gross margin was down considerably, to 18.7%, from 27.9% in Q3 2022. That\u2019s the difference between Tesla\u2019s quarterly operating profit of $1.76 billion in the third quarter and Nio\u2019s $664 million operating loss. For it to have broken even in Q3 2023, it needed 6 billion in vehicle sales [$664 million divided by 11%], more than double its actual sales in the quarter. Even if they were 27.9% in Q3 2023 (Tesla\u2019s Q3 2022 gross margin), they would have needed nearly $1 billion more vehicle sales just to break even. So, looking at it from this perspective, I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s a pathway to profitability in its immediate future. Perhaps when EVs become cool again. Until then, NIO stock seems like a dead bet walking. On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.
