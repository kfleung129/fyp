    "text": "A California tech entrepreneur is paying more than half a million dollars for Super Bowl ads criticizing Tesla for not disabling its Autopilot technology outside the conditions for which it was designed, a problem highlighted by a Washington Post investigation this past fall and later cited in a recall of virtually every U.S. Tesla equipped with Autopilot, around 2 million vehicles. It\u2019s the second consecutive year Tesla critic Dan O\u2019Dowd has run an ad campaign on television\u2019s biggest night. He leads the Dawn Project, a group that has sought a ban on Tesla\u2019s driver-assistance technology. The latest campaign is unequivocal: \u201cBoycott Tesla,\u201d it says, following footage of deadly and severe crashes involving its vehicles. One ad features footage of Teslas running over child-size mannequins, depictions that have previously led Tesla to issue a cease-and-desist letter. O\u2019Dowd said he was compelled to bring awareness to the latest issue with what he calls \u201cthe most incompetent software I\u2019ve ever seen\u201d in part by The Post\u2019s investigation. O\u2019Dowd founded Green Hills Software, which makes operating systems for cars and airplanes. \u201cWhat possible reason is there that they don\u2019t disable Autopilot on roads that they say are not safe?\u201d he asked of Tesla. Tesla and its chief executive, Elon Musk, did not respond to a request for comment. Musk\u2019s followers have accused O\u2019Dowd of a conflict of interest because one of Green Hills Software\u2019s customers is Mobileye, which develops driver-assistance software. O\u2019Dowd says his motivation stems purely from concerns over Tesla\u2019s tech. Tesla maintains that its software is intended to be used by a fully attentive driver and argues that it is \u201cmorally indefensible not to make these systems available to a wider set of consumers,\u201d citing figures it says show a lower prevalence of crashes when its software is activated. \u201cThe people would have it banned if they only knew the truth, if they only understood what it would do,\u201d O\u2019Dowd said. \u201cWell, that\u2019s our job. The politicians aren\u2019t going to move until the public moves.\u201d The two ads highlight three significant crashes alleged to have involved Autopilot. In one, a 17-year-old was severely injured when a Tesla struck him at 45 mph as he disembarked a school bus in North Carolina that had its stop sign out and warning lights flashing. \u201cStill Tesla does nothing,\u201d the ad concludes. \u201cBoycott Tesla to keep your kids safe.\u201d The ad makes reference to prior Dawn Project videos depicting the alleged failure of Teslas to react to child-size mannequins in the road \u2014 including last year\u2019s Super Bowl commercial, which aired weeks before the North Carolina crash. The other ad set to air during this year\u2019s game shows the crash that killed a 50-year-old father in 2019 when his Tesla drove under a semi-truck trailer and the moment a Tesla blew through a stop sign and blinking lights on a rural Florida road as it barreled toward a parked vehicle and flung a young couple into the air, killing one of them and leaving the other severely injured \u2014 footage first published by The Post. In both cases, Autopilot was operating in locations where it was not intended to be used. \u201cTesla dances away from liability in Autopilot crashes by pointing to a note buried deep in the owner\u2019s manual that says Autopilot is only safe on freeways,\u201d the commercial opens, pointing to federal pleas to restrict it. \u201cShockingly, Tesla refused,\u201d the commercial continues, leading into footage of the semi-truck crash and the crash involving the young couple. \u201cThis caused many tragic accidents when Autopilot was enabled on roads where Tesla knows it isn\u2019t safe. Tesla must be held accountable. Boycott Tesla to keep your family safe.\u201d O\u2019Dowd\u2019s group said the ads are airing in D.C., California, Delaware and Michigan. Musk took last year\u2019s Super Bowl attention in stride. \u201cThis will greatly increase public awareness that a Tesla can drive itself (supervised for now)\u201d he tweeted about last year\u2019s ad. The company is facing concerns over stagnating revenue, mounting worries about its capacity to deliver long-promised \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d technology, and Wall Street hand-wringing over the persistent distraction of its mercurial CEO. It has shed billions in value, down around 15 percent just in the past month. Musk has asked for a larger stake in the company as a condition for \u201cgrowing Tesla to be a leader in AI & robotics,\u201d saying that without 25 percent control he \u201cwould prefer to build products outside of Tesla.\u201d But some investors have not given the idea a warm reception. In January, a Delaware judge ruled that an unprecedented $56 billion pay package awarded to him in 2018 was unfair. "
