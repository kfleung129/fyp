    "text": "With the market taking a turn for the worse yesterday, we\u2019re going to look at how to find bearish options trade ideas using the\u00a0Bear Put Spread Screener. A bear put spread is a vertical spread that aims to profit from a stock declining in price. It has a bearish directional bias as hinted in the name. Unlike the bear call spread, it suffers from time decay so traders need to be correct on the direction of the underlying and also the timing. A bear put spread is created through buying an out-of-the-money put and selling a further out-of-the-money put. The maximum profit is equal to the distance between the strikes, less the premium paid. The loss is limited to the premium paid. Let\u2019s take a look at Barchart\u2019s Bear Put Spread Screener for today: Let\u2019s strengthen the screener by filtering for stocks with a Sell rating.

TSLA Bear Put Spread Example Using the April 19 expiry, this trade involves buying the $185 put and selling the $140 put. The price for the trade is $12.43 which means the trader would pay $1,243 to enter the trade. This is also the maximum loss. The maximum gain be calculated by taking the width between the strikes and subtracting the premium paid: 35 \u2013 12.43 x 100 = $3,257 The breakeven price for the trade is equal to the long put strike, less the premium. In this case, that gives us a breakeven price of $172.57. Let\u2019s look at the second example using Boeing (BA) The Barchart Technical Opinion rating is a 100% Sell and ranks in the Top 1% of all short term signal directions.
