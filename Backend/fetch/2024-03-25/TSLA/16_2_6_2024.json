    "text": "Despite insisting he hates advertising, Tesla CEO Elon Musk is parking his car company into several ads on his social media site X. On Tuesday, X users could see carousel-like ads featuring Tesla cars. BREAKING: Tesla has started paid advertising on X in the U.S. pic.twitter.com/oAY7ZVYUak  For years, Tesla has let the reputation of its vehicles stand on its own and has relied on word of mouth to drive sales. Despite the unorthodox strategy, the company has become one of the most popular car brands in the world and remains at the forefront of electric vehicle production. This changed soon after Mr. Musk acquired Twitter in late 2022, with Tesla announcing it would begin a small advertising campaign on the social media site. \u201cIt\u2019s indeed ironic. Twitter is highly dependent on advertising,\u201d he said. \u201cHear I am, never really used advertising before and now I have a company that is highly dependent on advertising. I guess I should say that advertising is awesome and everyone should do it.\u201d Since then, Tesla ads have appeared on TikTok, YouTube and Google besides X. Yet no Tesla advertisements have been spotted on Meta platforms Facebook, Instagram and Threads. \u2022 Vaughn Cockayne can be reached at vcockayne@washingtontimes.com.
