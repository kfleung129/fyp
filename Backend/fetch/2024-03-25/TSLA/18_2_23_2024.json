Yet it seems Musk no longer thinks such a move is viable or reasonable for electric automakers: The world\u2019s second-richest man took to X to deride Lucid for its Saudi funding. Lucid is majority owned by the same Saudi sovereign fund that Musk tried to sell Tesla to \u2014 the same fund that still holds a considerable stake in Musk\u2019s X, formerly known as Twitter. Musk\u2019s tone, plus the context of his social network\u2019s crackdown on \u201csensitive content,\u201d makes it clear his use of \u201csugar daddy\u201d here is derogatory \u2014 he sees Lucid as unable to stand on its own, without the backing of an authoritarian regime. That same regime propped up Tesla during its developmental years. Saudi Arabia routinely jails human rights advocates, bans them from travel long after their sentences are served, and even commits mass executions for crimes like \u201cdisrupting the social fabric and national cohesion\u201d or \u201cin and inciting sit-ins and protest,\u201d according to Amnesty International.
