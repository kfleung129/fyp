Signup Follow Us The 2028 Showdown: Apple's Design vs Tesla's Data in Electric Vehicles and Self-Driving Tech In the world of electric vehicles and self-driving technology, 2028 is gearing up to be a year of intense competition. Two tech giants, Apple and Tesla, are expected to go head-to-head, with Apple focusing on design and Tesla focusing on data. The rivalry isn't new, but it's certainly intensifying as we approach the end of the decade. Apple's long-anticipated foray into electric vehicles, known internally as Project Titan, has seen its fair share of setbacks. Initially slated for an earlier release, the production of the Apple Car has been pushed back to 2028. Furthermore, the vehicle's autonomous driving capabilities have been downgraded to Level 2, requiring human intervention. Despite these challenges, it's clear that Apple is committed to making its mark in the automotive industry. The company has poured significant investment into the project, with reports suggesting that they're spending hundreds of millions of dollars on research and development. However, there is some skepticism within the company about the vehicle's potential profitability, especially given the reduced autonomy and stiff competition in the market. Meanwhile, Tesla has been a dominant force in the electric vehicle market, setting records for deliveries in 2022 and 2023. The company is set to start production on a highly-anticipated $25,000 car in 2025, further cementing its position in the industry. Tesla's focus on data and continuous innovation has allowed it to outpace competitors like General Motors and Ford, engaging them in a price war that Tesla seems to be winning. Unlike Apple, Tesla's electric vehicles are no mere speculation - they're a reality, and a highly successful one at that. This gives Tesla a significant head start over Apple, as it already has a proven track record in the industry and a well-established customer base. As we approach 2028, the competition between Apple and Tesla is expected to heat up. Apple will have to work hard to debut its new EV in a market dominated by established players like Tesla. The challenge will be even greater given the Apple Car's reduced autonomy and the company's lack of experience in the automotive industry. On the other hand, Tesla will need to maintain its momentum and continue innovating to stay ahead of the competition. Even as Apple enters the market, Tesla's focus on data and affordability may give it an edge over the design-focused Apple. Regardless of the outcome, one thing is clear: the rivalry between Apple and Tesla is set to shape the future of electric vehicles and self-driving technology. As consumers, we can only wait and watch as this exciting competition unfolds in the coming years.    Subscribe to our Newsletter!
