Over the years, EV maker Tesla has evolved into a dynamic technology innovator. With the world\u2019s richest man at the helm (Elon Musk), Tesla has gone from an obscure start-up to the EV king. Tesla has transformed the EV space like Netflix revolutionized entertainment. In fact, roughly 70% of battery-powered electric car sales in the United States are courtesy of Tesla. However, for four straight quarters, TSLA stock has plummeted after reporting earnings, and the stock is more than 50% off its all-time high of $414.50, which was achieved in 2021. Is it time to give up on Tesla, or is the most recent dip an opportunity for bargain hunters? Jason Goepfert (@jasongoepfert on X) ran historical price data on Tesla and made a significant discovery: \u201cEvery time Tesla gapped down 5% or more to a 6-month low, it rebounded strongly over the next 30 days. 100%-win rate, 18% (!) median return.\u201d Thursday, Tesla gapped down more than 5% to 6-month lows. Will history repeat? Tesla\u2019s price-to-book ratio of 12.19 (calculated by taking total assets \u2013 liabilities, preferred stock, and intangible assets) is at its lowest level since early 2020. The last time TSLA\u2019s p/b was this low, TSLA exploded from $35 to more than $400 per share. Pure-EV competitors to Tesla are collapsing. For example, Nio, Rivian and Lucid are more than 90% off their all-time highs. Earlier this week, news broke that China is planning to unveil a massive stimulus package to boost the country\u2019s struggling economy. In addition, the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC) will allow banks to hold smaller cash reserves. Should the stimulus effort be successful, it will be a big boost for Tesla, whose second-largest market is China. Tesla is turning into a cash cow with nearly $30 billion cash on hand. With so much dry powder, Tesla\u2019s board has the flexibility to buy back shares of TSLA or inject more cash into the business to ramp up production. As Tesla faces a stock decline for four consecutive quarters, recent data suggests a potential opportunity for investors. Historical analysis reveals that every time Tesla experienced a 5% or more gap down to a 6-month low, shares roared back in the next 30 days. Finally, an attractive valuation and cash hoard bode well for the EV king. Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +6.2 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +46.4%, +49.5% and +55.2% per year. Today you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.
