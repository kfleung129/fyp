The company\u2019s manufacturing account shared the news on X on Friday morning, noting that the over 500 chargers are free and open to employees, visitors and guests. The post also included a picture of the lot, which shows a number of Tesla and other electric vehicles (EVs) charging using what appear to be the company\u2019s Gen 3 Wall Connectors.

The hardware also comes with a 7.3-meter (~24-foot) cable, making it easy to reach charging ports that are located in multiple spots on a vehicle. The factory, as located outside of Berlin in Gr\u00fcnheide, Brandenburg, also features a V4 Supercharger station, which Tesla made operational in November. The company has also developed a number of other amenities for employees and the public, including a train to and from surrounding communities, a new lobby opened in November, and more. Last week, the Gr\u00fcnheide community voted against expansions to Tesla\u2019s automotive factory, with 3,499 residents voting against the plans to increase the plant by 170 hectares. The residents expressed that the necessary deforestation for the project, comprising about 100 hectares, would negatively impact the local environment. Still, Tesla plans to move forward with the expansion, according to an executive who recently highlighted Brandenburg J\u00f6rg Steinbach\u2019s support for the project: There is zero impact on any future expansion plans.  We fully respect the referendum, and agree with @joergstb that this is a good opportunity to redouble our work with the community and all stakeholders.  The zoning plan would potentially shift more freight traffic to expanded\u2026 https://t.co/B7oI536N6s \u2014 Rohan Patel (@rohanspatel) February 21, 2024  Tesla currently produces the Model Y at Giga Berlin, though the factory is eventually expected to help build the automaker\u2019s more affordable next-generation vehicle. Earlier this month, the factory quietly reached a production goal of 6,000 Model Y units per week, despite having to pause operations in January due to armed conflicts in the Red Sea extending supply shipment times.
