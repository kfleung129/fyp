    "text": "Stock Analysis What are the early trends we should look for to identify a stock that could multiply in value over the long term?  Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed.   Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return.    So on that note, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) looks quite promising in regards to its trends of return on capital. If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business.  The formula for this calculation on Tesla is: Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities) 0.11 = US$8.9b \u00f7 (US$107b - US$29b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023). Therefore, Tesla has an ROCE of 11%. In absolute terms, that's a satisfactory return, but compared to the Auto industry average of 8.9% it's much better. Check out our latest analysis for Tesla Above you can see how the current ROCE for Tesla compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past.
