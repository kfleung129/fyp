Login Tesla investors have not had a stretch this bad in a long, long time. Shares of Elon Musk\u2019s electric-vehicle giant have dropped 26 per cent this month, wiping out $US205 billion ($300 billion) in market valuation. The stock is on pace to close lower for the sixth straight week, its longest losing streak since 2016. For perspective, at that point Tesla had not even launched its first mass-market car, the Model 3. \u201cThere\u2019s no floor in this stock in the near term,\u201d Adam Sarhan, founder and chief executive of 50 Park Investments, said in an interview. \u201cInvestors are scratching their heads. If Tesla is lowering its forecast and is not bullish on the near term, why should investors be bullish?\u201d \u201cTesla\u2019s December results and outlook effectively pushed back the positive inflection point in the business by a year,\u201d said Gene Munster of Deepwater Asset Management.\u00a0FDC There are plenty of reasons for the sell-off. The auto industry is warning about plunging demand for EVs. Hertz Global Holding, the rental-car behemoth, pulled back from plans to expand its electric vehicle fleet, and Ford Motor said it was seeing a weaker market for them. Meanwhile, Tesla instituted several price cuts, sparking worries about thinning margins. Then came Wednesday\u2019s (Thursday AEDT) fourth-quarter earnings report, when the company said it expected to expand at a \u201cnotably lower\u201d rate in 2024, but did not give any further details. The stock tanked on the news. Since then, at least two analysts have downgraded the stock, while several have cut their price targets on it. The average price target on Tesla has fallen by nearly 8 per cent since Tuesday\u2019s close, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, and now sits at $US220.34. The shares are trading at around $US182. Long-time bullish Tesla analyst, Wedbush\u2019s Daniel Ives, removed the stock from his \u201cBest Ideas List\u201d, saying the lack of details on price cuts, outlook, demand from the company is \u201ca bitter pill to swallow for the bulls\u201d. Ives still has a buy equivalent rating on the stock, but has also lowered his price target. The stock could stay in flux for a while, considering Tesla\u2019s reluctance to lay out a road map and an EV winter that is expected to plague the entire industry this year. \u201cTesla\u2019s December results and outlook effectively pushed back the positive inflection point in the business by a year,\u201d said Gene Munster, of Deepwater Asset Management. \u201cNow it looks to be the second half of 2025 before revenue growth will accelerate. In the near term, shares will likely drift lower in what will be a vacuum of good news.\u201d Still, for a stock that can move vigorously in either direction once sentiment shifts, this month\u2019s sharp dive also could open the doors to a quick bounceback. Technical signals suggest the stock has dropped into \u201coversold\u201d territory, which typically signals a coming reversal. The violent drop \u201cin less than one month has taken it to the kind of oversold level that has only been exceeded once since it went public\u201d, Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak + Co, wrote in a note on Friday. \u201cThis stock might have further to fall before it reaches its ultimate bottom, but the odds that it will see a bounce over the near term are getting quite high.\u201d Still, not everyone is pessimistic. Fund manager David Baron is betting the stock slide will be a bump in the road for Elon Musk\u2019s company before another parabolic rally. The manager of the Baron Focused Growth Fund expects Tesla\u2019s stock to reach $US1200 by 2030, up some 550 per cent from current levels, citing its strong brand. Tesla and Musk\u2019s privately held SpaceX were the fund\u2019s largest holdings as of December 31. Last year, it climbed 28 per cent, beating the 18 per cent rise in its benchmark, the Russell 2500 Growth Index, and the S&P 500\u2019s 24 per cent gain. And despite Tesla\u2019s outlook for slower sales growth this year \u2013 a result in part of the EV winter that\u2019s gripping the entire industry \u2013 Mr Baron still expects the stock to touch around $US300 in about 12 months.
