    "text": "Countdown to Luke Lango\u2019s \u201c2nd Trillion-Dollar A.I. Trade\u201d The U.S. govt just unlocked an $8 trillion market to move in a new direction. See how it could unleash 6,000% potential upside. The EV market leader could yet again disprove its skeptics in 2024 Advertisement Source: Arina P Habich / Shutterstock.com Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock ended 2023 on a high note. The EV market leader reported record vehicle deliveries for the year (1.808 million), representing a 38% increase compared to 2022. The stock ended the year up by triple-digits. That was fantastic news for those who bought in when sentiment was at its most bearish last winter. For TSLA\u2019s longtime skeptics, this is a horrendous turn of events. Contrary to bearish predictions, this high-flying stock remained unaffected by factors like inflation, interest rates, and competition. Despite challenges, Tesla may prove its skeptics wrong in the new year. However, whether that means you should buy and hang tight today is another question entirely. Tesla stock remains far from its past all-time high. As you may recall, during the height of \u201cEV stock mania\u201d in 2021, TSLA reached prices north of $400 per share. In hindsight, one can argue that shares went up too far, too fast two years ago. That said, thanks to several catalysts, TSLA stock could make a big leap back towards near its high-water mark. For one, if the much-awaited pivot on interest rates by the Federal Reserve ends up taking shape this year, this may have a tremendous impact on re-accelerating electric vehicle demand growth in the U.S. Also, over in China, the world\u2019s largest EV market, and home to Tesla\u2019s largest production facility, government stimulus efforts could indirectly boost EV demand. Demand has been affected by China\u2019s weak post-Covid recovery. A demand resurgence may help counter a key headwind for Tesla (rising local competition). That\u2019s not all. The hitting of new milestones with its autonomous driving technology is something else that would drive further gains for TSLA. So too, would any progress with Tesla\u2019s efforts to bring a low-priced EV to market, as InvestorPlace\u2019s Thomas Niel argued last month. Several factors could make 2024 a strong year for TSLA stock. Proceed with caution. More share volatility could come soon. TSLA ended 2023 on a high note because of the market\u2019s strong performance. Stocks, especially growth stocks, rallied during November and December, thanks to optimism about the aforementioned possible \u201cFed pivot.\u201d However, doubts about when this pivot will happen (or even if it will happen at all this year) could be creeping back up. This could result in a rocky stock market, and another short-term move lower for TSLA. Beyond negative price moves driven by the broad market\u2019s movements/macro news, concerns about Tesla itself may also drive a sharp pullback for shares. For instance, as I discussed last week, negative news about the Cybertruck could dampen bullishness for TSLA. When Tesla next releases earnings on Jan. 24, investors may look to certain aspects of the earnings report (such as further margin declines, or less-stellar full-year sales outlook) as excuses to bail on the stock. With all this in mind, in contrast to last year, TSLA\u2019s price performance could experience a rough start. Tesla\u2019s long-term prospects remain fairly bright. Morgan Stanley analysts suggest diversifying into self-driving technology licensing and high-margin products/services for potential earnings growth of 27% between now and 2030. If this bull case pans out, shares still have considerable room to run. This suggests holding onto a TSLA position, if it\u2019s currently in your portfolio. It also suggests eventually adding some to your portfolio if you don\u2019t already own it, but bear in mind there\u2019s no rush to do so. In short, as much could knock it lower before it surges even higher, wait for weakness before initiating/adding to a TSLA stock position. TSLA stock earns a B rating in Portfolio Grader.
