The company was previously expected to begin construction in February, but it has become clear that it will begin no earlier than in March. \u201cWe have a queue, just look, of the best companies in the world that want to come to Nuevo Le\u00f3n. Today I spoke with the director of Tesla\u2026 and they promised that\u2026 they would begin construction and improvement. The second largest company in the world has already knocked on the door and wants to come, the largest automobile company in the United States also wants to come,\u201d the governor said, according to Milenio.
