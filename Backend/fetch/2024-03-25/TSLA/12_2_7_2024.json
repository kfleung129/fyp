    "text": "While charismatic leaders like Elon Musk receive the lion\u2019s share of attention, many of us would surely prefer to have a boss who is less grandiose and more modest in their leadership style. Maybe the Tesla directors who agreed to\u00a0pay Elon Musk US$56 billion\u00a0were just feeling generous. Or maybe, as the judge who canceled this \u201cunfathomable\u201d deal suggested, they really were \u201cstarry-eyed\u201d and swayed by Musk\u2019s \u201csuperstar appeal\u201d. In her ruling,\u00a0Kathaleen McCormick said\u00a0those who decided to give Musk the biggest pay cheque in corporate history could have been \u201cswept up by the rhetoric\u201d surrounding one of the world\u2019s best-known CEOs. Certainly Musk \u2013 and his style of leadership \u2013 seems to be constantly in the spotlight. The German sociologist\u00a0Max Weber\u00a0(1864-1920) might have described his leadership style as \u201ccharismatic\u201d.\u00a0Weber saw charisma\u00a0as the possession of a particular type of authority which stemmed from admirers attributing extraordinary qualities to a single person. He said such leaders, whether they worked in politics or industry, appeared to have a \u201cgift of grace\u201d (from the Greek origins of the word \u201ccharisma\u201d) \u2013 a special something which sets them apart, and allows them to create change in a way that would be impossible for lesser mortals. My research\u00a0suggests that charismatic leadership seems to be enjoying a renaissance, having fallen out of fashion over the past two decades. Charismatic leaders used to be everywhere. They seemed to be the ideal of big business in the West from the late 1970s until the turn of the century. In the US, for example, Lee Iacocca was often credited as being\u00a0the savior of Chrysler\u00a0for making the car manufacturer profitable after it had been on the verge of bankruptcy. Similarly, Jack Welch, as CEO of General Electric, was famous for his management style and\u00a0merciless cost-cutting, which preceded extraordinary growth at the company founded by Thomas Edison and J.P. Morgan. In the UK, the likes of Richard Branson and Alan Sugar were celebrated as characterful innovators who made large amounts of money. But a series of business scandals during the early 2000s \u2013 such as the\u00a0collapse of Enron\u00a0and telecommunications giant WorldCom \u2013 saw charismatic leadership start to fall out of favor. This trend was accelerated by the global financial crisis in 2008, and a growing awareness about climate change and gender inequality \u2013 issues which seemed to call for new, more responsible, and democratic styles of leadership. So, the charisma-based model of management went out of fashion, replaced by leadership styles described as\u00a0\u201cauthentic\u201d\u00a0(leaders who are true to themselves) or\u00a0\u201cshared\u201d, when leadership is a deliberately collective endeavor. The CEOs of the most famous global companies ten years ago, such as ExxonMobil and Walmart, were not household names. But today, the bosses of corporations such as Meta, Amazon, and Tesla are world-famous. So why the change? Partly, this came about after the economic boom following the 2008 global financial crisis saw tech firms\u00a0rapidly increase in value\u00a0\u2013 success that was often credited to the founder. Figures such as Jeff Bezos and Sam Altman came to be perceived as entrepreneurial heroes rather than \u201cmere\u201d CEOs, increasing their prominence and public profiles.  Another factor comes from living in a time of crisis. The Harvard sociologist Rakesh Khurana\u00a0warned back in 2002\u00a0that the adulation enjoyed by some charismatic CEOs as \u201csaviors\u201d distracts us from other people\u2019s contribution to a particular company\u2019s success. The search for Khurana\u2019s \u201csavior\u201d figures seems to offer a simple escape route from worries over climate change, war, and economic turbulence. When Musk\u00a0fantasizes about saving humankind\u00a0by colonizing space, and the disgraced crypto entrepreneur Sam Bankman-Fried proposes\u00a0the eradication of world poverty, they present themselves as redemptive figures to audiences beyond their investors and employees. Furthermore, in a world increasingly reliant on algorithms, business has become somewhat dehumanized. People may be yearning for leadership with a (super)human face. None of this means, however, that charismatic leaders will attain the same degree of dominance they did in the 1980s and \u201990s. If the charismatic leader is making a comeback, it is a comeback on a more crowded stage. They may be popular in certain circles, but so too is the leader as a\u00a0champion of diversity,\u00a0or ethics,\u00a0or human relationships.  While charismatic leaders receive the lion\u2019s share of attention, many of us would surely prefer to have a boss who is less grandiose and more modest in their leadership style. That could be someone like\u00a0Mary Barra\u00a0at General Motors or\u00a0Lars Fruergaard J\u00f8rgensen\u00a0at Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk. Or it could be one of the countless leaders whose names do not appear in the media nearly every day. As a\u00a0recent biography\u00a0of Musk shows, the Tesla boss holds history-defining influence via his business interests in a social media platform, satellite technology, and cars. So, perhaps the big question is how we can best moderate the enormous concentration of power accumulated by some charismatic leaders. Cutting US$56 billion from an enormous personal fortune might be a step in the right direction. Sverre Spoelstra\u00a0is\u00a0Associate professor, Copenhagen Business School, Lund University.
