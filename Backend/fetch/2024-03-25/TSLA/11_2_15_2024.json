    "text": "The Delaware Chancery Court invalidated a substantial equity award to Elon Musk \u2013 the largest in history.\u00a0 It applied the entire fairness test instead of the more deferential business judgment rule, finding that Musk \u201ccontrolled\u201d Tesla and dominated the grant approval process. Key factors included: Even though Tesla conditioned the award on approval by a majority of disinterested stockholders, the burden of proof did not shift to plaintiffs.\u00a0 The court determined stockholders were not \u201cfully informed\u201d because of misleading statements and omissions in the proxy statement, including: Even recognizing that Musk may appeal, the ruling provides lessons for companies and their boards when making compensation decisions: Carefully evaluate the independence of directors handling material compensation matters. Establish that directors satisfy their duty of care to act deliberately and on a fully informed basis. Pay attention to disclosures of compensation proposals to stockholders. Background In 2018, Tesla awarded Elon Musk a performance-based equity-compensation plan that stockholders approved at the annual meeting. The plan offered Musk the opportunity to receive twelve tranches of options, each representing 1% of Tesla\u2019s total outstanding shares. For a tranche to vest, Tesla\u2019s market capitalization needed to increase by $50 billion and Tesla needed to achieve either an adjusted EBITDA target or a revenue target in four consecutive fiscal quarters. According to the board and Musk, the plan provided \u201call upside\u201d for stockholders \u2013 they risked nothing \u2013 and gave \u201c6% for $600 billion.\u201d With a $55.8 billion maximum value and $2.6 billion grant date fair value, the plan was the largest potential compensation opportunity in history. In June 2018, the plaintiff filed his complaint asserting breaches of fiduciary duty and waste against the defendants and unjust enrichment against Musk.\u00a0 The court dismissed the waste claim but found for the plaintiffs on the others. Although Delaware law does not automatically require rescission due to material disclosure failures, the court concluded that invalidation of the award was appropriate because no third-party interests were implicated, it had not been exercised and any exercised shares would be subject to the five-year holding period. Business Judgment Rule Not Available; Entire Fairness Test Applied The court applied the Delaware entire fairness test instead of the more lenient business judgment rule because Musk \u201ccontrolled\u201d Tesla and dominated the grant approval process.\u00a0 The finding of Musk\u2019s control was based on (1) his 22% stock ownership; (2) his \u201csuperstar\u201d status with influential positions as CEO, Chair and founder and with managerial authority over the company, often disregarding board authority; (3) \u201cthick ties\u201d with directors negotiating on behalf of the company, rendering them \u201cbeholden to him\u201d and therefore non-independent, and (4) his domination of the process leading to board approval of the compensation plan. Application of Entire Fairness Test The court examined both elements of the entire fairness test: process and price. \u201cDeeply Flawed\u201d Board Process. The court found that the board approval process was \u201cdeeply flawed,\u201d citing, among other things: Failure to Calibrate Size or Structure of Plan. The court also criticized the price \u2013 the design of the plan \u2013 which would reward Musk with up to an additional 6% ownership if Tesla\u2019s market capitalization increased $600 billion while also achieving certain revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth metrics. Key failures included: No Burden Shifting due to Disclosure Failures Tesla conditioned the plan on approval by a majority of disinterested stockholders.\u00a0 Under Delaware law, that would normally allow defendants to shift the burden of proof \u2013 even if, as here, the committee was not independent.\u00a0 However, the court found that defendants were unable to prove that the stockholder vote was fully informed because the proxy statement: The court also rejected various arguments made by defendants, finding they did not satisfy their burden of proof with respect to establishing: [View source.] See more \u00bb DISCLAIMER: Because of the generality of this update, the information provided herein may not be applicable in all situations and should not be acted upon without specific legal advice based on particular situations. \u00a9 BCLP  |  Attorney Advertising Refine your interests \u00bb Back to Top Explore 2024 Readers' Choice Awards Copyright \u00a9  JD Supra, LLC "
