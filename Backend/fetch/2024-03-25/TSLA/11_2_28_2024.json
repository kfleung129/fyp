    "text": "Elon Musk\u2019s electric vehicle (EV) maker, Tesla Motors (NASDAQ: TSLA), has always been a contentious investment. On the one hand, TSLA is arguably the most recognizable name in the industry that is widely expected to become one of the biggest in the coming years and decades amidst the ongoing green transformation On the other, many have been pointing out for years that Tesla is a car company and not a big tech firm and that it should be valued as one, with at least one analyst making a shockingly low 2025 Tesla stock prediction for TSLA in 2024 \u2013 $23.53. The debate appears more relevant in 2024 than ever before as the broad EV market has been on a decline for well over a year, with many even claiming that the bubble has burst by late January, yet February brought an unexpected reprieve, compelling many to again consider buying Tesla stock rather than shorting it. While Tesla has been struggling in terms of stock market performance in the last 52 weeks \u2013 it declined 2.91% \u2013 and particularly in the last 6 months \u2013 having fallen 16.37% in the time frame. Still, while the company is overall down compared to its share value one year ago, Tesla stock graph shows periods of significant growth along with periods of decline in stark contrast to many of TSLA\u2019s competitors. The latest 30 days of trading have, however, sent Elon Musk\u2019s EV maker 4.61% into the green, with the uptrend seemingly stabilizing in the last full market week. The latest full day \u2013 Tuesday, February 27 \u2013 brought the uptrend to a halt, at least for the time being, as Tesla shares closed 0.17% in the green at $199.73. Still, the rally is not yet large enough to negate TSLA stock\u2019s 2024 decline, and the EV maker remains 19.60% down year-to-date (YTD). It remains to be seen whether the recent uptick represents the end of a value buying opportunity for Tesla shares or if it is a deep breath before the plunge. While much has been said about the slowdown in demand that the EV industry has been facing \u2013 a slowdown significant enough that certain traditional vehicle makers like Ford (NYSE: F) have scaled down production, and ambitious big tech companies like Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) have reportedly scrapped their automotive plans \u2013 the fact remains that Tesla has been offering strong delivery figures despite the tough year. In fact, TSLA\u2019s deliveries report for the entire 2023 showcased a strong growth in production, and the firm shipped as many as 1.8 million vehicles during the year \u2013 500,000 more than in 2022 \u2013 indicating that there is a lot of room to grow for the company, despite the significant headwinds. The broader EV market has also seen two significant rallies starting in late January. In the U.S., Lucid (NASDAQ: LCID) led an industry resurgence after it announced several crucial partnerships. Though the Saudi-owned company is back in the red, Tesla managed to continue riding the rally. The recent performance of the Chinese EV market could also be a factor \u2013 if looked at as an indicator for what may come to the global electric vehicle industry \u2013 as most of its notable companies like BYD (SHE: 002594), Xpeng Inc (NYSE: XPEV) rose approximately 5% in the last 30 days while Li Auto (NASDAQ: LI) surged as much as 60% in February alone. What the current \u201cEV winter\u201d brought to light more than anything else is just how bullish most experts are when it comes to the industry\u2019s long-term prospects. This is most evident when one looks at the 12-month price targets for companies that have faced significantly more serious issues than Tesla in recent months \u2013 Nio (NYSE: NIO) with a forecast 70% upside and Lucid with 30%. In this relatively short time frame, the forecasts for Elon Musk\u2019s EV maker are also cautiously optimistic, with TSLA stock\u2019s average target forecasting a 9.52% upside \u2013 which becomes even more notable when the effects of the extremely bearish $23 forecast on the average figure are taken into account. Given the ratings for this relative short term, it hardly comes as a surprise that the answers to the question of what Tesla stock will be worth in 2030 are, generally, rather bullish. Late in January, and despite many exclaiming that the EV bubble has burst at the time, David Barron \u2013 a manager of a $1.3 billion investment fund \u2013 opined that Tesla Motors is likely to rise 550% in the coming 6 years and set his Tesla stock price target at $1,200 \u2013 not accounting a possible Tesla stock split that might happen in so many years. Baron explained that his very bullish Tesla stock price prediction for 2030 stems from the company\u2019s generally strong brand and a history of success. In this context, the current slowdown can be viewed more as a temporary setback than a harbinger of downturns to come. Ark Invest\u2019s Cathie Wood is another major Tesla bull, and her prediction for the EV maker\u2019s rise is not only more significant than Baron\u2019s but foresees a quicker surge. In fact, Ark\u2019s 2027 Tesla stock price target stands at an impressive $2,000 per share. While the figure might appear too high at first glance, Wood has previously been right when she predicted a 1,000% 5-year rise for the company \u2013 a prediction that, discounting the actual Tesla stock value effects stock splits have had in the meantime, came true in 2021. All things considered, right now appears like a decent time to buy TSLA shares, but whether you should buy Tesla stock today will largely depend on your personal risk tolerance and faith in Elon Musk\u2019s EV maker. While the company has its fair shares of bulls \u2013 and bulls that have been right with past predictions \u2013 there are many who recommend caution when it comes to Tesla shares. While the $23 Tesla stock price prediction is on the extreme end, others have loudly proclaimed that they will not come close to the EV company unless it sees an even greater price drop. Perhaps the most prominent of these is Gurgavin Chandoke \u2013 an event-driven, technology-focused trader who frequently shares his opinions and strategies on X \u2013 who stated he would not buy Tesla shares unless they fell to approximately $100. I AM STILL NOT A BUYER OF TESLA HERE AFTER THIS 40% CRASHTESLA NEEDS TO DROP ANOTHER 50% + TO GET ME INTERESTED$TSLA pic.twitter.com/D44gw0efXm Indeed, while the returns on buying Tesla stock today could become immense if the company\u2019s biggest bulls are even partially correct and there is no clear answer to the question of what Tesla stock will be worth in 2030, risks remain high. Not only are EVs still considered luxury goods in a market unfavorable for such products due to the inflation and interest rate-driven cost of living crisis, but even in its own playing field, Tesla Motors has been overtaken in terms of deliveries by one of its biggest competitors \u2013 China BYD \u2013 already last year.
