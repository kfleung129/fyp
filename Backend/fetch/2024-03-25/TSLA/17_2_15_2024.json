Experts say the verdict shines a light on the problems with Tesla\u2019s governance structure SpaceX has left Delaware. The rocket company belonging to Elon Mush has shifted base to Texas. Musk, one of the world\u2019s wealthiest people, posted the news on X on Wednesday. SpaceX has moved its state of incorporation from Delaware to Texas!If your company is still incorporated in Delaware, I recommend moving to another state as soon as possible. pic.twitter.com/B7FLByL2dY But why has SpaceX left Delaware? Let\u2019s take a closer look: What happened? The move comes after a Delaware judge in January voided the CEO\u2019s $56 billion pay package for Tesla \u2014 the largest salary in corporate America. The Delaware judge, Kathaleen McCormick, in her ruling deemed the compensation granted by the EV maker\u2019s board \u201can unfathomable sum\u201d that was unfair to shareholders. McCormick was ruling on a lawsuit from a Tesla investor named Richard Tornetta. Tornetta in 2018, calling Musk\u2019s pay package \u2018unfair\u2019, sued Musk and several Tesla directors. While Tornetta himself held just nine Tesla shares, the deal was also criticised by major pension fund California State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System (CalSTRS) and proxy advisory firms, who viewed it as far too generous. BBC quoted McCormick as saying that the Tesla board of directors were \u201cperhaps starry eyed\u201d over his \u201csuperstar appeal\u201d and did not fully inform shareholders. \u201cSwept up by the rhetoric of \u2018all upside,\u2019 or perhaps starry eyed by Musk\u2019s superstar appeal, the board never asked the $55.8 billion question: Was the plan even necessary for Tesla to retain Musk and achieve its goals?\u201d McCormick wrote. \u201cThe incredible size of the biggest compensation plan ever - an unfathomable sum - seems to have been calibrated to help Musk achieve what he believed would make \u2018a good future for humanity\u2019,\u201d wrote McCormick in her 201-page opinion. As per CNBC, Tesla\u2019s eight-person board comprises\u00a0 Musk, his brother Kimbal, chairwoman Robyn Denholm and ex-Tesla technology chief JB Straubel. McCormick wrote that many of the directors on Tesla\u2019s board lacked independence because of their close personal ties with the CEO. Two of Tesla\u2019s current directors showed a lack of independence in the pay decision, she added. McCormick has ordered the Tesla shareholder who challenged the pay plan to work with Musk\u2019s legal team on an order implementing the decision. \u201cGood day for the good guys,\u201d Greg Varallo, an attorney for Tornetta said. Tesla directors argued during the trial that the company was paying to ensure one of the world\u2019s most dynamic entrepreneurs continued to dedicate his attention to the electric vehicle maker. Antonio Gracias, a Tesla director from 2007 to 2021, called the package \u201ca great deal for shareholders\u201d. Tornetta\u2019s lawyers argued the Tesla board never told shareholders the goals were easier to achieve than the company was acknowledging and that internal projections showed Musk was quickly going to qualify for large portions of the pay package. The plaintiff\u2019s legal team also argued the board had a duty to offer a smaller pay package or look for another CEO and that they should have required Musk to work full-time at Tesla instead of allowing him to focus on side projects, like SpaceX and X. Kristin Hull, founder of Tesla investor Nia Impact Capital, described the board as beholden to Musk, a problem she said is common at other big technology companies. \u201cThis is the bro-show,\u201d she said of the situation. The pay package granted stock option awards for approximately 304 million shares that Musk can buy at about $23.33 each, well below $191.59 where it closed on Tuesday. Musk earned all 12 tranches of stock option awards as Tesla hit escalating financial and operational goals. Musk has not exercised any of the options and once he does he is required to hold the shares for five years before selling, according to McCormick. He was not guaranteed any salary. Tesla\u2019s value ballooned to briefly top $1 trillion in 2021 from $50 billion when the package was negotiated. Amit Batish at Equilar, an executive pay research firm, estimated in 2022 that Musk\u2019s package was around six times larger than the combined pay of the 200 highest-paid executives in 2021. Musk after the decision held a poll on X to determine where SpaceX should be incorporated. \u201cThe public vote is unequivocally in favor of Texas! Tesla will move immediately to hold a shareholder vote to transfer state of incorporation to Texas,\u201d Musk wrote. According to BBC, Tesla earlier moved its corporate headquarters to Texas in August 2021. What happens next? Elon Musk and the Tornetta on Tuesday asked the judge to pause her ruling until an appeal is resolved. Varallo, the shareholder\u2019s attorney, told Reuters the two sides will agree to a stay if they can reach a deal on an appeal bond. The letter is the first indication that Musk intends to appeal the ruling to the Delaware Supreme Court. \u201cI\u2019d give you very high odds on that,\u201d Varallo told CNBC. Experts say Musk is extremely likely to challenge the ruling. Kobi Kastiel, a law professor at Tel Aviv University, told CNBC, \u201cGiven the high stakes involved, it is likely that Tesla will appeal the decision,\u201d Kastiel said in an email. The ruling comes as Tesla prepares another round of compensation negotiations with the CEO. Musk said in a post on X this month that he was uncomfortable leading Tesla unless he had 25 per cent of the voting control. The billionaire owned around 13 per cent of the company at the time and he said negotiations would not start until McCormick had ruled. \u201cGiven the way she describes the board process - through the testimony of the directors - there is no way that his most recent demand for 25 per cent can get approved,\u201d Brian Quinn, a professor at Boston College Law School, said. \u201cIt\u2019s dead on arrival.\u201d Kastiel agreed. In the absence of a successful appeal, \u201cany new compensation arrangement with him will have to be assessed\u201d in light of McCormick\u2019s decision, Kastiel told CNBC. Ross Gerber, president and CEO at Gerber Kawasaki Wealth & Investment Management and a Tesla investor, told Reuters the ruling showed the company needed to replace at least three directors with independent board members before it can negotiate a new pay package for Musk. \u201cEssentially, the entire corporate structure of Tesla has been deemed, like not appropriate for a public company,\u201d Gerber said. But Kastiel said that\u2019s easier said than done \u2014 particularly when a CEO like Musk is involved. \u201cAs long as the CEO is perceived as a star and the company depends on the CEO\u2019s vision and leadership, even nominally independent directors \u2014 those without strong ties to the CEO \u2014 will have difficulty monitoring the CEO\u2019s conduct,\u201d Kastiel told C_NBC._ \u201cPlaintiffs may have a better chance of advancing their claims by potentially leveraging the Tornetta findings to argue that the majority of the Tesla board is not independent of Musk,\u201d he said. \u201cTo mitigate this risk, Tesla will need to significantly enhance the independence of its board and nominate new independent directors who do not have strong ties to Musk.\u201d Musk\u2019s brain-chip implant company, Neuralink also changed its location of incorporation from Delaware to Nevada last week.
