    "text": "In a recent report on The Electric Viking channel, Sam delved into the surprising revelation made by Elon Musk\u2019s mother regarding the Tesla CEO\u2019s car purchases. Contrary to popular belief, Musk apparently pays the full price for his Tesla vehicles, dispelling the assumption that he, as the head of the company, would enjoy complimentary or discounted models. Here\u2019s the full story. The video began with Sam sharing his own experience of starting a business and receiving products at a cost price, sharing the common practice of employees enjoying discounts or perks related to their work. However, when it came to Tesla, Sam suggested that the rules were different. Sam expressed his initial expectations, saying that one would assume Elon Musk, the CEO and founder of Tesla, would receive Tesla vehicles for free. However, the surprising revelation came from Musk\u2019s mother, who disclosed that her son paid the full price for a Tesla, and there were no family discounts involved. The video went on to highlight that it was not just Elon Musk who abided by this practice, but also his family members, including his mother and brother Kimble Musk. Even with Kimble being on the board at Tesla, he reportedly did not receive any special pricing benefits. Sam shared that this unconventional approach was contrary to the practices seen in many companies, where executives and their families often enjoyed certain perks and discounts. Sam mentioned that Tesla\u2019s policy extended to celebrities as well, citing an incident involving rapper Snoop Dogg. In a tweet to Elon Musk, Snoop Dogg expressed his desire for a Tesla, expecting a complimentary vehicle. However, Musk\u2019s response was clear: everyone, including him, paid the full price for a Tesla. The video suggested that this might come as a surprise to celebrities who were used to receiving special treatment. The video also shared that while other car companies, such as Toyota, reportedly offered employee discounts, Tesla remained an exception in this regard. Sam concluded the video by sharing the uniqueness of Tesla\u2019s approach in the automotive industry, where traditional norms of discounted vehicles for executives and their families were challenged. Several YouTube users shared their thoughts on the incident. One user wrote, \u201cTesla employees get stock which is more valuable than a car, they can buy a car and house which other employees can\u2019t.\u201d Another user added, \u201cElon paid full price for his Tesla, but did he notice? That\u2019s the difference. IMO employees should get a discount or atleast on options.\u201d So what are your thoughts? As Elon Musk and Tesla broke away from conventional practices in the automotive industry, what impact do you think this unique approach had on the company\u2019s culture and perception, both internally among employees and externally among customers?
