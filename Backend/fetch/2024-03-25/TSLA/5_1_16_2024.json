    "text": " ALAIN JOCARD / Contributor / Getty Images Tesla (TSLA) shares rebounded from early losses Tuesday after CEO Elon Musk said that he wants 25% voting control of the electric vehicle (EV) maker before advancing Tesla's position in artificial intelligence (AI). Musk said he is \"uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in AI & robotics without having ~25% voting control. Enough to be influential, but not so much that I can\u2019t be overturned\" in a post on X (formerly Twitter), which Musk owns. He added that \"unless that is the case, I would prefer to build products outside of Tesla.\" In July of 2023, Musk\u00a0launched\u00a0xAI, an AI-focused company separate from Tesla and X. The AI company said it \u201cwill work closely\u201d with X and Tesla. Wedbush analysts said they view Tesla \"as a disruptive tech leader and if Musk ultimately went down the path to create his own company (separate from Tesla) for his next generation AI projects this would clearly be a big negative for the Tesla story,\" adding that \"Musk having a back and forth about such an important issue over X is far from ideal for the investment community around Tesla.\" However, the analysts said that although Musk only owns about 13% of Tesla currently, they anticipate \"the Board and Musk will be able to resolve this issue over the next 3-6 months\" and reiterated their \"outperform\" rating and $250 price target. Tesla shares were up 1% at $220.97 as of about 11:45 a.m. ET Tuesday, after dropping as low as $212.18 early in the session. The stock has gained 68% over the past year.
