    "text": "As\u00a0Tesla, Inc. TSLA shares remain downbeat, CNBC Mad Money host\u00a0Jim Cramer, who thinks the electric-vehicle giant could be the first to fall out of the \u201cMagnificent Seven,\u201d ended up including it in the\u00a0list of potential next trillion-dollar companies. But he also suggested the stock might be getting a lift from a mystery buyer. What Happened:\u00a0On Monday\u2019s Mad Money episode, Cramer noted Tesla\u2019s market capitalization is plateauing around $635 billion. He speculated that a \u201cbig portfolio manager\u201d might be buying to stop the stock from falling further, acknowledging the unusual nature of such a move. \u201cIt does feel like some big portfolio manager\u2026.has decided to make a stand, not letting it to go any lower. I know it sounds strange, but that\u2019s almost conspiratorial, right but that\u2019s how Tesla trades,\u201d he said. \u201cThere could be a\u00a0Cathie Wood\u00a0imitator out there buying Tesla, not letting it come down, not caring if they get it cheaper, tour de force arrogant buyer.\u201d Wood is a Tesla bull, and the EV maker is one of the top holdings of many of Ark\u2019s actively managed exchange-traded funds. Ark resumed Tesla buying in late January as the stock plunged following the company\u2019s double-miss in the fourth quarter. This mystery investor, however, may not be enough to propel Tesla back to a trillion, according to Cramer. He believes the stock might benefit from future new model releases but expresses doubt about reaching the trillion-dollar mark.

Ever since the stock slipped in the aftermath of the company\u2019s third-quarter results in mid-July, it has been trading in a broad range. Since late January, it has been trading mostly below the $200 level. Last week, Nvidia became the most traded stock on Wall Street, replacing Tesla, according to Reuters. Tesla had dominated daily U.S. stock trading since 2020, with turnovers often surpassing $35 billion, according to LSEG data. Tesla\u2019s next big catalyst could be its upcoming deliveries report in early April.

Analysts have muted expectations for the recently launched Cybertruck, viewing it as a long-term contributor rather than an immediate revenue driver. Tesla bulls, like\u00a0Gary Black, emphasize\u00a0the need for advertising\u00a0and a more affordable EV to boost sales volume. Price Action: Tesla ended Monday\u2019s session up 3.87% to $199.40, according to Benzinga Pro data. Check out more of Benzinga\u2019s Future Of Mobility coverage by\u00a0following this link.
