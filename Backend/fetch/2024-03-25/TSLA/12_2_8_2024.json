    "text": "Tesla Inc. is reportedly reassessing its staffing needs, raising concerns about potential layoffs. The company has asked managers to evaluate the criticality of their employees' roles to the company's operations. This directive required U.S. managers to categorize the roles of their team members as either critical or non-critical. This assessment was initiated following the cancellation of some employees' biannual performance reviews. The reassessment of staffing needs is happening in the context of Tesla's recent quarterly earnings. The company missed both earnings and revenue forecasts for the fourth quarter of 2023. Despite a significant drop in shares, Tesla is preparing for future growth phases and significant capital investments. Traders and investors use our platform.
