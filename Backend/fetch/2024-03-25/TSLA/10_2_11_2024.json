Supply chain disruptions during the COVID-19 pandemic reduced the availability of new cars, causing used car prices to soar. Additionally, federal stimulus measures during the pandemic enhanced consumer affordability. With supply chain constraints easing, new car inventory has surged. Moreover, automakers, particularly EV manufacturers, have significantly reduced configurator and new inventory prices, making them more accessible. Tesla spearheaded the price-cutting trend in the EV industry, initiating reductions in early 2023. After a brief pause late last year, the Elon Musk-led company has resumed slashing prices. As recently as Saturday, the company began offering\u00a0a limited-time $1,000 price reduction\u00a0on its popular Model Y vehicle. The decline in used car prices may squeeze profits for automakers\u2019 in-house financing arms, as off-lease vehicles are sold for less than the residual values used in leasing contracts. Automakers are faced with the dilemma of either keeping lease rates low to remain competitive, potentially impacting profits, or maintaining lease amounts, which could negatively affect sales. Furthermore, lower used car prices could influence the purchase decisions of new car buyers, as consumers often avoid vehicles with lower resale value. Lower used car prices typically result in reduced residual values for new cars. Tesla ended Friday\u2019s session up 2.12% at $193.57, according to Benzinga Pro data.
