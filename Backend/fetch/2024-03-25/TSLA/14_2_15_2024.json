    "text": "In 2024, Tesla's stock has seen a significant decline of 26%, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite have risen about 4%. The company's 2024 earnings per share have fallen by approximately 20% since the start of the year. Tesla's 2025 earnings estimates have also been revised down by roughly 20% since the beginning of the year, and by 50% since December 2022. This downward trend in earnings estimates aligns with the decline in Tesla's stock price. Factors such as weak margin outlook, ongoing price cuts, and stiff competition from China have been attributed to this decline. Despite these challenges, analysts have reiterated their positive ratings on Tesla's long-term outlook, projecting a targeted upside of 70%. They anticipate a strong bounce in margin performance and the potential for 20% of all cars to be EVs by the end of the decade. Traders and investors use our platform.
