    "text": "The views expressed in this article are those of the authors and not their firm. In 2017 Tesla\u2019s market capitalization hovered around US$50 billion and it was the U.S.\u2019s most shorted stock: the market was betting decisively against Elon Musk. But by October 2021, and on the heels of a performance-based equity-compensation plan awarded by the Tesla board to Musk and subsequently approved by shareholders in March 2018 (the Plan), Musk propelled Tesla to stratospheric valuations exceeding US$1 trillion. Observers can therefore be forgiven for being surprised by the Delaware Court of Chancery\u2019s decision to rescind the Plan in Tornetta v Musk et al,[1] issued at the end of January. But even if one questions the result, the judgement remains worthwhile reading for corporate directors, and particularly members of compensation committees, attempting to fashion compensation plans for their senior executives. \u00a0It is rare that executive compensation plans receive the degree of judicial scrutiny levied by Chancellor McCormick. Furthermore, the essential similarity of Delaware and Canadian common law regarding principles of corporate governance makes much of the decision relevant north of the border. What is the key takeaway? Corporate law doesn\u2019t prohibit \u201csupersized\u201d compensation for \u201csuperstar\u201d executives, but it does impose specific procedural checks and balances. Stated differently, in Canada, provided it is the result of a robust process led by truly independent directors advised by external experts, and assuming meaningful disclosure to shareholders, a supersized compensation plan granted to a superstar CEO should, if challenged, find judicial approval. In brief, the Plan granted Musk options to increase his Tesla ownership by approximately 6% (from 21.9% to a maximum of 28.3%) if, and only if, he increased Tesla\u2019s market capitalization from approximately $50 billion to $650 billion, while also achieving operational milestones tied to Tesla\u2019s top-line (revenue) or bottom-line (adjusted EBITDA) growth.[2] The Plan\u2019s total maximum potential value to Musk was US$55.8 billion.\u00a0 Chancellor McCormick noted the Plan was \u201cthe \u201clargest potential compensation opportunity ever observed in public markets by multiple orders of magnitude\u2014250 times larger than the contemporaneous median peer compensation plan and over 33 times larger than the plan\u2019s closest comparison.\u201d Tesla\u2019s directors highlighted the Plan\u2019s objective was to \u201cachieve transformative growth, and that Tesla accomplished this by securing Musk\u2019s continued leadership.\u201d They further underscored that Musk\u2019s equity stake would only increase by 6% should he realize $600 billion of growth in shareholder value.[3] Ultimately, however, and notwithstanding the Court\u2019s acceptance \u201cthat Musk was uniquely motivated by ambitious goals and that Tesla desperately needed Musk to succeed in its next stage of development,\u201d the Court ruled Tesla\u2019s directors had breached their fiduciary duties by awarding the Plan. The Court-ordered remedy: rescission of the Plan such that Musk was disentitled to the entirety of the equity he had earned under it. But what is critical to appreciate is the Court\u2019s ruling doesn\u2019t condemn the Plan based on its terms in and of themselves. Rather, Chancellor McCormick rescinded the Plan primarily for deficiencies identified in (1) the independence of the committee tasked with formulating the Plan (the Committee), (2) the process around the Committee\u2019s development of the Plan, and (3) Tesla\u2019s disclosure to shareholders regarding the foregoing. In total, with appropriate modifications to these process points, the Plan could have survived judicial scrutiny.\u00a0Musk has also recently indicated that he intends to appeal the decision. Where exactly did the Committee and the Plan go wrong? The Court seized on several issues, and as such the judgement makes instructive, if not entertaining, reading. Regarding the Committee\u2019s composition, the Court\u2019s primary concern was numerous indicia its members lacked independence, i.e. appropriate objectivity and autonomy vis-\u00e0-vis Musk. The Court cited both business dealings outside the company and cross-investments amongst Committee members and Musk, as well as longstanding personal relationships evidenced by such things as attendance at family birthday parties and joint family vacations. Another \u201ccompromising factor\u201d identified by the Court was the off-market and \u201coutsized\u201d director compensation being received by two of the Committee members. Relatedly, the \u201cprimary\u201d intermediary between the Committee and Musk was Tesla\u2019s General Counsel, who was Musk\u2019s former divorce attorney.\u00a0 The Court described him as a man whose \u201cadmiration for Musk moved him to tears during his deposition.\u201d The Court underscored that on \u201cwhose side he viewed himself\u201d during the negotiation was unclear.\u201d Regarding the Committee\u2019s development of the terms of the Plan, a key concern of the Court was that the process was insufficiently \u201cadversarial\u201d. The Court highlighted several admissions during Committee members\u2019 testimony that they did not see themselves as being \u201con different sides of things\u201d with Musk, that they viewed the process as \u201ccooperative\u201d rather than \u201ccontested\u201d, and that they had not engaged in \u201cpositional negotiation.\u201d This was aggravated by the fact that the Plan as ultimately approved was very close to that initially proposed by Musk, that the Committee had not won any significant concessions from Musk, and that, where the Plan had been downsized, it had essentially resulted from Musk \u201cnegotiating against himself\u201d. The Court identified several additional deficiencies with the Committee\u2019s process. One was inadequate Committee control over timing and preparation. Although the Plan had been developed over nine months, the Court saw most work as occurring in \u201cshort bursts\u201d dictated by Musk and around which the Committee was given insufficient time to prepare. Another was that, notwithstanding that benchmarking is the \u201cfoundation\u201d of a compensation analysis, the Committee had not conducted a benchmarking analysis. Nor had the Committee asked its advisors to either challenge the Plan or present alternatives to it. The Court also highlighted that several of the Plan\u2019s preliminary performance milestones already appeared highly likely to be met.[4] Finally, the Court faulted the Committee for failing to address two interrelated questions. First, did adequate incentives for Musk already exist? The Court called this the \u201c$55.8 billion question\u201d, and answered that, given his existing 21.9% equity stake, Musk already had \u201cevery incentive to push Tesla to levels of transformative growth,\u201d in that he \u201cstood to gain over $10 billion for every $50 billion in market capitalization increase.\u201d Second, whether the Plan was necessary to retain Musk, i.e., was there danger Musk would depart without it? The Court did not see any. Musk\u2019s own testimony \u201cthroughout the litigation\u201d was that he had \u201cno intention of leaving Tesla.\u201d The Committee had expressed concerns that a risk faced by Tesla was Musk dedicating insufficient time to the company due to distractions posed by his other significant business ventures.\u00a0However, the Court criticized the Plan as \u201cnot conditioned on Musk devoting any set amount of time to Tesla because the board never proposed such a term.\u201d Regarding Tesla\u2019s disclosure of the foregoing in advance of the shareholder vote that approved the Plan, the Court held the vote was not fully informed as a result of deficiencies in the proxy circular sent by Tesla to shareholders, specifically for \u201cinaccurately describing key directors as independent and misleadingly omitting details about the process.\u201d What was required, according to the Court, was an \u201caccurate, full, and fair characterization\u201d of the Committee members\u2019 standing vis-\u00e0-vis Musk as well as the process by which the Plan was developed. However, the circular did not disclose any of the \u201cmembers\u2019 actual or potential conflicts with respect to Musk.\u201d Nor did the circular disclose several aspects of the Plan\u2019s negotiation the Court viewed as material in the circumstances, including \u201cthe level of control that Musk exercised over the process.\u201d Lastly,\u00a0 the circular did not disclose that, under Tesla\u2019s own projections, the company \u201cwould achieve three of the revenue milestones and all of the adjusted EBITDA milestones in 2020.\u201d And so what are the key lessons of Tornetta v Musk et al for compensation committees in Canada? Once again, a principal takeaway is that corporate law doesn\u2019t prohibit \u201csupersized\u201d compensation for \u201csuperstar\u201d executives, but it does require that procedural checks and balances are respected. We highlight the following: Lastly, the importance of attention to the foregoing is amplified where the executive could reasonably be described as \u201csuperstar\u201d and/or the compensation package as \u201csupersized\u201d. In special circumstances stratospheric compensation may be justifiable, but expect a commensurate level of scrutiny of the process undertaken by the directors that awarded the package. Chancellor McCormick\u2019s judgement is no doubt making the rounds throughout boardrooms across North America and elsewhere. However, a few additional caveats and comments are warranted in the Canadian context. The reality is that the Canadian business community is dwarfed by that of the U.S. such that it can be more difficult here to entirely avoid overlapping business or personal interests among senior executives and directors. Also, questions regarding director independence, including what may or may not qualify as potential conflicts of interests, have received scant judicial guidance by Canadian courts, further complicating the situation. Finally, we do not entirely agree with the Court\u2019s analysis regarding the requisite level of \u201cadversarial\u201d and \u201cpositional\u201d bargaining during the negotiation of an executive compensation plan. Yes, the committee should be independent and negotiations should be arm\u2019s length, but this does not mean that the process should be hostile as opposed to cooperative and collaborative. Negotiations over executive compensation are not the same as negotiations over an arm\u2019s length merger. It must also be recalled that directors are ultimately in pursuit of an appropriately structured \u201cwin/win\u201d pay package for senior executives and the company, and that the success of the company going forward will in good part depend on management and the board working well together for the benefit of all stakeholders.

[2] The Plan also featured a five-year holding period, an M&A adjustment, and a 12-tranche structure.\u00a0 For a tranche to vest, Tesla\u2019s market capitalization had to increase by $50 billion and Tesla had to achieve either an adjusted EBITDA target or a revenue target in four consecutive fiscal quarters. [3] Or, as the Tesla directors put it, the Plan was \u201call upside\u201d for the Tesla stockholders, who \u201crisked nothing\u201d but stood to gain $600 billion for only 6%.\u00a0 The options were valued at $2.6 billion at the time of grant. [4] Tesla\u2019s 2017 Projections showed revenue growth of $69.6B and adjusted EBITDA growth of $14.4B in 2020. Under the July 2017 Projections, Tesla would achieve three of the revenue milestones and all of the adjusted EBITDA milestones in 2020. *** Grant McGlaughlin is co-leader\u00a0of the Private Equity Group and practices in the areas of mergers and acquisitions, private equity, corporate finance, governance and sensitive and complex transactions.
