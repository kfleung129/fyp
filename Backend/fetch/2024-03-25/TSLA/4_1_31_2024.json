    "text": "With a strategic shift in focus and likely slower growth ahead, here\u2019s what we think of Tesla\u2019s stock. Tesla TSLA released its fourth-quarter earnings report on Jan. 24, after the close of trading. Here\u2019s Morningstar\u2019s take on Tesla\u2019s earnings and stock. With its 3-star rating, we believe Tesla\u2019s stock is fairly valued compared with our long-term fair value estimate. In 2024, we forecast Tesla will see a far slower growth rate, with deliveries increasing just 10% to a little under 2 million, from a little over 1.8 million in 2023. We forecast lower average selling prices, as Tesla will likely have to cut prices in key markets like China, in line with peers. We forecast automotive gross margins will be 18% in 2024, in line with 2023 results. In the longer term, we assume Tesla will deliver a little over 5 million vehicles per year in 2030. This includes fleet sales, an expanding opportunity for the firm. Our forecast is well below management\u2019s aspirational goal of selling 20 million vehicles by the end of this decade, but nearly 3 times the 1.81 million vehicles delivered in 2023. We think Tesla will be successful in continuing to reduce its manufacturing costs on a per-vehicle basis. We forecast segment gross margins will recover to the mid-20% range by the end of the decade\u2014well above the 19% generated in 2023 but below the 29% margin achieved in 2022. Read more about Tesla\u2019s fair value estimate. We award Tesla a narrow moat, based on its intangible assets and cost advantage. The company\u2019s strong brand cachet as a luxury automaker commands premium pricing, while its EV manufacturing expertise lets it make vehicles more cheaply than its competitors. We think Tesla\u2019s combination of intangible assets and cost advantage will persist and allow the firm to generate excess returns on capital. We see the potential for the firm to outearn its cost of capital over at least the next 20 years, which is the measurement we use for a wide moat rating. However, the second 10-year period carries significant uncertainty for both Tesla and the broader automotive industry, given the rapid advancement of autonomous vehicle technologies that could transform how consumers use vehicles. As such, we view a narrow moat rating, which assumes a 10-year excess return duration, as more appropriate. Read more about Tesla\u2019s moat rating. We assign Tesla a Very High Morningstar Uncertainty Rating, as we see a wide range of potential outcomes for the company. The automotive market is highly cyclical and subject to sharp demand declines based on economic conditions. As the EV market leader, Tesla is subject to growing competition from traditional automakers and new entrants. As new lower-priced EVs enter the market, Tesla may be forced to continue to cut prices, reducing the firm\u2019s industry-leading profits. With more EV choices, consumers may view Tesla less favorably. The firm is investing heavily in capacity expansions that carry the risk of delays and cost overruns. The company is also investing in R&D in an attempt to maintain its technological advantage and generate software-based revenue with no guarantee these investments will bear fruit. Tesla\u2019s CEO owns a little over 20% of the company\u2019s stock and uses it as collateral for personal loans, which raises the risk of a large sale to repay debt. Tesla faces environmental, social, and governance risks. As an automaker, Tesla is subject to potential product defects that could result in recalls, including its autonomous driving software. We see a moderate impact should this occur. Another risk involves employee retention. If Tesla is unable to retain key employees, such as CEO Elon Musk, its favorable brand image could decline. Should the company not be able to retain production line employees, it could see delays. We see a low probability but moderate materiality for both risks.
