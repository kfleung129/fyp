    "text": "Elon Musk is known for his quirky and controversial behavior. Whether it\u2019s challenging other billionaires to cage matches or boosting conspiracy theories on his social network X, the co-founder and CEO of Tesla (TSLA) isn\u2019t your typical business leader. So it might not be surprising that Musk once berated Wall Street analysts asking questions about his company during a conference call. The call was focused on Tesla\u2019s performance during the first quarter of 2018. Commercial real estate has outperformed the S&P 500 over 25 years.

Next?\u201d Musk responded, cutting him off. Another analyst, RBC\u2019s Joseph Spak, wanted to know why the Model 3 had a slower-than-anticipated rollout during the quarter. He was also cut off. \u201cThese questions are so dry. They\u2019re killing me,\u201d Musk said in response to Spak\u2019s question. Morgan Stanley\u2019s Adam Jonas described the conference call as \u201cthe most unusual call I have experienced in 20 years on the sell-side.\u201d Musk\u2019s behavior didn\u2019t do much to placate growing concerns about Tesla\u2019s future at the time. The company had reported a $700 million loss in the previous quarter and analysts were worried about the firm\u2019s cash flow and debt burden. Meanwhile, its stock price was volatile and the company\u2019s rollout of its latest model had been delayed.

Musk admitted in 2020 over Twitter that ramping up production of the Model 3 was \u201cproduction & logistics hell\u201d and \u201cextreme stress & pain for a long time \u2014 from mid 2017 to mid 2019.\u201d He said the company was about a month away from bankruptcy at one point. Musk also apologized to the analysts during the following earning's call. He said, \u201cObviously I think there\u2019s really no excuse for bad manners and I was violating my own rule in that regard. There are reasons for it, I got no sleep, 120 hour weeks, but nonetheless, there is still no excuse, so my apologies for not being polite on the prior call.\" Fortunately, bankruptcy was avoided and Tesla grew rapidly in the years that followed. The stock is up 1,065% since that bizarre May 2018 conference call. Tesla is now one of the 10 largest companies on the S&P 500 with a market cap of over $743 billion. It\u2019s also profitable, reporting $1.9 billion in net income on $23.4 billion in revenue during the third quarter of 2023. Tesla\u2019s sudden turnaround not only shocked Wall Street but also Musk himself. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect the stock to rise so much so soon,\u201d he said in a tweet in November 2020. Retail investors can probably take away a few lessons from this ordeal. The future is unpredictable, even for professional analysts and investors. To make good decisions, investors should tune out the noise from all the headlines they read. Instead, focusing on the long term and independent research and forecasts are probably better. The same goes for market sentiment. In fact, legendary investor Warren Buffett prefers a contrarian approach. \u201cBe fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful,\u201d he once said. Tesla investors who ignored all the fear surrounding the company\u2019s prospects in 2018 are probably sitting on sizable profits right now.
