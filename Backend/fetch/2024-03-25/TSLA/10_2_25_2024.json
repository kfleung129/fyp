    "text": "You don\u2019t need a deep Tesla TSLA stock analysis to tell you it\u2019s the worst-performing stock of the Magnificent Seven in 2024 so far. The EV maker has different issues than those confronting rival Rivian RIVN, which just reported terrible earnings that sent its stock careening lower. But the general EV market malaise is heavy enough to weigh on the industry, Tesla included. However, the TLSA also has more in its favor than most other car companies. It might be a bumpy ride for Tesla investors in the immediate future, but what does a TSLA stock analysis say about the longer term? Let\u2019s take a look at where an investment in Tesla might be 10 years down the road. EV Demand and TSLA Stock High interest rates make financing a new car purchase prohibitively expensive for many. Rivian produced over 17,500 vehicles in the fourth quarter, 8% more than the previous quarter, but delivered 10% fewer vehicles, or under 14,000 cars than it did in the third. For the coming year the luxury EV maker sees production being essentially flat at 57,000 vehicles. It wasn\u2019t much better at luxury EV peer Lucid Motors LCID, which expects to produce just 9,000 vehicles in 2024, a slight increase over last year, but a far cry from the 22,600 EVs analysts expected. Industry EV sales growth is declining at a faster rate than many thought. Ford F slashed its F-150 Lightning production in half while GM is standing on the brakes of its own EV production schedule. Although Tesla hasn\u2019t provided hard production numbers for the coming year, it did say, \u201cvehicle volume growth rate may be notably lower than the growth rate achieved in 2023.\u201d Big Fish Small Pond There is a shakeout coming to an EV market that is much smaller than analysts believed. The early adopters already bought their cars but consumers aren\u2019t convinced EVs are worth it. They are hedging their bets. Where EV sales are slowing, Toyota TM is seeing tremendous growth in its hybrid vehicle lineup. It suggests buyers don\u2019t fully trust the battery EV and want a fossil fuel backup plan. Tesla won\u2019t quite be the last man standing, but it will be standing taller than most. It revolutionized and popularized EVs when they were still quirky, not-ready-for-prime-time alternatives. Today, it is the premiere EV company and a growing carmaker overall. Tesla generated $82 billion in EV sales last year, up 15% from the year before. It also earned $8.9 billion in operating profits, which was a 35% drop year over year. Still, almost 1.85 million EVs were produced in 2023 and Tesla delivered 1.8 million of them. Not only does Tesla dominate the EV market with a 55% share despite growing competition but it owns a better than 4% share of the entire automobile market. Its share is bigger than Mercedes-Benz MBGAF, BMW BMWYY, Subaru FUJHY, and Volkswagen VWAGY. Yet trading at 45 times trailing earnings and going for 6 times sales, TSLA stock is still richly valued. The next decade is going to be a tougher slog than the last 10 years. Tesla won\u2019t be a bust like Rivian and Lucid but I don\u2019t see it outperforming the market either. The share price will have to come down significantly from these levels to make TSLA stock a buy.
