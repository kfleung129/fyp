FAQ - New Privacy Policy Auto expert Mike Caudill argues Elon Musk's design of the Tesla Cybertruck will push potential buyers away on 'Cavuto: Coast to Coast.' Chinese electric car company BYD may overtake Tesla as the world\u2019s biggest electric vehicle maker after it surpassed Tesla\u2019s fourth-quarter production. Tesla produced around 484,000 units in the final quarter of 2023 \u2013 an increase of 19.5% from the same period last year \u2013 but BYD sold more than 526,000 vehicles in the same quarter. The sales account for pure EV units. When accounting for plug-in hybrids, BYD has already surpassed Tesla, Axios reported. Tesla announced sales of 1.84 million pure EV cars, while BYD has sold 1.6 million pure EV and 1.4 million hybrid EV cars. China wants to have its two biggest EV makers to generate 10% of their sales overseas by 2025 but has not indicated which companies that would include \u2013 though, analysts believe BYD must be one of those two due to production and sales volume, The South China Morning Post reported. BIDEN'S EV PUSH IS AN \u2018ABSOLUTE\u2019 AND \u2018DANGEROUS\u2019 BUST: MARC MORANO Electric carmaker Tesla CEO Elon Musk meets with French Minister for the Economy and Finances Bruno Le Maire on the sidelines of the 6th edition of the \"Choose France\" Summit at the Chateau de Versailles, outside Paris on May 15, 2023.

The industry-leading investment firm owned 10.9% of the company in May 2023, even after selling off some of its holding. Some of BYD\u2019s success came as a result of aggressive discounting programs in Europe to help boost its presence in key foreign markets. BYD dropped the price by about 8% on its Han-branded sedans, with a much smaller discount on its Dynasty series of pure and hybrid models.

Europe is the prime target for rising Chinese manufacturers. BYD plans to build a new factory in Hungary and launch sales for three more models on the continent, with plans to sell 800,000 annually in Europe alone by 2030, The Guardian reported.

The still-biggest EV automaker will not have to worry about facing competition in the U.S. from Chinese rivals as tariffs and trade restrictions remain in place, which may also contribute to the intense focus on European markets.
