    "text": "TOP FUNDS: These Mutual Funds Beat Benchmarks Over A 10-Year Span     Tesla (TSLA) began rolling out FSD Beta Version 12 on Sunday night to some paying customers after weeks of internal testing. TSLA stock rose slightly Monday morning. It's unclear how many customers are getting FSD Beta V12 right away. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has been promising big improvements with Full Self Driving V12 for months. However, Musk often describes upcoming releases to his driver-assistance software as \"mind blowing.\" Despite its name, Full Self Driving is not full self-driving, but a Level 2 driver-assistance system. Tesla reports fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday night. Shares edged higher before Monday's open. Tesla stock retreated 3.1% last week to 212.19, its fifth straight weekly decline.
