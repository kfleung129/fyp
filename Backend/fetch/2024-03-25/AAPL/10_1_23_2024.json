The electric vehicle market continues to grow with fresh competition, and Apple (AAPL) has long had its eye on the pie. It seems that, although the company is still developing an EV, it has been hit with further delays as it strips back on features. On January 23, 2024, Bloomberg reported that Apple (AAPL) is delaying the launch of its own electric vehicle to 2028. This comes as the company rethinks the inclusion of some of its features including self-driving, according to people in the know. Back in April 2021, Apple CEO Tim Cook teased that Apple\u2019s car technology is still under internal investigation in an interview with Kara Swisher. During this chat, Cook said that \u201cautonomy itself is a core technology\u201d and that while many internal investigations don\u2019t see the light of day, he\u2019s \u201cnot saying that one will not.\u201d In Mark Gurman\u2019s reporting, he notes that Apple found it wouldn\u2019t be able to complete an EV with \u201cadvanced self-driving features for highways\u201d in the foreseeable future. It seems as though Apple will continue to target self-driving, albeit at a Level 2+ system, down from the Level 5 system it had originally planned to hit. There\u2019s certainly a lot of fierce competition in the electric vehicle space. Tesla continues to be a massive force while Sony\u2019s venture with Honda has shown a vehicle that can be controlled with a PlayStation 5 DaulSense controller. Regardless of the current process at Apple, it will be interesting to see the product it delivers when its EV hits in 2028.

Apple launches precisely when it means to and everyone else doesn't matter. Sure, but this is the perfect moment for a big tech player to enter the EV market. So many potential EV buyers want to buy but hate Elon Musk/Tesla. Apple continually kicking this can down the road is a mistake, imo. The company could have eaten Tesla's lunch if it shipped a Model Y competitor in 2024-2025. It isn't like Tesla is going to have anything new by that timeframe either. nah but every major automaker will have a full line of EVs on the market It doesn\u2019t need anything new, Model Y is selling extremely well. They\u2019ll have the Model 2 hype train going by then I would buy an apple car over anyone else. I really would. It would be instantly be a desired purchase As long as it has a physical volume knob is there some car that doesn't have a volume control on the steering wheel or something? I think the real question is whether the charging port will be Lightning or USB C They keep trying an aluminum chassis and that dog just ain\u2019t gonna hunt. "
