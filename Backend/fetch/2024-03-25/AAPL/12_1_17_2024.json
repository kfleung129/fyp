At Apple, employees who've stayed at least 10 years get a hefty square hunk of aluminum with a huge stainless steel Apple logo on it,\u00a0a polishing cloth, and a signed note from\u00a0CEO Tim Cook, according to photos and unboxing videos showing the award.

The work you've done, the challenges you've met and the breakthroughs you've made possible \u2014 they all add up to a profound and lasting contribution to Apple's mission to change the world for the better. On behalf of everyone at Apple, thank you for all you bring to our journey together.\"  The block comes with an Apple polishing cloth, which turned heads when it was unveiled in 2021 because of its $19 price tag. A note from Apple in the package says the gift is made from the same 6000 series aluminum that's used to make the company's products. On the side of the block, there's the number 10 denoting the anniversary, as well as the employee's name and the date they marked 10 years at the company. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Take a look at one video of the gift, from YouTuber DongleBookPro, here:   Read next Jump to "
