This has outpaced the S&P 500's approximately 22% advance since January 2023. Looking at the firm's projected results, analysts anticipate a 50% bottom-line increase, fueled by AI enthusiasm and layover buzz. The Seeking Alpha Quant Rating system has shown some uncertainty lately. After consistently signalling a Strong Buy stance for some time, in mid-January, the system for grading stocks on quantitative measures shifted to Hold. However, this too has reversed lately: earlier this week, SA's Quant Ratings reverted to a Strong Buy recommendation Wall Street analysts maintain a bullish view on the stock, with a consensus Buy rating. However, Tangerine Capital, a Seeking Alpha author, issues a cautionary note, warning that generative AI advancements may pose a threat to Alphabet's advertising dominance, while the expanding cloud business could lead to potential future margin shrinkage. Scheduled to detail its quarterly performance after the closing bell on Tuesday, Microsoft (MSFT) follows Alphabet in the earnings lineup. Microsoft has outperformed the broader market by an even wider margin than GOOG. Shares of the software giant have showcased over 68% growth in the past year. While Seeking Alpha's Quant Rating system maintains a cautious Hold outlook, Wall Street analysts continue to express optimism with a Strong Buy rating. Recently, the US Federal Trade Commission has opened an in-depth inquiry into Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft's deals with artificial intelligence start-ups, Anthropic, and OpenAI. The inquiry, which will scrutinize their corporate partnerships and investments, will aim to assess the tech giants' market cap of over $6.5 trillion. SA Investing Group leader Daniel Jones emphasizes Microsoft's strategic integration of AI into its business, citing investments in OpenAI and the development of Copilot as positioning the company for future success.

In contrast, Wall Street analysts maintain a Buy rating. Recetly, Bank of America Securities downgraded Boeing from Buy to Neutral, citing worries about product quality and safety. This comes after the US Federal Aviation Administration restricted Boeing from expanding its 737 Max jetliner output, although grounded planes will be allowed to fly post-inspections. The downgrade follows the grounding of 170 Boeing 737 Max 9 jets on January 6 after a midair crisis. Bank of America Securities has reduced its earnings estimates for Boeing in 2024 and 2025, emphasizing the need for quality improvements as the company aims to increase production amid heightened post-pandemic air travel demand.

Facebook parent Meta Platforms (META) is set to announce its Q4 results after Thursday's closing bell. Following an impressive performance in Q3, the social media giant projected Q4 revenue within the range of $36.5B to $40B. However, concerns over a weak outlook for advertising revenue impacted shares. Despite this, Meta's cost-cutting measures and a rebound in ad income have significantly boosted the stock's performance, resulting in a substantial 177% gain over the past 12 months. E-commerce and cloud giant Amazon (AMZN) is set to unveil its Q4 earnings on Thursday after the market closes. While Wall Street analysts have a consensus Strong Buy rating, Seeking Alpha Quant Ratings system assesses the company as a Hold. Over a period of one year, Amazon shares have seen a 62% increase . SA contributor Bradley Guichard takes a bullish stance on the stock, noting that Amazon is historically undervalued and currently trading 17% below its all-time high. He believes the current price doesn't fully reflect the company's potential. California-based tech giant Apple (AAPL) is set to release its Q1 earnings after Thursday's market close. AAPL shares have gained over 35% in the past 12 months, although that largely represents a sharp rise in the first half of 2023 and sideways trading since. The stock maintains a market value of $3T. Analysts anticipate an increase in earnings per share Y/Y, while revenue is expected to remain nearly flat. Despite Wall Street analysts maintaining a Buy rating, Seeking Alpha's Quant Rating system has concerns about growth and valuation, assigning a Hold rating. In China, Apple has become the largest phone seller, securing a 17.3% market share in 2023 according to IDC. Although iPhone shipments declined by 2.1% in Q4, Apple surpassed Vivo for the entire year. However, analysts predict sales pressure in 2024, attributing it to competition, limited product upgrades impacting high-end market share, and reduced iPhone appeal. Despite these challenges, Apple managed to maintain demand through discounts and promotions offered through third-party distribution channels. SA author Geoffrey Seiler observes that AAPL stock has been a significant winner over the past decade and five years. However, Seiler highlights potential risks for Apple, particularly in two large high-margin revenue streams\u2014its app store and search default revenue. While he doesn't expect these revenue sources to disappear soon, there's a real possibility of them facing challenges at some point. Seiler suggests that a hardware upgrade cycle and the Vision Pro could provide support in 2024, but he expresses concerns about the stock's valuation, deeming it unattractive given the potential risks the company is confronting.

Oil giants Chevron (CVX) and Exxon Mobil (XOM) are gearing up to unveil their Q4 earnings before the market opens on Friday. Despite both stocks trailing the broader market index, Seeking Alpha's Quant Rating system takes a cautious stance with a Hold rating. In contrast, Wall Street analysts remain optimistic, assigning both stocks a Buy rating. Amid current market conditions and rising crude oil prices, analysts anticipate a year-over-year decline in earnings per share and revenue for both CVX and XOM. Last week, TD Cowen downgraded Chevron to Market Perform with a lowered price target of $150, expressing execution concerns. Conversely, TD Cowen upgraded Exxon Mobil to Outperform with a $115 price target, highlighting the stock's decline and unchanged valuation. SA Investing Group leader Danil Sereda maintains a bullish stance on Exxon Mobil, citing the integrated oil and gas industry's expected growth due to supply-side measures and a resurgence in crude oil consumption. He emphasizes XOM's appeal with organic growth opportunities, the pending acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources, and the potential for cash returns and dividend growth.
