    "text": "iOS 18 is slated to be announced at WWDC in June, and it\u2019s shaping up to be a big update with a ton of new artificial intelligence features. In a new report today, Bloomberg once again says Apple sees iOS 18 as \u201cone of the biggest iOS updates \u2014 if not the biggest \u2014 in the company\u2019s history.\u201d Back in November, Bloomberg reported that Apple was hoping iOS 18 could be its most \u201cambitious and compelling\u201d update in years. In the latest edition of his Power On newsletter published today, Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman says that sentiment hasn\u2019t changed. In addition to the major new AI features, Gurman says \u201cthere\u2019s a lot more\u201d coming to the iPhone with iOS 18. \u201cApple\u2019s head of software engineering, Craig Federighi, told employees last year that the OS \u2014 codenamed Crystal \u2014 will have ambitious changes all around,\u201d Gurman reports. \u201cI\u2019m told that the new operating system\u00a0is seen within the company as one of the biggest iOS updates \u2014\u00a0if not the biggest \u2014\u00a0in the company\u2019s history. With that knowledge, Apple\u2019s developers conference in June\u00a0should be pretty exciting.\u201d Gurman has previously reported that Apple is planning a number of new AI integrations throughout iOS 18: There aren\u2019t any additional details on new features in iOS 18 right now. Still, it seems clear that Apple has a lot planned beyond its array of new AI features. FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links. More.
