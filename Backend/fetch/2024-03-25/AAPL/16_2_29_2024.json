Reports suggested ambitions to rival Tesla and even collaborate with McLaren on a supercar. However, according to Bloomberg News, Apple has decided to abandon the project, redirecting resources to artificial intelligence. Amidst concerns about profitability and leadership changes, the Apple Car dream comes to a halt, leaving only CarPlay as the company\u2019s road presence.

By\u00a0Dave Lee What could Apple have done with the humble automobile? ___STEADY_PAYWALL___ Ideas, some credible and others less so, have dripped out for a decade. For a time, the company\u00a0was rumored to be working on something small based on\u00a0BMW\u2019s i3. Then it was said to actually be\u00a0a van. With\u00a0augmented reality,\u00a0a new kind of battery\u00a0and\u00a0smart seat belts. Reports suggested a desire to leapfrog Tesla and go straight to full self-driving \u2014 and it was\u00a0granted permission\u00a0to test its technology on California\u00a0roads. It was looking at\u00a0building charging infrastructure. So insatiable was the appetite for any news on the car, Apple watchers had started to\u00a0pay\u00a0attention\u00a0to the kinds of vehicles bought by Apple executives\u00a0to see whether\u00a0there were any signs as to their tastes and the project\u2019s probable direction. My favorite report of all\u00a0was that Apple had\u00a0looked into a deal with\u00a0the legendary motor group McLaren, signaling the Apple car might one day be a true supercar. A\u00a0British\u00a0one, no less. I could just picture it making its debut in a Bond movie:\u00a0a tuxedoed Daniel Craig flirting with Siri to open the door to let him out. Alas, we\u2019ll never know what could have been. Apple\u2019s decision to scrap its car project,\u00a0according to reporting\u00a0from Bloomberg News\u2019 Mark Gurman, brings everyone\u2019s favorite Silicon Valley rumor to an anti-climatic but sadly predictable end. Apple\u2019s presence on our roads will remain limited to CarPlay, its in-car software. Some of the company\u2019s 2,000 workers on the project \u2014 named Titan \u2014 will\u00a0be reassigned to work on artificial intelligence, Gurman wrote. Others will have to apply for other positions;\u00a0some will\u00a0be laid off. In this era of cost-cutting across the tech business, the Apple Car was a distraction that could no longer be justified, not when the needs of AI must take priority, with Apple seen as a laggard.\u00a0Indeed, that Apple should bother making a car was always a difficult sell at the best of times. The large margins it enjoys on its hardware could not possibly be replicated, and the ordeal of putting a vehicle into production would have daunted even Tim Cook, for whom complex supply chains are a speciality. The initial struggles of Tesla, and costly abandonments of other car projects,\u00a0such as Dyson\u2019s, would have always been front of mind \u2014\u00a0and slowing growth in the sector made pushing ahead an even bigger risk. Indecision over the road the Apple Car should have taken seemed to be at the root of its problems. Leadership changes were frequent. Big-name former Tesla executive Doug Field joined Apple only to leave for Ford\u00a0three years later. Project Titan was a project troubled \u2014 an unkind take is that the company has thrown billions of dollars down the drain through mismanagement and a lack of clear vision. Then again, Apple\u2019s share price would rise handsomely whenever there was even a slither of news about the car\u2019s existence \u2014 and it wouldn\u2019t fall back when those rumors failed to materialize. Details of the project\u2019s cancellation barely moved the company\u2019s stock when reported on\u00a0Tuesday. Despite today\u2019s news, there will always be, I suspect, rumors of an Apple Car being worked on somewhere in the bowels of Cupertino\u00a0or some mystery location. Hazy details will be spoken about the same way we speculate about specimens at Area 51, or the\u00a0whereabouts of Lord Lucan. But any\u00a0expectations\u00a0that something would hit the road before the end of this decade have now been dashed. The Apple Car, sadly, is canceled. Read more: \u00a9\u00a02024\u00a0Bloomberg L.P.
