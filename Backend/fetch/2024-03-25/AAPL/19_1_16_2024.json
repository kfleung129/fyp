Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset will come with an option that lets you share it with friends and family members \u2014 a feature currently available on nearly every other headset. In a press release on Tuesday, Apple says you can let a \u201cguest user\u201d who\u2019s not registered to the device try out certain apps and experiences, without needing to set up an account on the device. Although not explicitly mentioned by Apple, it seems guest users will be able to bypass the headset\u2019s Optic ID requirement that unlocks the device upon scanning your iris. Apple doesn\u2019t go into too much detail about how this will all work, but the company notes guests may access \u201csome app content, such as large photo attachments, in Messages\u201d while the Settings app is open. Additionally, Apple says it will restrict Apple ID settings, Optic ID, passcode, passwords, Apple Pay, Persona, and health data while a guest is using the headset. When Apple first announced the Vision Pro headset, the company never made it clear how or if you could share the $3,499 device. But last year, 9to5Mac found a \u201cGuest Mode\u201d available within the visionOS software development kit, which would let users create a password that gives their friend or family member access to the Vision Pro\u2019s app. Apple didn\u2019t confirm the feature\u2019s existence until now. Along with a mention of guest users, Apple also confirmed rumors that you\u2019ll be able to use a travel mode \u201cto stabilize visuals\u201d if you ever get the urge to use it while on a plane. The Vision Pro will come with 3D movies and experiences from Disney Plus as well as support for streaming apps like Amazon Prime Video, Paramount Plus, Peacock, and others when it launches on February 2nd. / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.
