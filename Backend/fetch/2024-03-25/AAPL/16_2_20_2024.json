    "text": "---Advertisement--- Apple iPhone: The iPhone, Apple\u2019s flagship product, has been a remarkable success story since its inception. Recent revelations showcase the colossal financial achievement the tech giant has enjoyed over the past decade, with iPhone sales driving substantial revenue growth. In the last ten years alone, Apple has raked in an astounding $1.65 trillion from iPhone sales, as reported by AltIndex.com. The financial prowess of the iPhone is evident in the revenue growth reported by Apple CEO Tim Cook during the first quarter results earlier this month. The report highlights a remarkable surge in units sold, escalating from 153.4 million in 2013 to an impressive 235 million in 2023. This translates to a substantial 53% increase in the volume of iPhone units sold over the past decade. The iPhone\u2019s dominance reached a pinnacle in 2023, surpassing Samsung to become the most-used smartphone globally. Last year witnessed the shipment of 235 million iPhones worldwide, with an impressive 35% of all smartphone users opting for Apple\u2019s flagship device. This surge contributed significantly to Apple\u2019s cumulative sales revenue, reaching record highs. Apple\u2019s total iPhone shipments over the past decade amounted to a staggering 2.3 billion units. In contrast, its key competitor, Samsung, shipped 800 million fewer smartphones during the same period. The iPhone\u2019s consistent popularity and Apple\u2019s ability to maintain its competitive edge have been integral to its financial triumph. Since its debut in 2007, the iPhone has emerged as a vital product for Apple, steadily claiming a growing share of the company\u2019s revenue. The report attributes many of Apple\u2019s achievements to the iPhone\u2019s unique combination of user experience and status symbol appeal. To illustrate the magnitude of iPhone\u2019s contribution, in the first quarter of the financial year 2009, iPhone sales constituted a quarter of Apple\u2019s total revenue. Fast forward to the first quarter of the financial year 2024, and this figure surged to an impressive 58%. In the financial year 2014, Apple\u2019s revenue from iPhone sales stood at $101.9 billion. Over the next four years, this figure witnessed significant growth, reaching an impressive $166.2 billion. According to Statista and official company data, iPhone annual sales revenue has virtually doubled over the past ten years, underscoring the enduring financial success of Apple\u2019s iconic device.
