Prices subject to change.\u00a0Read More Last Updated on March 1, 2024 Reports are circulating on social media about some Apple Vision Pro users experiencing cracks in their computing headsets. There are dozens of Apple Vision Pro users reporting cracked units on the official r/Apple Vision Pro subreddit so much so that it\u2019s ushered in the colloquial term of \u201cCrackgate\u201d. It\u2019s disappointing to see a $3,500 headset experiencing such issues so soon after its US-only launch window, especially for early adopters who bought the Apple Vision Pro; it\u2019s looking like a far more widespread issue than originally theorized. Momentum behind Crackgate started to build just three days after the Apple Vision Pro\u2019s release date with one Reddit post stating \u201cwe have a crack on the outer glass already\u201d. The photo shows a small vertical line directly on the bottom middle of the headset. The user writes: \u201cI have never used my Vision Pro outside of my bed, and whenever I am not using it, I always have the soft outer cover on\u201d continuing with: \u201cI wonder what caused the crack, and whether it\u2019s a manufacturing defect or not\u201d. Soon after this post went live on on the subreddit, which now boasts over 60,000 users, more stories of the same vertical crack on the outer glass began appearing, with the severity appearing to get worse. One user posted about a \u201crandom crack in the front glass\u201d with the line considerably thicker and longer than the original sighting. They explain: \u201cIt\u2019s been sitting neatly in the Apple travel-case, and it\u2019s been subject to very light use of a couple of hours a day\u201d. Ending with: \u201cI haven\u2019t dropped it or similar\u201d. The shocking state of the photo was enough to ignite heavy discussion in the comments. The top-rated response asked if the battery was connected to the unit and charging on the wall outlet while inside of the protective cover, with some users explaining that the Apple Vision Pro cracks could be appearing due to a \u201cheat expansion problem cracking the glass\u201d. The Apple Vision Pro cracks appear to be getting some level of recognition from Apple itself according to threads on more posts where the headset has this issue. A user posted about another cracked front glass but followed up with Apple support. They shared their iPhone screen and \u201cother posts on this sub of people with the same issue\u201d to where the representative \u201cdocumented everything\u201d and set up a repair process. It\u2019s not just users on Reddit documenting issues, either. That\u2019s because people are also posting on Apple\u2019s community forums as well. A user writes about the Apple Vision Pro crack: \u201cI noticed a very small indent on the bridge of the nose of Vision Pro when I first got it\u201d they explain, \u201cit is very tiny, something like a fingernail size, I was concerned but assumed it just a production technique\u201d and that \u201cit is in line with the photos I have seen online\u201d The top response tells the user to bring it into Apple so that it can inspect the headset to see whether it\u2019s a manufacturing defect. Interestingly, they raise the idea of Apple charging a significant sum to repair the item: \u201cIf they think you damaged it, without Apple Care it\u2019s about $800 to repair it\u201d but with Apple Care it\u2019s \u201cstill a few hundred to repair\u201d. This appears to line up with estimates from Apple Support which now includes a service of \u201cCracked cover glass\u201d which is $799 without or $299 with an AppleCare+ plan. It appears as though leaving the Apple Vision Pro in direct sunlight for hours on end could be a factor in why the headsets are cracking at an alarming rate. One user writes: \u201cPSA: never set your Vision Pro down in a way that lets sunlight into the lenses\u201d because \u201cit will burn the screen and require an expensive repair\u201d. According to the comments, there\u2019s no warning in the box about using the headset in direct sunlight. Something to be aware of if you\u2019re considering buying Apple Vision Pro. It doesn\u2019t look as though the cracked Apple Vision Pro headset photos are slowing down any time soon. Earlier this week, one user posted \u201ccrack is wack!\u201d stating that: \u201cso apparently the cracking is real. In its case (Apple\u2019s official case) not charging, cover on the front. [The] crack wasn\u2019t there last time I opened it a couple of days ago. Unbelievable\u201d. The top rated comment explains: \u201cCrackgate has caused me to perform a new ritual of closely inspecting my device for cracks every time I take it out or put it away\u201d and that this eventuality isn\u2019t \u201cwhat Apple was hoping would be in the forefront of users\u2019 minds\u201d. The original poster responded: \u201cLast time I took it out was after seeing the posts about cracks and checking for one\u201d. They explain: \u201cDidn\u2019t expect it to actually happen to me\u201d and how they\u2019re \u201cworried it may happen to a lot of them\u201d. Another thread response writes: \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a more widespread issue than what what we see here\u201d and that they been \u201cdisconnecting the battery after each use and also when charging the battery\u201d. Crackgate looks to have inspired justified paranoia in the early adopters, which isn\u2019t a good sign given its exorbitant pricing and current limited availability. \u201cI also started waiting for the device to warm up to room temp before using it now\u201d and \u201c[it] really sucks this is happening and that we have to baby this thing\u201d. Apple has yet to officially comment on this situation. We\u2019ll be updating you with the latest news and comment as more information becomes available. The best advice we can offer is to follow the directives of users in terms of care for the headset; keep it unplugged when not in use, away from the sun or any kind of heat and be incredibly gentle. Hopefully, this is just the result of an early adopters\u2019 first batch, and something that could be amended in due time. We\u2019ll keep you posted.
