Martin Lewis' team of experts has shared an eye-raising way eager iPhone owners can cut the price and get the newest upgrade each year while saving a huge chunk of cash. On par with Samsung's rival new 2024 phones, a standard 128GB iPhone 15 from Apple would set shoppers back a minimum of \u00a3799 while picking its most expensive 1TB iPhone 15 Pro Max will cost a hefty \u00a31,599 - so it's safe to say upgrading to the latest software, design, features, and trend doesn't come cheap. Latest iPhone 15 deal: Here at Mirror Tech we often share the ins and outs of Apple's Upgrade programme as a way of splitting the costly price, an alternative for shoppers who don't want to commit to an inflated mobile data contract. But one tech-savvy reporter at MSE has found a much better way to cut the price of buying the latest iPhone - by ditching Apple's programme and creating your own.

By ditching the programme and opting for an Apple pay monthly plan on a new iPhone and simply selling it yourself when you want a new upgrade, instead of giving it back to Apple for free, he proved how shoppers can save hundreds. He said: \"Well, you can make your own DIY upgrade programme \u2013 simply buy a new iPhone each year (either paying upfront or monthly via iPhone Payments), then sell it when you upgrade. This beats the Upgrade Programme for two reasons \u2013 you get paid for your old phone, and you don\u2019t have to splash out for AppleCare+.\" Apple's official upgrade programme includes an upfront fee, followed by 11 months of payment instalments and a hefty extra amount for Apple care insurance. After the monthly payments, users can then hand in their phone and upgrade (hence the name) to the newer launched device - although you never get any money back for it. Taking inspiration from Nick's cost crunching on the difference on a new iPhone 7, I've added up the savings you could make if you adopted your own upgrade system on the newest iPhone 15 - it's a huge \u00a3600. To lock into Apple's Upgrade programme in 2024 you'll need to pay \u00a369 upfront, followed by monthly payments of \u00a342.95 at month 11 you'll be able to upgrade to the newest phone but you have to then commit to a further 20 months of instalments. - that's 32 months of \u00a342.95 overall - with the upfront fee included that's \u00a31,400.45. Where as shoppers could simply opt for the split monthly payments of \u00a332.29 for the iPhone 15 (or pay \u00a3799 upfront), avoid locking into a lengthy contract, and simply sell their old phone when they want the newer upgrade.
