The report noted Apple is 'hopeful' that a fix may roll out for affected users in an upcoming watchOS update. Latest Apple Watch Issues: It seems several users are facing issues of 'ghost touches' on their Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2. The touch-related issue is affecting the screens of the two premium watches, according to an internal memo shared with the Apple Authorised Service Providers. MacRumors, citing the memo, reported that some users may experience \"false touches\" and Apple is \"investigating\" and is \"aware of\" the problem.  \nThe issue might prompt the screen on the reported watches to \"jump erratically\" or perform unexpectedly without any user interference, Apple noted. This may also allow the wearable to dial calls unintentionally and not allow users to enter the passcode on an Apple Watch. \nAlso Read:\u00a0Apple Watch Series 9 Price: Apple Introduces New Watch Series With S9 SiP, 'Double Tap' Gesture; Details\n\"Some customers may report their Apple Watch Series 9 or Apple Watch Ultra 2 is experiencing false touches on their display,\" the memo read, as per the report. Some users may term the problem as \"ghost\" touches. The company noted that users must keep their smartwatches updated with the latest firmware update.  \n\nWatch Ultra 2 sports an Always-On Retina OLED LTPO flat sapphire crystal display.

The company did not share the level of impact, timeframe for a solution or whether this is due to some hardware issues. Apple has asked technicians that they should not repair these models until the company is investigating the concern. \nThe owners of these watches are required to force restart these devices (press and hold the Digital Crown and side button for about 10 seconds) and wait for the Apple logo. If this does not fix the issue, users can wait for the watchOS 10.4 update or a minor update in the 10.3 version. \n\nAlso Read:\u00a0WatchOS 10.1 Features: Control Your Apple Watch Without Touching The Screen Using 'Double Tap Gesture'; Check Supported Devices Here \nFor some context, the Series 9 gets an Always-On Retina OLED LTPO screen with up to 2,000nits peak brightness.
