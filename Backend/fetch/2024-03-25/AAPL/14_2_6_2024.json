This app is part of the initial wave of applications optimized for Apple\u2019s high-end headset, priced at $3,499 in the U.S. market. DingTalk\u2019s Vision Pro app, featuring advanced functionalities, allows users to manage multiple windows and utilize hand gestures for drawing directly on the screen, SCMP\u00a0reports. Furthermore, the app supports Apple\u2019s Persona feature, which creates realistic digital avatars from users\u2019 facial scans, enhancing video calls with true-to-life expressions tracked in real-time. The launch positions DingTalk alongside other Chinese applications embracing Apple\u2019s latest tech offering, despite its current availability being limited to the U.S., with plans for expansion into other markets, including China. Alibaba\u2019s\u00a0workplace communication platform\u00a0DingTalk accomplished a landmark of 700 million users by the end of 2023. Under President Ye Jun, DingTalk revealed an AI agent powered by Alibaba Cloud\u2019s Tongyi Qianwen. Additionally, popular Chinese mobile games and services like Honkai: Star Rail by miHoYo and the online travel service provider Trip.com have announced their apps for the Vision Pro, expanding its ecosystem with diverse content ranging from gaming to immersive travel experiences. As DingTalk surpasses 700 million users, including 120,000 enterprises, the platform continues to innovate, recently incorporating an AI agent to streamline workflows. This move reflects a broader trend among Chinese tech giants integrating AI into their offerings. Analysts expect Apple\u2019s Vision Pro to offer a significant EPS boost from immersive tech and apps. Vision Pro\u2019s AR features can also be a valuable tool for e-commerce, helping customers try on new clothing items or visualize new furniture products in their homes.
