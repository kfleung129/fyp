    "text": "The Financial Express OpenAI chief Sam Altman has called Apple\u2019s new Vision Pro the \u201csecond most impressive tech since the iPhone.\u201d We can\u2019t say for sure if he has tried the headset in person but regardless of whether or not he has, it\u2019s big praise for Cupertino\u2019s debut \u201cspatial computing\u201d headset that\u2019s got the whole industry talking. Altman took to X (the platform previously known as Twitter) to share his \u201cquick review\u201d of the USD 3500 Vision Pro that recently went on sale, though in select regions only. The headset blends virtual and augmented reality, collectively called mixed reality, and is being widely seen as the iPhone maker\u2019s next big thing for a future beyond the iPhone. Having said that, it\u2019s exorbitant pricing could deter it from mass adoption and so, all eyes would be on the second and third generation models to see how Apple plans to scale and make it available to even more people. vision pro is second most impressive tech since the iphone Developer support is also crucial. A good thing about the Vision Pro is that visionOS, the headset\u2019s operating system supports iPad apps natively while big brands like Disney have collaborated with Apple to launch dedicated apps and content to try and make full use of the phenomenal tech. At the same time, there are others like Netflix and Spotify that don\u2019t plan to release separate apps in which case users will have to depend on browsers for streaming. YouTube recently got onboard after speculation that it, too, might give the Vision Pro a miss. There is no denying that the Vision Pro packs tremendous potential despite the challenges including limited battery life (and Apple\u2019s workaround with the battery that powers the headset isn\u2019t the most graceful either). Its groundbreaking display (there are two of those, one for each eye with 23 million pixels in total) alone is tempting enough to sway many, not to mention, adding to the cost of making one. It has two processors (M2 and R1), both Apple-made and as many as 12 cameras and LiDAR for tracking. The somewhat modular design, too, is a big selling point though Apple needs to cut down on weight in the next generation. Like it or not, the Vision Pro has re-ignited the whole debate around virtual reality in particular and while rivals like HTC and Meta have offered headsets on similar lines for years (at much lower prices), Apple\u2019s entry into the space means even they should get the push needed for the industry to go forward faster and innovate further. Altman is not the only big-ticket name endorsing the Vision Pro, even Elon Musk has previously spoken positively about it. Then there are analysts who predict it\u2019s a combination of the Mac and TV, one that could be a threat to two-dimensional screens someday.
