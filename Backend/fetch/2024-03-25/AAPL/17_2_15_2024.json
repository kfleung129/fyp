    "text": "Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway sold off 10 million shares of Apple stock in the final three months of 2023, representing about 1% of its holdings in the company. The tech titan has become a major holding for the Oracle of Omaha\u2019s company and is known as one of the so-called \u201cfour giants\u201d \u2013 alongside its insurance, railroad and energy operations \u2013 that Buffett says drives most of Berkshire\u2019s value. But the Omaha-based conglomerate announced on Wednesday it had slightly trimmed its position in Apple in a regulatory filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The selloff is notable for Buffett, who is known to hold onto stocks for long periods of time. \u201cIf you aren\u2019t willing to own a stock for 10 years, don\u2019t even think about owning it for 10 minutes,\u201d he\u2019s said. Berkshire still owns more than 905 million shares of the company, worth about $174 billion. That represents 6% of all Apple shares and one-fifth of Berkshire\u2019s entire portfolio. Many investors, hoping to duplicate the success of Berkshire\u2019s portfolio, closely watch and often copy Buffett\u2019s market moves. This isn\u2019t the first time Berkshire, which began investing in Apple in 2016, has pared back some of its holdings in the tech company. In the second half of 2020, the company sold off about $11 billion worth of the stock, a move that Buffett, 93, later said was \u201cprobably a mistake,\u201d in a shareholder meeting. Buffett went on to praise Apple CEO Tim Cook as \u201cone of the best managers in the world\u201d and last year said that the company \u201cjust happens to be a better business than any we own.\u201d Berkshire Hathaway purchased an additional $31 billion in Apple shares in 2022. Shares of Apple fell by about 1.2% in morning trading on Thursday. Shares of Berkshire Hathaway were 0.7% higher. Apple reported earlier this month that sales grew year-on-year during the December quarter, following a streak of four consecutive quarters of revenue declines caused by slower device sales amid an uncertain economic environment. But while product sales have ticked up, revenue from the key China region slid, a sign of growing competition weighing on the iPhone maker. The company\u2019s stock is essentially flat from the start of this year. As it works to right the ship, Apple has taken a bold bet and rolled out its first new product in nearly a decade: the Vision Pro mixed reality headset. The device, which cost Apple billions in research and development, is being touted by the company as the future of computing, but for now, it remains a costly and clunky piece of hardware with limited uses. Filings also showed that Berkshire sold 80 million shares of printer company HP in the fourth quarter of 2023, reducing its holdings by 78%. It also pared off 32% of its holdings in media company Paramount. Buffett\u2019s annual letter to shareholders is due out on February 24. It will be the first letter since his long-time business partner, Charlie Munger, died last November. Additional reporting by Clare Duffy Most stock quote data provided by BATS.
