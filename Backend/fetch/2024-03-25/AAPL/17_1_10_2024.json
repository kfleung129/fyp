    "text": "Prykhodov Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) could soon overtake Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) for the world's most valuable company. The valuation for the Satya Nadella-led Microsoft hit $2.84T on Wednesday, as shares gained more than 1.5% and more than 67% over the past year. Apple, by comparison, is valued at $2.87T. The recent rise has been aided in part by enthusiasm about Microsoft's ability to monetize artificial intelligence, its stake in ChatGPT creator OpenAI and its Azure cloud business. Apple shares have gained more than 40% over the past year. In July, Apple became the first company to surpass a $3T valuation, a level it reached again last month. And while some on Wall Street have speculated that the Tim Cook-led company could hit a $4T valuation later this year, shares have sold off nearly 4.5% over the past month. Recent worries include a stretched valuation, iPhone stagnation and rising regulation from across the globe. Investment firm Redburn lowered its rating on the tech giant on Wednesday, becoming the third Wall Street firm to do so this month, after ratings cuts from Barclays and Piper Sandler. Microsoft has not yet set a date for its next quarterly earnings report while Apple is slated to report fiscal first-quarter results on Feb. 2. Both releases are often events that move the respective stocks and the broader market as well. Seeking Alpha's Christiana Sciaudone contributed to this story. "
