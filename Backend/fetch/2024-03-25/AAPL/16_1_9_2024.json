    "text": "       Want to see what the Apple Vision Pro hype is all about \u2014 without shelling out $3,500? Fortunately, you'll have a chance. Apple will start offering demos of its new \"mixed reality\" headset on February 2, when the Vision Pro becomes available in the US at Apple retail locations and the online Apple store. You'll be able to sign up for demos at your local Apple store beginning February 2 at 8 a.m., the company said in a promotional email sent Tuesday. The demos will be available through that weekend on a first-come, first-served basis, the email says. Related stories Apple didn't share further information on the demos, but it's pretty safe to assume there'll be long lines, especially given the Vision Pro's steep price, so prepare accordingly. Preorders for the headset will begin on January 19 at 8 a.m. ET. The Vision Pro uses virtual and augmented reality and two displays \"with more pixels than a 4K TV for each eye,\" merging the user's digital experience and their surrounding environment for more immersive work, gaming, and entertainment. It responds to the wearer's eyes, hands, and voice, allowing you to navigate apps just by looking at them, tapping your fingers together, moving your wrist to scroll up and down, or talking to Siri, Apple says. For the $3,499 price, the headset comes with 256 GB of storage, two bands for wearing it, a cover for when it's not in use, its battery and charger, and Apple's much-ridiculed $19 polishing cloth. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Read next Jump to "
