    "text": "The company issued new guidance regarding fixing a wet iPhone, and it doesn't include the popular hack of putting your phone in a food staple. It\u2019s an awful feeling: Your iPhone \u2014 the handheld mini-computer that holds much of your life \u2014 gets wet, and you need to fix it \u2014 like, now! The newer the iPhone, the more resistant it is to water and other hazards, the company says. But the devices are not totally watertight, and that's why a spilled glass of water could turn into a communication-ending disaster. The conventional wisdom says to put the phone in a bag of uncooked rice, with the hope that the thirsty grain will draw water out of it. It does seem to make some sense \u2014 and when your phone's life is on the line, you want the quickest fix. The assistive voice technology allows users who suffer from a voice disability to speak in their own natural voice. As it turns out, this old\u00a0iPhone\u00a0hack is not such a good idea \u2014 and Apple's support team has updated their guidelines for phone first aid to explicitly tell folks to lay off the rice. Instead, a little extra time and TLC can bring the drenched device back to life. There are a couple of reasons why rice isn't the solution. For one, tiny bits of the food staple could get stuck in sensitive parts of the phone, potentially causing damage. And rice doesn't do anything to prevent corrosion of the affected parts. Ultimately, it probably won't work, and you'll have wasted some\u00a0perfectly good rice. It's better to take some deep breaths and follow Apple's support advice. Here's what to do if your iPhone gets wet: First, unplug the phone from the\u00a0charging cable\u00a0and any accessories. Next, hold your phone upright, with the connector port facing down. Tap it gently into your other hand. Hopefully, some of the liquid will come out. Then, place the phone in a safe, dry location that gets some fresh air, but don't force air into the connector. Let it rest for at least 30 minutes. Leave it unplugged and unbothered. After some good rest and drying out time, test the phone by plugging it into a charging cable. If the phone isn't working right, or displays a \"liquid-detection alert,\" it will need more time to dry. Apple's support technicians say to give the phone 24 hours. Go ahead and test it every so often to see if anything improves. If things aren't improving after a day, you'll have to contact Apple for more help. Apple has a detailed rundown of\u00a0how to deal with a wet iPhone\u00a0with even more do's and don'ts. Good luck \u2014 and save the rice for dinner.
