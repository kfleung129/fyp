Ahead of that reading also comes the latest update on fourth-quarter GDP growth, which was last estimated at 3.3% and follows the Atlanta Fed's latest real-time reading of 3.2% for the current quarter. The solid growth, alongside a resilient labor market, suggests inflation pressure could remain elevated well into the spring.
