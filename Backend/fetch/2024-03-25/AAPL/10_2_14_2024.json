    "text": "UPDATED 11:45 EST / FEBRUARY 14 2024 by \nKyt Dotson Meta Platforms Inc. Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg took to Instagram to share his thoughts on the newly released mixed-reality headset from Apple Inc., the Vision Pro, where he said that Meta\u2019s Quest 3 headset was simply \u201cthe better product, period.\u201d In the\u00a0three-minute video,\u00a0Zuckerberg (pictured) said he finally tried the new headset, noting that he expected that it would be the superior product because the Vision Pro is significantly more expensive. The price comparison is staggering: The Vision Pro starts at $3,500 and the Quest 3 starts at $499. \u201cI have to say that before this, I expected that Quest would be the better value for most people since it\u2019s really good, and it\u2019s like seven times less expensive,\u201d Zuckerberg said. \u201cBut after using it, I don\u2019t just think that Quest is the better value. I think the Quest is the better product, period.\u201d Apple introduced the\u00a0Vision Pro\u00a0in June, which shipped earlier this month, and Meta unveiled the\u00a0Quest 3\u00a0in September. Both devices allow users to enjoy both virtual reality experiences, with complete immersion in virtual worlds that take over their vision, and mixed reality, which blends the physical world with computer-generated images overlaid over it. Zuckerberg mentioned that Quest 3 users don\u2019t need to worry about wires, unlike the Vision Pro, which has wires that attach to its external battery pack. \u201cThere\u2019s no wires that get in the way, which is a big deal,\u201d Zuckerberg said. He also mentioned that he experienced \u201cmotion blur\u201d in the display, stating that the Quest felt a lot \u201ccrisper.\u201d He did say that Apple\u2019s screen did have a higher resolution but added that the company had to make too many tradeoffs in comfort and \u201cartifacts\u201d to get there. The Quest is lighter than the Vision Pro at about 1.1 pounds, compared with between 1.33 and 1.4 pounds for the Vision Pro, depending on its configuration, making the Quest slightly slimmer and easier to wear for longer periods of time. Zuckerberg did give some praise to the Vision Pro for its eye-tracking system and mentioned that both headsets had gesture controls, but said that he believed the Quest 3 had better accuracy. \u201cQuest\u2019s immersive content library is a lot deeper,\u201d Zuckerberg said. He mentioned that Meta has been working with studios to make content and virtual reality games for a long time. And he added that if someone wants to YouTube or play on Xbox on a big screen, \u201cthat\u2019s only available on Quest right now.\u201d During his commentary, Zuckerberg commented that some Apple \u201cfanboys\u201d might get upset if someone claims the company isn\u2019t the leader in a new category. He hopes that Meta\u2019s open model will help its headset win overall in the new market. \u201cThe future is not yet written,\u201d he said.
