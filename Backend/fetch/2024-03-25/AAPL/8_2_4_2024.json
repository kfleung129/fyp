Maestri revealed a notable statistic about the importance of Apple\u2019s App Store business in the European Union, saying that it accounts for around 7% of Apple\u2019s global App Store revenue.  When asked about the App Store changes in the EU and how they could impact Apple\u2019s financials, Cook said: We announced a number of changes last week in Europe that would be in effect beginning in March, so the last month of the of the first calendar quarter of the second fiscal quarter. Those are some of the things that we announced include alternate billing opportunities, alternate app stores or marketplaces, if you will. We\u2019re also opening NFC for new capabilities for banking and wallet apps. If you think about what we\u2019ve done over the years, we\u2019ve really majored in privacy, security and usability. We\u2019ve tried our best to get as close to the past, in terms of the things that are that people love about our ecosystem, as we we can. But we\u2019re going to fall short of providing the maximum amount that we could supply because we need to comply with the with the regulation. In terms of predicting the choices that developers and users will make, it\u2019s very difficult to do that with precision. So, I will see what happens in in March. And CFO Luca Maestri added: As Tim said, these are changes that we\u2019re going to be implementing in March. A lot will depend on the choices that will be made. Just to keep it in context that the changes apply to the EU market, which represents roughly seven percent of our global App Store revenue.
