Industry participants like Apple AAPL, HP HPQ and 3D Systems DDD are benefiting from these trends. The improving availability of 5G-enabled smartphones has been a key catalyst for the industry participants. The launch of foldable and AI and ML-infused smartphones, tablets, wearables and hearables is another major growth driver for the industry participants. Robust demand for production printers, materials and software bodes well for 3-D printing solution providers. However, waning demand for consumer PCs and geopolitical challenges, including raging inflation and high interest, are major headwinds. Industry Description The Zacks Computer \u2013 Mini Computers industry comprises companies that offer smartphones, desktops, laptops, printers, wearables and 3-D printers. Such devices are based either on iOS, MacOS, iPadOS, WatchOS, Microsoft Windows, or Google Chrome and Android operating systems. The companies predominantly use processors from Apple, Intel, AMD, Qualcomm, NVIDIA and Samsung. Expanding screen size, better display and enhanced storage capabilities have been the key catalysts driving the rapid proliferation of smartphones. This has been well-supported by faster mobile processors. Laptops, both consumer and commercial, benefit from faster processors, sleek designs and expanded storage facilities. The addition of healthcare features has been driving the demand for wearables. 3 Mini Computer Industry Trends to Watch Enterprise Adoption Remains Healthy: Strong enterprise demand has been benefiting the industry participants.

Improved graphics quality is making smartphones suitable for playing sophisticated games. This is driving the demand for high-end smartphones and opening up significant opportunities for device makers.PCs Face Extinction Risk: Personal computers (desktops and laptops), be it Windows or Apple\u2019s MacOS-based ones, have been facing the risk of extinction due to the rapid proliferation of smartphones and tablets.
