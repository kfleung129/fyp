    "text": " When does a falling knife become just too tempting not to try and catch? With the broader equity market surging to record highs on the back of a risk-on sentiment that keeps getting stronger, there are only a handful of stocks out there that are plummeting right now. One such stock is\u00a0Dropbox, Inc. NASDAQ: DBX, whose shares were, as recently as two weeks ago, trading at a multi-year high but have since\u00a0fallen some 30%. It will be a bitter pill to swallow for Dropbox investors, who\u2019ll be forgiven for wondering why it\u2019s their stock, out of the\u00a0hundreds of tech companies\u00a0out there, that\u2019s bucking the wider trend. It all started going wrong for the cloud storage giant around St. Valentine\u2019s Day when they released\u00a0their Q4 earnings. In a sign of just how fickle investors can be, the stock sank despite Dropbox landing a solid beat on expectations for both the headline revenue and bottom-line earnings. Further bright spots in the report included the company\u2019s expansion into artificial intelligence (AI) opportunities and the solid increase in average revenue per paying user year on year. Operating margins were also much improved, but the slowing growth, especially with Dropbox\u2019s revenue seems to outweigh all of these bullish signs. For the fourth straight quarter, Dropbox\u2019s ARR was down a pattern that would give even the most bullish investor something to worry about. Dropbox\u2019s shares gapped down at the open and haven\u2019t really paused for breath since. Yesterday\u2019s 2.5% drop put the stock back at 2018 levels. On the same day,\u00a0NVIDIA Corp\u2019s NASDAQ: NVDA\u00a0earnings sent the rest of the market soaring. So, what\u2019s the angle here? Are we looking at a\u00a0serious entry opportunity that\u2019s going to start soon emerging as Dropbox\u2019s fall levels out, or is this one of the few tech stocks that should be steered clear of? Before diving in, it\u2019s important to note that even with the preceding quarters showing slowing revenue growth, Dropbox shares still had no trouble rallying through last year. Indeed, through the start of this month, they\u2019d gained almost 80% since March of last year, with much of those gains coming since last November. However, it\u2019s looking like the report from the other week was the final straw for any of the remaining bulls who\u2019d been happy to overlook the warning signs from last year. In the two weeks since the report, the commentary from the analysts has all been one way down. Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase are just two of the heavyweights who moved their rating on Dropbox shares down from a Buy. However, what\u2019s interesting here is the velocity of the stock\u2019s current drop, both the refreshed and lowered price targets from those analysts' teams above where Dropbox shares are trading today. Bank of America lowered its price target\u00a0from $34 to $28, while JPMorgan Chase lowered it from $33 to $33. With Dropbox shares set to go into the weekend well beyond the $24 mark, you can\u2019t help but get the sense there\u2019s a serious entry opportunity opening up here. Taking the more optimistic of those price targets, we\u2019re looking at a targeted upside of at least 35%, a potential return that should tempt even the more cautious investor. Backing up the entry opportunity thesis is the stock\u2019s relative strength index (RSI) reading, which, at 19, is screaming oversold conditions. Rarely does a stock maintain its downward pressure when the RSI is so extreme, and were Dropbox shares to show any signs of stabilizing in Friday\u2019s session, they\u2019d be very good value to pop higher into next week. The company will need to deliver a strong report next quarter that shows plenty of revenue growth to truly turn things around, but that doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s not an opportunity to capitalize on a potential overreaction in the meantime.
