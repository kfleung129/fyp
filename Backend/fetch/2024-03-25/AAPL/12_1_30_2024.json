Another major change that iOS 18 could bring is the support for RCS, which is a new standard for messaging that offers more features and functionality than the traditional SMS or MMS. Apple announced in November that it plans to adopt RCS on iOS in 2024, after facing pressure from the industry and consumers to do so. However, Apple also confirmed that messages from Android users to iPhone users would still appear in green bubbles, indicating that they are not using iMessage. iOS 18 is still in development and may change before its official release, which is expected to happen in September, along with the launch of the new iPhone models. More details about the software update may emerge as the WWDC event approaches in the next few months.
