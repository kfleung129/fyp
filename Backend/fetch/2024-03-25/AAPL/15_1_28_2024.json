    "text": "A veteran\u00a0Apple executive who oversaw the company\u2019s electric vehicle efforts is reportedly resigning. DJ Novotney, a vice president of hardware engineering, is leaving Apple after nearly 25 years to take a job with electric vehicle maker Rivian Automotive, Bloomberg News reported Sunday (Jan. 28), citing sources with knowledge of the matter. According to the report, these sources say Novotney was a senior lieutenant to a number of Apple\u2019s key hardware engineering executives and was a major player in developing several generations of the iPod and iPhone, and was chosen by former hardware chief Dan Riccio to help lead development of the iPad. \u201cGreat products are what we do best and I have been so very lucky along the way to be part of so many amazing teams that developed everything from iPod, iPhone, iPad, Watch and so many more,\u201d Novotney wrote in a memo to colleagues seen by Bloomberg. \u201cApple has been my life, but now is the time for me to move on and help bring to life a new set of products.\u201d The news comes days after a separate Bloomberg report that Apple had scaled back and\u00a0delayed its plans\u00a0to put out a vehicle. Apple had initially hoped to release a fully autonomous vehicle, but has now apparently lowered its ambitions and is now focusing on an electric vehicle (EV) with more limited features, including more basic driver-assistance features. These changes are happening amid consumer unease about EVs, something PYMNTS\u2019 Karen Webster examined last month. She wrote that this hesitancy is \u201cmade more real\u00a0when considering that there are only 160,000 charging stations in the U.S. right now \u2014 and even fewer supercharging stations that provide a top up in 30 minutes.\u201d Most take three to four hours to generate a full charge. And while the White House has said it plans to pay to\u00a0develop 500,000 stations, that number is still short of the 700,000 that would be needed in a scenario in which 40% of vehicles in the U.S. were electric. \u201cThe problem facing the EV ecosystem today is there were not enough early adopters to create sufficient demand for suppliers of charging stations, so the U.S. lacks the density of fast charging stations that later adopters of EVs would require to give up gas,\u201d Webster wrote. \u201cAnd investors in EVs may have underestimated the importance of that and overestimated the willingness of consumers to overlook battery anxiety based on the enthusiasm of those early adopters.\u201d  We\u2019re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.
