    "text": "Countdown to Luke Lango\u2019s \u201c2nd Trillion-Dollar A.I. Trade\u201d The U.S. govt just unlocked an $8 trillion market to move in a new direction. See how it could unleash 6,000% potential upside. The Street's worries about PYPL stock are way overdone Advertisement Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com The Street\u2019s worries about\u00a0PayPal\u00a0(NASDAQ:PYPL) stock are way overdone. Eventually, these concerns, pushing\u00a0the shares down\u00a080% from their August 2021 high of $289, will become much less intense, enabling PYPL stock to soar far above its current levels. Specifically, investors\u2019 trepidation about PayPal\u2019s falling profit margins and its competition from\u00a0Apple\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL) will eventually be unfounded. As a result, I view PYPL as a strong buy at its current levels. Also importantly, the company\u2019s new CEO is likely to boost the firm\u2019s bottom line, while the valuation of PYPL stock remains extremely attractive. In July, research firm\u00a0MoffettNathanson\u00a0issued a negative note\u00a0on PYPL stock, citing increasing competition from\u00a0Apple\u2019s Apple Pay. According to\u00a0Barron\u2019s,\u00a0the bank reported that \u201cApple Pay is available on 80% of iOS apps, compared with 44% for PayPal. That could be a problem for PayPal given the ubiquity of Apple devices.\u201d But globally, iPhone users\u00a0spend an average of only\u00a0$10.40 monthly on their apps, representing a small percentage of their total spending. And, of course,\u00a0most of the world\u2019s\u00a0consumers actually have Android phones, not iPhone devices. Specifically, \u201cApple claims 650 million active App Store users while Google claims 2.5 billion active users.\u201d Moreover,\u00a0MoneyTransfers.com\u00a0estimated in October\u00a0that \u201cApple Pay\u2019s market share of online payments is 6.21%.\u201d Given that Apple Pay has been available for several years, the data point suggests that the service hardly represents a huge threat to PayPal, which had a 40% share\u00a0as of last\u00a0July. The Street, which has tremendous reverence for Apple, tends to greatly estimate how much the firm\u2019s offerings will grow and cause headaches for its competitors. For example, before Apple TV launched, many analysts were convinced that the service would dominate the streaming space. In fact, by my predictions at the time, it became barely more than a blip in the sector. The Street\u00a0has also been very concerned\u00a0about a slight decline in PayPal\u2019s margins, as its operating margin shrank from about 23% in Q2 2019 to 22.2% in Q3 2023. During the coronavirus pandemic, the company\u2019s operating margin reached a high of 28%. Large investors sometimes get obsessed with profit margins, causing the shares of companies whose margins are dropping to sink sharply. Eventually, however, increases in total profits usually cause stocks to climb. For evidence of that assertion, consider large oil companies, which have notoriously low margins but have generally managed to keep their stocks moving higher over the years. And PayPal\u2019s profits\u00a0have generally continued to\u00a0climb meaningfully, jumping to $3.76 billion in the 12 months that ended in September 2023 from $2.42 billion in the 12 months that ended in September 2022. As\u00a0I noted in a previous\u00a0column, PayPal\u2019s new CEO, Alex Chriss, said on Nov. 1, \u201cSimply put, our cost base remains too high, it is actually slowing us down.\u201d The CEO indicated he would sharply cut the firm\u2019s costs going forward. As PayPal reduces its spending, its margins will likely increase, making the Street more bullish on PYPL stock. Finally, PYPL stock has a very low, attractive forward price-earnings ratio of 11 times.
