    "text": "Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: Microsoft is back on top. After trailing behind Apple for the majority of the past decade, Microsoft is the world\u2019s most valuable publicly traded company as of market close on Friday. The tech giant\u2019s stock (MSFT) closed at $388.47 a share on Friday, giving it a market capitalization of $2.89 trillion. Apple\u2019s stock (AAPL) closed at $185.92 a share, for a market capitalization of $2.87 trillion. Market capitalization \u2014 or market cap \u2014 is the total value of all the shares of a publicly traded company. In other words, it\u2019s the market value of the company. Microsoft\u2019s rise to the top comes after the company had a stellar year thanks to its success with generative artificial intelligence. In 2023, the company\u2019s CEO, Satya Nadella, made\u00a0a multi-billion dollar investment in AI, including commercializing and adding AI tools like ChatGPT into its suite of products before rivals. He even strengthened Microsoft\u2019s ties to ChatGPT maker OpenAI, a major pioneer in the field of artificial intelligence, during a board and leadership upheaval at the smaller company late last year. Apple, meanwhile, is facing a barrage of problems. iPhone sales are slowing in part because of the Chinese government\u2019s reported efforts to restrict purchases (Beijing denies it has put any restrictions in place). That\u2019s helped Chinese smartphone maker Huawei to gain market share. Apple also recently contended with a brief ban from selling the latest Apple Watch models in the United States. Microsoft declined to comment, while Apple did not return CNN\u2019s request for a comment. Most stock quote data provided by BATS.
