Alphabet Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) subsidiary Google is poised to begin\u00a0manufacturing its Pixel smartphones in\u00a0India as soon as the next quarter, according to a report by Nikkei. This move signifies a strategic pivot for the tech behemoth\u00a0to diversify its supply chain\u00a0and penetrate the burgeoning Indian smartphone market. The production line for the premium Pixel 8 Pro is set to be established\u00a0in Southern India in the\u00a0coming weeks. This will be\u00a0followed by the Pixel 8\u00a0production in Northern India by mid-year. The tech giant\u00a0is\u00a0initially starting with limited production\u00a0volumes. This move comes as India's reputation as a smartphone manufacturing hub continues to grow. Tech forerunners such as\u00a0Apple, Samsung, Oppo, and Xiaomi\u00a0are extending their presence in the region.

The decision mirrors a larger industry trend towards a 'China+2' strategy. This approach seeks to establish\u00a0multiple non-China production bases to\u00a0ensure supply chain resilience. Google's foray into India\u00a0follows up on the 2023 announcement regarding\u00a0the release of its first\u00a0India-manufactured Pixel phones. With this venture, Google joins the ranks of\u00a0Apple and Samsung in capitalizing\u00a0on the vast Indian market.\u00a0The Indian government's efforts to transform the country into\u00a0a tech manufacturing powerhouse through\u00a0incentives and potential import restrictions\u00a0further attract companies like Google. Similar actions are being taken by\u00a0other tech giants like Apple,\u00a0Acer, and ASUS, which are\u00a0also escalating their production efforts in India.
