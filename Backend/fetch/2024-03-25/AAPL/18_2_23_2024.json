    "text": "Mike O\u2019Rourke, chief market strategist at Jones Trading and creator of the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d name for Big Tech stocks, believes the title has already lost its functionality. Indeed, O\u2019Rourke recently released a note titled, \u201cR.I.P. Magnificent Seven Era,\u201d arguing the tag is now defunct. Is he right? According to O\u2019Rourke, who claims to have made the moniker in spring 2023, the Magnificent Seven refers to the main seven stocks that have driven market sentiment recently. O\u2019Rourke believes the term is no longer adequate to describe the major market movers. The Magnificent Seven, as it is currently known, consists of Alphabet GOOG, Amazon AMZN, Apple AAPL, Meta META, Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia NVDA and Tesla TSLA. However, O\u2019Rourke now maintains that Meta and Nvidia represent the two titans of the original seven. He even suggests they may merit their own title, perhaps \u201cThe Terrific Two.\u201d \u201cIt was last April when we coined the term \u2018Magnificent Seven\u2019 to encapsulate the seven largest stocks in the S&P 500 as they drove 88% of the index\u2019s gains in the first 4 months of 2023,\u201d O\u2019Rourke noted Thursday. \u201cToday\u2019s events, along with others that unfolded thus far in February 2024, have sown the seeds for the end of that remarkable run.\u201d Nvidia\u2019s Recent Surge Fuels Speculation That \u2018Magnificent 7\u2019 Has Dropped to Just 2 O\u2019Rourke\u2019s claim isn\u2019t without precedent. Nvidia added a record $277 billion in market capitalization Thursday, following the company\u2019s outstanding Q4 earnings report Wednesday. In doing so, Nvidia broke Meta\u2019s previous record set earlier this month. \u201cThese two companies, along with these moves, are playing a prominent role in slaying the Magnificent Seven as we know them,\u201d O\u2019Rourke wrote. \u201cThis earnings season has shown that Nvidia and Meta Platforms have both lower multiples and significantly faster growth than other Magnificent Seven names, and that is why other members will be deemed less attractive given their expensive multiple and megacaps status.\u201d O\u2019Rourke also commented on the potential weaknesses of other members of the Mag 7 in comparison to Meta and Nvidia. Indeed, according to O\u2019Rourke, Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon all have major hurdles to jump to have growth potential comparable to META and NVDA. Tesla is a particularly tough fit within the Magnificent Seven, as it is forecasted to show a dip in earnings, while still trading at 65 times forward earnings. Indeed, Tesla is easily the biggest loser in the group this year. It is down about 22% year-to-date, at the time of writing. \u201cWhen the valuation and growth prospects become this distorted among leadership names, investors will start rotating towards the winners and maybe even look elsewhere for new opportunities,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said. It\u2019s worth noting that not everyone is in agreement that O\u2019Rourke coined the term Magnificent Seven. Indeed, some maintain it was Michael Hartnett, Bank of America analyst. However, it is still difficult to say who was truly first.
