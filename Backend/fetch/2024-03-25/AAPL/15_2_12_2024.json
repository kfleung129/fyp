    "text": "Apple recently launched its Vision Pro mixed reality headset in the US, which has attracted a lot of attention from both the Cupertino company's loyalists and critics for its unique features and futuristic-looking technology. However, a new report claims that Apple may be looking to implement many of these innovative features in its iOS 18 operating system, which is likely to be announced at its WWDC 2024 developer conference. According to a report by The Verifier, Apple is looking to bring many of the visual elements of visionOS to iOS 18 and iPadOS updates. In particular, Apple hasn't made many drastic changes to its operating system for iPhones and iPads in a long time, and this could change with the iOS 18 update. The report notes that iOS 18 will bring a facelift with a fresh design in everything related to the user interface, including menus, built-in apps and Safari. The visionOS interface is inspired by iOS, but thanks to a complex background and floating windows, elements in visionOS have rounded corners, shadows and depth, 9to5Mac reports. Generative AI in iOS 18:\u00a0A recent report by Bloomberg's Mark Gurnman had also revealed that Apple is working on bringing a number of AI features to its iOS 18 update.
