Here is a list of our partners and here's how we make money. 4.5 For Apple users, Apple Pay Later may be an especially convenient way to delay full payment on a purchase without incurring interest or fees. Apple is the newest entrant into the \u201cbuy now, pay later\u201d space. Its classic pay-in-four plan, known as Apple Pay Later, is similar to other BNPL plans but promises no interest or fees, making it a particularly affordable credit option for borrowers. You can use Apple Pay Later to make online and in-app purchases up to $1,000, and eligible users can apply in the Apple Wallet mobile app. \u00bb COMPARE: The best buy now, pay later apps Loan amount $75-$1,000. Payment structure Pay-in-four plan. Interest 0%. Availability Available online and in-app. Conducts soft credit check Yes. Minimum credit score None. Late fee No late fee. Other fees No other fees. Option to reschedule a payment No. Pauses account when payment is missed Yes. Apple Pay Later divides your purchase into four equal installments, with the first installment due at checkout and the remaining three installments due every two weeks until the loan is paid off. For example, if you use Apple Pay Later to make a $400 purchase, you\u2019ll pay $100 at checkout. You\u2019ll then have three remaining installments \u2014 each $100 \u2014 spread out over six weeks. The first payment is taken from the debit card you use to check out. Future payments are managed in the Apple Wallet mobile app, where you can change your payment method, make payments early, make extra payments or pay off the loan entirely. You can also view the total amount due for Pay Later loans in the next 30 days. Apple Pay Later is available for online and in-app purchases, but the merchant must accept Apple Pay. \u00bb MORE: Apple announces BNPL feature, Apple Pay Later Whether you should use Apple Pay Later depends on your financial situation. Weigh the pros and cons below to decide whether it\u2019s the right fit for you. No interest or fees: Apple Pay Later charges zero interest or fees, which makes this a particularly affordable way to access credit, especially compared with other financing options like a credit card, where you can accrue interest and fees each month, depending on your repayment behavior. Convenient application and approval: If you already have an iPhone or iPad with access to Apple Pay Later, you can apply for a Pay Later loan directly from your device with no hit to your credit score. For Apple users, this may be a more convenient option than setting up an account with a different BNPL provider. Consumer-friendly features: Apple Pay Later has several built-in features that help protect users. For example, if you miss a payment, Apple won\u2019t approve you for additional Pay Later loans until you\u2019ve caught up, which can help you avoid overextending yourself. You also can only check out with a debit card. Many BNPL providers let you tie your account to a credit card, which means you\u2019re paying for credit with credit. Autopay flexibility: You aren\u2019t required to opt in to autopay to check out with Apple Pay Later. Though autopay can be a convenient way to make payments, it can also lead you to overdraft your bank account if you don\u2019t have enough money on your debit card to cover an installment. If you do check out with autopay, you can turn it off at any time. Also, if your payment is declined while autopay is enabled, Apple will automatically turn off autopay to prevent overdrafts. Credit reporting: Apple reports payment history for Apple Pay Later loans to the credit bureau Experian. That means other lenders can see your Apple Pay Later loan information if they pull your Experian credit report, which could help prevent overextension across credit products. According to Experian, this reporting isn't currently factored into credit scores but may be in the future. Small loan amounts: Apple Pay Later offers loans only up to $1,000, which is smaller than those of some BNPL providers. If you want to break up a large purchase, like a new computer or furniture, you may not be able to use Apple Pay Later. Only one type of payment plan available: Apple doesn\u2019t offer a monthly financing option, which other BNPL providers do. Monthly plans let you break up payments over a longer period \u2014 think three months to five years \u2014 which can help you finance a larger purchase. These plans can come with interest, though, and are not always a good fit for borrowers. Not available for in-store use: Apple Pay Later is available only for online and in-app purchases, which means you can\u2019t use Apple Pay Later to shop in stores, unlike most other BNPL providers. You can now use \u201cbuy now, pay later\u201d to check out at most retailers. The type of payment plan \u2014 and whether it charges interest or fees \u2014 depends on the BNPL provider, so it\u2019s important to pay close attention to the loan terms you\u2019re offered at checkout. For some users, BNPL is a smart way to break up a purchase, especially if you get a zero-interest offer and are positive you can afford the installments. Getting approved may also be easier compared with credit cards or loans because there\u2019s no minimum credit score requirement. But BNPL is still a form of debt, and there are risks. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau released a study in September 2022 raising concerns about inconsistent consumer protections, the ease of debt accumulation and overspending, and data harvesting and monetization. Another CFPB study from March 2023 identified BNPL users as more likely to show signs of financial distress. BNPL pros BNPL cons Zero-interest plans available. No minimum credit score required. Available at most major retailers during checkout. Some plans may charge interest. Some plans may charge fees. Payments may not be reported to the three main credit bureaus. Easy to overspend. Disputes and returns can be challenging. NerdWallet recommends using BNPL only for necessary expenses. Though BNPL can be a convenient and low-cost payment option, you\u2019re still taking on debt, and it\u2019s rarely a good idea to go into debt for a nonessential purchase. Approval for Apple Pay Later is based on your credit report, details about your purchase and any previous payment history you may have with Apple Pay Later. Every purchase you make is a separate loan and requires individual approval. To get approved, you\u2019ll need to be at least 18 years old and be a U.S. citizen or a lawful resident with a valid U.S. address that's not a P.O. Box. You might need to verify your identity with a driver\u2019s license or other state-issued ID. You\u2019ll also need to update your iPhone or iPad to the latest version of iOS or iPadOS and set up two-factor authentication. A valid debit card is required to check out with Apple Pay Later. Apple may conduct a soft credit pull when you apply for Apple Pay Later. This won\u2019t affect your credit score. Though there\u2019s no minimum credit score required, users with a 610 FICO score or lower may have a harder time getting approved, according to Apple\u2019s website.
