    "text": "Microsoft is back on top. After trailing behind Apple for the majority of the past decade, Microsoft is the world\u2019s most valuable publicly traded company as of market close on Friday. The tech giant\u2019s stock (MSFT) closed at US$388.47 a share on Friday, giving it a market capitalization of US$2.89 trillion.
