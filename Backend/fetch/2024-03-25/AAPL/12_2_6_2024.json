    "text": "Generative AI startup Midjourney Inc. scooped up Apple Vision Pro's former hardware engineer manager, Ahmad Abbas, to lead its hardware efforts. What Happened: Abbas joined Midjourney as the head of hardware in December. Before this, he led Apple Inc.'s AAPL Vision Pro development for five years. He also had a brief stint at Elon Musk\u2019s Neuralink. Abbas has worked with Midjourney founder David Holz before his stints at Neuralink and Apple, as well as at Leap Motion, a company Holz founded in 2008.

There is speculation that suggests it could be a device capable of creating and managing thousands of 3D rooms. Holz hinted at its potential use for AI-generated 3D worlds and possibly real-time video games. In a 2022 prediction, Holz suggested a game console with an AI processor capable of real-time game generation could be a reality within a decade. With Abbas now part of the team, this could happen sooner than anticipated. Why It Matters: The recruitment of Abbas, who played a significant role in the development of Apple Vision Pro, is a significant move for Midjourney. The Vision Pro is known for its capabilities in scanning objects and surfaces in real time. With Abbas\u2019 expertise and the shared vision between him and Holz, Midjourney\u2019s \u201cOrb\u201d project could have a major impact on the generative AI industry.
