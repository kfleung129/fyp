The $3,500 virtual reality device was unveiled last year, taking up a large portion of the company\u2019s annual September tubthump for new products and technology.

The Vision Pro\u2019s main lens adjusts to lighting and user preference, so it can be worn for longer periods, with the user able to interact with other people, the company maintains. It is controlled by eyes, hands and voice, via a newly customized operating system. In addition to lean-forward activities like videoconferencing, the Vision Pro also features games, movies and series, including titles from Disney+ and Max. About 250 games will be available at launch from Apple Arcade, including several titles designed for the Vision Pro. The device uses Apple Immersive Video, which presents films and series in 3-D 8K wrapping 180 degrees around the viewer, with Spatial Audio. Pre-orders will be taken starting January 19. The sticker shock of the Vision Pro\u2019s price will be a new test of Apple\u2019s grip on consumers. Sales of the company\u2019s flagship iPhone have faltered in recent months, leading to downgrades of Apple stock by a few Wall Street analysts. Some skeptics have pointed to a Big Tech rival, Meta Platforms, which has pivoted toward virtual reality and even renamed itself from Facebook without much initial success. The counter-argument has been that Apple is in a unique position to entice more people to engage with VR, and that the $3,500 price point will come down as demand rises, making it more feasible for the Vision Pro to gain wider adoption. Apple even eschews the term virtual reality, referring instead to the concept of \u201cspatial computing.\u201d Best of Deadline 'Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux' Photos: All The Images Of Joaquin Phoenix And Lady Gaga Hollywood & Media Deaths In 2024: Photo Gallery & Obituaries 2024 Premiere Dates For New & Returning Series On Broadcast, Cable & Streaming Sign up for Deadline's Newsletter.
