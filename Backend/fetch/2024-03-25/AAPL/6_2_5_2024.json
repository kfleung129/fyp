    "text": "WALTHAM, MA \u2014 A company based in the Watch City is suing Apple, alleging that the company infringed on one of its patents for features on two Apple Watch bands. Boston Inventions, LLC., has filed a lawsuit in District Court, alleging that the patent infringement stems from a 2017 patent won by the company for its \"Hybrid Mechanical and Magnetic Fastening System.\" Specifically, Boston Inventions believes that Apple is using its technology in two products, the \"Apple Watch Leather Link\" and the \"Fine Woven Magnetic Link\". Though it's these two models the company said infringes on the patent, the lawsuit notes that there are at least two different colors and multiple case and band sizes being sold. According to the lawsuit, Boston Inventions reached out to Apple to inform them of the infringement and, according to the lawsuit, offered them the opportunity to license or purchase the patent. In a response, Apple \"feigns ignorance and sets forth dubious assertions related to non infringement and invalidity of the [patent], and then simply states that it does not require a license to continue blatantly infringing Plaintiff\u2019s patent.\" Boston Inventions is seeking both financial compensation and interest on that compensation, from Apple in the lawsuit. The company also seeks a jury trial. Get more local news delivered straight to your inbox. Sign up for free Patch newsletters and alerts. "
