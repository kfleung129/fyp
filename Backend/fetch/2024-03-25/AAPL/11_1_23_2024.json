    "text": "Countdown to Luke Lango\u2019s \u201c2nd Trillion-Dollar A.I. Trade\u201d The U.S. govt just unlocked an $8 trillion market to move in a new direction. See how it could unleash 6,000% potential upside. You can acknowledge Apple's challenges but still have some exposure to AAPL stock Advertisement Source: Yalcin Sonat / Shutterstock.com Can Apple\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0stock have a \u201cmagnificent\u201d performance this year, like it did in 2023? Apple\u2019s investors should have realistic expectations on Wall Street. Despite being a large company, Apple still faces uncertainty in certain areas. We\u2019ll address Apple\u2019s challenges in a moment. If you already own Apple stock, you\u2019ll likely want to continue holding or possibly add more shares. Most importantly, know your time frame in advance and, unless you plan to hold your Apple shares for decades, think about what you\u2019ll do if the trade goes against you. Regarding Apple in 2024, two areas of uncertainty immediately come to mind. First, there\u2019s no guarantee that Apple\u2019s Vision Pro mixed-reality headset will be a strong seller. This device carries a hefty $3,499 price tag, and one estimate claims that a high-end Vision Pro headset could cost $4,363 after taxes. Eventually, Apple could market this device, or a version of it, to a variety of businesses. There may be use cases for the Vision Pro headset in teaching, automobile repair and even surgery. However, this is just a concept now and it remains to be seen if there\u2019s strong demand for mixed-reality headsets in these areas. Another well-known issue for Apple is the company\u2019s lackluster smartphone sales in China. However, looking ahead to the future, Evercore analyst Anit Daryanani sees a silver lining to this problem: \u201cWe maintain our bullish stance on Apple and think buy-side expectations are likely below current consensus, so an in-line quarter would likely drive upside, especially if Apple can point to continued solid iPhone performance in China.\u201d If Apple can show notable improvement in China smartphone sales, there could be a swift rally in AAPL stock. Still, this is a scenario that might or might not play out in reality. We\u2019ll just have to keep tabs on Apple\u2019s data in the coming weeks. Of course, no discussion about Apple\u2019s technology tools can leave out the topic of artificial intelligence features. Without gen-AI functionality in its products, Apple would get left behind in the tech-gadget market. There\u2019s no need to worry about this, Bank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan seemed to suggest in his recent commentary. He expects Apple to \u201cintroduce AI driven features in iOS18 with monetization through better iPhone hardware and AI enabled third party apps.\u201d Furthermore, Mohan and other Bank of America analysts anticipate a \u201cstronger multi-year iPhone upgrade cycle driven by need for the latest hardware to enable Generative AI features to be introduced in 2024/2025.\u201d It\u2019s a reasonable expectation which seems to be echoed in a remark made by Melius Research analyst Ben Reitzes. He\u2019s looking forward to \u201cnew product launches and an AI strategy\u201d at Apple\u2019s \u201cDeveloper Forum in June.\u201d Staying objective means seeing both sides, bullish and cautious, for any stock. This even applies to a tech-gadget juggernaut like Apple. In 2024, extra due diligence will be needed if you\u2019re thinking about buying and/or holding Apple stock. Going forward, watch closely for fresh data on Apple\u2019s mixed-reality headset and smartphone sales in China. Also, look for Apple to develop new and interesting AI features for its iPhones and other devices, and above all else, keep your position size and your expectations reasonable with AAPL stock this year.
