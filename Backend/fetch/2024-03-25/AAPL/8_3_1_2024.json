Good morning, With the weekend just a few short hours away, it\u2019s understandable to already be contemplating what you might order when you go out tonight. If you\u2019re hitting the bar, it\u2019s best to keep up with the latest trends in the world of cocktails\u2014from savory, umami-forward drinks like one called \u201cCold Pizza,\u201d to interactive options that include flair and special glassware, cocktail fanatics are all-in on getting experimental in 2024. One of the trends that seems like it\u2019s here to stay: the increase in low- and non-alcoholic options available to order. \u201cThe non-alc category continues to grow at an astonishing rate,\u201d says Adam Montgomerie, bar manager at Hawksmoor NYC. Tata Steel steel mill close to the North Sea coast and port of IJmuiden on October 5, 2023 in Velsen. Global carbon dioxide emissions hit another record high in 2023, but the increase was smaller than the previous year due to the strong expansion of renewable sources. Extreme droughts across the world were key contributors to the rise in emissions last year, as they led to a shortfall in hydropower output and caused countries like the U.S. and China to turn to fossil fuels to cover the gap. Caitlin Clark, one of the biggest stars in women\u2019s basketball, announced she will enter the WNBA draft this April. Clark has broken a number of records in her final season at the University of Iowa, including becoming the all-time leading scorer in Division I women\u2019s basketball, and is estimated to make $910,000 on name, image and likeness deals this season. It was a hot February for stocks, as each of the three major indexes registered all-time highs for the month, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq each notched their best February returns since 2015, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average had its best February since 2021. It\u2019s a notable accomplishment for stocks to register such a big month, considering February is typically associated with below-trend returns due to the hangover of portfolio readjustments A SPAC formed by Korean billionaire Chey Tae-won\u2019s SK conglomerate is acquiring Webull Corp., a Chinese-owned online broker rival to Robinhood Markets, the companies said on Wednesday, in a deal that values the stock trading platform at approximately $7.3 billion.

Goya Foods heir Andy Unanue has listed this $32.7 million home for sale in Palm Beach, Florida. The luxury housing market is continuing on an upward trajectory that started at the end of 2023, according to the Institute for Luxury Home Marketing, and heirs to companies like Goya Foods, Bacardi and Bass Oil Producers have recently listed homes worth tens of million of dollars. Luxury homes in seasonal resort locations are expected to outperform traditional markets this year, according to Coldwell Banker. Shares of Apple dipped below $180 for the first time in nearly four months on Thursday, highlighting a difficult stretch for the stock as investors gravitate toward Apple\u2019s big tech peers who appear more readily positioned to capitalize on the AI boom. Long heralded for its market-beating returns, Apple has provided a worse return to investors than the S&P on a 6-month, 12-month and 2-year basis, according to FactSet data. A Yangwang U8 giant SUV is seen on the stand of the Chinese carmaker BYD at the Geneva International Motor Show in Geneva, on February 27, 2024. The Biden Administration announced Thursday that Chinese cars could eventually pose a risk to the U.S. by potentially collecting sensitive data about Americans and sending it back to Beijing. The president said he has directed Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo \u201cto conduct an investigation into connected vehicles with technology from countries of concern,\u201d though a senior official said that there is no imminent threat, and that the looming risk of Chinese cars is a \u201cnext few years\u2019 problem.\u201d Two founders of Trump\u2019s media business are suing the company they once started, claiming the business is trying to dilute their stakes in the company. United Atlantic Ventures\u2014a partnership founded by former Apprentice contestants Andy Litinsky and Wes Moss\u2014alleges the former president and other leaders recently attempted to \u201cdrastically dilute UAV\u2019s interests,\u201d in what the filing describes as \u201c11th hour, pre-merger corporate maneuvering\u201d to increase the amount of authorized stock from 120 million shares to one billion shares. The Senate\u2019s Committee on Energy and Natural Resources heard testimony this week about geologic hydrogen, a promising new form of clean energy generated naturally underground, which has attracted growing interest and investment in the past year. \u201cThis new source of hydrogen could lower energy costs and increase our nation\u2019s energy security and supply chains,\u201d Evelyn Wang, director of DOE\u2019s Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy told senators. UnitedHealth-owned Change Healthcare has confirmed the ransomware group \u201cALPHV/Blackcat\u201d is behind its recent cyber attack, as disruptions to pharmacies continue nearly a week after the attack was reported. The group reportedly posted about the attack on the dark web, claiming it had accessed \u201cmore than 6 TB of highly selective data,\u201d including medical and dental records, payment information and patients\u2019 private information from a variety of Change Healthcare partners. Former President Donald Trump renewed his calls Thursday for President Joe Biden to undergo a cognitive test, suggesting such a test should be mandatory\u2014but legal precedent suggests a required exam would defy the Constitution. Presidents are not required by law to undergo a physical or cognitive examination, though publicizing the results of annual physicals became routine practice under former President Richard Nixon. Though he\u2019s just four years older than Trump, polling suggests voters\u2019 concerns about Biden\u2019s age far outweigh those surrounding Trump. The crypto industry has long resisted having its tokens classified as securities. However, the success of bitcoin\u2019s spot ETFs, could prompt issuers to break ranks depending on the SEC\u2019s next move. TOPLINE Spring has come early to cryptoland. Bitcoin is trading above $60,000, up more than 167% in the last 12 months and more than $7 billion has poured into the new bitcoin ETFs. The market is buzzing with anticipation for an ETF backed by bitcoin\u2019s little brother ether, the native token associated with the Ethereum blockchain and used to create such things as NFTs. Ether has a market cap of more than $400 billion, second only to Bitcoin, whose market cap exceeds $1.2 trillion. In May, the SEC will likely pass final judgment on nine spot ether ETF applications. But unlike bitcoin\u2019s decision day in early January, which seemed to be a fait accompli, ether\u2019s outlook is far less certain. The most immediate concern is whether the SEC believes that ether is a security, which means that it would be subject to registration and regulatory oversight by the SEC under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Most ETFs, like the QQQ or the SPDR S&P 500 trust, fall under the so-called 40 Act, precisely because they are bundles of stocks, or registered securities. Despite the fact that cryptocurrencies seem to trade and behave much like any number of stocks in the market, the digital asset community believes that the thousands of different cryptocurrencies behind the $1.8 trillion dollar industry are not securities. In fact, they bristle at the thought, calling it anathema to the decentralized ethos that launched bitcoin 15 years ago. To some extent, these beliefs were vindicated when the SEC greenlit spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in January after a 10-plus year wait under the 1933 Securities Exchange Act, which recognized the underlying bitcoin in these funds as commodities. WHY IT MATTERS If the SEC decides that ether is a security, it will insist on ETF issuers treating it as such in their applications for approval. While this might seem like just a bunch of legal paperwork, doing so would be an affront to crypto industry insiders and idealists, and throw into question the status of thousands of cryptocurrencies. However, given the potential billions at stake for early movers in the new booming market for crypto ETFs, those that can gain market share rapidly as Blackrock, Invesco, Fidelity have with their bitcoin ETFs could benefit from such an SEC ruling. When it comes to asset gathering and profits, \u201ccrypto community ideals\u201d aren\u2019t likely to carry much weight. Said one applicant who requested anonymity, \u201cAt the end of the day, we'll file under whatever jurisdiction or regulation the SEC wants.\u201d MORE Crypto Billionaire Mike Novogratz On Bitcoin\u2019s Next Bull Run Forbes 30 Under 30 alum Timothy Latimer announced on Thursday new funding for his company Fervo Energy, which is pursuing the dream of harvesting limitless, zero-carbon energy from the Earth: $244 million: The total funding announced this week, led by Devon Energy, with help from billionaire John Arnold, Liberty Mutual and others 250 degrees Fahrenheit: The temperature of the naturally hot rock that Fervo Energy drills into, in a process that can be thought of as fracking for geothermal energy\u2014with no oil or gas coming from underground 8 megawatts: The amount of power from each of the three wells at a Utah pilot project that the company aims to produce\u2014enough to power about 8,000 homes with zero-carbon emissions In today\u2019s job market, it\u2019s not uncommon to see hundreds (or even thousands) of applicants on a job posting on LinkedIn, which can make it all the more confusing when a role like that is reposted. Counterintuitively, this might be the right time to apply: Job listings get the largest volume of applicants within the first 48 hours, and this brief window tends to yield enough quality candidates for recruiters to move forward. But if a role is later reposted, it probably means no candidate was selected, and there may even be a greater sense of urgency this time around.
