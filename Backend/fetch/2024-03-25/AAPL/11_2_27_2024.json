    "text": "\u201cPoliticians in both parties broadly agree that a handful of tech companies hold too much power.\u201d Those are the words of former U.S. attorney general, William P. Barr, from an opinion piece published in the Wall Street Journal. That they won\u2019t age well is a waste of words, but online writing allows for a little bit of waste. Unfortunately for Barr, but happily for the rest of us, truth isn\u2019t arrived at by counting heads. Time was when most politicians \u201cin both parties\u201d felt AOL was so dominant that its tie-up with Time Warner\nTWX\n had to be delayed so that the combined entity wouldn\u2019t control all of 21st century communication and entertainment. Missed by those formerly fearful of AOL, along with the Apple\nAAPL\n-fearful Barr, is that when politicians and government types more broadly stare at the commercial present, they\u2019re unwittingly staring at the past. This is worth keeping in mind as Barr writes with a certitude so common to those in the sheltered-from-market-realities political class, that \u201cKeeping markets free requires confronting anticompetitive abuses.\u201d Unbeknownst to Barr is that actual or would-be competitive businesses, including Apple, would give anything to know just which business tactics and strategies are \u201canticompetitive\u201d as a way of at least trying to remain relevant in the commercial arena. Except that they don\u2019t know. Barr\u2019s analysis imagines that tomorrow is a known, when in reality it couldn\u2019t be more uncertain. The latter explains why Microsoft\u2019s\nMSFT\n mistakes while Bill Gates ran the company vastly outnumbered the correct speculations about what was ahead. Figure that Microsoft was late on the internet, smartphones, social media, not to mention various errant products including Zune. What\u2019s true for Microsoft has also proven true for Amazon\nAMZN\n. If we ignore how long it took the powers-that-be to take a company formerly headquartered around porn and pawn shops seriously, we can\u2019t forget that Jeff Bezos long yearned for just a few successful ideas in order to fund the inevitable bad ones that would well outnumber the good. The digression into Microsoft and Amazon is necessary as a corrective to Barr\u2019s rather arrogant presumption that \u201cpower\u201d in the marketplace has permanent qualities, along with his similarly arrogant presumption about anticompetitive actions. The former imagines that the business present constitutes the frontier of progress, while the latter imagines that businesses operate with certainty about what consumers will want tomorrow. Except that they don\u2019t know these things. That\u2019s why Apple, Amazon, Microsoft and every other technology company with \u201ctoo much power\u201d is aggressively investing tens of billions annually in new ideas and unknown companies. The copious investment is a signal that they very much want to be competitive in the future, but quite unlike Barr, they\u2019re much less than sure about what will make them competitive. To understand the above better, consider Barr\u2019s odd lament that \u201cMore than half of the mobile devices in the U.S. are apple devices.\u201d If we forget that he should be celebrating Apple\u2019s remarkable success in the 21st century marketplace after nearly going bankrupt as the 20th century closed, we can\u2019t ignore how unlikely Apple\u2019s success with the iPhone was. Looking back to 2007 when the first iPhone was released, ahead of it then-Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer scoffed. In his words about the iPhone, \u201cFive hundred dollars? Fully subsidized? With a plan? I said that\u2019s the most expensive phone in the world and it doesn\u2019t appeal to business customers because it doesn\u2019t have a keyboard, which makes it not a very good e-mail machine.\u201d What about RIM/Blackberry, the at-the-time king of mobile devices? When asked to address Apple\u2019s smartphone in 2007, RIM/Blackberry CEO Jim Balsilie calmly responded that \u201cThe recent launch of Apple\u2019s iPhone does not pose a threat to Research In Motion Ltd.\u2019s consumer-geared BlackBerry Pearl and simply marks the entry of yet another competitor into the smartphone market.\u201d Hopefully readers see where this is going in the way that Barr seemingly does not. The very idea of \u201canticompetitive abuses\u201d that Barr writes about is rooted in the impossible notion that Barr can see into the future in the way that businesses plainly cannot. Which brings us to a close. It was on July 3, 2016 that the U.S. Senate finally switched from buying RIM/Blackberry devices to iPhone and Android models. Stop and think about that, but please don\u2019t be surprised that it took government years and years to catch up to the marketplace. Which is why Barr\u2019s fear of Apple shouldn\u2019t surprise us, while at the same time reminding us just how detached his analysis is from market realities. No, Apple does not violate antitrust law.  "
