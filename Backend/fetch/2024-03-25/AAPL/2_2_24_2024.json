And last month saw the 40th anniversary of the day Apple launched its Macintosh computer \u2014 Jan. 24, 1984. So this Jan. 24, Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak and other luminaries attended a special presentation at Silicon Valley\u2019s Computer History Museum, where long-time tech journalist David Pogue heard the Mac\u2019s origin story from the people who were there. Tales were shared by three different panels of \u201coriginal Mac team members and Apple insiders,\u201d according to the museum\u2019s blog post. The final panel even included Steven Levy, who famously chronicled his pre-launch meeting with the Macintosh team in his 1994 book Insanely Great: The Life and Times of the Macintosh, the Computer that Changed Everything. \u201cInsanely great\u201d was Jobs\u2019 description for what they were trying to do \u2014 along with \u201cput a dent in the universe.\u201d Levy told me that the panels were \u201ca joyous gathering.\u201d 40 years down the road, \u201cIt was great seeing them! Some of them have become friends, and others I hadn\u2019t seen for a long time.\u201d  Back in 1984, Macintosh engineer Andy Hertzfeld had told Levy \u201cWe\u2019re all maniacs. People want to be computer scientists, but we are also hackers, trying to make Macintosh incredibly small and tight and fast.\u201d And Levy\u2019s book cites CEO John Sculley\u2019s observation that the Mac team almost exuded \u201csome spiritual force, mesmerizing people\u2026 Excitement showed on everyone\u2019s face.\u201d Andy_Hertzfeld_1985_(cropped) \u2013 photo by Tony Wills \u2013 Creative Commons via Wikipedi But Levy makes a counterpoint. \u201cDay by day the evidence accumulated that they had it within their power to create something a quantum leap better than anything the industry, indeed the world, had ever witnessed. They believed they could make a dent in the universe.\u201d And whatever scale of reverberations might lay ahead, Levy had already heard this particularly far-reaching pronouncement from a 28-year-old Steve Jobs. \u201cComputers and society are out on a first date in this decade and for some crazy reason we\u2019re just in the right place at the right time to make that romance blossom\u2026\u201d Dan\u2019l Lewin, the Computer History museum\u2019s president and CEO, warmly opened the event \u2014 and then told the audience, \u201cThis one is special,\u201d since Lewin had also led the initial launch of the Macintosh during his time at Apple. Lewin believes history is about the present as much as the past \u2014 a conversation between both eras, he said, bringing a chance to \u201creflect forward\u2026 and ideally make the world a better place.\u201d And then Lewin added, almost as an aside, that changing the world had been Douglas Engelbart\u2019s intent from the very beginning\u2026 Working over at Xerox\u2019s legendary PARC R&D center, Engelbart had engineered (and eventually demoed) the ideas which \u201cbegot all of these things\u201d \u2014 including the idea of the mouse, and of overlapping application windows. In 1994 Levy wrote that Engelbart remained at least somewhat overlooked, while \u201cHis vision was at the mercy of those he inspired.\u201d Specifically, Levy recounted the tale of Engelbart\u2019s legendary demonstration for eight people from Apple, where an excited Steve Jobs \u201cnearly exploded\u201d when he said\u2026 \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you doing anything with this? This is the greatest thing! This is revolutionary!\u201d The first panel included Susan Kare, creator of all the Mac\u2019s icons and fonts, as well as three development team members. Macintosh engineer Bill Atkinson remembered demonstrating the Mac\u2019s predecessor, the Lisa, to Engelbart, and getting some impactful advice: \u201cIn your quest to make something user-friendly, be sure you don\u2019t lock out the power user who wants to go fast later.\u201d That very night, Atkinson added a feature still in use today. \u201cThe fact that there are keyboard shortcuts, I credit a little goading from Doug Engelbart.\u201d The panel also remembered how the Macintosh project had originally been started in 1979 (and supervised for its first year) by Jef Raskin, who had written the manuals for the Apple II. But while Rafkin started the project, he told Levy that \u201cIt was clear that Macintosh was the most interesting thing at Apple \u2014 and Steve Jobs took it over.\u201d Speaking in January, Macintosh engineer Andy Hertzfeld said Rafkin deserved a lot of credit \u201cfor putting together the vision of the Macintosh, which was if we could make a computer that was inexpensive and easy to use, we could sell computers by the millions.\u201d Hertzfeld says that even though Rafkin left the team, his original vision stuck with the project throughout its development. Steve Capps added that \u201cthe whole team \u2014 from manufacturing manuals to software to hardware \u2014 was 100 people. And that\u2019s just unheard of today.\u201d Levy\u2019s book says the team started as \u201ca scrappy assortment of outcasts and mutts\u2026\u201d The audience applauded when Susan Kare remembered the positivity and encouragement she\u2019d experienced from Steve Jobs. Levy\u2019s book also notes that in January of 1983, Steve Jobs scrawled three words onto an easel. \u201cReal artists ship.\u201d  But Bill Atkinson remembered another way Jobs motivated them. \u201cHe said, \u2018Real artists sign their work.\u2019 And he brought around a piece of white paper and sharpies, and all of us got to sign on them \u2014 and then he had those engraved on the hard tooling for the case. So if you take off the back of an original Mac, all of us have signed it. He wanted us to take pride in our work.\u201d Levy captured more of that sentiment in his book \u2014 remembering his 1984 interview with Steve Jobs. \u201cI look at most of the people I get to work with as artists,\u201d Jobs had said. \u201cI look at myself as an artist if anything.\u201d And when Levy said \u201cReally?\u201d Jobs had joked, \u201cSort of a trapeze artist.\u201d \u201cWith or without a net?\u201d \u201cWithout.\u201d But then Jobs said seriously \u201cIt\u2019s a way of expressing feelings. Wanting to put something back into the world.\u201d While we spend our lives eating the food that others have grown, \u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful, ecstatic feeling to create something that puts it back in the pool of human experience and knowledge\u2026 \u201cI\u2019m one of those people who think that Thomas Edison and the light bulb changed the world a lot more than Karl Marx ever did.\u201d Levy himself appeared on the final panel, along with Chris Espinosa, Apple\u2019s longest-serving employee, and former Apple Chief Evangelist Guy Kawasaki. And Levy remembered that using computers at that time \u201cwas like throwing messages over a fence\u201d \u2014 whereas opening folders on a Mac or using a cursor felt like finally interacting with the digital world. \u201cThat was the inflection point that I was seeing, right at that moment.\u201d The museum also held a panel with the marketing team \u2014 Andy Cunningham, Dan\u2019l Lewin, and Mike Murray \u2014 who remembered how Apple\u2019s Board of Directors had originally demanded that they not broadcast their soon-to-be-famous Super Bowl ad. Murray said even after their eventual triumph, he continued feeling a pressure to succeed. \u201cThe technical team was just so brilliant, and the work they had done \u2014 it was just so extraordinary, taking from Lisa and taking from PARC and putting it all in this small box. They had worked so hard \u2014 and we couldn\u2019t fail them\u2026 Though it was imperfect for the marketplace at the time, we had to get it out there, and we had to make it stick.\u201d  Levy spoke to Jobs before the launch, who insisted his motivation was a love for the users, the product, and the company that Apple could become. \u201cIf we fail, that will mean my entire worldview is all wrong.\u201d And Jobs went on to predict they\u2019d sell two million by the end of the next year. He was wrong. Levy\u2019s book notes that even in its first five years, barely one million Macs were sold. (\u201cIt almost failed\u2026\u201d Levy writes. \u201cThe Macintosh factory kept churning out gorgeous boxes that gathered dust in dealerships\u2026 Apple would experience months where it moved no more than five thousand Macs.\u201d) Apple showed a quarterly loss; it laid off 20% of its workforce, and \u201cThe board decided finally that Jobs was the problem.\u201d Just 16 months after the launch, Steve Jobs left Apple \u2014 not to return until 1997. In Levy\u2019s book, the Mac ultimately makes inroads with the arrival of serious business applications like the desktop publishing software PageMaker. The Macintosh was upgraded with more memory and a second plug-in floppy drive \u2014 and, crucially, a redesigned \u201cMac Classic\u201d was released for under $1,000. So in its second five years, from 1989 to 1994, Apple sold roughly 10 million Macintoshes. In his book Levy called the Mac \u201cbut a step in a path that was probably inevitable, the trail leading to a Digital Nirvana where all information, all music, all pictures, all transactions and all mental activity gets parsed into seething bits of ones and zeros.\u201d But, still \u2014 it was \u201cthe crucial step, the turning point\u2026\u201d Pogue told the audience at the Computer History Museum that the Macintosh was the result of people who\u2019d worked for \u201cinsanely long hours, for insanely low pay \u2014 because they believed in their mission\u2026\u201d And when he asked his audience to stand if they\u2019d ever worked on the Macintosh \u2014\u00a0 dozens did. At the end of the night, Lewin also acknowledged all of the people who\u2019d worked on the hardware \u2014 \u201cthe manufacturing infrastructure, and everything else. Because software\u2019s pretty, and there\u2019s a lot of good stories about marketing and everything else, but those who had anything to do with hardware \u2014 associated with any of these products \u2014 I just want to acknowledge the fact that we weren\u2019t able to put it all on stage.\u201d And the audience applauded loudly. At the end of the night the museum invited anyone who\u2019d worked in the Mac division to join a group photo for the museum\u2019s collection (Computer History Museum).
