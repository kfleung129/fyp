Jim Cramer recently talked about the top themes of 2024 he's eyeing. Cramer said that he likes to talk about themes that investors can always fall back to. Cramer's top theme for 2024 is, unsurprisingly, AI. Related to this theme, Cramer talked about his expectations for this year and said that he's expecting a few stocks from the Magnificent Seven group to fall from their 2023 glory. Some Mag. 7 stocks Cramer has been recommending investors in 2023 include Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA). Cramer said that Tesla will be first to go down in the Magnificent Seven group of stocks. Cramer criticized Elon Musk's latest demands in which he said he needs to take a 25% control of Tesla in order to make it a leader in AI and robotics. Cramer called this \"pure hubris.\" Cramer also talked about some research reports which believe Apple will have a terrible time in the start of 2024 amid problems in China. Regarding the election 2024 theme, Cramer said that there has never been a president more friendly for the stock market than Donald Trump was. \"He measured himself by the Dow,\" Cramer said of Trump. Cramer said that Trump will \"fight for the rich like no other\" and the analyst expects the former President of the US to speak against capital gain tax, which Cramer thought would result in \"market soaring.\" Methodology For this article we first listed down all the stocks Jim Cramer has been recommending investors to sell or stay away from over the past 12 months. From these stocks we picked stocks with the highest number of billionaire investors. We used Insider Monkey's proprietary database of billionaires and their stock holdings to find the number of billionaire investors for these companies Number of Billionaire Investors: 6 Jim Cramer has long been bearish on Riot Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:RIOT)\u00a0and recommending investors to stay away from this stock. Recently, Jim Cramer made the following comment about Riot Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:RIOT): \"Let\u2019s stop fooling around. If you want bitcoin, buy bitcoin. I think bitcoin\u2019s topping out, by the way, so I\u2019m going to say, enough is enough and ka-ching is ka-ching.\u201d In November 2023, Jim Cramer had said that Riot Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:RIOT) does not make any money and investors should own Bitcoin directly if they want to get exposure to crypto. Insider Monkey's database of billionaires shows that six billionaires had stakes in Riot Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:RIOT). Jim Cramer is bearish on RIOT but recommends buying Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA). Number of Billionaire Investors: 7 Earlier this month Jim Cramer categorically recommended investors to hit eject on semiconductor stock Navitas Semiconductor Corp (NASDAQ:NVTS). Jim Cramer said that Navitas Semiconductor Corp (NASDAQ:NVTS)\u00a0is not making any money. \" In this market, they\u2019ve got to make money...Let\u2019s just exit Navitas.\u201d A total of seven billionaires in Insider Monkey's database had stakes in Navitas Semiconductor Corp (NASDAQ:NVTS)\u00a0as of the end of the third quarter of 2023. Baron Discovery Fund made the following comment about Navitas Semiconductor Corporation (NASDAQ:NVTS) in its Q3 2023 investor letter: \u201cNavitas Semiconductor Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVTS) is a leader in gallium nitride (GaN) power semiconductors and a smaller player in silicon carbide (SiC) power semiconductors. These are both new materials used as a base (substrate) on which to print power-oriented chip circuits. Shares fell during the quarter as the stock was trading at a premium valuation heading into the quarter, and investors were broadly concerned about underlying demand conditions in key end-markets like smartphones. Despite near-term concerns, the company reiterated its outlook to double revenues in 2023, reported strong design win momentum, and indicated opportunity pipeline growth. Navitas sells monolithically integrated GaN power integrated circuit chips (completed printed circuit systems on a chip), which provide greater reliability and performance compared to competitors that supply discrete power devices (multiple individual, larger components put together on a chip). It recently purchased a silicon control company to drive integration and performance even further, and its SiC products offer high performance across many different applications. The company\u2019s high-power GaN product launches remain on track for data center, solar, and electric vehicle applications. We expect Navitas to gain share in the rapidly growing GaN and SiC power semiconductor markets over time, driven by its superior technology.\u201d Number of Billionaire Investors: 7 In early January, Jim Cramer recommended investors to \"move on\" from petroleum services company Tidewater Inc (NYSE:TDW).\u00a0Cramer said the stock has moved too much.
