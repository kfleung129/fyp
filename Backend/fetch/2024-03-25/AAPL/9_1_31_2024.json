    "text": "Dating app giant Match Group says it hasn\u2019t yet determined how it plans to adapt its products in light of the EU\u2019s Digital Markets Act (DMA), a new regulation that is forcing Apple to open up its platform to alternative app stores, third-party payments and more. Speaking to investors during the company\u2019s Q4 2023 earnings call this morning, Match President and CEO Gary Swidler noted that, like other companies including Spotify and Microsoft, there are questions and concerns with Apple\u2019s response to the legislation, but added that Match hasn\u2019t yet decided if it would opt into Apple\u2019s new rules. \u201cWe\u2019re still considering what this all means,\u201d Swidler said. \u201cWe\u2019re still looking at it, making sure we understand it,\u201d he explained. Apple announced last week a host of complicated rules around how it\u2019s complying with the DMA, which involve a new commission structure for apps distributed in the EU, including separate fees for the use of Apple\u2019s in-app payments and a new \u201cCore Technology Fee\u201d that applies to any business opting into the new rules. Alternately, app developers can choose to stay on the same system they are today, where they simply pay Apple a commission for in-app purchases that range from 15% to 30%, depending on the company size and other factors. In doing the math, several large companies realized Apple\u2019s DMA rules wouldn\u2019t actually provide them the discounts they had hoped for in an open app marketplace, where they could process their own payments and distribute apps outside the App Store. That\u2019s led to backlash from notable Apple critics, including Epic Games and Spotify, as well as others like Mozilla and Microsoft. Match is likely going to come to the same conclusion that the rules are not as favorable to their business as they had wanted them to be. However, Swidler noted there was the potential for the rules to change because, even though Apple had proposed new rules for its App Store and iOS platform, the European Commission still actually has to accept its proposal. \u201cAnd that, in and of itself, is far from assured,\u201d Swidler added. \u201cAnd so I think that will continue to play itself out over the next weeks or months as we get to that March 6 deadline.\u201d In addition, Match believes the fact that the new regulations are available to EU users could put pressure on other markets, like the U.S., to adopt similar measures. \u201cIf you\u2019re a consumer in the U.S., or you\u2019re a consumer in the U.K. \u2014 right next door to the EU \u2014 you start to wonder why our customers in the EU are getting benefits and we\u2019re not getting the same benefits. So if you\u2019re the government in those jurisdictions, you\u2019d say, well, our citizens deserve the same benefits as what we\u2019re seeing in the EU.\u201d Match has a relatively small percentage of its revenue in the U.K. that comes from iOS, the CEO noted, but it has a lot more revenue coming from the U.K. and North America, where similar laws regulating app stores would benefit the dating app maker, if they came to pass. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to see where this goes because we\u2019ve been waiting for this for a long time. And this is the first, tangible movement that we\u2019ve seen from the the regulators,\u201d Swidler said. He said Match estimated it could save $20 million in app store fees in the EU in the future. Match\u2019s earnings on Tuesday came out ahead of estimates with earnings of $0.81 per share, up from $0.30 per share a year ago. The company also posted revenues of $866.23 million for the quarter ending in December, up from $786.15 a year ago. For the full year, Match reported record revenue, up 6% year-over-year, to $3.4 billion.
