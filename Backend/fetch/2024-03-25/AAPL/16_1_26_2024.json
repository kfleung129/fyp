    "text": "January 26, 2024 8:41 AM \n\t\t\t\t\tPT Shortcuts maven Matthew Cassinelli proposes a useful enhancement to Apple Podcasts: However, I think Apple needs to go one step further in their next step and add timestamps to Apple Podcasts, a long-overdue feature that\u2019d enable users to share links to individual moments within a podcast, directly to a specific point in the transcript. Similar to what\u2019s already now available for Transcripts, listeners could tap on a paragraph, seek to the beginning of a sentence, and the use the Share sheet to not only \u201cCopy\u201d the text, but \u201cCopy link at timestamp\u201d \u2013 something I\u2019m surprised didn\u2019t come along with this feature. This is a great idea and frankly, I\u2019m kind of surprised that Apple hasn\u2019t offered this feature already. As Matt points out, it\u2019s in a couple of the company\u2019s other apps, and third party options like Overcast provide this kind of functionality. Sharing a podcast episode is good, but sometimes you want to tell somebody \u201cHey, listen to this part right here.\u201d Having a way to quickly and easily send that excerpt to someone seems like a no-brainer.
