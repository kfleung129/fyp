    "text": "Photo credit: Auguras Pipiras on Unsplash According to a report by Music Business, Apple Music plans to increase royalty payments to artists by 10% for tracks made in Spatial Audio. This initiative aims to promote the adoption of the technology and ensure that artists are fairly compensated for their time and investment. Starting in January, the financial incentive will be based on the proportion of plays. Spatial available plays will receive a factor of 1.1, while Non-Spatial available plays will continue with a factor of 1. Spatial Audio, introduced by Apple Music in June 2021, offers an immersive listening experience using Dolby Atmos technology. Eddy Cue, Apple\u2019s Senior Vice President of Services, believes this is the future of music, as it gives listeners the feeling of being on stage with the artist. Spatial Audio tracks on Apple Music can be identified by looking for the Dolby Atmos or Dolby Audio logo. For more information visit the official Apple website here. LATEST\nNEWS "
