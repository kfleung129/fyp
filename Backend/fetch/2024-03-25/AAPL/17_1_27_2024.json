    "text": "San Francisco: Swedish music streaming service Spotify\u2019s CEO Daniel Ek has criticised Apple\u2019s proposed App Store changes ahead of the EU Digital Markets Act (DMA), saying the changes are \u201cat best vague and misleading\u201d and a \u201cnew low for the company\u201d. In a blog post, the Spotify CEO alleged that under the false pretense of compliance and concessions, Apple has put forward a new plan \u201cthat is a complete and total farce\u201d. \u201cEssentially, the old tax was rendered unacceptable under the DMA, so they created a new one masquerading as compliance with the law,\u201d he argued. Earlier, Epic Games\u2019 CEO Tim Sweeney, whose company sued Apple over antitrust practices, also condemned Apple\u2019s plan, saying it was a case of \u201cmalicious compliance\u201d and full of \u201cjunk fees\u201d. Ek said that a completely new 0.50 cent Euro fee per download, every year, in perpetuity, to Apple for just allowing developers to exist on iOS \u201cis extortion, plain and simple\u201d. \u201cIf Apple\u2019s already charging a commission of 17 per cent (and 10 per cent for recurring payments) on digital goods purchased, why would they also need to charge an annual flat fee for every user?\u201d he argued. \u201cFrom our read of Apple\u2019s proposal, a developer would have to pay this fee even if a user downloaded the app, never used it and forgot to delete it. This will hurt developers, potential start-ups and those offering free apps\u201d. Under the new terms, if Spotify stays in the App Store and wants to offer its own in-app payment, \u201cwe will pay a 17 per cent commission and a 0.50 cent Euro Core Technology Fee per install and year\u201d. \u201cThis equates to us being the same or worse as under the old rules. With our EU Apple install base in the 100 million user range, this new tax on downloads and updates could skyrocket our customer acquisition costs, potentially increasing them tenfold,\u201d Ek noted. Apple has announced changes to iOS, Safari, and the App Store in the European Union in response to the DMA coming into force in March. For users, the changes include new controls and disclosures, and expanded protections to reduce privacy and security risks the DMA creates, the company said in a statement. The key news is that third-party app stores will be allowed on iOS for the first time. The changes will arrive with iOS 17.4 in March.
