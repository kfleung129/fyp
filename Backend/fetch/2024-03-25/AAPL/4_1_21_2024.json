    "text": "Stock Analysis Does the January share price for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value  by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value.  We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose.  Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example! We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws.  If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Apple We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period.  To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows.   Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years. A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today,  so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars: (\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$999b After calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage.  For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.2%. Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$195b\u00d7 (1 + 2.2%) \u00f7 (8.2%\u2013 2.2%) = US$3.3t Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$3.3t\u00f7 ( 1 + 8.2%)10= US$1.5t The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value,  which in this case is US$2.5t.  The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding.  Relative to the current share price of US$192, the company appears   around fair value    at the time of writing.   Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out. We would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows.  Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions.  The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance.  Given that we are looking at Apple as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt.  In this calculation we've used 8.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.191. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business. Whilst important, the DCF calculation  ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company.  It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model.  Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation.  For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation.  For Apple, there are three  essential  aspects  you should consider: PS.
