    "text": "If you are impressed by all the things that the Apple Vision Pro is capable of and want to grab one, you need first to find out an important truth about it. What Happened: An all-important scratch test by JerryRigEverything has revealed that Apple Inc.'s AAPL Vision Pro gets scratched very easily. This is despite Apple saying that the Vision Pro comes with a \"laminated glass\" on top. Although the Vision Pro\u2019s front glass is resistant to accidental damage, it was found to be highly susceptible to scratches. The YouTuber\u2019s experiments revealed that the Vision Pro\u2019s laminated glass has a plastic layer on top, making it extremely easy to scratch. Tests based on the Mohs scale of mineral hardness showed that the front glass of the Vision Pro gets slightly scratched at level two, with deeper scratches at level three. In comparison, most smartphone glasses scratch at levels six and seven.

Apple charges $799 to replace the front glass of the Vision Pro. With an AppleCare+ plan, the glass replacement will cost $299. Why It Matters: The Vision Pro, Apple\u2019s first-generation mixed-reality headset, was previously found to be sturdier than expected in durability tests, even after being dropped from a height of six feet onto a wooden floor. However, the latest tests revealing its vulnerability to scratches could be a concern for users. This comes at a time when buyers have started getting their hands on Apple Vision Pro, showcasing its revolutionary capabilities. Despite the mixed reviews, Apple\u2019s ambitious bet on the Vision Pro has attracted attention from industry leaders, including billionaire Elon Musk, who expressed his desire to try it out.
