    "text": "Apple\u2019s hardware team responsible for audio features on AirPods and other products has reportedly undergone some leadership changes. Gary Geaves, who has been crucial in the development of products like AirPods and HomePod, is stepping down from his role as the company\u2019s vice president in charge of acoustics in what is said to be a step toward retirement, Bloomberg\u00a0reported\u00a0Tuesday (Feb. 20), citing unnamed sources. Geaves will be replaced by\u00a0Ruchir Dav\u00e9, who is currently a top deputy in the team, according to the report. Apple did not immediately reply to PYMNTS\u2019 request for comment. The hardware team, consisting of about 300 employees, plays a significant role in Apple\u2019s audio products like AirPods and speakers, the report said. They work on sound and microphone technologies, as well as software features such as spatial audio, which have become popular selling points for Apple devices. The group is also involved in developing new products like wall-mounted smart displays and combined iPad and HomePod devices. This leadership change comes amidst other shifts within Apple\u2019s hardware engineering group, led by\u00a0John Ternus, per the report. For example,\u00a0Tang Tan, who was responsible for product design of iPhone, Apple Watch and AirPods, recently left the company. It was reported in December that Tan would join iPhone designer Jony Ive\u2019s firm\u00a0LoveFrom\u00a0to design an artificial intelligence (AI)\u00a0hardware device\u00a0for\u00a0OpenAI. In preparation for Tan\u2019s departure, Geaves\u2019 team was reassigned to report to Matt Costello, who oversees Beats headphones and HomePod, according to the report. Geaves, who joined Apple in 2011 after working at\u00a0Bowers & Wilkins, will remain at Apple as an advisor to Costello. Geaves had been planning to retire for a few years, and his move to an advisory role is seen as a step toward that, the report said. Under Geaves\u2019 leadership, products like AirPods have become top sellers, bringing in over $15 billion a year for the company, per the report. Geaves was also instrumental in the development of HomePod, which has gained momentum in recent years. The acoustics team at Apple has been working on revamping their product lineup, and consumers can expect new models in the coming months, the report said. This news comes about three weeks after it was reported that\u00a0DJ Novotney, a vice president of\u00a0hardware engineering\u00a0at Apple, was leaving to join electric vehicle maker\u00a0Rivian Automotive. We\u2019re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors. "
