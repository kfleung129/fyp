    "text": "JPMorgan has issued a rare stock target cut on Apple, lowering its target price by $10 to $215 on soft iPhone demand in China. According to AppleInsider, the stock target cut came after Apple\u2019s recent earnings report. The company revealed that its China iPhone sales declined \u201conly mid-single digits.\u201d Nonetheless, when combined with an 11% year-over-year revenue decline in China, JPMorgan opted to cut the stock price. \u201cApple looked to explain the F2Q revenue outlook for a roughly -5% decline y/y through the tougher compares on account of the iPhone supply fill-in during F2Q last year,\u201d wrote JP Morgan in a note seen by AppleInsider, \u201cexcluding which revenues are expected to track flat y/y despite a tough macro backdrop.\u201d \u201cHowever, putting aside the comparables, the key driver of the weaker outlook for the company in F2Q relative to expectations, which has more reaching consequences to the outlook beyond F2Q, is primarily the headwinds to Macs, iPad, and Wearables,\u201d the note continues. The firm also raised concerns about Apple\u2019s non-iPhone hardware sales, such as the Mac and iPad. \u201cWhile iPhones contribute a large majority of Product revenues for the company, and minor variances even in relation to comparables drive a significant variance in the financials,\u201d the note says, \u201cwe believe the bigger concerns from the EPS print will be demand for the other Hardware product categories.\u201d Given the importance of the Chinese market to Apple\u2019s growth, a decline in sales could spell trouble if the company cannot reverse it.
