Microsoft overtook Apple as the world\u2019s most valuable company, showing just how fast the night changes when artificial intelligence is involved. What does this mean? Apple has nailed steel laptops and headphones that perfectly compliment a workout outfit. Microsoft, though, has pulled ahead when it comes to the new shiny thing in tech: AI. On top of its stake into OpenAI, the firm\u2019s funneled cash into research and development, industry partnerships, and strategic acquisitions of firms like LinkedIn and GitHub, all in the pursuit of data and AI expertise. That\u2019s paid off: Microsoft has successfully rolled out AI solutions across its own business and turned its Azure division into the go-to cloud service for AI-curious companies. So by notching a market value of $2.89 trillion, Microsoft has tipped Apple off its long-held throne. Why should I care? For markets: AI\u2019s in for a makeover.

Keep an eye on any developments: any forays into AI might not be fully factored into Apple\u2019s stock yet. The bigger picture: Proaction is better than reaction. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has predicted that AI will affect nearly 40% of all jobs. And despite the promises of a fairer society, it\u2019s higher-income and younger workers who are expected to see their wages rise most in the future job market. But you can see this as an opportunity to join the upper ranks: next time you\u2019re twiddling your thumbs on a weekday evening, consider practicing with a new-age system like ChatGPT. ai apple bull market information technology international monetary fund microsoft tech valuation stocks us ai cloud geopolitics inflation Disclaimer: These articles are provided for information purposes only.
