    "text": "Leonardo Penuela Bernal/iStock via Getty Images Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is nearly finished making a new software tool for app developers that would rival Microsoft\u2019s GitHub Copilot and use artificial intelligence to predict and complete blocks of code, among other things, Bloomberg reported on Thursday. The Bloomberg report states that the company has been working on the tool for the last year as part of the next major version of its flagship programming software, Xcode. It has now expanded testing of the features internally and ramped up development ahead of a plan to release it to third-party software makers as early as this year, the report cited people familiar with the matter. Apple is also exploring the use of AI to generate code for testing applications, and currently, the company is pushing some of its engineers to try new AI features internally as part of their \u201cdogfooding\u201d effort to make sure they work properly before releasing them to outside developers, the report said.
