    "text": "Scott Olson Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares were downgraded by investment firm Barclays on Tuesday amid concerns over its hardware business, including the iPhone 15. Analyst Timothy Long lowered his rating on Apple shares to underweight from equal-weight, pointing out that sales for the iPhone 15 line, unveiled in September, have been uninspired. Long, who also cut his price target to $160, does not expect much from the iPhone 16 line, widely expected to be released in the fall of this year. In addition, he said there has been a \"lack of bounce back\" from the Macs, iPads and wearables business lines. Apple introduced new Macs, along with its new M3 processors, in October, and several new Macs last January. In its most recently reported period, Apple's Mac business generated $7.6B in revenue, down from $11.5B in the year ago quarter. Aside from hardware-related concerns, Long said he is not expecting revenue growth from Apple's services to be more than 10% in 2024. Services-related revenue clocked in at $22.3B last quarter, an all-time high for the company. Apple shares fell more than 3% in mid-day trading on Tuesday, their lowest levels in nearly seven weeks. Analysts are largely cautious on Apple (AAPL). It has a HOLD rating from Seeking Alpha authors, while Wall Street analysts rate it a BUY. Conversely, Seeking Alpha's quant system, which consistently beats the market, rates AAPL a HOLD. "
