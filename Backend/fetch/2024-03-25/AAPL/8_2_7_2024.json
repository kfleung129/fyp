Qantas - Qantas Frequent Flyer 11 Oct 2014 Total posts 693 \"Is this the next big thing in inflight entertainment ?\"Not by a long shot - for several reasons:If it were, this nascent technology has had 10+ years to develop. To whit, QF adopting the Samsung VR headset for trials in first class - back in 2015 !\u00a0Airlines are technically never leaders or visionaries when it comes down to front-line or emerging technology. Just look at the glacial rate of adoption of WiFi services on both international and domestic routes worldwide. Its only in the last 2 years that the likes of DL, AA and UAL have caught up with the likes of LCC JetBlue and Southwest in the provisioning of WiFi through the USA. And that's with land-based satellite networks overhead already.For this technology to work today to all its fantastic possibilities, it would require huge amounts of investments in bandwidth / storage, at a minimum. It also requires applications which embed VR / 3D / AI into software that distinguishes itself by being innovative, interesting, of 'perceived value' or even entertainment.\u00a0In that last category, the major tech firms may run into the 'gate-keepers' of the entertainment industry. That would be the likes of Warner Bros, Sony, Paramount, CBS, Vivendi, Netflix etc. Oh, and lets not forget Apple, Amazon, Google / YouTube as digital pre-cursor owners. Each would (and do) have their own philosophies to push.The Apple Headset is horrendously expensive. At USD $3,500.00 each,\u00a0 US reviewers are now estimating the ownership costs for the first 12 months add an additional USD $1,000.00 to the base costs of Apple's product.Hardware - Significant existing players already in the headset market include Facebook MetaQuest 2, Microsoft (Hololens), and devices from Occulus and Amazon. Each have the ability to release a technically superior product - and at a cheaper entry price level.Certainly, streaming a pre-produced video / digital film to a headset is no longer that challenging, for passive viewing. But adding 3D / Virtual Reality / immersive 'scenarios' and options will be complex.Technically, Apple is in an awkward position here. Apple is NOT a leader in either the VR or AI fields. Look to Meta / Microsoft / Alphabet (Google) / Amazon to lead in this area.\u00a0Meta has a serious commitment to the 'metaverse', Microsoft has a USD $ 70 billion commitment in terms of its recent Activision takeover and desire to be 'No. 1' in gaming, not to mention the USD $ 10 billion that MSFT has pumped into AI via its investment options. Alphabet is similarly mirroring MSFT - and both companies, along with Amazon - are the 3 leaders in 'cloud computing' and storage. Apple is clearly starting from behind here.The question is not whether \"the next big thing\" for travellers. The real questions are whether travellers see any interest in the technology, and more importantly, can the technology market leaders adopt their commercial products to serve a niche market (aircraft & travellers) at a rate that is both reclaimable and profitable.Airlines have been traditionally 'slow' to adopt digital technology. How many airlines have loaded their in-flight magazine, menu system, drinks ordering, duty-free catalogues. in-flight exercise regimens etc up online to their IFE systems ? Not a great deal.Certainly, the 'potential' is there, for this to be a leading technology. But in the airline / travel industry, the denominator will be \"at what cost\" vs. the tangible benefit ? Not by a long shot - for several reasons: If it were, this nascent technology has had 10+ years to develop. To whit, QF adopting the Samsung VR headset for trials in first class - back in 2015 !
