    "text": "Menu Apple has shut down a yearslong plan for an electric car with self-driving capability, multiple outlets report. Bloomberg first reported\u00a0that Apple had told close to 2,000 employees in an internal meeting Tuesday it would shut down the car project and reassign at least some staff to other areas within the company, including to its AI efforts. At least one executive attached to the car project was reassigned to report to Apple's head of AI strategy,\u00a0the New York Times reported, citing anonymous insiders who were familiar with Apple's moves. Apple reportedly spent billions of dollars on its autonomous car initiative, which would have put it in competition with Tesla.

The company has for years filed vehicle-related patents for\u00a0design touches\u00a0and\u00a0interface elements\u00a0such as steering wheels and control pedals. CEO Tim Cook has also more than once\u00a0publicly suggested\u00a0Apple had its eyes on self-driving technology. Cook made his first public comments about AI in a\u00a0Feb. 1 earnings call\u00a0this year. He said the company plans to invest in AI, \"where we continue to spend a tremendous amount of time and effort and we are excited to share the details of our ongoing work in that space later this year.\" Trending stories at Scrippsnews.com "
