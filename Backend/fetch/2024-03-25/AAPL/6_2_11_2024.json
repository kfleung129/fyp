And it turns out the Apple Vision Pro is perfect for remote workers like me who like to multitask. I used the Vision Pro for a full work day after unboxing it on Tuesday \u2014 and it combined all of my work-from-home guilty pleasures into one hub of work and play. When I connected my MacBook to the Vision Pro, the device turned into a mixed reality productivity wonderland: work tabs in one window, my comfort show playing off to the side in another, and a text thread of my friends' group chat floating near my head.

Still, the headset could be a game changer for remote workers. I still don't see myself taking the Vision Pro out in public to work while at the gym or on the train like others seem to be doing and the eye fatigue and the weight of the Vision Pro remain a concern. But having my home office in a headset is pretty sweet. Read next Jump to "
