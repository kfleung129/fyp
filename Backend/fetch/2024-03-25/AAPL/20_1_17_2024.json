    "text": "A look at what is and isn\u2019t working for both influencers and brands, and what the future of brand-influencer partnerships is likely to look like Through \u201cTogether Mzansi,\u201d McDonald\u2019s South Africa demonstrates an unwavering commitment to enhancing community living conditions Apple has\u00a0 achieved exceptional brand value growth in the past year, increasing it by  $219bn (74%) to  $517bn\u00a0  and thereby reclaiming its title as the  most valuable brand globally. This is\u00a0\u00a0according to leading brand valuation consultancy Brand Finance. The technology company achieved this  brand value increase  despite  iPhone sales having  largely plateaued. The rise is attributed to  Apple\u2019s strategy of finding new markets, expanding its ecosystem and encouraging upgrades to higher-value iPhones.  The company has maintained its position as the dominant player in the premium smartphone market, with a share of 71%. Brand value is the net economic benefit  a brand owner would achieve by licensing the brand in the open market. Brand strength, on the other hand, is the efficacy of a brand\u2019s performance on intangible measures relative to its competitors. David Haigh, chair and CEO of Brand Finance, says:  \u201cApple has grown its brand value through strategic diversification and premiumisation, moving away from heavy reliance on iPhone sales towards ventures into wearables and services such as Apple TV subscriptions. According to our research, more than 50% of respondents recognised Apple as expensive but worth the price, reinforcing the brand\u2019s ability to demand a price premium.\u201d A strong brand, he  says, can lead to improved business returns in several ways. \u201cFor one thing,  a strong brand can help a company differentiate itself from its competitors and establish a unique identity in the market, which can lead to increased customer loyalty and retention. This, in turn, can lead to higher sales and revenue. \u201cA strong brand can also help a company command a higher price for its products or services as consumers are willing to pay more for a brand they perceive as high-quality and trustworthy. \u201cIn addition, a strong brand can help a company attract top talent, as employees may be more attracted to work for a well-known and reputable brand. \u201cFinally, a strong brand can provide a company with a competitive advantage and help it weather economic downturns or industry disruptions.\u201d Brand Finance research found significant gain among brands that have heavily invested in AI, seeing  Nvidia (brand value up 163% to  $44.5bn) become the world\u2019s fastest-growing brand. A key supplier of chips in the AI space,  Nvidia is perceived as highly innovative, while familiarity, consideration and recommendation levels all increased year on year, according to Brand Finance research. The brand\u2019s overall performance firmly positions  Nvidia as a front-runner in the AI chip market, demonstrating a successful balance between innovation and market adaptation. Europe\u2019s most valuable brand, Deutsche Telekom, ranked  ninth globally, secured the world's top telecoms position and a spot in the global top 10.  The company (brand value up 17% to  $73,3bn) surpassed Verizon (brand value up 6% to  $71.8bn). Deutsche Telekom\u2019s customer momentum, driven by network strength, has boosted group service revenues, while successful fibre deployment in Europe, alongside 5G leadership in the US,  enhanced connectivity perceptions. Brand Finance research highlighted  the company\u2019s leadership in customer satisfaction metrics, driving a brand strength index increase to 83/100. This consistent global brand delivery is reinforced by the introduction of Deutsche Telekom\u2019s unified global claim, \u201cconnecting your world,\u201d completing its global brand strategy with heightened international focus and customer perspective. Tesla (brand value down 12%) has dropped out of the top 10, falling to 18th place in the ranking. The company has been harmed by its large exposure to the Chinese \u00a0electric vehicle (EV) market. BYD, which grew its brand value by 20% to $12.1bn, has now overtaken Tesla to become the world\u2019s largest EV maker. While Tesla\u2019s brand strength remains high overall, rated AAA-, Brand Finance research shows a significant fall in reputation. Tesla\u2019s close association with Elon Musk, a controversial leadership figure, creates added reputational risk for the brand. That said, despite BYD\u2019s greater production volume Tesla\u2019s brand value is five times that of BYD. This highlights the enduring significance of brands as corporate assets. It allows  Tesla to command a price premium, support its company value and potentially fuel renewed growth. The full ranking can be found here: Brand Finance Global 500 2024 ranking. The big take-out: Apple is one of the world\u2019s most recognised brands;, its high brand awareness\u00a0averages 96% across the 17 countries researched by Brand Finance.
