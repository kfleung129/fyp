    "text": "APPLE resolved a service outage that affected its App Store, music app and the ability to purchase AppleCare support, disrupting several popular offerings for some customers. For more than an hour leading up to 7.42 pm New York time, \u201cusers may have been unable to make purchases in the iTunes Store, Mac App Store and App Store\u201d, the company said on its system status page. Users of Apple Music, meanwhile, also suffered \u201cintermittent issues with the service\u201d, the iPhone maker said. The problems have now been fixed, Apple said. The outages came the same week that Apple announced sweeping changes to the App Store in the European Union. That overhaul \u2013 coming in March as part of Apple\u2019s iOS 17.4 operating system \u2013 is a direct response to the EU\u2019s new Digital Markets Act, which imposes rigid restrictions on the largest tech firms. Friday\u2019s (Jan 26) outages also included problems at Apple\u2019s subscription purchase feature, which was having \u201cintermittent issues\u201d.
