There\u2019s no denying that it hasn\u2019t made enough buzz in the industry, and reports also suggest that it\u2019s being sold for a higher price in other markets, due to its US-only availability. Subsequently, industry leaders such as Sam Altman were among the first ones to drop a quick review of Apple Vision Pro. OpenAI chief Sam Altman took to X to share his quick review of the Apple Vision Pro. He believes it\u2019s the \u201csecond most impressive tech since the iPhone.\u201d On the same post, another user commented that it probably has the worst name. However, Sam Altman quickly responded, \u201cChatGPT is a lot worse. [sic]\u201dAdvertisement\n\n\nAdvertisement Of course, we don\u2019t know whether he tried the Apple Vision Pro or not but a compliment from someone, who has changed his tune of the generative AI space, does matter. He doesn\u2019t delve into more details as to why he believes so. But a comparison with the first-generation iPhone means that he believes that Apple\u2019s Vision Pro has the potential to become the next big thing in tech. Elon Musk, too, was among the early adopters of the Apple Vision Pro. However, his appraisal of Apple\u2019s latest release is mixed. Musk concedes that the Vision Pro failed to surprise him. He draws a parallel with the first-generation iPhone, suggesting there\u2019s ample room for improvement in the Vision Pro. Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman notes that there\u2019s more to this and essentially, this is just the prototype of the final product. He further adds that the Apple Vision Pro will not affect the sales of or replace the iPhone or Mac; rather, it will impact the iPads. For those unaware, Apple Vision Pro is up and selling for $3500 for the base variant in the US. Apple is also giving 30-minute one-on-one demos to experience visionOS, made specifically for the Apple Vision Pro. Copyright \u00a92024 Android Headlines. All Rights Reserved.
