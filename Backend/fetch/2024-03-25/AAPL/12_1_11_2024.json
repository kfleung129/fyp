    "text": "Microsoft surpassed Apple on stock market indices to become the world's most valuable company for a short time during Thursday's trading session. The development has come after the iPhone entered into 2024 with growing concerns related to demand of its products. Last week Foxconn, a Chinese assembler of Apple's iPhones, reported a year-over-year revenue decline. Moreover, Tim Cook's firm is also facing an antitrust case seen by the US Justice Department. Due to a range of obstacles, Apple stock was also downgraded by Barclays and Piper Sandler. At the time when Apple is facing setbacks on multiple fronts, Microsoft recently announced the introduction of AI on its devices. The tech giant, last week, shared its plans to introduce a Copilot key on keyboards of devices with Windows PCs. The feature will provide fast access to software maker\u2019s AI assistant. Last year, Microsoft shares witnessed a better growth compared to Applee stock on the ground of its AI intervention. In 2023, Microsoft shares jumped by 57% amid expectations of the growth of the company on the back of its AI business. Whereas, Apple share increased by 48% in last one year, reported CNBC. The short-lived victory of Microsoft was also witnessed in 2018 and 2021. However, Apple is the first company to exceed $3 trillion in market capitalisation.
