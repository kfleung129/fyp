Still, the iPhone operating system won\u2019t be the only software to use this technology. According to BuyAiDomains, Apple just secured the iWork.ai domain, teasing that its iWork suit might get a revival with an Artificial Intelligence focus soon. The publication highlights that the iWork.ai domain was recently made available, and Apple acquired it. Still, trying to open the webpage goes nowhere. In addition, it\u2019s always possible that the company bought the domain to prevent bad actors from using this page for phishing once it unveiled some of its new AI capabilities during WWDC 2024. In the early 2000s and the beginning of 2010s, Apple used to promote its two big suites: iLife and iWork. Over time, the company abandoned these names and focused on the iCloud brand. Even though the iWork suite apps are still updated, the company has yet to bring a revamp to them. Among the new iWork AI features are auto-summarizing and auto-complete. These were first reported by Bloomberg\u2018s Mark Gurman. The journalist thinks Apple is bringing these capabilities for core apps and productivity software. In addition, iOS 18 will focus on AI in the following topics: Sign up for the most interesting tech & entertainment news out there.

During Apple\u2019s first\u00a0earnings call\u00a0of the year, Tim Cook\u00a0did not mention any software by name. But he did address AI twice, teasing the upcoming announcements. He did it once during his remarks, right after reminding those on the call about the Vision Pro launch. Cook said Apple will spend a \u201ctremendous amount of time and effort\u201d on AI, with details coming later this year. Circle to Search is one of the AI features I hope Apple adds to the iPhone and other products. I already wrote how Google could implement this Samsung Galaxy feature for iPhone users. Still, I think Apple could use some of its built-in features to make an even better application. In addition, I love how fast the Apple Watch Ultra 2 is in some Siri queries since it relies a lot on on-device processing. Ultimately, I believe AI is all about context and understanding. If Apple\u2019s assistant can get a huge boost on these matters \u2013 and everything points out that it is \u2013Cupertino could compete against OpenAI, Google, and Microsoft for the perfect experience. My top feature requests are summarizing stories, getting relevant information from queries, and improving my workflow with on-device processing. Also, a new iOS 18 concept basically described what I want for this next operating system update. As you can see, it\u2019s not just iWork that is getting an AI revamp, but iOS 18 and several other Apple products will likely get the Artificial Intelligence boost we expect.
