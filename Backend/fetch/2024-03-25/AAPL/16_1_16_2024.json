    "text": "The Supreme Court has denied both Apple and Fortnite maker Epic Games\u2019 request to appeal a lower court\u2019s ruling on the alleged anticompetitive nature of Apple\u2019s App Store. The decision to not hear the case was a bit of a surprise, given that a jury trial recently found Google guilty in a similar antitrust battle with Epic. With the nation\u2019s highest court refusing to weigh in on Apple\u2019s status, that means the original ruling still stands. Apple had largely won its case, as the judge decided that Apple had not engaged in anticompetitive practices. However, there was one area where Apple would have to cede ground to developers, the court had ruled \u2014 it said that app makers should be able to steer their customers to the web from links inside their apps. This upset to Apple\u2019s \u201canti-steering\u201d rules for its App Store is what originally prompted the tech giant\u2019s appeal. It does not want to allow app developers to market their own websites and payment mechanisms from inside iOS apps, which could reduce the purchases made on its App Store \u2014 and therefore Apple\u2019s cut of developer revenues through its commissions. Developers, however, want to have a direct relationship with their customers. And for consumers, there may be a benefit to transacting on the web as the in-app purchases or subscriptions may be available for less than in the App Store, as the developer no longer has to pay the \u201cApple tax,\u201d or commissions. In a statement, Epic Games\u2019 CEO Tim Sweeney dubbed the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to not take up the case as a \u201csad outcome for all developers,\u201d but proclaimed that the \u201cfight goes on.\u201d \u201cThe Supreme Court denied both sides\u2019 appeals of the Epic v. Apple antitrust case. The court battle to open iOS to competing stores and payments is lost in the United States. A sad outcome for all developers,\u201d said Sweeney in a prepared statement. Now the District Court\u2019s injunction against Apple\u2019s anti-steering rule is in effect, and developers can include in their apps \u2018buttons, external links, or other calls to action that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms, in addition to IAP,'\u201d he continued. \u201cAs of today, developers can begin exercising their court-established right to tell U.S. customers about better prices on the web. These awful Apple-mandated confusion screens are over and done forever. The fight goes on. Regulators are taking action and policymakers around the world are passing new laws to end Apple\u2019s illegal anticompetitive app store practices. The European Union\u2019s Digital Markets Act goes into effect March 7,\u201d noted Sweeney. The Supreme Court denied both sides\u2019 appeals of the Epic v. Apple antitrust case. The court battle to open iOS to competing stores and payments is lost in the United States. A sad outcome for all developers. \u2014 Tim Sweeney (@TimSweeneyEpic) January 16, 2024  Apple in April 2023 had won its appeals court battle with Epic, the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled. The court upheld the district court\u2019s earlier ruling related to Epic\u2019s antitrust claims, but also the lower court\u2019s judgment in favor of Epic under California\u2019s Unfair Competition law, which will require Apple to remove the \u201canti-steering\u201d clause from its agreement with App Store developers. The latter could potentially lead to a loss of billions in annual revenue for the tech giant if app makers can successfully redirect their customers to pay for purchases and subscriptions via the web. Apple investors immediately understood the impact of this decision, as Apple\u2019s stock dropped over two and a half percent shortly after the news broke. It has since recovered slightly and is currently down by 1.09% as of the time of writing. \u201cThe Supreme Court\u2019s decision not to take up Apple\u2019s appeal confirmed that the company\u2019s anti-steering policy is illegal, anti-competitive and must come to an end,\u201d noted Rick VanMeter, executive director of the lobbying group Coalition for App Fairness, which includes Epic Games, Spotify, Tile, Match and others. \u201cIt\u2019s a win that developers can now point their customers to their websites to make purchases, which will lower prices and increase consumer choice. This is a step in the right direction and highlights the need for legislation \u2014 like the Open App Markets Act \u2014 to create an open and free app store ecosystem,\u201d he added. "
