    "text": "Countdown to Luke Lango\u2019s \u201c2nd Trillion-Dollar A.I. Trade\u201d The U.S. govt just unlocked an $8 trillion market to move in a new direction. See how it could unleash 6,000% potential upside. Compelling growth opportunities may overcome key challenges Advertisement Source: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.com Shares of consumer technology juggernaut Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), known globally for the iPhone and other smart devices, popped higher on Thursday due to an analyst upgrade. Specifically, Bank of America\u2019s Wamsi Mohan sees intriguing growth catalysts that should help power AAPL stock forward despite certain challenges. According to a CNBC report, Mohan upgraded AAPL to \u201cbuy\u201d from \u201cneutral\u201d while raising the price target to $225 per share. That implies a 23% upside from Wednesday\u2019s close. Notably, AAPL stock gained over 1% in the premarket session following the call. In the late morning hours in the open market, it had gained over 3%. Per the underlying research note, Mohan stated the following: \u201cWe upgrade Apple to Buy from Neutral, given: 1) stronger multi-year iPhone upgrade cycle driven by need for the latest hardware to enable Generative AI features to be introduced in 2024/2025 (large part of installed base still on iPhone 11), 2) higher growth in Services as Apple better monetizes its installed base.\u201d Later this year, the BofA analyst expects Apple to integrate artificial-intelligence-powered features in its iOS 18 operating system. Also, the upcoming Vision Pro mixed-reality headset \u201ccould surpass iPad revs over time as spatial computing takes hold offering differentiated use cases driving services upside.\u201d Per CNBC, the tech giant unveiled the headset last year. It will launch in the U.S. on Feb. 2 with a price of $3,500. To be sure, AAPL stock isn\u2019t without its challenges. For one thing, the consumer economy in China faces serious headwinds. According to a Bloomberg report a few days ago, the nation\u2019s worst deflation streak in 14 years sparked a decline in consumer prices, reflecting weak demand. With China representing a key market for both Apple and myriad other companies, it\u2019s not an ideal development. Also, AAPL stock incurred some weak performances across recent sessions. Conspicuously, even with BofA\u2019s upgrade, shares are down about 4% in the trailing month. Also, these declines stemmed partly from downgrades from Piper Sandler and Barclays. Per CNBC, the former entity cited worries around valuation, while the latter stated that key products (including the iPhone) have experienced weaker sales volume. Nevertheless, Mohan counters that the red ink makes AAPL stock attractive from a valuation standpoint relative to the S&P 500. Also, the negativity could now be baked into the price. Finally, while the China weakness presents a challenge, it\u2019s also \u201clargely offset by strength in other countries.\u201d As well, AAPL stock may enjoy several key growth catalysts: Combined with potential improvements in Services monetization, AAPL stock could conceivably hit the new price target. Other analysts are generally enthusiastic about AAPL stock, though it\u2019s not a clean assessment. While the rating is a consensus moderate buy, it breaks down as 24 buys, eight holds and, conspicuously, one sell. Lastly, the average price target lands at $203.89, implying a bit over 8% upside potential.
