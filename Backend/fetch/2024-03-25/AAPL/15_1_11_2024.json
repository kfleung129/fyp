This is especially true as Apple\u2019s market value has decreased to $2.87 trillion while Microsoft is trading at nearly $2.84 trillion.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0The competition is not new as Microsoft has occasionally surpassed Apple in market value since 2018, most recently in 2021.The tug-of-war between the two tech giants has put focus on tech ETFs having the largest exposure to these companies.

Two analysts \u2014 Piper Sandler and Barclays \u2014 downgraded the stock rating on worries about iPhone demand. iPhone sales in China dropped 30% in the first week of 2024 due to growing competitive pressure from Huawei and other domestic rivals.Adding to Apple's challenges is the tepid forecast for its new product, the Vision Pro mixed-reality headset, which is set to be launched in the United States on Feb 2. Analysts predict that its impact on Apple's earnings per share will be minimal.Further, the tech giant had offered a cautious outlook for the holiday quarter. Apple CFO Luca Maestri indicated that revenues in the quarter are expected to be \"similar\" to last year, with revenues for Mac, iPad and Wearables categories expected to \"decelerate significantly\" from the fourth quarter.MicrosoftMicrosoft rose 2% in 2024 after a 57% surge in 2023, given its strength in the cloud business and artificial intelligence drive.
