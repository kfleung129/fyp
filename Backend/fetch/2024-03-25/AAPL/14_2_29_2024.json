Published on By Space meteorologists have issued a forecast for this week warning of a possible geomagnetic storm caused by the release of plasma from a solar flare.  This could affect radio transmissions on Earth and contribute to the observation of the \u201cnorthern lights.\u201d According to an alert issued March 23 by NOAA\u2019s Space Weather Prediction Center in Boulder, Colorado, the public has no reason to be concerned.

Jonathan Lash, a forecaster at the center, noted that many commercial aircraft can use satellite communications as a backup option.\nSatellite operators may also have problems tracking their spacecraft, and the power grid may detect induced current in its lines.\n\u201cFor the general public in high latitudes, with clear skies, this will be a great opportunity to see the \u2018northern lights,'\u201d Lash said.\nEvery 11 years, the Sun\u2019s magnetic field changes and its north and south poles switch places.  During this cycle, solar activity also changes and is now approaching its peak, which is called solar maximum.\nDuring solar maximum, geomagnetic storms like the one observed last Sunday can occur on Earth several times a year, according to Lash.  During periods of solar minimum, several years may pass between storms.\nLast December, the largest solar flare in recent years disrupted radio communications.

According to Bloomberg, the Chinese automaker has reduced prices on more than 100 of its electric and hybrid models. For example, BYD\u2019s new generation-changing Seagull hatchback now costs less than $10,000, while the manufacturer\u2019s best-selling electric sedan, the Qin Plus, costs less than $11,000.
