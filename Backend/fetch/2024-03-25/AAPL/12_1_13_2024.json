Have you ever thought about how much Tim Cook makes as the CEO of Apple? Given the immense responsibility he has, it\u2019s a fair question. Cook has been instrumental in shaping the company\u2019s business since Steve Jobs passed away, putting him in a rare league of CEOs. Tim Cook took home a hefty $63.2 million (about Rs 523 crore) in compensation for the fiscal year 2023. That\u2019s a lot of money, but it\u2019s actually less than what he made in 2022. Why? Well, it was intentional. Cook requested a 40% reduction in his total compensation after receiving a recommendation from Apple\u2019s compensation committee.

In comparison, Cook earned a total of $99.4 million in the fiscal year 2022, despite his base salary remaining the same at $3 million. The difference in compensation is due to the stock awards, which totaled $83 million, as well as non-equity incentive compensation of $12 million and other compensation of $1.4 million. If you\u2019re curious about how much other CEOs, like Microsoft\u2019s Satya Nadella, make, the numbers are pretty similar. Nadella made $48.5 million in 2023, according to The Register. But not all CEOs make the same amount. For example, Google CEO Sundar Pichai made a whopping $226 million in 2022, while Shantanu Narayen, Chairman and CEO, Adobe made $31 million in 2022. "
