Apple, Meta, and Amazon released results late on Thursday, proving once and for all that good things come in threes. What does this mean? Meta set the trio\u2019s tone with advertising revenue that picked up by 24% from the same time last year,\u00a0keeping pace with last quarter. The announcement that really sent investors toward Meta\u2019s stock, though, was news of the company\u2019s first-ever dividend. Amazon, for its part, managed to beat most of its expectations. That said, its famed cloud division only just hit targets: AWS made 13% more revenue last quarter than the same time the year before, falling shy of Microsoft\u2019s rate. Apple had issues too, reporting that sales in China fell 13%. Still, with iPhones flying off the conveyor belts, Apple managed to make more revenue and profit than analysts expected. Why should I care? For markets: The end is nigh\u2026 maybe. Many a prophet has advised that all good things must eventually come to an end, from Geoffrey Chaucer to Nelly Furtado. That\u2019s a worrying prospect for Big Tech investors, though, after the Magnificent Seven stocks carried US markets on their backs last year. Microsoft offered some reassurance on Tuesday, boasting a cloud business that made 30% more revenue last quarter than the same time last year. And with any luck, Nvidia will dole out more comforting news on February 21st. The bigger picture: Big Tech gets tired, too. Big Tech\u2019s results have been fine, so far, but any Friends fans will know that you can\u2019t trust \u201cfine\u201d. In fairness, though, investors\u2019 expectations could hardly have been higher after last year\u2019s AI furor, so the seven biggest tech companies landing somewhere around that mark is no small feat. Still, Big Tech stocks could enter a \u201cconsolidation\u201d phase where prices stay within a tight range for some time, often referred to as moving \u201csideways\u201d rather than higher or lower. ai amazon apple cloud earnings growth stocks information technology meta tech stocks us ai earnings grocery retail Disclaimer: These articles are provided for information purposes only.
