    "text": "Mark Zuckerberg has finally tested the Apple Vision Pro. (Photo Credits: Apple) The chief of Meta, the company behind Facebook, has taken to his \u00a0official Instagram handle to post an almost three and a half minute long \u00a0video review of Apple\u2019s maiden mixed reality headset. (Photo Credits: Apple) Interestingly, his take is both open and objective\u2014 and for the most part, believable. (Photo Credits: Apple) Zuckerberg talks about how the Vision Pro\u2019s weight and wired battery could amount to a less than ideal user experience for most users. (Photo Credits: Apple) He is quick to mention that the Quest 3 weighs 120 grams less and is fully untethered. (Photo Credits: Apple) The Vision Pro\u2019s display may have a higher resolution (and is actually \u00a0one of the big reasons to buy it) but it also has motion blur while \u00a0moving and the Quest 3 offers a wider field of view. (Photo Credits: Apple) Zuckerberg quips about how the Vision Pro costs nearly seven times more than the Quest 3. (Photo Credits: Apple) He also talks about controllers, or the lack thereof in Apple\u2019s headset, and how they might be better in some cases. (Photo Credits: Apple) Similarly, eye tracking, which the Vision Pro also has, is a feature he \u00a0intends to bring back in future generations (the Quest Pro has it, the \u00a0Quest 3 does not). (Photo Credits: Apple) Obviously he talks about content where Meta clearly has the early head \u00a0start, since it\u2019s been doing this for years now while Apple is only \u00a0getting started. (Photo Credits: Apple) Zuckerberg says, \u201cI don\u2019t just think that Quest is the better value, I think Quest is the better product, period.\u201d (Photo Credits: Apple) "
