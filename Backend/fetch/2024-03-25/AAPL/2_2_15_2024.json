    "text": "Billionaire investor\u00a0Warren Buffett-led\u00a0Berkshire Hathaway, Inc.\u2018s BRK BRK latest 13F report, filed with the SEC, surprised some by not revealing any new major positions in the fourth quarter. However, the report did disclose some interesting changes within the existing portfolio: Apple Adjustments:\u00a0Despite remaining the top holding, Berkshire trimmed its\u00a0Apple Inc. AAPL shares by over 10 million, suggesting a cautious outlook despite the stock\u2019s continued appreciation and dividend payments. At the end of the quarter, the firm held 905.56 million Apple shares. Berkshire stands to receive $217 million in dividend income alone from its Apple investment, assuming it hasn\u2019t tinkered with its holdings in the quarter-to-date period. The move comes on the heels of the\u00a0company\u2019s fundamentals faltering slightly\u00a0amid soft demand for its flagship hardware product, the iPhone. Despite the cutback, the value of Berkshire\u2019s Apple holding rose from $156.75 billion at the end of the third quarter to $174.35 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, reflecting the tech giant\u2019s 12.6% rally during that period. See Also:\u00a0How To Buy Stocks Chevron Acquisition:\u00a0The firm added 15.9 million worth of\u00a0Chevron Corp.\u00a0CVX shares, taking its total holding in the oil giant to 126.09 million and highlighting a potential shift towards\u00a0the energy sector\u00a0amid current economic uncertainties. Other Core Holdings:\u00a0Positions in\u00a0Bank of America,\u00a0American Express, and\u00a0Coca-Cola\u00a0remained unchanged, showcasing continued confidence in these long-term bets. Along with Apple and Chevron, these stocks make up roughly 75% of the aggregate fair value of its equity portfolio. Strategic Stock Picks:\u00a0Berkshire increased its stake in favored energy company\u00a0Occidental Petroleum Corp.\u00a0OXY by 19.59 million to 243.72 million and boosted its stake in\u00a0Sirius XM Holdings Inc.\u00a0SIRI from 9.7 million to 40.24 million shares. Portfolio Trimming: However, the firm reduced its position in\u00a0Paramount Global Class B shares\u00a0PARA by over 30 million to 63.32 million shares, as the troubled media conglomerate\u00a0explores merger-and-acquisition options. Amid rumors of a potential sale, reports earlier this week suggested Paramount \u2014 which owns media properties such as ABC News, MTV and Comedy Central \u2014 is cutting roughly 3% of its workforce.\u00a0Shari Redstone,\u00a0the chairman of privately-held National Amusement, which owns Paramount, is rumored to have discussed the sale of Paramount to Warner Bros. Discovery. Buffett also reduced Berkshire\u2019s stake in computer and peripheral device manufacturer\u00a0HP Inc.\u00a0HPQ by 79.67 million to 22.85 million. Portfolio Exits:\u00a0The firm exited positions in\u00a0D.R. Horton, Inc. DHI,\u00a0while maintaining its stake in\u00a0Lennar Corp.\u00a0LEN at 152,572 shares, paring back on\u00a0big bets made last year\u00a0when the housing market was under tremendous pressure.
