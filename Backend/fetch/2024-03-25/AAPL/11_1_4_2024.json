    "text": "Apple Inc. shares have experienced a decline, with a 3.6% fall on a previous day and a further 0.4% drop in premarket trading. The company's stock has been downgraded from Equal-Weight to Underweight by Barclays, with the price target reduced from $161 to $160. Analysts have expressed concerns about Apple's ability to demonstrate growth and innovation, particularly in the field of artificial intelligence. It has been noted that Apple appears to be in an innovation rut, especially within the handset and watch form factors. The company is facing increased competition as competitors introduce new form factors and challenge the form of the handset itself. Traders and investors use our platform.
