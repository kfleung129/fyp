    "text": "Countdown to Luke Lango\u2019s \u201c2nd Trillion-Dollar A.I. Trade\u201d The U.S. govt just unlocked an $8 trillion market to move in a new direction. See how it could unleash 6,000% potential upside. Here are three reasons Apple stock won\u2019t be in the second spot for long Advertisement Source: Yalcin Sonat / Shutterstock.com Many investors know that Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) passed Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) on Jan. 12 as the world\u2019s most valuable public company. Apple stock is trading just below $182, valuing the iPhone maker at around $2.83 billion. Microsoft is trading around $389, good for a $2.90 billion market capitalization, $70 billion higher. Will the next year see Apple fall further behind Satya Nadella\u2019s baby because of Cupertino\u2019s reluctance to embrace AI publicly? Or is this a temporary position switch that Apple will rectify with future product launches that meet the consumers\u2019 insatiable need for all things Apple? That\u2019s the million-dollar question. In the meantime, I believe Apple\u2019s valuation remains choked by keeping its cards close to the vest regarding AI. Soon enough, investors will understand what Tim Cook\u2019s battle plan is. When that day comes, you\u2019ll be glad you bought AAPL stock beforehand. \u201cIt was inevitable that Microsoft would overtake Apple since Microsoft is growing faster and has more to benefit from the generative AI revolution,\u201d Reuters reported D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria\u2019s comments about the horse race. \u201cMicrosoft and Apple have been trading places for the title of the most valuable public company for several years now. Microsoft surpassed Apple\u2019s market cap in 2021, 2020, and 2018 before Apple once again regained its place at the top,\u201d Munich-based Nermin S. commented about the latest switch on LinkedIn. He\u2019s not wrong. This dance has been ongoing. It\u2019s unlikely to be settled for many more years unless one of the two companies stumbles badly or hits a home run. In baseball vocabulary, we\u2019re in the early innings of an extra-inning game. While Apple hasn\u2019t delivered a new-new product since the iPhone in 2007 (by that, I mean something entirely different from existing products available at the time) it routinely upgrades its existing lineup to keep Apple lovers from moving to another ecosystem. I suppose you could say that the Apple Vision Pro mixed-reality headset is a new-new product, but there isn\u2019t much for consumers to compare it with, so we\u2019re all somewhat in the dark about why we should spend nearly $3,500 for one of these bad boys. Five years ago, many would have said that $1,000 was too expensive for a phone, but I\u2019m not sure how many feel that way today. Yes, they\u2019ve turned us into walking zombies, unable to carry on conversations without looking at our phones every few seconds, but for many, they are indispensable. So, it\u2019s very possible that five years from now, many of us will wonder if we could live without our Vision Pro. If that is the case, a $3,500 price tag won\u2019t be an issue for Apple. And that\u2019s where I think Warren Buffett got it right. He bought Apple stock because he realized people wouldn\u2019t give up their phones, even if offered $10,000. \u201cIf you\u2019re an Apple user and somebody offers you $10,000, but the only proviso is they\u2019ll take away your iPhone and you\u2019ll never be able to buy another, you\u2019re not going to take it. If they tell you if you buy another Ford car, they\u2019ll give you $10,000 not to do that, you\u2019ll take the $10,000 and you\u2019ll buy a Chevy instead,\u201d Buffett told CNBC in April 2023. Maybe I\u2019m wrong, but as much as I respect Satya Nadella\u2019s job as Microsoft CEO, I just don\u2019t see it having a product that its customers can\u2019t live without. AI aside, Microsoft\u2019s bevy of products can\u2019t hold a candle to Apple\u2019s when it comes to consumer excitement. Microsoft stock trades at 13.29x sales, about 30% higher than its 5-year average. Meanwhile, Apple stock trades at 7.67x sales, 22% higher than its five-year average. Apple\u2019s earnings yield is 3.30%, compared to 2.66% for Microsoft. From where I sit, Microsoft\u2019s out-performance over the past year has everything to do with AI and very little to do with consumer excitement about CoPilot or ChatGPT. Don\u2019t get me wrong, these are significant advances in software technology, but the market is pricing in that AI will bring all sorts of revenue to Microsoft. Still, ignoring the possibility that Apple\u2019s refrain from discussing AI publicly to a large extent isn\u2019t because they don\u2019t have any plans for it; it\u2019s because they don\u2019t want to take away from the Vision Pro launch in February. As far as I can tell, AI is naturally suited for use with the Vision Pro mixed reality headset, but I\u2019m far from a tech expert. One way, for example, that businesses could use it is to put out augmented reality content through their investor relations people that gives a user an immersive experience of a plant or facility. It\u2019s like a plant tour but in the privacy of your own home. AI could determine what shareholders and potential investors want to see and experience. So, I\u2019ve said in the past that if you can afford to buy both Apple and Microsoft, you absolutely should. That hasn\u2019t changed. Could Apple stock play second fiddle to Microsoft for the rest of 2024? Absolutely. That said, Tim Cook is a bright fellow. I\u2019m sure his AI plan is more substantive than investors are giving the company credit for. Either way, I don\u2019t see Warren Buffett selling anytime soon. Second fiddle or not.
