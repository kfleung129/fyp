    "text": "Apple\u2019s plans to pay more for songs produced with higher-quality audio are causing discord among some artists. That\u2019s according to a report Friday (Feb. 2) by the Financial Times (FT), which says that independent record labels\u00a0argue that this shift will mean more money for high profile stars and less for other artists. At issue is Apple\u2019s recent announcement that it would pay music companies up to 10% more in royalties for songs produced with Dolby Atmos, a \u201cspatial audio\u201d technology that the company has described as providing \u201cimmersive\u201d experiences\u00a0for listeners. As the FT report noted, better-quality audio is one area where Apple Music has an advantage over its competitor Spotify, though this audio costs more to produce. However, Apple won\u2019t be paying more in total. The extra 10% will come from a fixed pool of money, the FT said, which means songs that aren\u2019t recorded using Dolby Atmos will get less money. Now, some high-profile record labels \u2014 including Beggars Group, home to Vampire Weekend and Adele, and Secretly, which represents Phoebe Bridgers and Bon Iver \u2014 have expressed concerns about Apple\u2019s policy, sources told the FT. \u201cIt\u2019s literally going to take the money out of independent labels and their artists, to benefit the biggest companies in the marketplace,\u201d said a senior executive at a large independent label. \u201cIt\u2019s going to benefit the biggest player, Universal, because they\u2019re the ones with the resources to invest in that. Whereas the independent sector \u2026 we\u2019ve found it hard to justify the expense of creating spatial masters \u2026 we\u2019re not in the business of chucking money just because Apple is saying you should be spending money on this.\u201d Record executives told the FT that producing a song in spatial audio costs an extra $1,000, while a whole album would cost 10 times that amount. And going back and reproducing an old song with the technology can double costs. PYMNTS has contacted Apple for comment but has not yet gotten a reply. The news comes weeks after Spotify announced it was\u00a0launching in-app shopping on iPhones in the European Union beginning March 7. As PYMNTS reported, the new offering is enabled by the rollout of the EU\u2019s\u00a0Digital Markets Act\u00a0(DMA), which blocks the restrictions and 30% fees that Apple places on apps offering through its App Store. \u201cFor years, even in our own app, Apple had these rules where we couldn\u2019t tell you about offers, how much something costs, or even where or how to buy it. We know, pretty nuts,\u201d Spotify said in a blog post. \u201cThe DMA means that we\u2019ll finally be able to share details about deals, promotions and better-value payment options in the EU.\u201d  We\u2019re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.
