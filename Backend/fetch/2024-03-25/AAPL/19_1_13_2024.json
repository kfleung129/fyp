    "text": "Apple Inc. has long been the most valuable U.S. company, but Microsoft Corp. seems poised to overtake it. A look back at the companies\u2019 financial performance and a look ahead at expected revenue and profits make the case that Apple is no longer a growth stock and that Microsoft is the better long-term investment. A $45 Stanley water bottle is everything that\u2019s wrong with America right now My friend discovered he had a biological daughter 60 years ago. Does she \u2014 or her family \u2014 have a claim on his estate? Is buying a used Tesla from Hertz a good deal? Here\u2019s what you should know. My dad wants to take out a mortgage, but Sallie Mae won\u2019t release him as cosigner on my $153,000 student loan. What can we do? My sister owns properties in Hawaii, yet refuses to make a will. If she dies, will our half-sibling inherit anything? At the close on Friday, Apple AAPL remained in the top spot with a market capitalization of $2.892 trillion, just ahead of Microsoft MSFT at $2.887 trillion. Apple\u2019s stack was down 3.4% for 2024, while Microsoft was up 3.3% for the new year. Read:  Apple stock looks expensive vs. the rest of the \u2018Magnificent Seven\u2019 Here\u2019s a quick comparison of total returns (with dividends reinvested) for the stocks, and for the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY, to show how the companies\u2019 forward price-to-earnings valuations have moved, through the close on Thursday: Company or ETF Ticker Five-year total return Forward P/E Forward P/E five years ago Change in P/E valuation Apple Inc. AAPL 408% 27.7 12.3 125% Microsoft Corp. MSFT 294% 31.7 21.6 46% SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY 100% 19.5 15.1 30% Source: FactSet Apple\u2019s forward P/E (price divided by rolling 12-month earnings-per-share estimates among analysts polled by FactSet) has more than doubled over the past five years. The entire stock market is more expensive than it was, as you can see with SPY\u2019s valuation climbing 30%. Microsoft\u2019s valuation on this basis has grown 46%, not only because its stock hasn\u2019t performed as well as Apple\u2019s stock has, but because Microsoft has grown its earnings per share much more quickly. Here\u2019s a look at compound annual growth rates (CAGR) for the companies\u2019 sales and earnings per share over the past five years and the S&P 500 SPX. These are calendar-year numbers, adjusted by FactSet because some companies, including Apple, have fiscal years that don\u2019t match the calendar. The numbers for 2023 are based on the first three quarters\u2019 results and estimates for the fourth quarter. The table also includes projected CAGR for sales and earnings per share from 2023 through 2025. Company  or index Estimated five-year sales CAGR through 2023 Estimated five-year EPS CAGR though 2023 Expected two-year sales CAGR through 2025 Expected two-year EPS CAGR through 2025 Apple Inc. 8.1% 15.4% 4.9% 8.2% Microsoft Corp. 14.0% 19.4% 14.3% 16.2% S&P 500 7.0% 7.2% 5.3% 12.3% Source: FactSet Over the past five years, Apple\u2019s sales and earnings per share have grown at a faster pace than those of the S&P 500, but Microsoft has grown more quickly. Looking ahead, the estimates point to a pace of sales growth for Apple that will trail that of the index and lag far behind Microsoft. Apple is also expected to increase earnings at a slowing pace, again way behind Microsoft and even the index. A rapid pace of growth justifies a premium share price, so it makes sense that Microsoft now trades at a higher forward P/E than Apple does. But Apple\u2019s premium to the full S&P 500 is difficult to justify, based on these numbers. Analysts working for brokerage firms seem to agree. Here is a summary of ratings and price targets for Apple and Microsoft: Company Ticker Share \u201cbuy\u201d ratings Share neutral ratings Share \u201csell\u201d ratings Jan. 11 price Consensus price target Implied 12-month upside potential Apple Inc.
