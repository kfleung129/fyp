    "text": "In a recent development, YouTube GOOGL has confirmed that a Vision Pro app is in the works for Apple\u2018s AAPL Vision Pro VR headset. What Happened: YouTube officially acknowledged the development of a Vision Pro app, as per a report by The Verge. This comes after YouTube, Spotify, and Netflix initially refused to allow their iPad apps to run on the Vision Pro. There was no mention of a dedicated visionOS YouTube app in the future. The sudden change in plans is speculated to be linked to the popularity of the Juno app for YouTube on the Vision Pro. YouTube spokesperson Jessica Gibby confirmed the news: \u201cWe do not have any specific plans to share at this time, but we can confirm that a Vision Pro app is on our roadmap.\u201d See Also: Mark Zuckerberg \u2018Just Getting Started,\u2019 Says Ives. Munster Says \u2018Not Too Late\u2019 To Buy Meta It remains unclear when the app will be launched and what features it will include. YouTube has not yet responded to queries about whether the app will support VR and 360 videos on the Vision Pro. Why It Matters: The news of YouTube\u2019s Vision Pro app comes after both Netflix and Spotify decided not to launch their apps on Apple\u2019s Vision Pro. This decision was announced in January, with users being directed to access the content via a web browser as the iPad app would not run on the device. Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset has been receiving significant attention, with the sales numbers exceeding expectations. The headset\u2019s first-weekend sale was estimated to be more than double what was expected, with close to 180,000 units sold over the weekend. This impressive launch was attributed to the \u201cbetter than expected\u201d pre-orders, as tech analyst Ming-Chi Kuo stated.
