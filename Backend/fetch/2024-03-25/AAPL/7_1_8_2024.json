    "text": "STORY: Apple shares were up during Monday afternoon trading as the iphone maker announced the sale of its new Vision Pro mixed-reality headset in the United States starting Feb. 2. The launch of the headset marks the company's biggest product launch since the original iPhone went on sale in 2007. It will also put Apple in direct competition with Meta Platforms which dominates the virtual reality market. Meanwhile, iPhone sales in China dropped by 30% in the first week of 2024. Sharma thinks that pressures from domestic rivals such as Huawei \"would be a threat to Apple because the Chinese government does have a preference for local players and tends to give them an advantage.\" The decline in sales was the primary catalyst for an overall double-digit drop in China smartphone shipments for the first week, according to a note the brokerage published on Sunday.
