    "text": "Apple Inc.\u2019s start to 2024 is one for the history books, and not in a good way. The stock ended the week with its fourth session in a row of declines. That made for the first time that Apple shares \n        AAPL,\n        -0.47%\n       closed lower in each of the first four trading sessions of a year since 1982, according to Dow Jones Market Data. But as the saying goes, it\u2019s not how you start but how you finish. And for what it\u2019s worth, Apple\u2019s stock ended up rallying 35% in 1982, per FactSet data. Factoring in a losing session at the end of 2023, Apple\u2019s stock has logged five consecutive trading days in a row of declines, falling 6.4% over that stretch and logging its worst five-session streak since the period that ended Sept. 12, when it fell 7.1%. Apple has shed $193 billion in market capitalization over its current losing streak, and Microsoft Corp. \n        MSFT,\n        +0.28%\n       is moving closer to overtaking Apple as the most valuable U.S. company for the first time since late 2021. Less than $100 billion in market capitalization stands between the two companies.
