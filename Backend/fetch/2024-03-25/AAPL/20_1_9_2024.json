    "text": "Apple VP of Finance Saori Casey is headed to Sonos after more than a dozen years at Apple. The move comes after she departed Apple in December. Casey, described by Bloomberg as a \u201ctop deputy\u201d to Apple CFO Luca Maestri, will assume the role of Sonos CFO later this month. In a press release announcing the news today, Sonos CEO Patrick Spence touted Casey\u2019s experience at Apple and Cisco: \u201cI am excited to welcome Saori as our new CFO. The depth and breadth of her experience at world-class companies like Apple and Cisco make her perfectly suited to build on our momentum and seize the opportunity ahead.\u201d Casey is taking over the Sonos CFO role from Eddie Lazarus, who will retain his existing duties as Chief Legal Officer and take on a new Chief Strategy Officer role. \u201cSonos is an iconic consumer brand with an exciting portfolio of audio products that delight and inspire millions of consumers around the world, myself included,\u201d Casey said in the press release today. She will assume the CFO role at Sonos effective January 22, 2024. As Bloomberg points out, this is a significant loss for Apple and it comes amid a string of other executive departures. Last month, it was reported that Steve Hotelling, who worked on key technologies like the iPhone\u2019s multitouch screen, Touch ID, and Face ID, is retiring from Apple. Tang Tan, VP of product design at Apple, is also on the way out. At Apple, Casey was a \u201ctop deputy to CFO Luca Maestri\u201d and was tasked with \u201coverseeing financial planning, forecasting and investor relations.\u201d Follow Chance:\u00a0Threads,\u00a0Twitter,\u00a0Instagram, and\u00a0Mastodon.
