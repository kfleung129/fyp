    "text": "Countdown to Luke Lango\u2019s \u201c2nd Trillion-Dollar A.I. Trade\u201d The U.S. govt just unlocked an $8 trillion market to move in a new direction. See how it could unleash 6,000% potential upside. It's too early to buy AAPL stock at this point Advertisement Source: Yalcin Sonat / Shutterstock.com I believe that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and AAPL stock have two core problems. First, excitement about the company\u2019s flagship product, the iPhone, has largely evaporated. And second, the company\u2019s efforts to create \u201cthe next big thing\u201d to supplement the iPhone have largely failed. The Vision Pro won\u2019t change this pattern. On the other hand, I think there\u2019s a chance that the firm\u2019s upcoming iPhone can bring back the long, persistent lines of iPhone fans eager to buy the newest version of the device. However, until we learn more about the upcoming offering, I advise investors to avoid the name. For the first five years or so after the iPhone was launched, many if not most consumers viewed the newest versions of the devices as \u201cmust haves.\u201d And a multitude of other fans would get new iPhones every two years. Currently, devices are seen as similar to cars. Many consumers hold on to their iPhones for several years, and some wait until their phones aren\u2019t working anymore to buy new ones. Indeed, the tech website Zdnet reported last year that \u201c61% of iPhone users keep their previous iPhones for two years or more.\u201d This factor has played a key role in Apple\u2019s lackluster revenue growth. Over the last five years, it was only during the pandemic, when the tech giant\u2019s results were boosted by the work-from-home trend, that Apple really delivered strong revenue increase. For example, last year, the firm\u2019s top line actually fell slightly, dropping to $383 billion from $394 billion, and the same phenomenon occurred in fiscal 2019, when its sales came in at $260 billion, compared with $265.5 billion in fiscal 2018. And last quarter, the firm\u2019s top line only rose about 2% versus the same period a year earlier. Moreover, the numbers  would have been much worse if Chinese consumers had not become enthralled with the iPhone. In fact, the iPhone became the best-selling smartphone in China in 2023. But the device\u2019s popularity in the Asian country appears to be waning, as deliveries of the device in China dropped 2% last quarter versus the same period a year earlier. Apple TV+ has largely been a failure, as Barron\u2019s reported in 2023 that the offering \u201cwill lose billions of dollars\u2026for years to come.\u201d There has been much talk over the years about the conglomerate\u2019s efforts to develop an Apple-influenced\u00a0vehicle, but of course, such a product has never emerged. The firm\u2019s watch and its Services have been mid-level successes, but haven\u2019t really moved the top-line needle for the tech giant. And I\u2019d bet against the firm\u2019s new 3D headset, the Vision Pro, making a positive impact on the firm\u2019s financial results. Both Alphabet  (NASDAQ:GOOG)and Meta (NASDAQ:META) have tried and failed to get consumers excited about high-tech headsets. The New York Post recently reported that the devices cause \u201cextreme headaches\u201d and \u201cmotion sickness.\u201d The next update to Apple\u2019s operating system, iOS, will reportedly boost its AI capabilities. There are rumors that the next iPhone, iPhone 16, will feature new hardware which will enable users to exploit these capabilities. According to one report, Siri\u2019s intelligence will be boosted by the upgrades and will help \u201cusers\u2026 field complex questions and auto-complete sentences more effectively.\u201d Developers will create apps for the device more quickly. The latter change could result in huge increases in the quantity and quality of apps available for the platform. Apple\u2019s growth is anemic, while its forward price-earnings ratio of 28.2 is not exactly low. Therefore, I don\u2019t expect the shares to outperform the market soon.And while the AI upgrades of the next version of the iPhone may be a positive game changer, I think it\u2019s too early to tell if that will indeed be the case.
