The fine is expected to be announced early next month, the FT said. Last year, the European Commission accused Apple of distorting competition in the music streaming market via App Store rules that prevent developers from informing users of other purchasing options. Both the European Commission and Apple declined to comment on the FT report. Sign up to the Cyprus Mail Newsletter We are using cookies to give you the best experience on our website.
