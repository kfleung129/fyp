    "text": "Apple Inc. will begin selling versions of its Series 9 and Ultra 2 watches without a blood oxygen feature in the U.S., following a legal setback in its patent dispute with Masimo Corp. The company said Wednesday that the tweaked models will go on sale Thursday at its retail outlets and online store. The new models will still include the blood oxygen monitoring tool, but it won\u2019t function. Earlier in the day, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit declined to grant Apple a longer pause on an import ban of the devices imposed by the U.S. International Trade Commission. The ruling means the company has to stop selling the watches with the oxygen measurement feature while an appeal of the ban plays out \u2014 a period that Apple believes could last a year or more. That led Apple to take the unusual step of removing a key feature from its devices. Last week, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency approved redesigned versions of the watches that didn\u2019t have the capability. \u201cPending the appeal, Apple is taking steps to comply with the ruling while ensuring customers have access to Apple Watch with limited disruption,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cApple\u2019s appeal is ongoing, and we believe the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit should reverse the USITC\u2019s decision. We strongly disagree with the USITC decision and resulting orders.\u201d The company added that the feature remains available on models sold outside the U.S. Previously purchased watches also will retain the ability to check blood oxygen levels. Masimo shares jumped 2.1% to $122.57 following the decision, reaching their highest level since August. Chief Executive Officer Joe Kiani said in a statement that the development is a \u201cvictory for the integrity of the American patent system.\u201d Kiani added that the decision \u201caffirms that even the largest and most powerful companies must respect the intellectual rights of American inventors and must deal with the consequences when they are caught infringing others\u2019 patents.\u201d The court battle has threatened one of Apple\u2019s biggest moneymakers in its home market, an unprecedented situation for the tech giant. The watches are a central piece of the company\u2019s wearables, home and accessories division, a business that generated more than 10% of revenue last year, or nearly $40 billion. The ITC ruled in October that Apple\u2019s latest watches violate patents related to blood oxygen measurement, an area known as pulse oximetry. That led Apple to pause sales of the smartwatches just ahead of Christmas, though an interim stay allowed the company to bring the products back late last month. According to the ITC, the harm Apple said it would face from the ban \u201cis not unquantifiable, but rather speculative.\u201d Apple maintains that the ruling from the ITC is erroneous and should be reversed. Masimo had urged the Federal Circuit to reject the request for an extended delay, arguing Apple had almost three years to anticipate a ban and \u201ccannot complain about the consequences of its own failure to prepare for exclusion.\u201d Apple pushed back on the ITC\u2019s and Masimo\u2019s arguments that its ability to continue selling the noninfringing Apple Watch SE means any reputational harm from the ban can\u2019t be truly irreparable. It also criticized the product that the trade dispute was launched to protect, Masimo\u2019s W1 watch, saying it didn\u2019t exist when Masimo filed its complaint, wasn\u2019t placed in the consumer channel and is sold only in negligible quantities \u201cwell over two years after this investigation began on the false premise that Masimo had an established domestic industry.\u201d The appeals court said in a brief order Wednesday, \u201cWe reach no conclusion on the merits of the appeal.\u201d The panel said the temporary stay will expire at 5 p.m. Eastern time on Thursday. Apple, based in Cupertino, California, added the blood oxygen sensor to its watches in 2020 with the Series 6. Masimo, a medical device company, sued Apple that year, alleging that the iPhone maker violated several of its health technology patents and stole its trade secrets. The case is Apple Inc. v. ITC, 24-1285, US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Contact us at letters@time.com "
