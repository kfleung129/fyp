This is Security Bite, your weekly security-focused column on 9to5Mac. Every Sunday, Arin Waichulis delivers insights on data privacy, uncovers vulnerabilities, and sheds light on emerging threats within Apple\u2019s vast ecosystem of over 2 billion active devices. Stay secure, stay safe. Jamf, the popular Apple device management platform, is out with its annual security trends report for 2023. The analysis looks at anonymized real-world customer data collected from over 15 million devices using Jamf across multiple platforms (macOS, iOS, iPadOS, Windows, and Android), as well as threat research and industry events, to depict the threat landscape as it affects businesses and employees. Some of these stats are indeed alarming but may not come as a total surprise. Earlier this month, 9to5Mac reported that the adoption of iOS 17 is moving at a much slower rate than iOS 16, which contains at least two major vulnerabilities that have been exploited in Operation Triangulation patched in 16.2 and a second zero-click used by attackers to inject Pegasus spyware that was fixed with iOS 16.6.1. Lack of next-gen software adoption could be a driving factor behind such a large amount of mobile users running a device with known vulnerabilities. Of course, this is just iPhone. Jamf\u2019s data lumped all mobile operating systems together for this particular analysis, so we can\u2019t see how much Android is contributing to the 40%. It\u2019s a long-running misconception that Mac can\u2019t get malware. This is certainly not true. Without getting too much in the weeds, the increase in malware targeting Mac computers is evident. Jamf reports an additional 21 new families were detected in 2023, which would be a 50% increase YoY. What is true is as Mac continues to rise in popularity, it\u2019ll lose its strength in low numbers and become a more attractive target for cybercriminals. But the fact remains that Mac continues to be intrinsically more secure than Windows at the moment. \u201cThe analysis, carried out in Q4 2023 and revisiting the prior 12-month period, revealed many key themes, chief among them that organizations\u2019 cyber hygiene is abysmal and threat actors are ready to strike with the most sophisticated attacks yet,\u201d Jamf states.
