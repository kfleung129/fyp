    "text": "       Seven years after Apple's \"batterygate\" scandal, people are finally seeing payments from the class action lawsuit settlement. Back in 2017, owners of older iPhones began noticing performance issues in their phones after certain iOS upgrades. Later that year, Apple admitted to throttling the performance of older phones\u00a0\u2014 the company said at the time that this was to prevent the impacted phones from shutting down, which could happen as their batteries degrade beyond a certain point. The resulting class action lawsuit claimed that by doing this \u2014 and not properly informing owners of these iPhones \u2014 Apple pushed users to upgrade their phones early rather than getting their phone batteries replaced. Related stories Without admitting any wrongdoing, Apple eventually reached a settlement and agreed to pay $310 to $500 million depending on how many claims were filed. Claims had to be filed by October 2020, and to be eligible, users must have had an iPhone 6, 6 Plus, 6s, 6s Plus, 7, 7 Plus, or SE that ran a certain iOS in 2017 and experienced a decrease in speed and performance. Though it was previously estimated that the payment amounts would come out to around $65, people who are receiving the payout are reporting that they've had $92.17 deposited to their accounts. Nice thing to wake up to on a Saturday morning \u2014 especially after 3.5 years of waiting! https://t.co/efqqgca8NG pic.twitter.com/hqfBV25M6s Apple did not respond to Business Insider's request for comment ahead of publication.
