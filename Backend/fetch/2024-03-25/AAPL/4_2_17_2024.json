It turned out that in \u201cretaliation\u201d for this, Apple began to disable support for web applications (Progressive Web Apps; PWA) for EU residents. Photo: Vjeran Pavic / The Verge The apps no longer work in the iOS 17.4 beta, and Apple has confirmed that this is a deliberate decision.  The reason for this decision lies precisely in the new legislation of the European Union.  Bringing PWA apps into compliance with the Digital Markets Act (DMA) will require an entirely new integration architecture that is impractical to implement, the company says.  One of these changes in particular requires Apple to allow third-party browsers to use their own engines in iOS, which is a problem because web apps are built directly on the Webkit engine that powers the Safari browser. \nAs a result, now in iOS 17.4, sites added to the home screen do not act as PWAs, but only as bookmarks that open a new tab in the browser.

Published on By On Friday, a Spanish court ruled to block the Telegram messenger in the country, and today the same court suspended its own ban. created by DALL-E Spain\u2019s High Court has suspended its own order to block Telegram in the country.  The reason is waiting for a police report on the impact of the temporary ban on users.  Let us remember that the original resolution was supposed to be temporary. Thus, for now Telegram in Spain continues to operate without breaking the law, and then, as is now clear, the situation will depend, among other things, on the police report. Published on By The Microsoft team has tackled the problem with text display in the Google Chrome browser on the Windows 10 and Windows 11 operating systems. The problem has existed and been known for many years \u2013 many users complain about blurry or too thin text in the browser.  At the same time, in other applications and other browsers, the same users had everything fine with fonts.  As it turns out, Chrome and Windows were not interacting properly with each other, and now Microsoft is planning to fix a glitch that results in strange fonts in Chrome. The thing is that Windows has a ClearType text tuner that helps the user select different values \u200b\u200bfor text rendering.  Native applications on Windows usually receive these values \u200b\u200bautomatically.  Chromium uses Skia to render text and therefore does not take into account user preferences on Windows. Microsoft is going to tweak the Chromium code base so that it grabs the contrast and gamma values \u200b\u200bset using the Windows ClearType Text Tuner and then passes them to Skia Chromium.  This way, Skia will be able to display text the way the user wants and will prevent any Chrome problems with text in the future.
