    "text": "In September, Bloomberg reported that Apple had held exploratory talks with Microsoft about acquiring Bing as recently as 2020. In newly unsealed court filings this week, more details about the acquisition talks between Apple and Microsoft have surfaced. As reported by CNBC, these documents come as part of the US Justice Department\u2019s lawsuit alleging Google has a monopoly in the web search industry. In documents made public on Friday, Google argued that the relationship between Microsoft and Apple \u2013\u00a0including acquisition talks \u2013\u00a0is evidence that Google does indeed have \u201ccompetition\u201d in the search industry. According to Google\u2019s filings, Microsoft pitched Apple on making Bing the default search engine in Safari on at least seven different occasions: 2009, 2013, 2015, 2016, 2018, and 2020. Each time, Google says that Apple passed on the opportunity due to search quality. \u201cIn each instance, Apple took a hard look at the relative quality of Bing versus Google and concluded that Google was the superior default choice for its Safari users. That is competition,\u201d Google explained. Also in the filing, Google wrote that Microsoft approached Apple in 2018 to tout improvements it had made to Bing\u2019s search quality. Microsoft\u2019s goal was to either \u201csell Bing to Apple or establish a Bing-related joint venture.\u201d The filing includes comments from Eddy Cue, Apple\u2019s services boss: \u201cMicrosoft search quality, their investment in search, everything was not significant at all. And so everything was lower. So the search quality itself wasn\u2019t as good. They weren\u2019t investing at any level comparable to Google or to what Microsoft could invest in. And their advertising organization and how they monetize was not very good either.\u201d Google and Apple, of course, have a lucrative partnership through which Google pays billions of dollars to be the default search engine on Apple\u2019s platforms. The revenue generated from its deal with Google was a \u201ckey reason\u201d Apple\u2019s talks to acquire Bing never advanced beyond exploratory stages, multiple reports have explained.
