    "text": "Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: Football is back in full force this weekend. Sorry, the other one. Saturday marks the beginning of Apple\u2019s second year of streaming Major League Soccer matches, a decade-long, $2.5 billion deal that\u2019s part of an ambitious effort to attract more fans and money to the 28-year-old league, which has long struggled for relevancy in the shadows of other North American sports. A centerpiece of that plan is \u201cMLS Season Pass,\u201d a sleekly designed streaming package that ditches the fragmentation other sports suffer from and lets fans stream globally every game \u2014 without blackouts \u2014 in the Apple TV app. The package costs $14.99 per month or $99 for the season and slightly less ($12.99 per month or $79 for the year) for existing Apple TV+ subscribers. Besides every regular season game, it also includes the playoffs and final, plus the Leagues Cup and lower-level MLS Next Pro and MLS Next matches. \u201cWe\u2019re creating something new,\u201d Sacha Kljestan, a former MLS player and now a broadcast personality, told CNN. \u201cSomething from nothing that, I think, 10 years from now, people will look back and this might be a game changer in modern television media.\u201d Kljestan co-hosts \u201cMLS 360,\u201d which airs at 7:30 pm ET on Saturdays when a majority of the weekly MLS slate is played. Think of \u201c360\u201d as \u201cNFL RedZone\u201d for soccer junkies, with lead anchor Kevin Egan, analyst Andrew Wiebe and former soccer players Kaylyn Kyle and Bradley Wright-Phillips whipping viewers around as many as 10 games simultaneously happening, showing highlights and providing analysis. Similar to how NBC or CBS treats the NFL, Apple streams pregame and postgame coverage programs expanded to an hour this year, with the latter now beginning at a consistent time (12:30 am ET mostly following the finish of the Saturday games). Also, new this season is a Spanish-language version of \u201c360\u201d airing at the same time as the English-language edition. The glossy studio shows with sleek graphics and coverage changes to make games easier to find\ufeff and watch, especially compared to previous MLS coverage deals when games were shown on a hodgepodge of TV networks and local affiliates, have worked. \u201cOnce people tuned into the product, they were watching longer than our linear versions in past years,\u201d Camilo Durana, executive vice president of MLS\u2019 Apple partnership, properties and events, told CNN. \u201cWe know that consumers have responded well to the high-quality production and the care we\u2019ve taken with Apple to produce something that looks the part, feels premium and is produced in the best possible way,\u201d he added. A small number of matches are still shown on broadcast networks, like FOX in the US and TSN and French-language RDS in Canada, with their own commentators. Under the Apple deal, games are no longer shown on local broadcast partners. Apple is also helping the MLS expand its presence in other products it owns, practically making soccer impossible to escape. On Wednesday, Apple released a new Sports app that shows live MLS scores and pushes people to watch them on \u201cMLS Season Pass\u201d on the Apple TV app. (It was likely not a coincidence that it rolled out the same day that soccer superstar Lionel Messi made his first full-season debut for Inter Miami that streamed exclusively on Apple TV.) MLS content will also be shown in Apple News, Maps and Music apps, plus the matches can be watched on the new $3,499 Vision Pro headset. The league also released team-branded Beats by Dre (also owned by Apple) headphones this year with player-curated playlists streaming on, where else, Apple Music. The idea, according to Durana, are \u201cmore expansive integrations\u00a0within Apple\u2019s ecosystem\u00a0of products and services to just make the experience\u00a0better,\u201d thus satisfying existing fans and ideally attracting new ones to the MLS. Of course, all of this promotion is meaningless if no one is watching or paying. Apple doesn\u2019t release viewership or subscriber numbers. Sports Business Journal recently reported that the package has \u201csurpassed\u201d two million subscribers, however it\u2019s unclear how many are actually paying for it since the service was made free to T-Mobile subscribers and MLS season ticket holders. Durana also didn\u2019t reveal any numbers but said the company saw a \u201cmassive and very strong wave of subscribers mid-year\u201d in 2023 after Messi signed with Inter Miami. That matches a third-party report from analytics firm Antenna showing that \u201cMLS Season Pass\u201d was getting 6,000 new signups a day before Messi arrived but soared to 110,000 signups a day after he signed. Antenna said that the \u201cMessi Effect\u201d on a year-old streaming package was \u201cunique and profound.\u201d Even if the actual viewership is low, the $250 million yearly cost for Apple is a practically a \u201crounding error\u201d for a company worth about $3 trillion. It\u2019s also a \u201cgood investment because it\u2019s another sticky offering to pull people into its ecosystem,\u201d Santosh Rao, partner and head of research for Manhattan Venture Partners, told CNN. Soccer\u2019s global popularity and the young demographic MLS predominately attracts makes the \u201cwhole deal a success,\u201d even if its US ratings, he admitted, doesn\u2019t reach the levels of other leagues like the NFL or NBA. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing like live sports. It\u2019s the best thing you can offer,\u201d Rao said. Most stock quote data provided by BATS. US market indices are shown in real time, except for the S&P 500 which is refreshed every two minutes.
