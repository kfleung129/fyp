The Dow \n        DJIA\n       was most recently trading 100 points lower (-0.3%), as shares of Intel \n        INTC\n       and Apple \n        AAPL\n       are contributing to the blue-chip gauge's intraday decline. Intel's shares are down $2.73, or 5.4%, while those of Apple have fallen $8.50 (4.4%), combining for a roughly 74-point drag on the Dow. Also contributing significantly to the decline are Boeing \n        BA,\n       Salesforce \n        CRM,\n       and Microsoft \n        MSFT.\n       A $1 move in any one of the 30 components of the benchmark equates to a 6.59-point swing.
