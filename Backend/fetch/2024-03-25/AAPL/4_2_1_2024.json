    "text": " Apple\u00a0on Thursday reported sales and profit that beat Wall Street estimates, powered by growth in its iPhone business. But China sales missed analysts\u2019 targets. The 2% rise in overall fiscal first-quarter sales for the company ended four straight quarters of sales declines on the strength of its iPhone 15 lineup, which includes devices capable of capturing three-dimensional video for the\u00a0Vision Pro headset being released this week. Apple\u2019s total installed base of devices hit 2.2 billion, up from 2 billion a year ago. \u201cWe did feel good about the plus 6% (revenue growth) for iPhone,\u201d Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook told Reuters in an interview. \u201cWe had particularly strong double-digit growth on iPhone in emerging markets outside of China. The iPhone is doing well in those markets.\u201d He added: \u201cChina is the most competitive smartphone market in the world, and that hasn\u2019t changed.\u201d For its fiscal first quarter ended Dec. 30, Apple reported sales of $119.58 billion and profit of $2.18 per share, both above analyst expectations of $117.91 billion and $2.10 per share, according to data from LSEG. Sales of iPhones hit $69.70 billion, growing 6% to beat analyst expectations of $67.82 billion, according to LSEG data. Microsoft\u00a0in January eclipsed Apple as the world\u2019s most valuable company, with investors\u00a0viewing Apple as lagging\u00a0in the artificial-intelligence race between Wall Street\u2019s tech heavyweights. Apple\u2019s stock has dropped more than 3% in 2024, compared with the S&P 500\u2019s\u00a0.SPX\u00a02% increase. Apple has said it is researching generative AI but has instead focused on its Vision Pro headset, which analysts do not expect to bring meaningful revenue for several years. In the shorter term, analysts are increasingly worrying about sales of Apple\u2019s signature device in China, whose economy is navigating the burst of a real estate bubble. The iPhone also faces increasing competition in China and has fallen out of favor in government offices. Apple said sales in China were $20.82 billion, missing analyst estimates of $23.53 billion, according to LSEG data. Cook told Reuters that, when accounting for currency exchange rates, iPhone sales in mainland China were down \u201cmid-single digits\u201d in the quarter but said the company\u2019s installed base of iPhones in China is at an all-time high. Counterpoint Research reported China iPhone unit shipments fell during the quarter, with Chinese consumers looking to novel folding phones and homegrown rival Huawei, which re-entered the market with a flagship phone powered by a Chinese-made chip. In the rest of Asia beyond China and Japan, Apple\u2019s sales hit $10.16 billion, above analyst estimates of $9.75 billion, according to LSEG data. Cook said that iPhone sales hit an all-time high in South Korea, home to Apple\u2019s longtime rival Samsung Electronics\u00a0005930.KS. Investors will be listening closely for the Cupertino, California-based company\u2019s forecast for the fiscal second quarter on a conference call at 5 p.m. EST (2200 GMT). The biggest growth area for Apple during its fiscal first quarter was its services business, which includes the Apple TV+ service as well as music, iCloud storage and the App Store, and which rose 11% to $23.12 billion in sales. The results were slightly below analyst expectations of $23.35 billion, according to LSEG data. But Apple\u2019s App Store\u00a0faces a challenge in Europe, where a new law that takes effect in March will allow developers to skip paying commissions to Apple and place alternative app stores on the iPhone. Apple\u2019s first-quarter Mac sales were up slightly to $7.78 billion, in line with analyst expectations of $7.73 billion, according to LSEG data. Sales of iPads were down 25% to $7.02 billion, missing expectations of $7.33 billion, according to LSEG data. Apple\u2019s wearables segment, which includes its AirPods and Apple Watch sales, fell to $11.95 billion after company executives had warned of weak demand. The results were just above expectations of $11.56 billion, according to LSEG data. Several Apple Watch models have been at the center of a legal dispute with medical device maker Masimo\u00a0and were briefly pulled from shelves before Apple\u00a0removed a blood-oxygen monitoring features to comply with legal rulings and keep selling the devices. \u2013 Reuters "
