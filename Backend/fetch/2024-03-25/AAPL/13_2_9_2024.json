We know a lot of Super Bowl attention has been focused on Taylor Swift, but we want to take a moment to focus on the person performing at the half-time show: Usher. Between his new album and tour announcement, it\u2019s been a busy week. AP\u2019s Gary Hamilton has more.           LAS VEGAS (AP) \u2014 In a short film shown at the end of the Super Bowl halftime performer news conference, the show\u2019s headliner Usher comes up missing. The singer\u2019s sudden absence prompts instant panic from his friends including Ludacris, Lil Jon and Taraji P. Henson, sparking a search at various Las Vegas landmarks. Ultimately, Usher is found splashing water while dancing in a Caesar\u2019s Palace fountain in the seven-minute film \u201cWhere\u2019s Usher!?\u201d It\u2019s one of the many creative projects from Apple Music, which has made a concerted effort to amplify the anticipation around Sunday\u2019s halftime show. Since Apple Music became the halftime show sponsor, the streaming service is pushing to leave an influential mark like never before. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to extend the campaign to more than just a show on a Sunday afternoon,\u201d said Oliver Schusser, the vice president of Apple Music and Beats. The streaming service became the sponsor for the show in 2022 replacing Pepsi, which held the position for a decade. Schusser said Apple Music stepped in as a company that understands the music landscape. He called their partnership a \u201cvery powerful\u201d one with the NFL and Jay-Z\u2019s Roc Nation, which has produced the halftime show since 2019. \u201cWe want to make the halftime show press conference the artist moment,\u201d Schusser said. \u201cWe really wanted to elevate that and make that great. We did that last year. This year, we made it even bigger.\u201d  So far, Apple Music has gotten off to a promising start. Last year, the streaming service built a campaign for Rihanna \u2014 while keeping her pregnancy a secret \u2014 leading up to her performance, which became the most-watched in Super Bowl halftime history with more than 121 million viewers. As Usher prepares to headline this year\u2019s festivities, Apple Music created a strategic plan before he hits the Super Bowl stage. The streaming service has been working with the singer and his team since meeting with him during last year\u2019s Paris Fashion Week. \u201cIt\u2019s been a journey with him and his management ever since,\u201d Schusser said. \u201cWe want to make this a bigger and global event. Between Apple Music, Apple Music Radio, the talent who have a deep understanding of music and culture and obviously Apple\u2019s ecosystem, I think we can amplify that.\u201d Leading up to Sunday, it\u2019s all about Usher. Through the streaming service\u2019s app, listeners can check out the singer\u2019s halftime show trailer, his curated My Road to Halftime playlist featuring his own hits and collaborators. Usher and Jermaine Dupri created a mix of songs in spatial audio with jams including DJs Ti\u00ebsto, Gryffin and BLOND:ISH. Apple Music Radio\u2019s Nadeska Alexis had a livestreamed sit-down interview Thursday with Usher where the short film was shown. There\u2019s a story of Usher in 20 songs, an editorial feature that gives an in-depth look at his 30-year career as a performer. The platform offers a four-night Usher takeover through their live broadcasting shows hosted by Lil Wayne and Estelle along with exclusive programming on Apple Music Radio that will chronicle the singer\u2019s evolution; workout music by past halftime performers through Fitness+ and ways to revisit his past projects before the release of his ninth studio album \u201cComing Home,\u201d which comes out Friday. \u201cFrom a marketing standpoint, we approach it like a product launch,\u201d said Tor Myhren, vice president of marketing communications at Apple. \u201cYou have all the unique things about it then bring those to life. With Usher, the approach is that Usher is fun. Usher is a party. He wants to have a good time. It\u2019s really about capturing the essence of that artist, putting that together with the essence of Apple Music.\u201d Myhren said there\u2019s still a focus on Usher\u2019s performance after the Super Bowl. He said it\u2019s imperative to capitalize off the singer\u2019s show before turning the company\u2019s attention to next year\u2019s performer. \u201cWe still want people to bask in the glory of the show,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter any halftime artist plays, their streaming of their music the next week or two goes through the roof. We want to be in the middle of that. We want to give our customers a much better experience.\u201d Myhren said the foundation has been laid. \u201cIt\u2019s about the lead up to the show and how we can continue to reinvent that step,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to continue to bring this very cool musical experience to a much more global audience.\u201d Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.
