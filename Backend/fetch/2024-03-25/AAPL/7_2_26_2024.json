Contact Us | Privacy Policy EU prepares to probe Apple over Progressive Web App issues Some European lawmakers allege that Apple is shirking its responsibility to comply with the Digital Markets Act by removing Progressive Web Apps \u2014  and are preparing to launch an investigation.\r  In early February, European Union users began noticing that Progressive Web Apps weren't working properly in iOS 17.4. At the time, the issue wasn't immediately clear.\rIt was later found out that, due to security and privacy considerations, Apple opted to remove the Home Screen web apps feature in the EU. The company cited concerns about potential misuse by malicious web apps, given that third-party browsers will be available.\rHowever, as the Financial Times points out, the European Commission believes Apple may be limiting routes developers can take to avoid Apple's 30% App Store commission fee. The move has landed Apple in hot water once again as lawmakers send information requests to both the company and app developers. \r\"We are indeed looking at the compliance packages of all gatekeepers, including Apple,\" the European Commission said in a statement. \"In that context, we're in particular looking into the issue of progressive web apps, and can confirm sending the requests for information to Apple and to app developers, who can provide useful information for our assessment.\"\rApple did not provide a new comment to Financial Times. Instead, it reiterated that the change would affect only a small number of users overall. \rSupport for Progressive Web Apps has never been fantastic. However, their removal is perplexing, given Apple's previous stance on the matter. Apple has utilized the existence of this functionality as an anti-trust defense on a global level.

Apple would have to develop an entirely new framework to allow third parties to support the \u00a0functionality using their own apps and browser engines.The EU has claimed all these regulations are about leveling the playing field, but the playing field is now level here since Apple apps don\u2019t have the ability to add PWAs to the Home Screen. Nobody does. It\u2019s no longer a feature of iOS in the EU.Now they are dictating what features Apple must develop. That could be justifiable for\u00a0privacy and security issues. This isn\u2019t that. Go to the web browser of your choice and open the website. Done. What a joke.

They could put EU rep on Board and do everything to suit them. Customers could choose to buy a Euro iPhone from them, or an imported U.S. one. Let the market decide. Just spitballin\u2019.

Just straight up going to hell.\u00a0Not to mention the precedent that would set.\u00a0Better to just leave Europe and tell them that the rules is why they can\u2019t have nice things.\u00a0Any company gets to do whatever they want within the confines of the law. What the wi is trying to do is micromanage a company as if that company were part of a communist government. Now they are upset over a feature removal? Give me a break. What\u2019s next, forcing apple to change its icon designs? That would be terrible. Basically the same as having an fbi guy on staff at Twitter.
