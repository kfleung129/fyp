A spokesperson for the company stated that its roadmap includes an app native to Vision Pro\u2019s operating system, per an email via the outlet. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to see Vision Pro launch and we\u2019re supporting it by ensuring YouTube users have a great experience in Safari,\u201d YouTube\u2019s Jessica Gibby told The Verge in an email.\u00a0\u201cWe do not have any specific plans to share at this time, but can confirm that a Vision Pro app is on our roadmap.\u201d Last month, YouTube stated that it did not have plans to immediately create an app for Vision Pro, and the company told Engadget\u00a0that it would not make its iPad app available via visionOS.
