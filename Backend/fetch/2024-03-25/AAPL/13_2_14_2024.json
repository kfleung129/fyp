    "text": "Select Page Posted by Trevor Long | Feb 14, 2024 | News, On The Radio, Tech I\u2019ve seen some things in my time, but the CEO of one of the world\u2019s biggest tech companies posting a four minute video talking about how his company\u2019s product is better than the one the other big tech company just released is right up there on the charts of things I didn\u2019t expect.  That\u2019s what we got today on Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s Instagram account. Apple Vision Pro is the device on the minds of all tech heads right now, it\u2019s newly released and of course, it\u2019s an all new product for Apple. When I used it, I did it with the years of experience using other and similar headsets, and I stand by my ongoing comments that \u201cApple Vision Pro is the single most remarkable piece of technology I\u2019ve ever used.  I just don\u2019t know why we need it.\u201d While plenty of people love to come at Tech reviewers and a perceived bias that exists based on any number of factors, the Zuckerberg Post is pure gold. He does admit some solid wins to Apple, like \u201cApple\u2019s eye tracking is really nice\u201c, but goes on to say that Meta had that in Quest Pro and will likely bring it back in future. Likewise, \u201cApple\u2019s screen does have a higher resolution, and, and that\u2019s, that\u2019s really nice\u201d \u2013 but, \u201cApple\u2019s headset has this motion blur as you move around, Quest is just a lot crisper.\u201d Basically, Zuckerberg says in simple terms that Apple\u2019s headset is heavy, has a narrow field of view and that Apple has made compromises in the creation of this device. Critically, Zuckerberg points out that you can do the same things on Quest 3 that people are demonstrating with the Apple Vision Pro \u2013 showing things like browser windows open in the augmented space. But what the Meta CEO never does is talk about the control of those windows and control generally, other than to touch on \u201cfor input, Quest supports precision controllers that are great for games. Both headsets support hand tracking, but you know, I found ours (Meta) to be a little more accurate.\u201d Ahh, mate, this is buring the lede something solid.  The key and core difference here is that you don\u2019t have to use clumsy controllers to do basic tasks on Vision Pro.  To skip over that is rather disingenuous overall. He even points to a future where a \u201cNeural interface\u201d might be used for control.  Completely skipping the era of hand controls. For the most part though, Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s key points relate to a lack of things to do, content to use, games to play \u2013 he even noted you can Play Xbox on Quest 3. And this is \u2013 critically, Apple\u2019s number 1 battle ground. Apple need \u2013 urgently, for developers to build the things we will do in Vision Pro.  To build the ideas that will make vision Pro a success. That might be multi-person virtual environments, games, or other applications, but it does showcase the core advantage Meta has right now.  Time.  They\u2019ve had years working with developers on these headsets, Apple is starting from Scratch. Fascinating though for him to call it all out, so publicly.
