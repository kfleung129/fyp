Of the companies that reported results, 78.6% beat EPS estimates and 64.4% surpassed revenue estimates. The pace of earnings and revenue growth represents an acceleration from the last couple of quarters, with the technology sector being a major contributor. Notably, the earnings growth is the best growth rate for the S&P 500 companies since the 6.2% earnings growth rate in the second quarter of 2022. The resilience of the U.S. economy has played a crucial role in the rise of the stock market. However, it has reduced the likelihood of a near-term rate cut. Factors like robust retail sales, consumer sentiment and a cooling trend in the producer price index indicate the possibility of the Fed achieving a soft landing, bringing inflation back to target without triggering a recession.
