    "text": " Listen here or\u00a0wherever you get your podcasts. Hello, and welcome back to\u00a0Equity, the podcast about the business of startups, where we unpack the numbers and nuance behind the headlines. This is our interview show, where we sit down with interesting, knowledgeable folks and dive deep into what they are building, designing or thinking about. Today, we have Anshu Sharma back on the podcast. Last time, the Skyflow CEO riffed with us on interest rates and business cycles. This time, we wanted to talk to him about a theory he recently wrote up for TechCrunch: The Innovator\u2019s Dilemma. What if Christensen was wrong about disruption?  Or perhaps, a partial solution to that dilemma. The gist is that instead of using lower-cost products to take on incumbents, you might want to start at the top end of the market. This comes to bear today with the Apple Vision Pro headset, which is very expensive, and is entering a category replete with big investments and occasional returns. Equity will be back tomorrow with our regular news roundtable, so we\u2019ll chat with you soon! For episode transcripts and more, head to\u00a0Equity\u2019s Simplecast website. Equity drops at 7 a.m. PT every Monday, Wednesday and Friday, so subscribe to us on\u00a0Apple Podcasts,\u00a0Overcast,\u00a0Spotify\u00a0and\u00a0all the casts.
