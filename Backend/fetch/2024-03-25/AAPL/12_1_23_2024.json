    "text": "Countdown to Luke Lango\u2019s \u201c2nd Trillion-Dollar A.I. Trade\u201d The U.S. govt just unlocked an $8 trillion market to move in a new direction. See how it could unleash 6,000% potential upside. In 2024 the rally could end for these three stocks Advertisement Source: shutterstock.com/eamesBot The \u201cMagnificent 7\u201d stocks experienced a great rally in 2023. These tech giants were also the key reason why the\u00a0S&P 500\u00a0and the\u00a0Nasdaq Composite\u00a0rose 43% and 24% last year, respectively. While\u00a0many of the magnificent 7 stocks were largely safer bets amidst much of the macro-induced market volatility, chances are 2024 will not be the same. Below are the stocks of three, major tech giants that investors should consider dumping, at least for the short run. Not surprisingly, the iPhone maker\u2019s stock had a good run in 2023, increasing nearly 50%. However, recent challenges related to its revenue growth in its key product lines have largely cast doubt on the company\u2019s future growth prospects. Despite new iPhone and iPad releases, Apple\u2019s (NASDAQ:AAPL) revenue growth\u00a0remained unchanged, disappointing investors. The mobile handset market is at capacity. Consumer demand for smartphones is decreasing as they lose novelty with each iteration. Another reason investors should be wary of AAPL stock is the uncertainty of the China market, which\u00a0accounted for\u00a0about 19% of Apple\u2019s revenue at the end of its fiscal year 2023. Huawei\u2019s launch of the Mate 60 Pro led many Chinese consumers to favor it over the new iPhone amidst geopolitical tensions. According to a report by Bloomberg in late October, Apple\u2019s iPhone 15 sales were still behind the predecessor, largely due to the resurgence of Huawei\u2019s flagship device. Unless Apple pursues a broad and competent diversification strategy, investors should not hope for strong share price appreciation. All in all, it\u2019s one of those stocks to sell. When\u00a0OpenAI\u00a0released\u00a0ChatGPT\u00a0earlier this year, a lot of market spectators, investors, and ordinary people marveled at the technology. Meanwhile, others wondered if Microsoft\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) billion-dollar investment in the startup was finally paying off. The computer software giant had\u00a0initially invested $1 billion in OpenAI\u00a0back in 2019, but its cumulative investment has swelled beyond $13 billion. There was also a lot of hope that ChatGPT would change the growth prospects for Microsoft\u2019s Bing browser, but current numbers leave more to be desired. Last year, when Satya Nadella went to testify against Google\u2019s anti-competitive, web browser practices, he noted that even the AI-powered ChatGPT has not been able to help Microsoft meaningfully break into the search browser market. He also denied artificial intelligence was leading to dramatic shifts in Microsoft\u2019s market share. Microsoft\u2019s stock last year rose 58%, and its market cap now is encroaching upon $3 trillion, higher than even that of Apple\u2019s. If much of that share appreciation was related to the AI craze feeding into the market. Investors should be vigilant about when this hype will fizzle out. Tesla\u00a0(NASDAQ:TSLA) is one of the dominant players in the global electric vehicle market. The automaker managed to beat estimates throughout 2023. In particular, Tesla\u2019s quarterly earnings have come in\u00a0above analysts\u2019 estimates, and the price-cut strategy the automaker began to pursue in the beginning year has increased quarterly deliveries while also placing pressure on gross margins. However, even though Tesla may be a decent long-term bet if one is betting on the overall EV market, the stock may face some headwinds and seriously underperform throughout 2024. Delivery numbers for Q4 2023 were\u00a0released\u00a0in early January. Despite beating Wall Street\u2019s estimates again, the automaker\u2019s deliveries trailed behind Chinese competitor BYD (OTCMKTS:BYDDY). The question of whether Tesla will continue to be second place to BYD internationally will likely be on the minds of investors this year. If Tesla continues to underperform in that regard, the stock could lose much of its luster in 2024.
