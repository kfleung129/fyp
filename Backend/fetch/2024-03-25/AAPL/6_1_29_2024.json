    "text": "After 25 years at Apple, DJ Novotney, who played a key role in initiating the iCar project, is leaving to join Rivian Electric vehicle manufacturer Rivian has started 2024 with a bang, poaching Apple\u2019s vice president of hardware engineering, DJ Novotney, away from the world\u2019s biggest tech company. In his new role, he will reportedly lead management for new products and engineering. Novotney has been with Apple for nearly 25 years, and in that time has played an important role in developing several of the tech company\u2019s most recognizable products. A part of the teams that created iPods, iPhones, iPads, and the Apple Watch, he was also reportedly a member of the team developing the iCar, though he left that team as part of a reorganization. \u201cGreat products are what we do best and I have been so very lucky along the way to be part of so many amazing teams,\u201d Novotney wrote in a memo seen by Bloomberg. \u201cApple has been my life, but now is the time for me to move on and help bring to life a new set of products.\u201d His role at one of America\u2019s best-known companies makes Novotney a major score for Rivian, which is in the process of developing a new platform for mass market electric vehicles. An important source of revenue for the automaker, the new R2 vehicles based on it will be central to the company\u2019s future success.

Meanwhile, in Cupertino, this is just the latest departure of a senior figure for Apple. The company will lose its vice president of design for the iPhone and Apple Watch, Tang Tan, next month, while head of hardware technologies, Steve Hotelling, left late last year.
