The tech giant has been making headlines left and right as it juggles a handful of downgrades to its stock price, faces required major changes to its App Store policies, and gears up for a potential antitrust lawsuit that could target large swaths of its business. All of this comes as Apple prepares to launch its $3,499 Vision Pro headset. Apple\u2019s most ambitious product in years, the Vision Pro catapults the company into a product category that even established players like Meta (META) have struggled to turn into a hit. It\u2019s a lot to say the least. But it\u2019s not all doom and gloom for Apple. Generative AI-equipped iPhones and a reacceleration of the company\u2019s services business should help goose growth in the years ahead. And if the Vision Pro takes off, it would provide an entirely new revenue stream across both Apple\u2019s hardware and services segments. \u201cI don't think Apple's in any way under any existential threat right now that didn't exist before,\u201d Deepwater Asset Management managing partner Gene Munster told Yahoo Finance. \u201cIt's just that they're participating in markets that [have] slower growth and they're looking for ways to try to juice that growth.\u201d China is Apple\u2019s third-largest market, generating $72.6 billion of the company\u2019s $383.3 billion in total revenue in 2023. North America, Apple\u2019s biggest market, generated $162.6 billion, while Europe generated $94.3 billion. All this makes reports of a slowdown in iPhone sales in China perhaps Apple\u2019s biggest and most pressing story. A sluggish economic recovery coupled with a resurgent Huawei, which despite US sanctions has managed to put out smartphones with modern processors and features, are expected to hurt Apple\u2019s market share in the country. According to Counterpoint Research, the iPhone maker controlled 15% of the Chinese market in Q3 2023. That was slightly better than Huawei\u2019s 14%, but behind Vivo\u2019s 16% and Oppo\u2019s 19%. Analysts at Barclays, Piper Sandler, and Redburn Atlantic each pointed to the region as a potential problem for Apple with Barclays\u2019s Tim Long saying that the firm saw \u201cincrementally worse\u201d iPhone 15 data out of China. He also added that he doesn\u2019t predict any \u201cfeatures or upgrades that are likely to make the iPhone 16 more compelling.\u201d Redburn Atlantic\u2019s James Cordwell also called out China in a Jan. 10 note, saying that he remains concerned about Apple\u2019s competitive position in the country. Piper Sandler\u2019s Harsh Kumar and Robert Aguanno said that the deteriorating macro environment in China could weigh on Apple\u2019s handset business. \u201cWe highlight in our outlook that China is a key swing factor for sales next year,\u201d Aguanno told Yahoo Finance. \u201cAny recovery in expectations for iPhone growth will be fueled by either the reemergence of the Chinese consumer along with outsized growth in other emerging markets such as India.\u201d Apple is also contending with reports that the Department of Justice is preparing to file an antitrust lawsuit against the company. According to the New York Times, the department could file the lawsuit, which would focus on Apple\u2019s strategic hardware and software moats, as soon as March. Critics have long called on antitrust enforcers to take action against Apple for establishing policies that prevent users from accessing apps from third-party app stores or keep device and app makers from using certain hardware features of Apple\u2019s iPhone, such as its mobile payment technology. The European Union is also attempting to force Apple to loosen restrictions on its App Store, including allowing third-party app stores on the iPhone. The company has also set up new App Store rules in the US that allow developers to advertise third-party links for making app purchases outside of the App Store. Apple will still charge a commission on those sales but will lower the amount from 15% or 30% to 12% or 27%. That drew a sharp rebuke from longtime rivals like Spotify who say Apple\u2019s changes don\u2019t go far enough. Apple\u2019s new Vision Pro AR/VR headset is also a major part of its 2024 equation. The device, which is available for preorder and hits the market Feb. 2, is a huge gamble for Apple, as it looks to enter a completely new market. With a starting price of $3,499, the Vision Pro won\u2019t reach the kind of sales volumes as the iPhone. And while early reports say preorders have sold out, there\u2019s no guarantee that interest in the spatial computer will remain high. \u201cInitial sales data upon the device launch is encouraging to us but we would still be cautious about the long-term prospects for the device,\u201d Aguanno said. \u201cIt\u2019s too early to tell here.\u201d That said, Apple\u2019s long-term prospects remain strong, the analysts said. Bank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan told Yahoo Finance Live that he has a high degree of conviction that Apple will continue to move higher in the coming years. \u201cPrimarily it\u2019s about generative AI on iPhones,\u201d he said. \u201cWe think that\u2019s going to be a major catalyst.\u201d Mohan further added that he believes the Vision Pro will have long-term potential on the hardware and services fronts. Aguanno offered a similar take on the company\u2019s future outlook, saying Apple\u2019s market positioning and product set is solid. We\u2019ll get our first taste of Apple\u2019s 2024 performance when it reports its earnings on Feb. 1. Daniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.
