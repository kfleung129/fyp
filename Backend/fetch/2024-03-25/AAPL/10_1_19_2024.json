    "text": "       Preorders launched for Apple's new Vision Pro early Friday morning, and it looks like customers were eager to snap up the first available units. The very first orders of the headset showed a February 2 delivery date, which is the day the headset launches. Those preordering could select either to get the product shipped to their address or their nearby Apple store for pickup. But as more people forked over at least $3,499 for the device, the delivery estimates quickly began to slip. Related stories A couple hours later, the Vision Pro \u2014 the $3,499 256 GB, the $3,700 512 GB, and the $3,900 1TB versions \u2014 was estimated to arrive on doorsteps during the first week of March. It's worth noting that it's a fluid situation, so it's worth double-checking whether Apple has made an earlier delivery window available for a particular configuration of the headset. The Vision Pro, with its sky-high price tag, was always expected to be a smaller launch than something like the newest iPhone. Earlier this month, analyst and Apple supply chain expert Ming-Chi Kuo predicted that the company would produce only 60,000 to 80,000 Vision Pro units for the initial launch. \"Since the shipment is not large, I believe that Vision Pro will sell out soon after the release,\" Kuo wrote on X. If you're hoping to be the first to get your hands on one, you can always try your luck in person at an Apple store on launch day. And if you don't have thousands to spend on the device, you can try it for free. You'll be able to sign up to demo the device at some Apple stores during the first weekend in February.
