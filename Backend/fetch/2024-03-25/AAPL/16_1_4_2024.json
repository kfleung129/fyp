(02:36) This is an abridged transcript of the podcast. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has agreed to settle a lawsuit which alleged that the company knowingly let scammers exploit its gift cards, and keep the stolen funds for itself. According to the Reuters report, Apple and the plaintiffs agreed on material settlement terms after working with a mediator, the report added citing a filing in federal court in San Jose, California. The issue involved scammers who insisted that victims buy App Store and iTunes gift cards to pay for things like taxes, hospital bills, utility bills, bail and debt collection. Victims were then told to share the codes on the backs of the cards, in spite of a warning sign on the cards which reads, \"Do not share your code with anyone you do not know.\" As per the complaint, Apple would typically deposit about 70% of the stolen funds into the scammers' bank accounts, and keep about 30% for itself as a \"commission\" for knowingly converting stolen codes into dollars. According to the complaint, the victims likely lost \"hundreds of millions of dollars\" in the fraud. The lawsuit covered anyone in the U.S. who bought gift cards redeemable on iTunes or the App Store between 2015 and July 31, 2020 and provided codes to the scammers, and did not receive refunds from Apple. A draft for a formal settlement is being prepared to be presented for preliminary approval. In June 2022, a judge denied Apple's efforts to dismiss the lawsuit.

The firm is currently looking to increase sales in the US and Latin America. TikTok Shop is one of the fastest-growing features for ByteDance (BDNCE).
