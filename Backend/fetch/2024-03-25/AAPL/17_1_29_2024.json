But according to federal prosecutors, Halvorsen sold at least 141 of the computers for cash, costing the company more than a half-million dollars. Halvorsen, a 49-year-old Livermore resident, pleaded guilty Monday to conspiring to transport stolen property out of California. His federal indictment alleged that he started stealing and selling MacBooks in 2019, and kept up the scheme until last May. The company that employed him is not named in the indictment, which refers to it as a \u201ccloud-based machine data analytics\u201d business.

Halvorsen was undone by a joint investigation between the IRS and FBI, according to the U.S. Department of Justice. He faces a maximum five years in prison and $250,000 fine, but prosecutors are asking the court for 18 to 24 months imprisonment, given his guilty plea. However, the prosecution noted in the plea agreement that its position on sentencing could change, depending on Halvorsen\u2019s future cooperation with investigators or any \u201cpost-plea obstruction of justice.\u201d According to the plea agreement, he agreed to pay back his company\u2019s losses of $535,800, and could also be hit with a court-ordered fine. Halvorsen\u2019s sentencing is scheduled for April 15. Copyright \u00a9 2024 MediaNews Group "
