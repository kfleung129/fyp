Published on By The Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 Lite tablet turned out to be so successful that Samsung is releasing variations of it for the third time.  The original was released in 2020, then there was a re-release in 2022 with minor changes (mainly SoC), and now the 2024 model will be on sale.  The first region where the Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 Lite (2024) is available is Romania.

The tablet immediately runs Android 14 with One UI 6.1 shell.  The 2022 model came with Android 12 and One UI 4.0, and was recently updated to One UI 6.0.

Moreover, this time we are not talking about the Chinese version of the tablet, but about the global one. Xiaomi Pad 5 users outside of China have started receiving the HyperOS beta version number 1.0.1.0.TKXMIXM.  For now, it is only available to Mi Pilot program members.  If no critical bugs are found, the system will be released as an over-the-air update for all device users.

Published on By Samsung now offers one of the longest supports on the market for a number of its latest smartphones: up to 7 years of software updates, and this includes the operating system.  But the company went further and increased this period to 8 years!  True, not for smartphones. Tablets will receive updates for 8 years, but not all, but only those aimed at the corporate market.  Smartphones for the same market will have 7 years of updates.  So far, the only tablet for which 8 years of support has already been confirmed is the Galaxy Tab Active5.  The Galaxy Xcover7 smartphone offers 7 years.  At the same time, at the launch of these devices they announced 5 years of support. \nFor the enterprise market, software support is often much more important than for the consumer market.  As for tablets, they are replaced less often than smartphones, so Samsung\u2019s actions here are quite logical.
