Login Apple was already the least-loved big tech stock on Wall Street. Growing concerns over iPhone sales have now triggered a second downgrade this week, cementing analysts\u2019 cautious approach. Piper Sandler & Co\u2019s Harsh Kumar cut his Apple rating on Thursday, citing a weak macro environment in China that will dampen demand for iPhones. Coming into 2024, Apple was the big tech stock with the least number of bullish recommendations, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\u00a0Bloomberg \u201cWe are concerned about handset inventories,\u201d Kumar said in a note, lowering his recommendation for Apple to neutral from overweight after holding a bullish view since March 2020. \u201cGrowth rates have peaked for unit sales,\u201d he said. Kumar\u2019s downgrade follows a more bearish move by peers at Barclays Plc, where analysts led by Tim Long cut their rating to underweight on Tuesday. Coming into 2024, Apple was the big tech stock with the least number of bullish recommendations, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Piper Sandler\u2019s downgrade now pushes the company\u2019s buy-equivalent ratio down even further \u2014 with the percentage of analysts bullish on the company at a three-year low. Apple was the only big tech firm to see revenues contract for the past four quarters. Wall Street is currently anticipating revenue growth of just 3.6 per cent in fiscal 2024 and profit expansion of 7.9 per cent, according to the average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The stock, which had rallied nearly 50 per cent last year, has stumbled in the first sessions of 2024. It has slid 5.2 per cent this year, wiping off more than $US155 billion in market value, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The shares are now on the brink of breaching into the oversold territory as they\u2019re set to extend losses for a fourth consecutive session; they were 1.4 per cent lower to $US181.74 near 11am in New York. Nearly unanimously bullish on big tech, Wall Street is more cautious when it comes to Apple. The stock has attracted only 33 buy-equivalent recommendations. That pales in comparison to Amazon\u2019s 68, Meta Platforms\u2019s 66 and the 59 bullish ratings for Nvidia.
