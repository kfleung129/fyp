Whether you want to build your own home theater or just learn more about TVs, displays, projectors, and more, we've got you covered. Get tech's top stories in 30 seconds: iPads are expensive, but useful if you like to stream videos or read on the go Jump to a Section An iPad offers better portability than a laptop, and their big screens make them better than a phone for streaming video, reading websites, and getting work done. The iPad is also a great e-book reader. You may not need an iPad if you already carry around a phone and a laptop, and they are pretty expensive, but you might be surprised at just how often an iPad can come in handy. This guide will help determine whether you need an iPad based on your lifestyle and needs if you're on the fence. An iPad is a tablet that runs on iPadOS, a variation of the operating system that powers iPhones. As a tablet, an iPad is a thin touchscreen device that resembles an oversized iPhone or the screen of a laptop with the keyboard portion removed. In addition to the standard iPad, you can also get a lightweight iPad Air, a powerful iPad Pro, or a compact iPad mini. These devices are all highly integrated into the Apple ecosystem, allowing you to access your iCloud files on the go and use most of the same apps you can use on an iPhone. They're better for consuming media and getting work done than iPhones due to their larger displays, and they're more portable than MacBooks. An iPad may replace your need for a laptop in specific situations. You should consider an iPad if you: Not everyone needs an iPad. You might not if you: There are a lot of situations where an iPad can come in handy, and some people can even replace their desktop computer or laptop with an iPad. Here are some reasons you might consider getting an iPad. The iPad is a high-quality tablet that can be useful regardless of what other hardware you own. It comes alive if you\u2019re already in the Apple Ecosystem. If you use an iPhone, wear an Apple Watch, and do most of your work on an iMac or MacBook, you\u2019ll find that an iPad is a natural extension of that family of devices. AirDrop lets you seamlessly transfer files, iCloud gives you access to photos, settings, and other data, and you can even use an iPad as a second monitor with your Mac. If you\u2019re an artist or enjoy doodling in your free time, the Apple Pencil is a game-changer. It turns the iPad into a drawing tablet, and the latest version even wirelessly charges when magnetically connected to the iPad. It\u2019s also tremendously helpful if you take a lot of handwritten notes for your job or any other purpose, as it makes it easy to jot down notes and organize them for quick access later. Whether you love binge-watching Netflix, spend all day listening to music or podcasts, or are an avid reader, an iPad represents an upgrade over using a phone or laptop. The big screen is better for video content and e-books, and the built-in speakers provide better sound for instances where you find yourself without your earbuds. An iPad is also easier to carry and hold for long periods than a laptop. An iPad is a perfect solution whether you\u2019re FaceTiming friends and family or stuck in Zoom meetings all day for work. Instead of tying up your computer or laptop or relying on the tiny screen of your phone, making video calls on your iPad allows you to free up your other devices and increase your productivity. The latest iPads also have unique features like Center Stage designed to improve video calls. Despite their big screens and powerful hardware, iPads have excellent battery life. If you often find yourself on the go all day, without time to stop and charge your phone, an iPad could be a game-changer. Instead of your phone battery hanging by a thread at day's end, shifting tasks to the iPad will likely see both batteries in the green even after the longest, most active days. There are many reasons to get an iPad, but not everyone needs one. They are expensive, and some people won\u2019t get enough out of an iPad to justify the purchase. Here are some of the reasons you might not want an iPad. The base iPad model might be more affordable than you expect, but it's still pretty expensive compared to other tablets. If you're working on a tight budget and already have a phone and laptop, it might be a stretch to justify an iPad's premium price tag. You can find Android tablets that cost significantly less if you don't need a high-performance device. Or consider sticking with the gear you already have. One of the biggest problems with the iPad family of devices is Apple charges a premium for storage. There is always a base model with little internal storage and significantly more expensive options with more storage. Most Android tablets let you insert an inexpensive microSD card if you need more space, but Apple doesn\u2019t give you that option. If that\u2019s a deal-breaker, then you shouldn\u2019t get an iPad. Apple releases a new iPad every 12 to 18 months, and the releases of new iPads, iPad Airs, and iPad Pros are staggered. That means a new iPad is almost always around the corner, and the iPad you buy today might be overshadowed by a new model tomorrow. If you don\u2019t need an iPad, see when the next model and the most likely new features are coming. If the next model includes any killer new features you need, you may want to wait before you buy. An iPad can help you increase your productivity if you're an artist or find yourself in many video calls, spend a lot of time out of the office, or take lots of notes. While you can do many things with a phone and laptop that you can do with an iPad, there are a lot of situations where an iPad is a more efficient option, is easier to carry around, and provides a superior experience. An iPad is also handy during downtime, as the big screen is great for streaming media and reading e-books, especially if you currently do those things on a cramped phone screen. While an iPad can accomplish many of the same tasks as a laptop, that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re interchangeable. There are probably some tasks you\u2019ll still need your laptop for, but there are also a lot of situations where you\u2019ll be able to leave your laptop at home and only carry the much lighter iPad. The transition is seamless if you use an iPhone, iPad, or MacBook. You can also use an iPad as a second screen for your MacBook, for video calls while still using your MacBook for other tasks, and for creating art and jotting notes if you add an Apple Pencil. You can use an iPad exclusively, depending on where you go to school and the apps you\u2019re required to use. That could save you money since iPads are cheaper than MacBooks, lighter, and easier to carry between classes. However, your school might require apps that won\u2019t run on an iPad, or your workload requires an actual laptop. In those cases, you\u2019ll need to decide if the convenience of the iPad is worth the extra cost, especially if you\u2019ll typically need to carry a laptop to class in addition to the iPad. Apple offers several iPad models to hit a wide variety of price points, and the difference in price between the entry-level iPad and a top-of-the-line iPad Pro is huge. If you plan on reasonably light usage, like streaming media, sending emails, and taking notes, you can safely avoid an iPad Pro and get a regular iPad. The current iPad Air model will typically have hardware similar to the previous iPad Pro at a significantly lower price point if you want to save money without taking too much of a hit in performance. If you need extra power or enjoy all the latest bells and whistles and can afford the higher price tag, the latest iPad Pro will significantly outperform the competition. The first- and second-generation Apple Pencils use different means to sync with an iPad, but they're both easy. For the original, plug the Pencil into the Lightning port at the bottom of your tablet (the same one you use to charge the iPad). For the second-gen, attach the Pencil to the magnetic connector on the side of the iPad. It's on the same side as the volume buttons. After doing either of these steps, the iPad will automatically detect and pair with the Apple Pencil. Like the iPhone, the iPad supports AirPrint, which lets you send documents and photos to a compatible printer. As long as both the printer and your iPad are on the same wireless network, you can transmit something and print it through the Share menu.
