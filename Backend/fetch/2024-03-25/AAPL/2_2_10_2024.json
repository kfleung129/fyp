    "text": "The last time Microsoft became the most valuable company in the world was in 2021. In January this year, the situation repeated itself, but not for long: Microsoft briefly overtook Apple in terms of market capitalisation and took first place, but then fell back to second place. Almost a month has passed - and Microsoft is again the most expensive company in the world. The company ended the week at $420.55 per share (+1.56% for Friday). As a result, Microsoft's market capitalisation currently stands at $3.124 trillion. This is an absolute record among all companies. The previous record was set by Apple: its market capitalisation reached $3.09 trillion on July 31, 2023. It now stands at $2.916 trillion. In addition, the top 10 includes Alphabet (Google), Amazon, NVIDIA, Meta (Facebook) and TSMC. Source: CompaniesMarketCap "
