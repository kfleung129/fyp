By \n\n\tAlex Weprin Media & Business Writer Tim Cook wanted to know more about the stats. The Apple CEO was huddled over an iMac in the NBA\u2019s league headquarters in New York alongside NBA commissioner Adam Silver, flanked by a wall of regulation basketballs. On the white table in front of them was the computer, and a piece of hardware that Cook says \u201creally changes everything.\u201d Apple Vision Pro. The NBA had been hard at work on a dedicated app for the device, and two of its developers, senior software engineers Lauren Marshall and Matthew Parrott, were walking Cook and Silver through its features, like the ability to watch up to five games at once, the possibilities of immersive video, and, as Cook inquired about, real-time stats that can be displayed next to the live games.\u00a0\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRelated Stories\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tLifestyle\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCONCACAF Nations League Final 2024 Livestream: How to Watch USA vs. Mexico Online\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tGeneral News\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNBC's Paris Olympics Opening Ceremony Coming to Imax Cook and Silver, in a joint interview shortly after the demo, were effusive about the potential of the device to transform not just how people watch sports, but all entertainment content. \u201cI\u2019ve seen several demos of the output of different games, and it\u2019s just mind blowing, it\u2019s so much different,\u201d Cook said, when quizzed by The Hollywood Reporter about the potential of the device. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to go back to the 2-D world after you\u2019ve been in the 3-D world, you just don\u2019t want to do it.\u201d \u201cI think what the marketplace is going to do now is cause other content creator organizations \u2014 not just the NBA \u2014 to look at the transformative nature of this and start investing,\u201d Silver added, recalling a meeting with Cook years earlier in his office, where the tech executive urged the league to invest in its own direct-to-consumer operations. \u201cThere\u2019s\u00a0a strong incentive now for us to take this global content and find ways to distribute it around the world and create an even more engaging and immersive experience. So I think you\u2019re going to see a lot of content creators saying, we need our own developers, we need our own engineers. We can\u2019t just leave it to others, and that\u2019ll raise the bar for everybody.\u201d Cook\u2019s tour of the NBA league office took place the morning of Vision Pro\u2019s release day, Friday Feb. 2. Just a couple of hours earlier, Cook was on hand to open the doors of Apple\u2019s flagship Fifth Ave. Store, with employees counting down from 10 to signal Cook to swing open the oversize glass doors, and a line of die-hard Apple enthusiasts waiting outside to pick up their Vision Pro devices. Cook shook their hands as they walked in, and stuck around for selfies and to chat with buyers. A few blocks south and a few hours later in the NBA office, Cook says that many of the first customers he spoke to that morning were developers looking to get their hands on the Vision Pro so that they could experience it for themselves. He adds that, similarly, Apple is also deeply invested in getting the Vision Pro in the hands of creators who will create original content for the device, partners like the NBA and Disney, yes, but also people like filmmaker James Cameron, or Jon Favreau (who helped create an immersive dinosaur experience for the device that has to be seen to be believed). \u201cWe started talking to a lot of creators, and everybody is blown away by the storytelling that can take place in this versus the tools of the past,\u201d Cook says. \u201cAnd so my gut is there\u2019s going to be a lot of people running towards this, but we\u2019ll see.\u201d In the NBA\u2019s office, of course, live sports is always top of mind. The league\u2019s app had been in development since shortly after the Vision Pro was announced at last year\u2019s WWDC. \u201cWe had a lot of discussions about immersive environments versus the shared space where you can have apps living side by side,\u201d says Chad Evans, the NBA senior VP, head of product and platform. The Vision Pro allows for both, the ability to envelope yourself in an environment like a theater, or an environment where you can simultaneously access other apps. \u201cWhen we think about the fan experience, they\u00a0want to be able to talk to their friends about the game. They want to be able to access their social media apps. And so we really thought about this multi app environment where you can surround yourself with NBA content and how can our app live in that ecosystem.\u201d Evans adds that actually trying the device was \u201csort of this aha moment,\u201d allowing his team to understand what they wanted to do. And then there\u2019s the potential for immersive video, which can put users at the center of the action. \u201cI think the fan wants to be a part of the game and a part of the action, and there\u2019s nothing like being\u00a0in Vision Pro and feeling like you\u2019re on the court,\u201d Cook says. \u201cIt\u2019s not that you have a courtside seat. It\u2019s so much better than that.\u201d \u201cAs Tim said it this is in many ways better than sitting courtside,\u201d Silver added. \u201cIt can take you anywhere on the floor. It can give you the perspective of a player, it can bring you places that you could never otherwise go and absorb it.\u201d And even Silver waxed poetic about its potential to change how consumers watch sports. \u201cWe saw it for soccer, we saw it for baseball [in the Vision Pro demo],\u00a0and I think as Tim said, this is of course early days, but this is transformative,\u201d Silver added. \u201cThis\u00a0to me, will be how people over time experience sports through the media.\u201d Of course, there will be an adjustment period required. \u201cIt will take a lot, you know, it will take rethinking about production and camera locations on the courts and so forth. You will have to re-engineer everything, but it\u2019s so worth it,\u201d Cook says. After completing the demo\u00a0Silver and Cook walked down a set of wooden bleachers into what is normally the NBA employee cafe. The tables and chairs had been cleared out, however. Instead, waiting for them was the NBA development team responsible for the Vision Pro app. Cook and Silver shook hands and posed for photos, including a group shot. On the wall is an almost floor to ceiling screen showing NBA footage. Evans, speaking with THR on bench seating overlooking a foggy Fifth Avenue and Central Park, expresses enthusiasm for the potential of immersive spatial video recording of games. Silver says the NBA is already planning to take advantage of the tech, and will utilize some of Apple\u2019s specialized equipment to film All Star week events in Indianapolis later this month, but ultimately he expects any network or streaming service with live sports to experiment it. \u201cI\u2019d say in terms of a rights category, one thing that Apple has been so great at is looking out into the future,\u201d Silver says. \u201cI see sort of a double meaning of Vision Pro, it is literally a vision of the future. And as we look out, I\u2019d have\u00a0to imagine that anyone who\u2019s licensing content for us is going to want to have these rights themselves, whether it\u2019s actually Apple or someone who\u2019s producing content: Disney, ESPN in order to use Apple hardware. \u201cI think it\u2019s my job to incentivize our partners to be able to look out into the future,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019re just scratching the surface here.\u201d Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter Send us a tip using our anonymous form.
