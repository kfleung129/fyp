    "text": "Apple announced last year that it would extend its agreement with Qualcomm to continue using the company\u2019s 5G modems until 2026. However, as Apple\u2019s plans to build its own modems have been thwarted, it will continue to use Qualcomm\u2019s modems in the iPhone until 2027 at least. The news was confirmed by Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon during the company\u2019s first fiscal quarter 2024 report. According to Amon, Qualcomm will continue to license its 5G modems to Apple until March 2027. Previously, the deal had already been extended until 2026. He also told CNBC that he\u2019s \u201chappy with the relationship with Apple.\u201d Apple is yet to comment on the extended deal with Qualcomm. However, the news doesn\u2019t come as a surprise. The company has been trying to develop its own 5G modems to replace Qualcomm\u2019s for years. In 2019, Apple acquired Intel\u2019s modem division in a $1 billion deal. The acquisition gave Apple more than 17,000 patents and more than 2,200 Intel employees. However, all these efforts were not enough to help the Cupertino-based company. A Bloomberg report last year revealed that the development of Apple\u2019s 5G modems has been a \u201cfrustrating journey\u201d for the company\u2019s engineers and executives. According to people familiar with the matter, the prototypes have failed to outperform Qualcomm\u2019s modems in terms of performance and efficiency. The initial goal was to ship the first devices with in-house 5G modems this year. However, the two renewals of the agreement with Qualcomm suggest that Apple is far from shipping its first 5G modem. It\u2019s worth noting that\u00a0Qualcomm is also the supplier of the satellite communication module used by iPhone 14 and iPhone 15 models. FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links. More.
