While many entertainment companies are taking a wait-and-see approach to Apple\u2019s new Vision Pro spatial computing headset, The Walt Disney Company has been on board from day one. When Apple first unveiled the $3,500 vr/ar/mr headset last June, Disney was introduced as a key launch partner that would have an app ready for the device\u2019s launch. \u201cWe\u2019re constantly in search of new ways to entertain, inform, and inspire our fans by combining extraordinary creativity with groundbreaking technology to create truly remarkable experiences,\u201d Disney CEO Bob Iger said at the time. \u201cWe believe Apple Vision Pro is a revolutionary platform that can make our vision a reality.\u201d An article in Fast Company offers new insights into the Disney Company\u2019s firm commitment to Apple\u2019s tech, which officially launched this past Friday. It quotes Disney Entertainment & ESPN president and chief technology officer Aaron LaBerge, who describes Disney\u2019s interest in the following way: \u201cWe\u2019re a storytelling company, and this is a platform that allows us to tell stories in a different way. That\u2019s why we were so excited about it.\u201d At this early juncture, Disney hasn\u2019t yet begun to tell any stories that are native to the Vision Pro. Rather, it has ported a version of its Disney+ streaming service to the headset. The Vision Pro version of Disney+ offers a series of 3d environmental skins, allowing users of the service to view films while, for example, on the scare floor of Monsters, Inc. or in the Avengers Tower. It\u2019s a slick gimmick that is perhaps best explained by watching a video of someone exploring the interface: More ambitious projects are in the works. Disney is tight-lipped about what specifically it has planned for the Vision Pro with the exception of a single project that the company announced last year: an app based on Marvel\u2019s animated What If\u2026? series. According to Disney exec LaBerge though, this is only the beginning: This product has touched every part of our company, from the studios to the teams that manage our streaming services to our mobile developers. Even our teams at the parks have been involved in the things that we\u2019re doing. Even more boldly, LaBerge claims that the Apple Vision Pro is \u201cgoing to change our entire production and post-production pipeline. It\u2019s going to change how we make content, how we operate our environments. It\u2019s a big deal.\u201d Time will tell whether Disney\u2019s foray into ar/vr/mr is successful or it flops like the company\u2019s now-shuttered metaverse division. And a lot of Disney\u2019s future in this space is actually out of the company\u2019s hands; rather it will be determined by Apple\u2019s ability to turn the Vision Pro from a piece of novelty tech into an affordable and functional mass-consumer product. Should that happen, there could be plenty of success stories, from Disney and others. Amid Amidi is Cartoon Brew's Publisher and Editor-at-large.
