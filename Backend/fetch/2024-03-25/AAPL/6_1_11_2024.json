Apple was briefly overtaken as the world\u2019s most valuable company by Microsoft in the early trading on Thursday, as the two battle for the number one market capitalization spot. As reported by Reuters, Microsoft overtook Apple early Thursday when its shares rose 1.5%, elevating its market cap up to $2.888 trillion. By contrast, Apple\u2019s shares fell 0.3%, bringing its market cap down to $2.887 trillion, \u201c the first time since 2021 that its valuation has fallen below that of Microsoft.\u201d Since then, Microsoft\u2019s shares have settled slightly and are now trading just 0.85% up at a market cap of $2.87 trillion. However, Apple\u2019s shares have fallen further down nearly 0.7%. As it stands, it\u2019s going to be very tight at the closing bell, with both companies in with a chance of taking the top spot by the end of Thursday. While it\u2019s possible Apple could retain the title today, the power shift seems inevitable at this point after a tough start to Apple\u2019s year and rising fortunes in Redmond. Apple\u2019s share price is down 1.27% year-to-date, off the back of a sharp tumble in December precipitated by a ban on the Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2. Currently suspended pending the legal case, it remains to be seen whether Apple will be able to circumvent the ban or come to any kind of legal settlement, but it was a big blow to finish out the year that spooked investors. By contrast, Microsoft\u2019s shares are up 16% in the past six months as the company continues its fervent investment in AI. Apple is expected to unveil its own forway into LLM and AI later this year but is definitely behind the curve compared to rivals. Apple has also seen its stock downgraded by several analysts. Barclays, Piper Sandlers, and now Redburn-Atlantic have all downgraded their rating of Apple\u2019s share price based on factors including limited growth for iPhone. Apple continues to struggle with iPhone sales in China and will be looking to several high-profile releases in 2024 to change its fortunes. That includes Apple Vision Pro, which will have limited appeal given its price tag, a new OLED iPad Pro, a new M3 MacBook Air, and of course the iPhone 16. iMore offers spot-on advice and guidance from our team of experts, with decades of Apple device experience to lean on.
