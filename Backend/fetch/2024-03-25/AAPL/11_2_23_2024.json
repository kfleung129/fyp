See how it could unleash 6,000% potential upside. Is the next stop $3 trillion for NVDA stock? Advertisement Source: FP Creative / Shutterstock.com There aren\u2019t any hotter stocks in the market right now than Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). Today, shares of NVDA stock hit another all-time high, with the company briefly surpassing $2 trillion in market capitalization in early morning trading. At the time of writing, NVDA stock has once again passed the $2 trillion mark and appears to be heading higher. For investors in this high-performance chip maker, this rally has truly been incredible. Some investors may indeed be keen on holding their position for an extended period. And such a view makes sense if one believes that the artificial intelligence (AI) growth drivers propelling Nvidia\u2019s recent earnings beat will remain strong for years. Even at this current market capitalization, NVDA stock trades at only 33 times forward earnings. This is largely a function of how profitable its core high-performance chip business is. But it also begs the question \u2014 if revenue and earnings growth continue to accelerate, could Nvidia actually be a bargain at this level? Let\u2019s dive into whether Nvidia could be poised for even higher highs moving forward. Currently, there are only four companies in the world trading at market capitalizations above $2 trillion. And with Saudi Aramco\u2019s valuation only slightly higher than Nvidia\u2019s, it\u2019s possible that Nvidia could be challenging Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) for the top spot around $3 trillion, if this momentum continues. Indeed, such a move toward $3 trillion would imply around 50% upside from current levels. And considering NVDA stock is already up more than 60% year to date, such a move wouldn\u2019t be out of the question. The company\u2019s forward multiple isn\u2019t stretched for a company growing at this brisk of a pace. In fact, there are a growing number of investors who now believe Nvidia is a relatively cheap hypergrowth name on a PEG (price-to-earnings-to-growth) basis. That thesis is valid and has been proven correct by Nvidia\u2019s recent earnings beats. However, the bar is now set extremely high for Nvidia. We\u2019ll have to see how many more quarters the company can pole-vault over expectations.
