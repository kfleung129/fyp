1,"Microsoft Tops Apple as Worlds Most Valuable Company","1/11/2024","https://www.pymnts.com/news/investment-tracker/2024/microsoft-tops-apple-as-worlds-most-valuable-company/","Microsoft’s AI investments have helped it surpass long-time rival Apple as the world’s most valuable company Shares in the software company climbed early Thursday (Jan 11) to bring its market value to $287 trillion ahead of that of Apple the Financial Times (FT) reported As the morning progressed the two companies jumped back and forth between the number one and two spots several times the report said Microsoft has benefitted from investor enthusiasm in the rise of generative artificial intelligence (AI) technology in the wake of the rising popularity of AI chatbot ChatGPT Microsoft is the largest backer of OpenAI the company behind ChatGPT The FT report argued that Apple — Microsoft’s rival since the rise of personal computers in the 1980s — has been largely left out of the AI craze (or taking a quieter approach as PYMNTS argued last summer) The company is also dealing with slowing iPhone sales — especially in China — leading its stock to be downgraded by analysts earlier this year Meanwhile PYMNTS on Thursday examined the potential of OpenAI’s new ChatGPT store’s potential as a monetization strategy The store which debuted Wednesday (Jan 10) offers a low-to-no-code platform for users to create customized AI-powered chatbots The company said in a blog post that its users have already built more than 3 million custom versions of ChatGPT A major element of the GPT store similar to Apple’s App Store is the “leaderboard” it will use to showcase the most popular and most-used GPTs “Already the AI developer is featuring GPTs that include personalized hiking trail recommendations from AllTrails the ability to surface results from 200 million academic papers via Consensus a way to design presentations and social posts from Canva and more” the report said As PYMNTS CEO Karen Webster has written for an app store to take off it needs the same thing Apple and Google needed with their app stores 16 years ago: a critical mass of developers and users “OpenAI claims to have a lot of both with 100 million weekly users after only its first year and hundreds (if not thousands) of developers using GPT and its derivatives to create new apps that would ultimately live in a GPT app store” PYMNTS wrote We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors"

7,"Unpacking Microsofts Speedy Upgrade to Windows 11","1/17/2024","https://www.microsoft.com/insidetrack/blog/unpacking-microsofts-speedy-upgrade-to-windows-11/","How Microsoft does IT Jan 17 2024 Inside Track staff [Editor’s note: This content was written to highlight a particular event or moment in time Although that moment has passed we’re republishing it here so you can see what our thinking and experience was like at the time] Like our customers we at Microsoft have a strong business need to address the new challenges created by remote and hybrid work The internal adoption of Windows 11 is helping our company meet those needs while enabling our employees to work smarter and more securely regardless of where they are Our priority in rolling out Windows 11 internally was to provide employees uninterrupted access to a safe and productive workspace while giving them a chance to try out the new operating system Introducing a new operating system especially across a distributed workforce naturally led to questions about device downtime and app compatibility However with established practices and evolved solutions in hand historical obstacles became just that—a thing of the past The rollout of Windows 11 at Microsoft was our most streamlined to date frictionlessly delivering employees the latest operating system in record time What made the deployment of Windows 11 a success? Over the past decade our Microsoft Digital Employee Experience team the organization that powers protects and transforms employee experiences has worked closely with teams such as the Windows product group to improve how it runs Microsoft’s updates upgrades and deployments Whereas significant time and resources were once dedicated to testing app compatibility building out multiple disk images and managing a complex delivery method processes and tools introduced during Windows 10 have streamlined upgrades and enabled the transformation to a frictionless experience Data from App Assure a Microsoft service available to all customers with eligible subscriptions shows the company had 997 percent compatibility for all apps in Windows 11—that eliminated the need for extensive testing It also meant that employees’ Windows 10 apps work seamlessly in Windows 11 Additionally Microsoft Endpoint Manager and Windows Update for Business eliminated the need for using more than one disk image and made it easier for employees to get Windows 11 Our Microsoft Digital Employee Experience team relied on the same familiar tools and process as a Windows 10 feature update to quickly deliver the upgrade to employees The upgrade was divided into three parts: Plan: Identify an execution and communication plan then develop a timeline Prepare: Establish reporting systems run tests ready employees and build backend services Deploy: Deploy Windows 11 to eligible devices We at Microsoft Digital Employee Experience have a successful history of deploying new services apps and operating systems to employees And it all starts at the same place—creating a disruption-free strategy that enables employees to embrace the latest technology as soon as possible without sacrificing productivity Before the deployment of Windows 11 could begin we had to take a careful inventory of all devices at Microsoft and determine which they should target Windows 11 has specific hardware requirements and a percentage of employees running ineligible devices meant that not every device would be upgraded Employees with these devices will upgrade to Windows 11 during their next device refresh To evaluate the device population we used Update Compliance and Microsoft Endpoint Manager’s Endpoint analytics feature This allowed our team to generate reports on devices that either met or failed to comply with minimum specifications For example certain devices especially older desktops lacked the Trusted Platform Module 20 (TPM) chipset requirements for security in Windows 11 In the end 190000 devices were deemed eligible based on hardware and role requirements Over the course of five weeks our Microsoft Digital Employee Experience team deployed Windows 11 to 99 percent of qualifying devices After evaluating the broad population of devices our team developed a plan for devices that would not receive a Windows 11 upgrade Since Windows 10 and Windows 11 can be seamlessly managed side-by-side within the same management system we only had to designate the number of devices that would not receive the upgrade Using Update Compliance to inform deployment policies we applied controls on ineligible devices automatically skipping them during deployment These measures made it easy to know why a device didn’t upgrade but also assured a disruption-free experience for both employees and those on our team responsible for managing the upgrade These controls also allowed the company to bypass deployment on any device that had been incorrectly targeted for an upgrade Ineligible devices Windows 10 and Windows 11 can be managed side-by-side and will be supported concurrently at Microsoft until all devices are upgraded or retired As devices are refreshed more and more of our employees will gain access to Windows 11 Devices that should not receive the upgrade Other devices like servers and test labs—where we validate new products on previous operating systems—were issued controls and excluded from receiving Windows 11 Once upgradeable devices were identified our team was able to create a clear timeline From this schedule our communications team developed an outreach plan support teams readied the helpdesk and the deployment team developed critical reporting mechanisms to track progress For the deployment itself our team used a ring-based approach to segment the deployment into several waves This allowed us to gradually release Windows 11 across the company reducing the risk of disruption Windows 11 has built-in support for rolling back to Windows 10 with a default window of 10 days after installation If needed our Microsoft Digital Employee Experience team could have revised this period via group policy or script using Microsoft Intune Post-upgrade there wasn’t much demand for a rollback but the strategic release cadence that the team used paired with the rollback capability gave our team an easy way to quickly revert devices that might require going back to Windows 10 for a business need Prior to starting the Windows 11 upgrade we asked employees to complete pre-work needed for a successful upgrade Because the upgrade was so smooth only light readiness communications were needed Instead we focused on ensuring that employees were aware and excited about the benefits of Windows 11 and that they were ready to share their feedback on what it was like to use it To maximize the impact of our communications our team readied content that was digestible for every employee regardless of role Employees needed clear and concise messaging that would resonate so that they could understand what Windows 11 would mean for them Our team in Microsoft Digital Employee Experience targeted a variety of established channels including Yammer FAQs on Microsoft SharePoint email Microsoft Teams Microsoft’s internal homepage and digital signage to promote Windows 11 To generate interest our materials focused on: An entire page on our company’s internal helpdesk site was dedicated to links related to the upgrade including Microsoft Docs where users could find a comprehensive library on new features Executive announcements from company leadership also conveyed the benefit of moving to Windows 11 and the ease with which it could be done Our team directed employees waiting to see if their device met Windows 11’s hardware requirements to the PC Health Check app At an enterprise level the team relied on Update Compliance to assess the device population We also used this opportunity to reinforce messaging to Windows 10 users—both operating systems would continue to operate side-by-side until all devices were refreshed This helped ease concerns for employees who had to wait for an upgrade Getting the deployment right wasn’t just about sending messages outward Our team needed to receive and respond to employee questions before during and after the Windows 11 rollout Our support teams were given an opportunity to delve into Windows 11 prior to the deployment which based on experiences with previous upgrades gave them time to categorize and group by severity any potential issues they might encounter This familiarity not only helped them give employees informed answers but also served as another feedback gathering mechanism We run Microsoft on Microsoft technology and we encourage our employees to join the Windows Insider Program where users are free to provide feedback directly to developers and product teams That’s why communications didn’t just focus on what was new with Windows 11 but on how feedback could be shared If an employee had comments they submitted them through a Feedback Hub where other employees could upvote tickets giving visibility to our engineers in Microsoft Digital Employee Experience and the Windows product group In addition to readying employees we had to make sure all the backend services were in place prior to the deployment This included building several processes setting up analytics and testing Evolving beyond previous upgrades the deployment of Windows 11 was the most data driven release we have ever done Looking closer at diagnostic data and creating better adoption reporting gave our team clear data to look at throughout the deployment Using Microsoft Power BI our team could share insights regarding the company’s environment This better prepared everyone on the team and allowed us to monitor progress during deployment Our team captured the following metrics: In addition to visibility into project status access to this data empowered our team to engage employees whose eligible devices did not receive the upgrade To accommodate users whose eligible devices might need to be excluded from the deployment our team created a robust workback plan that included a request and approval process a tracking system and a set timeline for how long devices would be excluded from the upgrade Our Microsoft Digital Employee Experience team released communications specifying the timeframe for employees to opt out including process steps Employees who needed to remove their devices from the upgrade submitted their alias machine name and reason for exclusion From there our team evaluated their requests Only users with a business reason were allowed to opt out For example Internet Explorer 11 requires Windows 10 so employees who need that browser for testing purposes were allowed to remove their devices from the deployment Once we had approved devices for exclusion a block was put in place to remove them from the deployment Data gathered during the opt-out process enabled us to follow up with these employees upgrading them to Windows 11 at a more appropriate time At Microsoft security is always top of mind for us A careful risk assessment including testing out a series of threat scenarios was performed before Windows 11 was deployed across the company Our Microsoft Digital Employee Experience team built several specific Windows 11 security policies in a test environment and benchmarked them against policies built for Windows 10 After testing the policies and scenarios to see if they would have any impact on employees we found that devices with Windows 11 would meet Microsoft’s rigorous security thresholds without creating any disruptions Just as importantly users would experience the same behaviors in Windows 11 as they might expect from Windows 10 A decade ago our efforts to deploy feature updates could be challenging as we needed to account for different builds languages policies and more This required careful management of distribution points and VPNs prior to beginning deployment efforts in earnest When Windows 10 was released in 2015 our team used two deployment strategies: one for on-premises managed devices and one for cloud managed devices Today the situation is much simpler Launched during the Windows 10 era Windows Update for Business established some of the trusted practices that make product releases and feature updates a great experience for us here at Microsoft Windows Update for Business deployment service introduces new efficiencies for our team consolidating two deployment strategies into one For the deployment of Windows 11 our team had an advantage—Windows Update for Business deployment service Windows Update for Business deployment service enabled our Microsoft Digital Employee Experience team to grab device IDs from across the environment and use them to automate the deployment Windows Update for Business deployment service handled all the backend processing and scheduling for us; all we needed to do was determine the start and end dates Our team easily managed exclusions and opt-outs with Windows Update for Business deployment service and when a device needed to be upgraded the service made it easier to remove and roll them back to Windows 10 Importantly Windows Update for Business deployment service provides a single deployment strategy for us moving forward Deployment has been simplified and the data loaded into Windows Update for Business deployment service for this upgrade will help speed up future releases We had to decide which policies they wanted to work with for the greatest outcome This included how many alerts an employee would receive before receiving an upgrade to Windows 11 Windows Update for Business deployment services reduced the long list of policies that our team needed to manage during deployment This accelerated deployment without compromising security By structuring the deployment timeline to hit a small group of employees before incrementally moving on to a larger population our Microsoft Digital Employee Experience team ensured Windows Update for Business deployment service ran as expected and that all required controls and permissions were set As our team used the Windows Update for Business deployment service to plot out upgrade waves Windows 11 downloaded in the background and employees received pop-up alerts when their device was ready The employee could restart at any time and would boot into Windows 11 after a few automated systems completed the installation Employees could also schedule Windows 11 to upgrade overnight or during the weekend Working closely with Microsoft Surface and other Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) partners the companies who supply Microsoft with new devices our team was able to ensure that our employees had Windows 11 pre-loaded onto their PCs This approach guaranteed that new devices complied with the hardware requirements of the new system A new device straight out of the box only needs to be powered on and connected to the internet before Windows Autopilot authenticates and configures everything for the user Once initial setup is complete Windows Autopilot ensures that new devices are equipped with Windows 11 and all the correct policies and settings For a transcript please view the video on YouTube:

team’s approach to product releases and upgrades With no measured uptick in support tickets the deployment of Windows 11 has been a frictionless experience for employees and the wide adoption of new features confirms the value of the effort The speed at which the team completed the deployment—190000 devices in five weeks—represents the fastest deployment of a new operating system in company history We credit the success of this deployment to good planning tools strong communication and the positive upgrade experience Windows 11 provides Windows Update for Business deployment service proved to be a big step in the evolution of how employees get the latest version of Windows The service’s ease of use meant the team had a higher degree of control flexibility and confidence The tighter hardware-to-software ecosystem that comes with Windows 11 means our employees and all users of the operating system benefit from richer experiences This along with integration to Microsoft

Microsoft data residency plans will see firm store all cloud customer data in the EU AWS already provides digital infrastructure solutions designed for generative AI applications for a number of large enterprise customers in the region including the Asahi Group Marubeni and Nomura In October 2023 the firms flagship generative AI service dubbed Amazon Bedrock was also made available in the Asia Pacific (Tokyo) AWS region Amazon Bedrock provides users with access to a variety of foundation models that customers can privately customize and fine-tune using their internal data in order to create bespoke AI tools tailored to their business needs Stay up to date with the latest news and analysis from the world of cloud computing with our twice-weekly newsletter Speaking to ITPro Gartner VP analyst Wataru Katsurashima said growing enterprise demand for data infrastructure will have made this investment a welcome announcement “AWS is the market leader in Japans IaaS market with a wide range of customers ranging from large enterprises to small and medium-sized enterprises This announcement of this major investment has been generally welcomed by various organizations in Japan” Katsurashima also noted the cloud giant’s strong relationship with domestic authorities “AWS has a very good relationship with the Japanese government and Mr Hirai who was the first digital minister of the Japanese government was present at AWS’s press conference” Katsurashima said “Mr Hirai gave a short presentation and said that Japans ruling Liberal Democratic Party welcomed this investment” AWS is not the only member of the big three western hyperscalers looking to capitalize on growing demand in Japan Microsoft and Google Cloud both fierce competitors in the global cloud computing space also appear to view the country as ripe with opportunities Google opened its first Japanese data center in 2023 with the Inzai data center beginning operations in March as part of a $730 million investment in infrastructure first announced in October 2022 Microsoft meanwhile has had the longest cloud infrastructure presence in the country with its first two data centers hosting Windows Azure cloud services coming online in February 2014 Microsoft also recently signed its first power purchase agreement (PPA) with Shizen Energy to provide renewable energy for its data centers in October 2023 The virtual PPA will see Microsoft procure renewable energy from a 25 MW capacity solar farm in Inuyama CIty Aichi Prefecture Become more knowledgeable about AI DOWNLOAD NOW The Asian market appears to be an enticing one for cloud infrastructure vendors with elevated AI adoption rates compared to other global regions Furthermore Katsurashima said to the cloud market growth rate in the Asia Pacific and Japan (APJ) region is higher (243%) than in the Americas (179%) and EMEA (203%) making APJ a “key region for continued growth for hyperscale cloud provider” Japan in particular is one of the fastest growing countries in the APJ region he added “The cloud market growth rate in Japan is the 2nd largest in APJ (after China) making Japan an important country for hyperscale cloud providers Japans total cloud market is expected to reach more than $37 billion in 2027” Mark Kidd executive vice president and general manager of data center management company Iron Mountain told ITPro more investment should be expected as the hyperscalers try to drastically expand their capacity to capture the soaring demand for AI solutions “We know that the boom in Generative AI will require large quantities of data center capacity This could mean that by 2030 the world will require 500-1000% more capacity than we currently have Kidd noted the attention these firms are paying to sustainability concerns as users continue to demand increased capacity and compute speeds “However with the ceaseless human demand for better faster digitalisation and data volumes expected to grow exponentially year on year for the foreseeable future data center operators and its customers have an opportunity and responsibility to ensure that more data doesnt mean more emissions” Solomon Klappholz is a Staff Writer at ITPro He has experience writing about the technologies that facilitate industrial manufacturing which led to him developing a particular interest in IT regulation industrial infrastructure applications and machine learning This next-generation data center project is turning waste heat into algae-based biofuel — could this be the future of green data storage?

access to our top analyst recommendations in-depth research investing resources and more Learn More Interest in artificial intelligence (AI) skyrocketed after the launch of OpenAIs ChatGPT in November 2022 The chatbot highlighted how far AI has come with the potential to advance countless industries including cloud computing e-commerce consumer products healthcare education autonomous driving and more In fact according to data from Grand View Research the AI market is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 37% until at least 2030 The markets trajectory would see it exceed a value of $1 trillion before the decades end As a result its not surprising that numerous AI stocks have soared over the last year For instance Microsoft (MSFT -015%) shares have climbed 69% since last January rallying Wall Street with its 49% stake in OpenAI The partnership has granted Microsoft access to some of the industrys most advanced AI models suggesting the Windows company has significant potential in the sector However AI is expanding quickly presenting dozens of other attractive ways to invest in the industry Some of these options could have more growth potential than Microsoft or offer more value So forget Microsoft in 2024 Here are two AI stocks to buy instead Whether youre a casual investor or trade professionally youre probably aware of Nvidias (NVDA 312%) meteoric rise last year Its stock soared 239% in 2023 as the companys graphics processing units (GPUs) became the gold standard for AI developers worldwide As interest in AI soared so did demand for GPUs and Nvidia was perfectly positioned to supply its hardware to the entire market The company achieved an estimated 90% market share in AI chips alongside soaring earnings In the third quarter of fiscal 2024 (which ended October 2023) Nvidias revenue rose 206% year over year as operating income increased 1600% The company profited from a spike in AI GPU sales represented by a 279% rise in data center revenue Nvidia has a powerful position in AI Competition in the software side of the industry is heating up with companies like Microsoft and Amazon facing off over leadership in AI cloud services However increased competition only means more chip customers for Nvidia with the company likely to flourish for years Data by YCharts This chart shows that over the next two fiscal years Nvidias earnings could hit $24 per share while Microsofts may achieve about $15 per share Multiplying these figures by each companys forward price-to-earnings ratio (Nvidias 48 and Microsofts 35) yields stock prices of $1152 for Nvidia and $525 for Microsoft Considering their current positions these projections would see Nvidias stock rise 96% and Microsofts 33% over the next two fiscal years While both figures are impressive Nvidias higher percentage and prominent role in AI make it a more attractive investment this year As the home of potent brands like Google Android and YouTube Alphabet (GOOGL 215%) (GOOG 204%) has massive potential in AI The company has grown into a tech behemoth hosting nine products with more than 1 billion users Its top performers are Google Search Android and Chrome While these services enabled Alphabet to build a lucrative digital advertising business they could also prove to be assets in its AI expansion Last December Alphabet unveiled Gemini a highly anticipated AI model that is expected to be competitive with OpenAIs GPT-4 The popularity of Alphabets various services and Gemini could prove to be a powerful combination With the new model Alphabet could create a Search experience closer to ChatGPT offer more effective advertising introduce new AI tools on Google Cloud and better track viewing trends on YouTube Alphabet surpassed $77 billion in free cash flow last year significantly more than rivals Microsoft or Amazon The companys considerable cash reserves strengthen its outlook in AI as it has the funds to invest heavily in its research and development and overcome potential hurdles Data by YCharts These charts show Alphabets stock is also far cheaper than Microsofts The company has lower figures in two key valuation metrics: forward price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-sales (P/S) ratios Forward P/E is calculated by dividing a companys current share price by its estimated future earnings per share Meanwhile forward P/S divides its market cap by estimated revenue For both metrics the lower the figure the better the value Forward P/E and P/S are great ways to determine the value of a companys shares as they take into account its financial health against its stock price In this case Alphabet is a far bigger bargain than Microsoft on both fronts Alongside considerable potential in AI Alphabet is a no-brainer buy in 2024

Either way “a portion” of Microsoft Teams went down Friday for over eight hours — with outages in North America South America Europe the Middle East and Africa according to status updates from Microsoft’s official account At 8:17PM ET Friday Microsoft tweeted that the worst is over but that the company was still mopping up with a handful of issues still ongoing Shortly after midnight Saturday the company called the all-clear: “we’ve confirmed that our Microsoft Teams service and features have been restored or have returned to optimal health” it writes So yeah if you couldn’t communicate with your colleagues via Microsoft’s biz comm platform that’s probably why We’d seen reports of users not being able to log into Teams at all while others saw missing messages missing attachments delays and more As of late Friday Microsoft had already gotten to the point where you should’ve be able to log in load messages view media and access call recordings — but that anonymous users might still have been unable to join meetings seen delays had trouble rejoining meetings or loading Copilot history and that you probably shouldn’t reboot your computer if you need to log into Teams since that was an issue too The spike in problem reports at DownDetector suggested this outage had been going on for at least three hours at the time we originally published our story and Microsoft officially recognized the issue at around 11:45AM ET The company said it identified “a networking issue impacting a portion of the Teams service” and began failovers to resolve the problem Four hours later though Microsoft reported that “Our failover operation did not provide immediate relief to all end users in North and South America regions” While the DownDetector spike has subsided it’s not clear whether that’s because services are substantially restored or because there’s no point complaining anymore Here’s how far Microsoft got by the eight-hour mark: We’re continuing to apply mitigations across the affected infrastructure and our telemetry is showing additional improvement in the user experience though many customers are still affected by this issue We’re also working to apply fixes to address individual affected Teams features in parallel while our broader remediation strategy is ongoing We’re evaluating any and all additional workstreams that will allow us to reduce the impact to those customers that are still affected It took roughly 13 hours for Microsoft to completely address the issue If you had access to a Microsoft Teams admin console you were able to check the status at TM710344 For hours after the outage began Microsoft’s status page was all green suggesting Microsoft Teams was fine but it updated with a lengthy description shortly before 2PM ET including that “We’ve completed a failover in the Europe Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region and telemetry is showing improvement” and that it planned to take similar steps in other regions IT admins saw a similar message in their dashboards around 1PM ET according to an r/sysadmin user: Here’s Microsoft’s final update on the outage: Title: Some users may experience multiple issues with their Microsoft Teams User impact: Users may have experienced multiple issues with their Microsoft Teams More info: Affected scenarios included but weren’t limited to the following: -

GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with MSFT As of 2024-02-12 Microsoft Corps intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $29258 Its currently trading at a price of $42059 Therefore the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -4375% The company is modestly overvalued The GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage In the growth stage the company is experiencing faster growth while in the terminal stage a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run Microsoft Corps intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps Term Value Explanation EPS without NRI $1107 GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow Discount Rate 11% An appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 417% rounded up to the nearest whole number which is 5% A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate Growth Stage Growth rate (g1) = 1750% Years of Growth Stage = 10 We choose the growth rate based on the availability prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10 5 or 3 years in that order and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate The default growth period is set to 10 years Terminal Stage Growth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10 For the terminal stage the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation Growth Stage = EPS without NRI * [ (1 + g1) / (1 + d) * (1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2 + + (1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ] = 15346 Terminal Stage = EPS without NRI * (1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 * [ (1 + g2) / (1 + d) + (1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2 + + (1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ] = 13912 Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based) = Growth Stage + Terminal Stage = 29258 GuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $17545 This valuation indicates that the Microsoft Corp is significantly overvalued accompanied by a margin of safety of -13972% You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page Please note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model: Future Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings Embracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role All else being equal a company with rapid growth will have a higher value Predictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance For companies with unpredictable performance such as cyclical companies the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized Discount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate Using the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based) To identify undervalued predictable companies focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based) This article generated by GuruFocus is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice Our commentary is rooted in historical data and analyst projections utilizing an impartial methodology and is not intended to serve as specific investment guidance It does not formulate a recommendation to purchase or divest any stock and does not consider individual investment objectives or financial circumstances Our objective is to deliver long-term fundamental data-driven analysis Be aware that our analysis might not incorporate the most recent price-sensitive company announcements or qualitative information GuruFocus holds no position in the stocks mentioned herein This article first appeared on GuruFocus Related Quotes"

sell its Bing search engine to Apple in 2018 Google said in a court filing earlier this month The document from Googles antitrust case against the US Justice Department was unsealed on Friday The legal battle over whether Alphabet has a monopoly in web search advertising touches on key agreements Google has in place with Apple and Android phone makers to ensure exclusivity of its search engine In 2021 Google spent more than $26 billion to keep its search engine the default according to a slide shown during the trial in October Google has been trying to prove in the case that it competes fairly In the filing earlier this month Google argued that Microsoft pitched Apple in 2009 2013 2015 2016 2018 and 2020 about making Bing the default in Apples Safari web browser but each time Apple said no citing quality issues with Bing In each instance Apple took a hard look at the relative quality of Bing versus Google and concluded that Google was the superior default choice for its Safari users That is competition Google wrote in the filing The Justice Department said in its own newly unsealed filing that Microsoft has spent almost $100 billion on Bing over 20 years The Windows and Office software maker launched Bing in 2009 following search efforts under the MSN and Windows Live brands Today Bing has 3% global market share according to StatCounter In the fourth quarter Microsoft generated $32 billion from search and news advertising while Google search and other revenue totaled $48 billion Google said in its filing that when Microsoft reached out to Apple in 2018 emphasizing gains in Bings quality Microsoft offered to either sell Bing to Apple or establish a Bing-related joint venture with the company Microsoft search quality their investment in search everything was not significant at all said Eddy Cue Apples senior vice president of services according to the filing And so everything was lower So the search quality itself wasnt as good They werent investing at any level comparable to Google or to what Microsoft could invest in And their advertising organization and how they monetize was not very good either Google said Apple CEO Tim Cook sent an email to Apple executives about the assessment of Bing but his remarks are redacted in the filing Representatives for Google and Microsoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment In October Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella testified in the trial that he has focused every year of my tenure as CEO to see if Apple would be open to a default arrangement for Bing Cue testified that if Apple did not receive the massive payments it sought from Google Apple would have developed its own search engine the Justice Department asserted in its filing Bloomberg reported in September citing unnamed individuals that in around 2020 Microsoft executives held exploratory talks with Eddy Cue Apples senior vice president of services about selling Bing to Apple WATCH: Its unclear if Google can

Microsofts investment and partnership with French Large Language Model startup Mistral AI the company continues to work hard to try to dispel the image that its blocking competition through its deep partnership (and financial stake) in OpenAI On Monday at Mobile World Congress the company launched a new framework its calling AI Access Principles -- an eleven-point plan that Microsoft said will govern how we will operate our AI datacenter infrastructure and other important AI assets around the world The points cover areas such as the building and operation of an app store to allow businesses to pick and choose different LLMs and other AI products and a commitment to keeping companys proprietary data out of its training models It also includes a commitment to let customers change cloud providers or services within the cloud if they choose to It also details a focus on building cybersecurity around AI services; attention to building data centers and other infrastructure in an environmentally-sound way; and education investments Brad Smith the president and vice chair of Microsoft announced the framework today at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona Although the implication here is that Microsoft is open to dialogue and conversation with stakeholders ironically Smith delivered the news in a keynote speech with no scope for follow-up questions (Read a roundup of day one hardware coverage from MWC here) The announcement comes at the same time that Microsoft is coming under increasing regulatory scrutiny for its $13 billion investment in OpenAI which currently gives it a 49% stake in the startup that is leading the charge for generative AI services globally In January the European competition watchdog said that it was assessing whether the investment falls under antitrust rules The take specific aim at how third parties might use Microsofts platforms and services to develop AI products a critical business area and enterprise service that the company hopes to develop in coming years not just with the carriers who attend MWC but businesses and organizations from a much wider array of industries If they are training a model on our infrastructure if they are deploying it on our infrastructure we recognise that their data is their data we will not access it and use it to compete with the companies that are relying on our infrastructure Smith said These AI Access Principles to be clear are not binding rules for Microsoft -- nor is there any kind of detail laid out around how any of the commitments might be verified or tracked -- but they serve a purpose in anticipation of that In the event of any formal regulatory investigations they will likely be used by the company to argue that it is taking proactive efforts to ensure competition in the market In fact as of today we have almost 1600 models running in our data centres 1500 of which are open source models said Smith on stage today showing how we as a company focus on proprietary and open source models companies large and small On the other hand by laying them out publicly like this the principles become a public pronouncement that the public Microsofts competitors and pointedly regulators could use as a reference point if they believe Microsoft has failed to measure up A group of Chinese researchers from Nanjing University School of Aeronautics

Check if analysts think Microsoft will grow revenue in the future When looking at investment returns it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings along with any dividends based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested So for companies that pay a generous dividend the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return In the case of Microsoft it has a TSR of 310% for the last 5 years That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned This is largely a result of its dividend payments! Its nice to see that Microsoft shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 61% over the last year Thats including the dividend That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years which is 33% Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance But to truly gain insight we need to consider other information too Consider risks for instance Every company has them and weve spotted 1 warning sign for Microsoft you should know about Of course Microsoft may not be the best stock to buy So you may wish to see this free collection of growth stocks Please note the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges Have feedback on this article?

pales in comparison to the artificial intelligence (AI) markets CAGR of 37% for the rest of the decade and its value of $137 billion Data by YCharts Excitement over cryptocurrency faltered in recent years as volatility has caused pullback from investors The chart above compares the three-year growth between the most prominent cryptocurrency and three companies active in AI Each tech company has performed significantly better than Bitcoin and potentially has more room to run in the coming years thanks to AI Cryptocurrencies developed a reputation for inconsistency However its just the opposite with tech stocks The tech market is known for rewarding innovative companies with consistent gains over the long term with that unlikely to change alongside a recent boom in AI So here are three AI stocks with more potential than any cryptocurrency All eyes have been on Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) this year because its chips have become the go-to for developers across the AI market The companys dominance in graphics processing units (GPUs) gave it a leg up on its competitors allowing it to secure an estimated 80% to 95% market share in AI chips Soaring demand for AI GPUs caused Nvidias revenue to skyrocket In the fourth quarter of 2024 (ended in January) the companys revenue increased by 265% year over year to $22 billion Meanwhile operating income jumped 983% to nearly $14 billion The monster growth was primarily owed to a 409% increase in data center revenue reflecting increased chip sales Data by YCharts Nvidias earnings could hit $34 per share over the next two fiscal years Multiplying that figure by the companys forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 32 projects a stock price of $1094 Considering its current position these projections would mean Nvidias stock rising 39% by fiscal 2027 In addition to a dominating position in a high-growth market like AI Nvidia is a screaming buy this month with more potential than any cryptocurrency As the home of potent brands like Windows Office Xbox and LinkedIn Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is a tech behemoth and one of the biggest threats in the industry The companys shares are up 65% in the last 12 months and it recently surpassed Apple as the worlds most valuable company with its market cap currently at just over $3 trillion Additionally Microsoft won over investors with an expanding role in AI Heavy investment in ChatGPT developer OpenAI has led to a lucrative partnership and access to some of the most advanced AI models in the industry The Windows company used OpenAIs technology to introduce AI features across its product lineup In 2023 Microsoft added new AI tools to its Azure cloud platform integrated aspects of ChatGPT into its Bing search engine and boosted productivity in its Office software suite by adding AI features Microsoft achieved more than $67 billion in free cash flow last year highlighting the businesss reliability and value as a long-term investment Data by YCharts Microsofts earnings could reach nearly $16 per share over the next two fiscal years In a similar calculation to Nvidia multiplying that figure by Microsofts forward P/E of 35 yields a stock price of $550 projecting stock growth of 35% by fiscal 2026 With its lucrative OpenAI partnership Microsoft is a far better investment than any cryptocurrency Like Nvidia Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD) has massive potential in the hardware side of AI The company got a late start in the industry outrun by Nvidia last year However AMD is moving to challenge Nvidias dominance soon and take its slice of the lucrative sector Last December the tech giant unveiled its MI300X AI GPU designed to provide an alternative to Nvidias products The new chip already caught the attention of some of techs most prominent players signing on Microsoft and Meta Platforms as clients Moreover AMD isnt banking solely on stealing market share from Nvidia in GPUs AMD seeks to lead its own space within AI by doubling down on AI-powered PCs According to research firm IDC PC shipments are projected to receive a major boost this year with AI integration serving as a key catalyst And a Canalys report predicts that 60% of all PCs shipped in 2027 will be AI-enabled AMD has a solid outlook over the long term and earnings-per-share estimates reflect this Data by YCharts AMDs earnings could hit just above $7 per share over the next two fiscal years Multiplying this figure by the companys forward P/E of 49 yields a stock price of $352 If projections are correct AMDs stock price could double by fiscal 2026 And with that AMD has significantly more potential than the crypto market Should you invest $1000 in Nvidia right now?

Heres a closer look Microsoft stock has been on a roll standing out even amid a strong showing for the broader market over the past year MSFT is up 607% in the last 52 weeks compared to a return of 327% for the Nasdaq Composite ($NASX) Like most AI-related tech stocks MSFT isnt particularly cheap at current levels That said while Microsofts valuation ratios are elevated theyre down from historical peaks The stock currently trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 349x and a price-to-sales ratio of 119x By comparison the stock traded north of 40x forward earnings in September 2020 Its also worth noting the companys consistent dividend growth Microsoft is on pace to achieve Dividend Aristocrat status in this decade as the tech titan has consistently boosted shareholder payouts each year since 2003 MSFT pays $075 per share each quarter for a forward yield of 077% providing investors with an appealing combination of income and growth Plus with ample free cash flow and a low payout ratio theres plenty of room for more dividend hikes down the road In its fiscal Q1 earnings report Microsoft raked in earnings per share (EPS) of $299 which exceeded analysts expectations of $265 Revenue of $5652 billion also beat Wall Streets forecast For MSFTs next quarterly release due out on Jan 23 the company is expected to report earnings of $275 per share reflecting a year-over-year increase of 1853% Microsoft has reported significant growth in its AI and Azure segments which has been a key driver of its overall performance In the recent quarter Azure and cloud services revenue rose by a stronger-than-anticipated 29% and CFO Amy Hood revealed that 3 points of Azures growth came from AI surpassing the companys own expectations Asked about Microsofts ability to maintain the pace of growth going forward CEO Satya Nadella explained on the conference call Given our leadership position we are seeing complete new project starts which are AI projects And as you know AI projects are not just about AI meters They have lots of other cloud meters as well In other words the companys AI services are not only driving growth in Azure - theyre stimulating sales across the board In particular Microsofts AI-infused programming assistant Copilot is driving adoption of Azure as it requires the cloud platform to run Copilot is already being used by 40% of the Fortune 100 companies in preview Microsoft has an advantage over cloud competitors like Amazon and Google when it comes to AI adoption partially due to strong integration between its productivity suites and Azure services In fact MSFT reported stronger cloud growth than both of its FAANG rivals in the most recent quarter which analysts at Bernstein took as an indication that Microsoft “has taken the AI mantel from Google and that Azure could become a bigger and more important hyperscale provider than AWS” Other analysts appear equally optimistic about Microsofts future prospects - but perhaps none more so than Truist Securities analyst Joel Fishbein who initiated coverage of Microsoft stock with a “buy” rating and a three-year price target of $600 That represents expected upside of about 55% from current levels or a compound annual growth rate of roughly 157% - which is not a stretch considering Microsofts past performance Elsewhere Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives just raised his target price on the stock to $450 from $425 expressing confidence that AI-powered growth will sustain its run He projects Azure alone will be a $1 trillion market in the next decade with Microsoft gaining share Another bullish analyst Frederick Havemeyer at Macquarie sees upside for Microsoft from increased enterprise spending on digital transformation and cloud migration On average analysts expect Microsoft to deliver earnings per share of $1114 in fiscal year 2024 reflecting growth of 1356% from the prior year Revenue for fiscal 2024 is forecast to rise 147% to $24306 billion Wall Street is overwhelmingly bullish on Microsoft stock with a “strong buy” consensus based on 37 analysts recommendations The mean price target for Microsoft is $40889 representing a potential upside of 56% from current levels In conclusion Microsoft stock could plausibly surge to $600 per share driven by AI growth Given its market-leading position robust AI results so far and upbeat projections for continued growth the stock still looks appealing despite its relatively stretched valuations As Microsoft continues to lead in AI and cloud the stock remains a top pick for growth - and the dividend is a nice bonus too All market data (will open in new tab) is provided by Barchart Solutions Copyright © 2024 Futures and Forex: at least 10 minutes delayed Information is provided as is and solely for informational purposes not for trading purposes or advice For exchange delays and terms of use please read disclaimer (will open in new tab) © Copyright 2024 The Globe and Mail Inc All rights reserved Andrew Saunders President and CEO"

67,"Microsoft overtakes Apple as the world’s most valuable company","1/22/2024","https://theboar.org/2024/01/micapple/","Microsoft (MSFT) has surpassed Apple (AAPL) to claim the title of the world’s most valuable company in market capitalisation The Redmond Washington-based software giant saw a 1% increase to $38847 on Friday concluding with a market valuation of $289 trillion In comparison Apple experienced a 02% increase and concluded with a market capitalisation of $287 trillion This marks the first instance since November 2021 that Microsoft has closed with a higher value than Apple This achievement is attributed to Microsoft’s intensified focus on generative artificial intelligence (AI) a sector gaining growing favour among investors This marks the first instance since November 2021 that Microsoft has closed with a higher value than Apple In early 2023 Microsoft made a significant move by unveiling a multiyear investment of $10 billion in Sam Altman’s OpenAI the groundbreaking startup responsible for ChatGPT Integrating OpenAI’s technology into its suite of productivity software Microsoft successfully catalysed a resurgence in its cloud-computing business during the July-September quarter Unlike Microsoft which along with Nvidia and Amazon saw a substantial market surge in AI Apple has notably lagged behind in this regard This decline is particularly evident in China a key market where slow economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic is contributing to reduced demand for iPhones Additionally heightened competition from a resurgent Huawei is substantially impacting Apple’s market share DA Davidson Analyst Gil Luria told Reuters “It was inevitable that Microsoft would overtake Apple since Microsoft is growing faster and has more to benefit from the generative AI revolution” Looking at recent developments at least 3 out of 41 analysts covering Apple have lowered their ratings since the beginning of 2024 In contrast Microsoft enjoys a favourable outlook on Wall Street with no “sell” ratings and almost 90% of brokerages recommending buying the stock Apple on the other hand has two “sell” ratings with only two-thirds of analysts rating it as a “buy” “China could be a drag on performance over the coming years” brokerage Redburn Atlantic said in a client note on Wednesday downgrading Apple’s shares to “neutral” Looking at recent developments at least 3 out of 41 analysts covering Apple have lowered their ratings since the beginning of 2024 This ongoing competition between Microsoft and Apple for the title of the most valuable public company has been a persistent narrative with positions frequently swapping in recent years The rivalry between these tech giants can be traced back to the 1980s when Apple co-founded by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak accused Bill Gates’ Windows maker of appropriating the “Look and feel” of its Macintosh computer software In the early 1990s Apple faced a setback in a high-profile copyright lawsuit against Windows paving the way for Microsoft to dominate the PC market for decades However fueled by the success of the iPhone Apple’s market value surpassed Microsoft’s in 2010 – a position it has maintained for several years as Windows grappled with the transition to mobile computing However Microsoft briefly surged ahead of Apple during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021 leveraging its strength in cloud computing amid the remote working boom but Apple swiftly reclaimed the top spot on both occasions Microsoft’s ascension to the top spot highlights that Apple has ground to cover While OpenAI’s ChatGPT soared to prominence last year Apple remained relatively inactive Both Google and Microsoft Corp introduced generative AI iterations of their search engines producing responses with striking human-like qualities In addition Microsoft further enhanced its Windows applications with intelligent assistants and Amazoncom Inc revealed an AI-infused revamp of Alexa Meanwhile the most noteworthy AI release from Apple was an enhanced auto-correct system in iOS 17 Despite indications that Apple is working on an in-house large language model the company is faced with the task of catching up in the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence Your email address will not be published Required fields are marked * Comment * Name * Email * Website Δ This site uses Akismet to reduce spam Learn how your comment data is processed © 2024 Copyright The Boar Powered by Tom Hamish & Aaron"
68,"AAPL AMZN MSFT: How to Play the Tech Giants Ahead of Earnings","1/23/2024","https://investorplace.com/2024/01/aapl-amzn-msft-how-to-play-the-tech-giants-ahead-of-earnings/","Countdown to Luke Lango’s “2nd Trillion-Dollar AI Trade” The US govt just unlocked an $8 trillion market to move in a new direction See how it could unleash 6000% potential upside These tech stocks are running into quarterly earnings over the coming weeks Advertisement Source: whiteMocca / Shutterstock It’s that time of year again: big-tech earnings season With a fairly robust start to 2024 the tech behemoths may need to pull a surprising earnings beat out of a hat to get Mr Market to nudge their share prices higher from current levels Indeed many analysts have mixed feelings about the three Magnificent Seven tech titans going into earnings Sure valuations seem a tad too extended as we enter earnings season But if there are firms that can pole-vault past estimates and deliver positive surprises it has to be members of the Magnificent Seven cohort With earnings on tap for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) over the coming weeks investors may be wondering which if any is worth pursuing ahead of their respective quarterly reveals On the other hand is it a better idea to wait until after the tech stocks share their earnings given the stakes are higher after the market’s recent gains? Let’s find out Apple started the year with a handful of analyst downgrades that weighed down its share price after a turbulent finish to 2023 Many unenthused analysts don’t expect much from the firm this year as iPhone sales continue to be underwhelming Indeed Apple remains a Magnificent Seven firm that’s continued to put up the returns with more than 40% in gains over the past year That said it’s been outshined by many of its Magnificent Seven peers on the front of recent returns And questions linger as to what could help iPhone 15 (and its coming iPhone 16) sales kick up a notch Perhaps recent discounts in China could help boost iPhone 15 demand in an ultra-competitive market (Huawei is the force over in China) that’s faced more than its fair share of economic headwinds In any case don’t count on such efforts to impact the quarterly numbers due to be released in just over a week With earnings ahead I wouldn’t chase AAPL stock after its latest jump back to $193 and change Though expectations are now relatively modest I think it will take more than just better-than-expected numbers to move the needle higher Perhaps some AI commentary could do the job? In recent sessions Apple stock seems to be ascending again over hopes for some artificial intelligence (AI) announcement Amazon’s momentum could continue through the year as it continues trimming its workforce in a bid to shore up financial firepower while also investing heavily in its generative AI projects Over the past 12 months shares of AMZN are up around 58% a solid gain even for a Magnificent Seven member Though shares are still off nearly 16% from their all-time highs I think it’s just a matter of time before new heights are reached as Amazon looks to gain the cloud with a bit of help from new AI tech Additionally hopes for a healthier consumer could help jolt the e-commerce business which has taken a backseat to Amazon’s other initiatives of late With layoffs sweeping through various Amazon subsidiaries (Twitch recently shed 35% of its staff) it certainly seems like the company is pushing to bolster profitability in this higher-rate environment Even as rates come down again I’d look for Amazon to be more deliberate in how it spends money on growth projects moving forward Perhaps AI could receive more love than Amazon subsidiaries like Twitch that aren’t really helping Amazon pay the bills All considered I think Amazon has what it takes to impress for its coming quarter However I’d prefer waiting for a pullback which may just happen post-earnings I’m sure dip-buyers will be ready to pounce quickly Microsoft stock is close to fresh new all-time highs with shares just a few bucks below the $400 per-share mark Going into earnings expectations are going to be quite high That’s to be expected for a firm that’s up more than 64% over the past year With shares trading at 384 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) you’re going to be paying a hefty historical premium to play the tech titan ahead of earnings Though Microsoft’s AI will pay more of the firm’s bills over time I’m not so sure this past quarter is the one that will have AI written all over it Microsoft Copilot still has a long way to go as it works its way into our favorite Microsoft software In any case the expensive AI gem could easily stand to become even more expensive after earnings If you’re worried about MSFT stock getting away from you after posting its numbers perhaps it makes sense to buy half a stake before and the other half after earnings With the recent launch of the popular Xbox Game Pass title Palworld and the Activision Blizzard integration in full swing it will be interesting to see what the firm has to say about its gaming ambitions during its conference call On the date of publication Joey Frenette held shares of Apple Amazon and Microsoft The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer subject to the InvestorPlacecom Publishing Guidelines Joey Frenette is a seasoned investment writer specializing in technology and consumer stocks Contributing to the Motley Fool Canada TipRanks and Barchart Joey excels in spotting mispriced stocks with long-term growth potential in a fast-paced market Article printed from InvestorPlace Media https://investorplacecom/2024/01/aapl-amzn-msft-how-to-play-the-tech-giants-ahead-of-earnings/ ©2024 InvestorPlace Media LLC Market Analysis Stocks to Buy Crypto & Blockchain Market Analysis Stocks to Sell Stocks to Buy Stocks to Buy Stocks to Buy Financial Market Data powered by FinancialContent Services Inc All rights reserved Nasdaq quotes delayed at least 15 minutes all others at least 20 minutes Copyright © 2024 InvestorPlace Media LLC All rights reserved 1125 N Charles St Baltimore MD 21201 Not Yet a Premium Subscriber?

around 56% YTD The company was already rather pricey before this bull run if we take a look at the companys PE Ratio over the last few years Their 5y average hovers right around 31 Data by YChartsData by YCharts I think we can all agree that a company like Microsoft with this high quality deserves some kind of premium compared to peers or the overall market Especially when considering the different business ventures of Microsoft and the growth prospects of these segments which additionally produced very constant and reliable growth over the last years: Revenue of Microsoft broken down by segment 2012-2023 (statistacom) Revenue of Microsoft broken down by segment 2012-2023 (statistacom) Traditional valuation methods like PE Ratios tend to under-appreciate high quality companies with solid growth prospects just like Microsoft To valuate the company independently well now take a look at the different business segments of Microsoft as well as the different products the company is offering within these segments to get an in-depth understanding of future revenues and margins We then take these metrics and evaluate the company using a Bear and Bull Case Discounted Cash Flow Analysis Part of this segment are the well know Microsoft Office Apps which include for example Word Excel PowerPoint and Project Here Microsoft and Google (GOOG GOOGL) are the clear market leaders with both of them owning around 50% of the global market share Office productivity software market share worldwide 2022 (statistacom) Office productivity software market share worldwide 2022 (statistacom) Another aspect of this segment is Microsoft Dynamics which is a set of business tools designed to assist companies in managing and streamlining several areas of their operations It offers a selection of enterprise resource planning (ERP) and customer relationship management (CRM) systems that let companies automate financial customer service sales and other crucial operations Microsoft Dynamics is intended to improve an organizations productivity teamwork and data-driven decision-making The whole business productivity software market which in my opinion includes Dynamics and Office is expected to grow at 153% pa in the next few years In the Bull Case we assume that MSFT manages to hold its high market share in this segment and therefore achieves a revenue growth rate with this business venture of 15% pa For the Bear-Case we assume that the consumers increasingly use the free variants of the main competitor Google which in turn leads to a growth rate below the market Another important product in this segment is the social media platform LinkedIn LinkedIn is a professional social networking site where users may make connections with businesses professionals and coworkers Users construct digital resumes called profiles that highlight their education experience and skills in the workplace LinkedIn can be used for business development networking and job finding Users can join professional organizations network with individuals in their sector and exchange industry-related content on this platform The platform has seen some solid growth over the last few years and has currently around 700 million users Number of LinkedIn Users (statistacom) Number of LinkedIn Users (statistacom) While the user growth of LinkedIn is already pretty impressive the growth of generated revenue of the platform is even better They achieved a revenue growth rate of 40% over the last 12 years and 25% over the last five years The Social Networking market is expected to grow at an annual growth rate of ~7% in the following years I however believe that LinkedIn can exceed these assumptions as most of the potential users dont have an account on LinkedIn yet Social network usage by brand in the US (statistacom) Social network usage by brand in the US (statistacom) I also think that the uniqueness of the platform as a career platform and tool heavily benefits the future growth projections of LinkedIn The revenue distribution in this segment was like the following We will now use the percentage of the fiscal years 2023 of the revenue as a weighting to calculate the anticipated revenue growth rate for the whole Productivity and Business Processes segment The margins of this business were in the range of 45% to 49% with a clear and constant increase over the last few years To adjust for the Bear and Bull Case I anticipated the following margin development: Microsofts Intelligent Cloud division offers a range of cloud-based services and solutions such as server products cloud services and Azure cloud services for networking computation and storage This market niche specializes on providing corporate services AI analytics and hybrid solutions that let companies take use of scalable and adaptable cloud infrastructure to boost productivity creativity and agility The company is currently holding around 22% of market share in this segment according to statista If we however factor in the market share development over the last few years it becomes very clear that Microsoft is constantly expanding its market share in this rapid growing segment Worldwide Market Share of Leading Cloud Infrastructure Provider (statistacom) Worldwide Market Share of Leading Cloud Infrastructure Provider (statistacom) Cloud Infrastructure Services Vendor Market Share Worldwide (statistacom) Cloud Infrastructure Services Vendor Market Share Worldwide (statistacom) The global market for cloud computing is anticipated to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 20% between 2023 and 2030 This seems very well achievable for Microsoft if we take a look at the historical growth rates of Microsoft and the major competitors Google and Amazon (AMZN) in this segment: Microsoft Azure revenue growth worldwide (statistacom) Microsoft Azure revenue growth worldwide (statistacom) With these facts in mind I anticipated the following growth rates for the intelligent cloud segment: Bear: 15% pa Bull: 25% pa The EBIT margins of Microsofts Cloud were the following in the last few years: This seems already on the high end especially when we compare this to the cloud offering AWS from Amazon which is currently only at an EBIT margin between 35% and 24% in the last few quarters Therefore I only anticipated a slight increase for the Bull Case: The biggest part of the More Personal Computing segment is Microsoft Windows which is an operating system for personal computers created by Microsoft that offers a graphical user interface and a number of utilities It is one of the most extensively used operating systems in the world running a huge variety of gadgets including tablets servers laptops and desktop computers Operating systems market share of desktop PCs 2013-2023 by month (statistacom) Operating systems market share of desktop PCs 2013-2023 by month (statistacom) This segment seems like a very minimal growth opportunity for Microsoft as the global personal computing market is expected to grow at only 23% pa over the next few years To once again adjust for Bear and Bull Case I assumed the following growth rates: Bear: 1% pa Bull: 3% pa Continuing in this segment we have the Gaming category of Microsoft Here we have the most notably Xbox brand which offers a range of games gaming consoles and online services (such as Xbox Live) Xbox game consoles including the Xbox Series X and Series S are well-known for its multi-media features online gaming service integration and gaming capabilities Microsoft is also expanding in this segment through acquisitions like buying Mojang ZeniMax or just recently Activision Blizzard Microsoft Nintendo and Sony global console gaming software revenue 2021-2025 (statistacom) Microsoft Nintendo and Sony global console gaming software revenue 2021-2025 (statistacom) The global video games market is expected to grow at a growth rate of around 9% pa in the following years To adjust for the big acquisition of Activision Blizzard I added the last TTM revenue of the company to the existing revenue of the gaming segment which equates to right around 50% revenue growth in 2024 for this segment From there on I assumed the following growth rates for the Bear and Bull Case scenario: Bing is one of the products and services offered by Microsofts Search and News Advertising division in relation to internet advertising Microsoft Advertising allows marketers to place advertisements for their goods and services on partner websites and platforms in addition to the Bing search engine The general digital ad spend is predicted by experts to grow like this: We have a clear declining trend visible here which is why I extrapolated this linear trend to get the following growth rates for the remaining years: For the Bear and Bull Case we assume growth rates 20% above/below the predicted market rates Microsoft manufactures a variety of hardware products such as the Surface series of laptops tablets and 2-in-1 computers Microsoft also manufactures peripherals such as mouse keyboards and the augmented reality device HoloLens As mentioned above the personal computing market is expected to grow at around 3% pa in the next years I believe it is also fitting if we assume the same growth metrics in the Devices segment as we did in the Windows segment: Bear: 1% pa Bull: 3% pa The revenue in this segmented is distributed like this: We once again us the percentage of the fiscal years 2023 of the revenue as a weighting to calculate the anticipated revenue growth rate for the whole More Personal Computing segment If we now take a look at the margins of the last three years in this segment I believe the following assumptions seem fitting: We now have estimates for Microsofts sales and profit margins for every significant business sector for the years 2024 to 2030; nevertheless a few more suppositions are required before we can fully evaluate the firm: I have summarized the main assumptions on margins and revenues here: Revenue And Margin Assumptions Bear (own assumptions)Discounted Cash Flow Analysis Bear I (own assumptions microsoftcom seekingalphacom)Discounted Cash Flow Analysis Bear II (own assumptions microsoftcom seekingalphacom) Revenue And Margin Assumptions Bear (own assumptions) Discounted Cash Flow Analysis Bear I (own assumptions microsoftcom seekingalphacom) Discounted Cash Flow Analysis Bear II (own assumptions microsoftcom seekingalphacom) In this scenario we get a fair value share price of ~$271 indicating that the company could be overvalued by up to 28% Note that this is the share price one should pay if they believe the Bear Case will come to fruition This scenario however includes worse growth than the market rate as well as below historical profitability margins Again the main assumptions summarized for this scenario: Revenue And Margin Assumptions Bear (own assumptions)Discounted Cash Flow Analysis Bull I (own assumptions microsoftcom seekingalphacom)Discounted Cash Flow Analysis Bull II (own assumptions microsoftcom seekingalphacom) Revenue And Margin Assumptions Bear (own assumptions) Discounted Cash Flow Analysis Bull I (own assumptions microsoftcom seekingalphacom) Discounted Cash Flow Analysis Bull II (own assumptions microsoftcom seekingalphacom) In our Bull Case scenario we get a fair value share price of $515 which would translate in an undervaluation of up to 37% However just like the Bear Case anticipated below average metrics for MSFTs future the assumptions in the Bull Case are rather optimistic and include higher than market growth rates as well as improvements in the different margins of each segment With our Bear and Bull Case scenario the company is currently miss-priced by -28% to 37% indicating that even after the recent Bull-Run the company somewhat trades in the fair value territory I believe that the assumptions we took were pretty conservative and realistic and the current price can still be a solid entry point for investors that want to build a position in this very high quality company This is why I currently rate the company a Buy with a short-term price target of $400 For the ones that already own the company - just like myself - I would wait for a slight decline to extend the position or in the meantime look for other opportunities In my last article I explained how Amazon could be such an opportunity right now Editors Note: This article was submitted as part of Seeking Alphas Top 2024 Long/Short Pick investment

At the start of the new year it’s worth carefully examining this inquiry After all we have favorable circumstances moving in the bulls’ direction As a broader point the economy last year avoided the much-dreaded recession bullet Along with that the Federal Reserve saw encouraging disinflationary trends Indeed the data was apparently so enticing that Fed Chair Jerome Powell hinted at possible interest rate cuts in 2024 If so that would likely undergird hot tech stocks More to the point the technology machinery appears to be running flat out on all cylinders As a result semiconductor specialist Nvidia enjoyed dramatic upside But it’s also possible that investors will be rotating their portfolio to seek out the next big hit If that’s you below are intriguing ideas to consider for hottest tech stocks A legacy tech giant IBM (NYSE:IBM) used to be the talk of the town when the baby boomers dominated the market Now Big Blue has given way to other hipper ideas for hottest tech stocks Still I believe this old dog can learn new tricks It’s been on the move in the past half-year period And analysts rate shares a consensus moderate buy with the high-side price target reaching $179 Primarily what makes IBM an intriguing idea for hot tech stocks centers on its specialty in machine learning Basically ML is a component of artificial intelligence fostering algorithms techniques for machines to learn from data According to Statista the ML market size will likely hit $2043 billion by the end of this year Further the sector volume could land at $5281 billion by 2030 As an investment idea I understand that IBM doesn’t get the juices flowing However investors should note that shares trade at a lowly forward earnings multiple of 1622X Also its forward dividend yield stands at 41% which is very generous for one of the hottest tech stocks An everywhere everything idea within the vast innovation ecosystem Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) offers a sensible idea for hot tech stocks No it’s not exciting However it more than held its own in 2023 beating out the performance of the Nasdaq Composite index Analysts believe the solid run will continue this year pegging shares a consensus strong buy Also the average price target lands at $42436 For me MSFT is appealing because it has its hands on several innovative fields However if I had to pick one it would be its aggressive investments in AI particularly generative AI According to Fortune Business Insights the global generative AI market size reached a valuation of $29 billion in 2022 Further the segment could expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 475% to 2030 At the forecast culmination the segment could be worth nearly $668 billion And that’s not including other compelling business units such as Azure and its Office Software as a Service (SaaS) platform Finally MSFT isn’t exactly traded at a discount However it enjoys solid long-term revenue growth and consistent profitability Thus it’s one of the hot tech stocks to consider Formerly known as Science Applications International Corporation Leidos (NYSE:LDOS) has its hands in several relevant businesses including defense aviation information technology and biomedical research Thus it’s one of the great investments to consider for the long haul However it does have the advantage of being one of the hottest tech stocks Analysts rate shares a strong buy with a $12183 average price target Fundamentally Leidos draws attention for its cybersecurity business Per its website the company is recognized as a sector leader across the federal government Further at the end of this year the global cybersecurity market could print revenue of $1831 billion Plus experts project that the sector will expand at a CAGR of 1056% If so we’re talking a market volume of $2736 billion by 2028 Finally Leidos makes an enticing case for hot tech stocks to buy because of its attractive valuation Currently the market prices at LDOS at a forward earnings multiple of 1411X lower than the sector median 238X Given the upward growth trajectory of cybersecurity along with its other relevancies the discount appears credible Formerly known as Facebook Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) inherently draws attention for its massive social network Cynically META ranks among the hottest tech stocks thanks to leveraging a veritable data goldmine However the company has also transitioned to several innovative arenas It performed quite well last year and analysts remain enthused pegging shares a consensus strong buy Also the average price target lands at $39157 One of the compelling focus areas for Meta has been its investment in the metaverse Now I’m not going to say that I’m a huge fan of the concept Nevertheless the underlying virtual reality market should be huge According to Mordor Intelligence the VR market size reached a valuation of $5424 billion last year Further the segment should expand at a CAGR of 2474% ultimately reaching $16382 billion by 2028 To be sure with META marching toward the 200% up mark (it fell a bit short) in 2023 you’re not going to get a discount here However the company maintains a strong long-term revenue growth rate while staying consistently profitable Thus it’s a solid idea for hot tech stocks Moving into the extremely speculative segment of the hottest tech stocks investors that are willing to throw caution to the wind should take a look at Canaan (NASDAQ:CAN) As a specialist in blockchain mining hardware CAN might be appealing to those who want to participate broadly in the cryptocurrency sector but don’t actually want to directly take the risk Analysts rate shares a moderate buy with a $425 average price target Obviously the narrative for Canaan revolves around how well cryptos perform in 2024 If the sector continues to build upon what materialized near the end of last year CAN may fly higher What makes the idea more tempting is that its market performance wasn’t really that impressive compared to its blockchain-mining peers However a once-ignored opportunity could easily transition to a blistering outperformer in the crypto paradigm Still caution is key For example it’s true that Canaan enjoys a three-year revenue growth rate of 376% which is outstanding Still the problem is that the mining equipment specialist’s fortunes are heavily tied to crypto sentiment So just be careful how much exposure you have As the name suggests D-Wave Quantum (NYSE:QBTS) specializes in quantum computing Per its public profile D-Wave claims to be the world’s first company to sell computers that exploit quantum effects in their operations It’s been incredibly choppy over the past 52 weeks Nevertheless analysts appreciate the opportunity pegging shares a unanimous strong buy Also the average price target clocks in at $217 In a nutshell classical computers – no matter how fast they are – operate in a binary linearism In order for a set of problems to be solved the initial challenge must be addressed before the next obstacle can be engaged Think about unlocking a lock by entering every possible combination It would take a while On the other hand quantum computers can run multiple problem sets simultaneously due to the underlying weird nature of quantum mechanics Here’s the bottom line According to BCC Research the sector may grow from $9047 million last year to $65 billion by 2028 That would be a CAGR of 481% which is astonishing However the risk is that QBTS trades for 1262X trailing revenue which is screaming high A literal penny stock you want to be supremely cautious with Asensus Surgical (NYSEAMERICAN:ASXC) Frankly I’m hesitant to even naming this idea for the hottest tech stocks available As you can see from its 52-week chart ASXC is volatile as fudge as the kids like to say Still the underlying surgical robotics specialty draws much interest Analysts are split with a moderate buy rating The average price target stands at $150 which is intense According to Grand View Research the global surgical robots market size reached a valuation of $392 billion last year Experts project that the sector may expand at a CAGR of 95% from 2024 to 2030 At the forecast culmination the industry may generate annual revenue of $742 billion For ASXC the idea is to get a piece of the pie With a market capitalization of less than $100 million it may not need to grab much for shares to skyrocket Frankly whether it will or not requires a whole lot of faith We’re talking the kind that led to Indiana Jones taking a step in that deep chasm hoping that his foot would land on an invisible bridge Shares trade at 1384X trailing revenue so you really need to think about this one carefully before diving in Penny Stocks On Penny Stocks

Because I think its tangibly changing economic productivity Nadella envisions a future where AI could serve as a personal tutor for children breaking down complex information and alleviating the fear associated with learning He believes that while AI will enhance our cognitive capabilities—likening it to a steam engine for the mind—critical thinking will remain a distinctly human endeavor He offered a refreshing perspective on the potential benefits of AI in the labor market Contrary to the lump of labor fallacy which posits a fixed amount of work within an economy Nadella suggests that labor markets are dynamic entities capable of adapting to technological advancements The lump of labor fallacy has been a topic of discussion in relation to AI and job displacement This misconception assumes that there is a finite volume of work and that the introduction of AI and automation will inevitably lead to a reduction in the total number of jobs available However evidence contradicts this belief indicating that while AI may displace certain jobs particularly those involving routine and repetitive tasks it simultaneously creates new opportunities For instance the World Economic Forum predicts that by 2025 AI will have displaced 75 million jobs but will also have generated 133 million new ones In the interview Nadella stressed on the role of AI in reducing the learning curve for workers even those who are mid-career enabling them to acquire new skills more rapidly and efficiently “This aspect of AI can be particularly empowering as it facilitates career development and personal growth” he added Moreover AI brings expertise to the fingertips of frontline workers enhancing their ability to perform tasks with greater proficiency By providing real-time skills training and on-the-job guidance AI empowers workers across various sectors potentially leading to improved wages due to their enhanced capability to deliver expert advice or services he said Furthermore Nadella sees AI as a competitive advantage for countries like India where he believes the strong market and growth rate are well-suited to harness AI-led growth for increased productivity Also Read: Dilli Chalo protest: Farmers call ceasefire for now say will try again tomorrow Copyright©2024 Living Media India Limited For reprint rights: Syndications Today Add Business Today to Home Screen Home Market BT TV Reels Menu Menu"
87,"Microsoft: Azure And AI Are Set To Drive Growth In The Next Decade (NASDAQ:MSFT)","2/14/2024","https://seekingalpha.com/article/4670331-microsoft-azure-and-ai-are-set-to-drive-growth-in-the-next-decade","LIONEL BONAVENTURE/AFP via Getty Images LIONEL BONAVENTURE/AFP via Getty Images Recently Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) has become the worlds most valuable company surpassing Apple Inc (AAPL) once again From my perspective the gap between the two will continue to widen in the coming years Not because I believe Apple will perform poorly but because I anticipate Microsoft will excel Satya Nadella has successfully positioned Microsoft in the right place at the right time Microsoft is poised to lead two of the most revolutionary waves of our time: cloud computing and artificial intelligence In this article I will explain why I believe Azure will eventually emerge as the undisputed leader in the cloud industry and why Microsoft will be the biggest beneficiary of artificial intelligence among the big caps (excluding Nvidia) Furthermore I posit that Microsoft is also likely to capitalize most effectively on this growth and will face the least risk during this transition Microsoft is undoubtedly the company that will find the most synergies between its traditional business and cloud computing and AI Lets examine some of the ones I consider most relevant: As you may know Microsoft owns Xbox and a large number of video game developers including Activision Blizzard following the completed merger last quarter In this case the synergies are quite clear Despite the slow start of cloud gaming (or as I like to call it Gaming-As-A-Service) it is poised to become a massive business in the next decade with compounded growth rates of 40% until 2030 Grand View Research Grand View Research Among the three major console manufacturers-Sony Nintendo and Microsoft-only Microsoft has a significant cloud service Thanks to the years invested in developing Azure Microsoft can now leverage its unparalleled scale unmatched by either of the other two competitors to provide the best cloud gaming experience in the market In fact I believe that the acquisition of Activision may have been undertaken to enhance the catalog of its cloud gaming service and ensure that their titles dominate the platform in the coming years On the other hand Amazoncom Inc (AMZN) and NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) do provide cloud gaming services of a certain quality such as Amazon Luna and Nvidia GeForce Now However these two players can only serve as cloud service providers and not as game developers themselves; they must seek alliances with third-party developers Microsoft is the sole player capable of offering an integrated product that combines cloud gaming with low latency and its own array of games This I believe could give them a certain advantage over others Nevertheless given the rapidly expanding nature of this market it is likely that all players will experience significant growth in the coming years However thanks to the comprehensive integration Microsoft offers with Xbox it will be challenging for them to lag behind and not be among the foremost beneficiaries of this trend The synergies between the Office suite and the development of artificial intelligence are already beginning to be seen in action Just a few weeks ago Copilot Pro was launched an artificial intelligence service for all Microsoft applications from Excel Word and PowerPoint to Bing and Edge This service is focused on increasing productivity in the business environment so although its price may seem high for the general public ($20/month) at the enterprise level it has a price that could be considered even cheap for the exponential increase in productivity it can provide The integration of these types of artificial intelligence tools can help continue to drive sales in the Productivity & Business Process segment This sector is more mature than the cloud segment which until recently was seen as unlikely to maintain double-digit growth rates in the long term However with these new services it is now much more probable Lets say that Microsoft has once again been able to reinvent the wheel with its Office suite One aspect of Microsoft that receives relatively little attention is Dynamics its ERP and CRM solution which competes with SAP Salesforce or Workday among others Here Microsofts advantage is quite clear: it is the only provider capable of offering these SaaS services alongside cloud infrastructure services This integration strengthens Microsofts Dynamics business by consolidating everything within the company and it enables clients to be offered broader solutions than those available from other SaaS providers This has led Dynamics to maintain growth rates exceeding 15% since the pandemic gradually capturing market share from its competitors Another positive aspect for Microsoft is the integration of artificial intelligence into its Dynamics services although this feature can be replicated by its competitors In summary clients seek comprehensive solutions for their infrastructure and software-as-a-service needs and practically the only company capable of offering this complete solution is Microsoft thanks to the synergies between Dynamics and Azure Authors calculations Authors calculations This could be one of the biggest growth opportunities for Microsoft in the future: gaining market share in internet searches However this is no easy feat and until a few years ago I would have said it was impossible for anyone to steal market share from Alphabet Inc (GOOG) (GOOGL) But now I do believe Microsoft has a chance to do so As you may already know Microsofts search engine Bing has integrated a conversational chat feature that assists you with internet searches allowing for natural interactions This could truly be a paradigm shift if it were to gain popularity However this type of search requires more computing power to process which will likely reduce the margin for searches permanently as Satya Nadella has mentioned In this scenario and imagining that this type of search becomes dominant (which is yet to be seen) Microsoft has much to gain and very little to lose Consider this: if they fail to boost Bing as a search engine with a significant market share Microsoft would lose practically nothing The resources allocated to this artificial intelligence are easily convertible to other purposes and the costs of attempting this move are minimal However if Microsoft were to achieve a relevant market share in searches the potential gains would be enormous Lets consider that Google earns nearly $200 billion a year from advertising on its search engine while Bing earns less than $10 billion The market share to be captured is enormous and every percentage point Microsoft takes from Google represents billions of dollars in revenue Certainly challenging Googles dominant position will not be easy and success is not guaranteed However I believe the risk/benefit ratio favors Microsoft and being the first mover in this matter may give them some advantage On the other hand Google has a lot to lose in this matter Searches are their main business and any changes to the search engine that affect user experience could cause them to lose market share if Bing becomes a popular alternative In this case we encounter the typical innovators dilemma: Google is interested in maintaining the status quo so they must be very careful with their moves because they have practically nothing to gain (they are already a monopoly in searches) and much to lose whereas Microsoft doesnt mind taking risky moves because the potential gains could be enormous For now this is not happening but it is certainly a very positive optionality we have when investing in Microsoft and in the event that it does not materialize the rest of the business would still justify the valuation of the company StatCounter Global Stats StatCounter Global Stats As weve been discussing throughout the article following its investment in OpenAI Microsoft has positioned itself as one of the leading companies in the field of artificial intelligence Another way they can capitalize on this is through Azure where they not only offer their own AI in their products but also a wide range of services and tools for developing implementing and managing AI solutions on a large scale But how can Microsoft maximize its potential in this competitive and ever-changing market? The masterstroke is to integrate Azure and AI more seamlessly giving their customers the option to access their pre-trained models or use their computing power to train their own custom models Microsoft is already generating revenue by charging for access to their models via APIs and selling additional training power to their customers allowing them to use their cloud infrastructure for this purpose Apart from Google and Amazon no other provider has the capacity to offer these services as they require massive investments in equipment and cutting-edge technology from Nvidia or Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD) to build and maintain data centers As we can see in the following graph sales of services related to artificial intelligence are once again accelerating the growth of Azure which was already quite substantial If artificial intelligence ends up being as significant as many believe Microsoft will be one of the biggest beneficiaries even if its own AI products were to fail all thanks to Azure @jaminball @jaminball For several years I have held the belief that Microsoft would eventually become the leading provider of cloud services surpassing AWS and it seems that the trend is pointing in that direction While Google and Amazon are two players with very solid cloud solutions that are sure to experience exponential growth in the next decade and generate a substantial amount of revenue Microsoft is in the best position to capitalize on this opportunity Before the era of cloud computing Microsofts clients were primarily large enterprises and institutional organizations unlike Google and especially Amazon This established customer base gives Microsoft a significant advantage in the market Additionally its focus on integration and interoperability along with its wide range of products and services allows it to offer comprehensive and customized solutions that uniquely meet the needs of business clients In the following graph we see how Amazon is slightly losing market share due to its strategy of lowering prices to increase customer loyalty (which I find very appropriate from Amazons position) On the other hand Google is gaining some market share mainly because it is the smallest player and Microsoft is gaining the most market share Again my scenario is that in 2 or 3 years Microsoft will be the leading player in the global cloud market Synergy Research Group Synergy Research Group Finally another piece of data that supports my prediction is observing the growth rates of the three main players Microsoft thanks to the momentum weve already seen in artificial intelligence is once again the fastest-growing even surpassing Google which is much smaller I reiterate that Amazons strategy is geared towards lowering prices so its logical to see a slower growth rate although I believe they are making good decisions given their position @EricFlaningam @EricFlaningam When we talk about Microsoft they really hold such a dominant position that its hard to think of risks that could completely break the long-term thesis However I do believe we should closely monitor potential technological disruptions and see if Microsoft is adapting to them correctly In past decades several technological waves were missed due to poor decisions such as mobile telephony and their operating systems search engines browsers social networks etc Under Satya Nadellas leadership it seems that this is changing as he has managed to ride and lead the waves of cloud and artificial intelligence but its certainly something we should keep an eye on Finally I would like to provide a brief overall assessment of the company to see if despite this significant increase weve seen in recent months we might be facing a good opportunity to buy Microsoft shares To do this I have projected growth rates and margins for each of the companys segments Although these growth rates may be very high they are lower than those expected by analysts themselves as I prefer to be somewhat more conservative Nevertheless Microsoft is a company that has been consistently surpassing estimates for many years and is likely to surpass mine as well In my valuation I have projected a final multiple of around 23x EBIT which despite being very high I believe a quality company like Microsoft with so many recurring revenues may deserve Authors calculations Authors calculations With these projections we arrive at a target value of $567 per share in 2024 and a fair value for this year of $340 Therefore I believe it is prudent to wait for a pullback in the stock before buying However as I often reiterate selling high-quality stocks solely due to potential temporary overvaluation is a mistake; therefore I would not recommend selling for those who already hold shares In summary I currently assign it a Hold rating and look forward to seeing how all the synergies and tailwinds weve discussed in this article materialize in the upcoming quarterly results This article was written by Analyst’s Disclosure: I/we have a beneficial long position in the shares of MSFT either through stock ownership options or other derivatives I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha) I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Seeking Alphas Disclosure: Past performance is no guarantee of future results No recommendation or advice is being given as to whether any investment is suitable for a particular investor Any views or opinions expressed above may not reflect those of Seeking Alpha as a whole Seeking Alpha is not a licensed securities dealer broker or US investment adviser or investment bank Our analysts are third party authors that include both professional investors and individual investors who may not be licensed or certified by any institute or regulatory body"

There was that Xbox app compact mode Feb 15 Andrew Webster Taken on their own today’s gaming announcements from Microsoft might not seem all that earth-shattering A handful of unspecified Xbox games are coming to rival platforms the subscriber numbers for Game Pass have grown Diablo IV will lead the rush of Activision Blizzard titles on Game Pass and more hardware is on the way including a powerful next-gen console and possibly a handheld But they all point to a future that Microsoft hasn’t exactly been shy about: making Xbox into more than just a console In an internal memo to employees Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer explained the strategy like this: Feb 15 Andrew Webster You can read all of the news right here but if you want to check out the podcast where Xbox leadership discussed everything from platform exclusives to the state of Game Pass to some vague talk of new hardware the whole thing is embedded below Feb 15 Tom Warren Microsoft has been gradually moving Xbox away from the idea of a single piece of hardware in recent years with ambitions to reach billions of gamers across consoles PCs and mobile devices Now it’s officially bringing four Xbox-exclusive games to PS5 and Nintendo Switch amid an “Xbox Everywhere” effort inside Microsoft that will likely see even more games arriving on rival consoles It’s a seismic strategy shift that the company is downplaying publicly so I sat down with Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer to get some answers and discuss the company’s vision for the future of Xbox Feb 15 Tom Warren Microsoft’s Xbox Game Pass service now has 34 million subscribers That’s up 36 percent from the 25 million Microsoft previously reported more than two years ago Microsoft revealed the new 34 million figure in an official Xbox podcast today as part of an announcement that some Xbox exclusives are coming to the PS5 and Nintendo Switch It’s the first time Microsoft has disclosed fresh Xbox Game Pass subscriber numbers since announcing its Activision Blizzard acquisition in January 2022 Feb 15 Tom Warren It’s official: Microsoft is bringing some Xbox-exclusive games to PS5 and Nintendo Switch It’s part of a broader strategy shift inside Microsoft’s gaming business to grow games beyond just the company’s Xbox consoles “We’ve made the decision that we’re going to take four games to the other consoles” reveals Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer on the official Xbox podcast Bizarrely Microsoft is refusing to name the four titles but the company says that two are community-driven games and the other two are smaller titles Feb 15 Ash Parrish Diablo IV will be the first Activision Blizzard game coming to Xbox Game Pass launching on the service on March 28th Once Microsoft completed its billion-dollar acquisition of Activision Blizzard fans speculated that its games would arrive immediately on the subscription service Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer said in October of last year right when the deal closed that fans would have to wait until 2024 before games like Call of Duty would start showing up on the service That time is now but instead of Call of Duty we’re getting Diablo IV Feb 15 Tom Warren Microsoft is teasing the potential for unique Xbox hardware in the future and a powerful next-gen console Four previously exclusive Xbox games are officially coming to the PS5 and Nintendo Switch soon and Microsoft wants to reassure Xbox fans that it’s still very much invested in the future of its platform and hardware In an official Xbox podcast today Xbox president Sarah Bond teased that Microsoft will deliver “the largest technical leap” with the next-generation Xbox: Feb 15 Andrew Webster Later today Microsoft will be sharing “updates on the Xbox business” in an episode of the Xbox podcast that will feature Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer head of Xbox game studios Matt Booty and Xbox president Sarah Bond If rumors are to be believed we’ll be hearing about multiplatform games and possibly even new hardware It’ll be available at 3PM ET and you can check it out on the Xbox YouTube channel — and of course stay tuned to The Verge for all the news Feb 14 Sean Hollister The Nintendo Switch is on track to become the bestselling game console of all time Sony’s PS5 will likely surpass the Xbox One’s entire lifetime sales later this year Meanwhile Microsoft’s newer Xbox Series X and S with their comparatively disappointing exclusive games are firmly in third place yet again — and it doesn’t look like Xbox Game Pass will ever fill the gap Microsoft isn’t planning to take this lying down It’s among the largest video game companies in the world now that it owns Activision Blizzard and it’s going to act This Thursday we expect the company to reveal a seismic shift in strategy one where it could bring Xbox exclusives like Hi-Fi Rush Starfield even Indiana Jones to PlayStation and / or Switch Feb 12 Tom Warren Microsoft’s Xbox business needs to get bigger The company’s Xbox Series S and X sales still lag behind Sony’s PlayStation 5 and Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer has previously admitted its Xbox Game Pass subscriptions were slowing down too He admitted that in 2022 a dry year for Xbox games after Microsoft’s big exclusive Bethesda game Starfield was delayed An Xbox Game Pass slowdown might be why I’m hearing that a number of Xbox exclusives are coming to consoles with which Microsoft usually competes Sources familiar with Microsoft’s plans tell The Verge that the company is getting ready to launch a select number of Xbox games on PS5 and Nintendo Switch Weeks of rumors suggest that Hi-Fi Rush Sea of Thieves and even Bethesda titles like Starfield and Indiana Jones could appear on non-Xbox platforms Feb 12 Tom Warren After weeks of rumors of Xbox exclusives coming to PS5 and Nintendo Switch Microsoft is now planning to discuss its vision for the future of Xbox at an event later this week Microsoft’s Xbox business update event will take place on Thursday February 15th at 12PM PT / 3PM ET Weeks of rumors suggest that Hi-Fi Rush Sea of Thieves and even Bethesda titles like Starfield and Indiana Jones could appear on non-Xbox platforms Microsoft hasn’t addressed these rumors directly but Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer didn’t dismiss them last week “We’re listening and we hear you” said Spencer before announcing the Xbox business update event Feb 5 Tom Warren Microsoft is planning to share details about its plans to bring Hi-Fi Rush and other Xbox exclusives to PS5 and Nintendo Switch consoles according to sources familiar with Microsoft’s plans Details of Microsoft’s multi-platform plans have been gradually leaking with The Verge revealing over the weekend that the upcoming Indiana Jones game is being considered for PS5 Now Microsoft is getting ready to outline the future of Xbox next week after a weekend of leaks and uncertainty for Xbox fans “We’re listening and we hear you” says Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer in a post on X “We’ve been planning a business update event for next week where we look forward to sharing more details with you about our vision for the future of Xbox Stay tuned” Feb 4 Tom Warren Bethesda’s upcoming Indiana Jones game is also tentatively set to launch on Sony’s PlayStation 5 console We got our first glimpse of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle during Microsoft’s Xbox Developer Direct event last month where it was announced for Xbox and PC A source familiar with Microsoft’s plans tells The Verge that Bethesda is also considering bringing Indiana Jones and the Great Circle to PS5 A new multi-platform approach for certain Xbox games is emerging inside Microsoft we’re told with the company weighing up which titles will remain exclusive and others that will appear on Switch or PS5 in the future Indiana Jones appears to be part of this new wave of multi-platform games Feb 1 Tom Warren After rumors of Xbox console exclusive Hi-Fi Rush coming to PS5 and Nintendo Switch data miners might have just found a smoking gun T-shirt files included in the game’s latest update include a “I’m here baby!” in PlayStation blue a “Rock out! Anywhere” in Nintendo Switch red and “Shadow dropped” in Xbox green The rock out anywhere slogan must reference the Switch’s portability the “I’m here baby!” the sheer surprise of an Xbox game on PS5 and the shadow drop for the original surprise Xbox launch There’s no smoke without fire 1/3 / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products weve tested sent to your inbox daily The Verge is a vox media network © 2024 Vox Media LLC All Rights Reserved"

recommendations in-depth research investing resources and more Learn More There have never been more millionaires than today Indeed Statista estimates that as of December 2023 there were 227 million millionaires in the United States roughly 9% of the American population One big reason why: The current bull market and in particular the artificial intelligence (AI) stocks that are powering it higher So lets take a look at two millionaire-maker AI stocks that still have plenty of room to run These stocks may not be cheap today but they may be worth every premium penny in the long run Image source: Getty Images First up is Microsoft (MSFT -015%) There are many reasons why the worlds largest company has made and will continue to make countless millionaires but I want to cover one specifically: Microsoft is poised to grow its often underappreciated search and news advertising business In its most recent quarter (the three months ending on Dec 31) Microsofts search and news ad segment generated $32 billion in revenue Thats a tidy sum similar to the revenue Roku generated over the last 12 months ($34 billion) However for Microsoft the $32 billion it generates from advertising is but a drop in the bucket The company makes about $62 billion in quarterly revenue So to some investors its digital ad segment revenue is often an afterthought -- particularly when compared to the true digital ad giants like Alphabet and Meta Platforms However thanks to its partnership with OpenAI Microsoft might be able to force its way into the digital ad conversation Recent reports suggest that OpenAI may be working on a search engine designed to rival Alphabets flagship Google Search Crucially Microsoft was quick to adopt key ChatGPT features into its Bing search engine last year leading to the possibility that Microsoft might once again quickly adopt any future breakthroughs At any rate it is clear Microsoft has room to grow when it comes to the digital ad market The overall market is likely to expand to $966 billion by 2028 If Microsoft can use AI innovations to improve the popularity of its search and news products it could turn an unsung revenue stream into a giant in its own right Next is Nvidia (NVDA 312%) the undisputed AI king Indeed Nvidia has undergone nothing short of an explosion in demand both for its products and its stock since AI took the limelight last year In terms of market cap Nvidia is now Americas third-largest company trailing only Microsoft and Apple The companys surging fortunes are partly thanks to its graphics processing units (GPUs) which are used to train large language models like ChatGPT There is however another reason that isnt discussed as often: Nvidias compute unified device architecture (CUDA) interface Without getting too technical CUDA is a proprietary software framework that helps developers tap into the power of GPUs for training AI models In short it is Nvidias secret weapon that makes its GPUs so desirable for AI developers and it helps explain why Nvidia likely has around 90% share of the data center GPU market Financially CUDA gives Nvidia a strong strategic moat -- making it difficult for rivals like Advanced Micro Devices or Intel to gain market share They rely on the OpenCL standard instead but this open-source system offers significantly slower performance than Nvidias proprietary language At any rate theres no doubt that Nvidia is like a freight train cruising downhill -- seemingly unstoppable In its latest quarter (the three months ending Jan 28) Nvidia reported $221 billion in revenue up 265% from a year earlier Yes you read that correctly Nvidias quarterly revenue almost tripled from a year ago Its data center revenue increased 409% going from $45 billion to $184 billion NVDA Revenue (Quarterly) data by YCharts In short Nvidias CUDA moat is driving enormous shareholder returns and it remains a company that could make more millionaires for some time

on the go on Apple Podcasts and Spotify Google (GOOGL) (GOOG): Microsoft (MSFT) offered to sell Bing to Apple (AAPL) when pitching default deal (00:23) Walt Disney (DIS) Reliance sign pact to merge Indian media operations - report (01:27) Ford (F) halts shipments of electric F-150 truck due to quality issue (02:36) This is an abridged transcript of the podcast Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) offered to sell Bing to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in 2018 or form a joint venture related to the search engine This information is coming from a recently unsealed post-trial brief from the US Justice Departments antitrust case against Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) The case relates Googles (GOOG) (GOOGL) alleged search monopoly and the methods it employed to ensure dominance such as spending billions of dollars to make its search engine the default option in phones Google argued that it had been competing fairly Google (GOOG) told the court that Microsoft (MSFT) approached Apple (AAPL) in 2009 2013 2015 2016 2018 and 2020 to make Bing the default option for its Safari browser In each instance Apple took a hard look at the relative quality of Bing versus Google and concluded that Google was the superior default choice said Google (GOOG) That is competition Apple (AAPL) executive Eddy Cue said this was because Bings search quality wasnt as good as Google (GOOG) and Microsoft (MSFT) wasnt investing at any level comparable to Google Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) and Reliance Industries Ltd signed a binding agreement for a merger of their media operations in India The media unit of Reliance which is controlled by billionaire Mukesh Ambani and its affiliates will own at least 61% of the combined entity according to a Bloomberg report on Sunday which cited people familiar with the matter The latest update on the deal is expected to be announced this week according to the report The stake split could still change depending on how Disney’s other local assets are factored in by the time the deal is closed A Disney (DIS) representative declined to comment to Bloomberg and a Reliance spokesperson didnt immediately respond to request for comment Disneys (DIS) Indian operations have reportedly suffered significant losses over the past year due to the loss of streaming rights to air cricket matches Media reports in the last month indicate that Disneys preliminary deal to sell majority control of its Indian business to Reliance Industries is at a sharply lower valuation than when it was acquired The deal reportedly values the operation at $39B However when Disney acquired it via its $713B Fox media assets buyout in 2019 the unit was valued somewhere between $7B and $16B Ford Motor Co (NYSE:F) has halted shipments of the F-150 Lightning electric truck due to an undisclosed quality issue The automobile manufacturer said it stopped shipping the electric truck on Feb 9 to ensure quality according to media reports including from Bloomberg which cited a statement from late Friday Ford didnt specify when shipping of the Lightning would resume delivery to dealers though the automaker noted it has started shipping gas-powered versions of the truck The news comes after Ford (F) a little more than a month ago said it was ramping up the manufacture of its gas-powered Bronco and Ranger line and reducing production of the F-150 Lightning EV Production at the Rouge EV Center will now be reduced to one shift effective April 1 as the company expects global growth in EV sales in 2024 will be less than anticipated Other articles to look out for on Seeking Alpha:

104,"Is Microsoft (MSFT) a Buy as Wall Street Analysts Look Optimistic?","2/5/2024","https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-msft-buy-wall-street-143005015.html","The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy sell or hold a stock Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stocks price Do they really matter though? Lets take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Microsoft (MSFT) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage Microsoft currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 114 on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell) calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy Hold Sell etc) made by 37 brokerage firms An ABR of 114 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy Of the 37 recommendations that derive the current ABR 33 are Strong Buy and three are Buy Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 892% and 81% of all recommendations Brokerage Recommendation Trends for MSFT Check price target & stock forecast for Microsoft here>>>While the ABR calls for buying Microsoft it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it Our research shows that for every Strong Sell recommendation brokerage firms assign five Strong Buy recommendations In other words their interests arent always aligned with retail investors rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading Therefore the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stocks price movement Zacks Rank our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record categorizes stocks into five groups ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) and is an effective indicator of a stocks price performance in the near future Therefore using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision Zacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR Although both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5 they are different measures altogether The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 128) In contrast the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5 It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations Because of their employers vested interests these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support misguiding investors far more often than helping them In contrast the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions according to empirical research Furthermore the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year In other words at all times this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it But since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a companys changing business trends and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough it is always timely in indicating future price movements Is MSFT Worth Investing In? Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Microsoft the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 41% over the past month to $1160 Analysts growing optimism over the companys earnings prospects as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate along with three other factors related to earnings estimates has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Microsoft You can see the complete list of todays Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>> Therefore the Buy-equivalent ABR for Microsoft may serve as a useful guide for investors Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

105,"None","2/6/2024","https://www.xrtoday.com/mixed-reality/microsoft-ignores-xr-investments-in-favour-of-ai/","Home → Mixed Reality Microsoft avoids HoloLens and Industrial Metaverse talk during its fiscal year 2024 second quarter Published: February 6 2024 Rory Greener Earnings calls are out and usually the rolling soapbox is an opportunity for a business leader to address the good the bad and the ugly of a firm’s recent activities and investments Microsoft recently released information regarding its recent Fiscal Year 2024 Second Quarter earnings call The call hits all the expected notes such as genAI However interestingly despite an increased push towards developing XR solutions since mid-2023 Microsft did not mention its MR/spatial applications HoloLens 2 or its industrial metaverse roadmap Regarding Mcrosoft’s recent performance Amy Hood the EVP and CFO at Microsoft noted: This quarter revenue was $62 billion up 18% and 16% in constant currency When adjusted for the prior year Q2 charge operating income increased 25% and 23% in constant currency and earnings per share was $293 – which increased 26% and 23% in constant currency Results exceeded expectations and we delivered another quarter of double-digit top and bottom-line growth While Microsoft primarily focuses on providing a broader digital solutions portfolio far more expansive than just immersive solutions the complete lack of XR in the call is interesting – especially considering that under a year ago the firm’s investments into XR seemingly dropped in favour of genAI investments only to pick up mid-year The firm is still deploying its immersive solutions for enterprise end-users worldwide working with clients such as the US Army Boeing and SNC-Lavalin Moreover in January the firm dropped a major Microsoft Mesh update introducing immersive VR meeting features to the popular Teams video conferencing platform So not all is lost However on the hardware side no new hardware is close to confirmation even if its devices are still in use However again the HoloLens 2 is dormant Will this mark the last beats for the device or is it just a bump in the road? There may be many reasons for XR’s dormancy during Microsoft’s most recent earnings call Notably the main reason is the clearly outperforming nature of Microsoft’s genAI and Cloud investments which are taking centre stage over XR for the leading digital solutions firm CEO Satya Nadella noted: It was a record quarter driven by the continued strength of the Microsoft Cloud which surpassed $33 billion in revenue up 24% We’ve moved from talking about AI to applying AI at scale By infusing AI across every layer of our tech stack we’re winning new customers and helping drive new benefits and productivity gains The firm sees this success via a new “models as a service” according to Nadella that “makes it easy for developers to use LLMs from our partners like Cohere Meta and Mistral on Azure without having to manage the underlying infrastructure” he remarked Nadella also explained that Microsoft’s Azure AI platforms have roughly 53000 customers and “over one-third are new to Azure over the past 12 months” Nadella added: Overall we are seeing larger and more strategic Azure deals with an increase in the number of billion-dollar-plus Azure commitments Vodafone for example will invest $15 billion in cloud and AI services over the next 10 years as it works to transform the digital experience of more than 300 million customers worldwide “We’re also using this AI moment to redefine our role in business applications” said Nadella It is clear that the fledging AI landscape is a fruitful one for Mccriosoft with clear financial benefits for the company compared to what has been a rocky XR road for Microsoft over the past two years So it is understandable that Microsoft may be turning away from XR again despite revving up the engines for what felt like a second wind in the space Nadella added: On to the future of work A growing body of evidence makes clear the role AI will play in transforming work Our own research as well as external studies show as much as a 70% improvement in productivity using generative AI for specific work tasks And overall early Copilot for Microsoft 365 users were 29% faster in a series of tasks like searching writing and summarizing Two months in we’ve seen faster adoption than either our E3 or E5 suites as enterprises like Dentsu Honda Pfizer all deploy Copilot to their employees “In 2024 AI will become a first-class part of every PC” he also explained Seemingly all focus is on AI for Microsoft which believes its alliance with the leading genAI firm OpenAI is proving incredibly successful Even in the firm’s gaming part of its earnings call – the most conventional XR use case – Microsoft did not mention XR in any capacity; again understandably referring to the power of AI in this space also In closing Nadella explained: This generation of AI is going to be different It started with the move from 25 to 3 of GPT and then it’s used inside of developer scenario with GitHub Copilot And so yes I think this is the place where it’s most evolved in terms of its economic benefits or productivity benefits All this may not put a nail in Microsoft’s XR coffin The firm has many plates to spin and XR is just one of many worthwhile investments for the firm Moreover with the rise of the Vision Pro the firm may be reevaluating its stance on XR hardware and software – after all Microsoft used spatial computing way before Apple Microsoft also distributes immersive versions of its productivity solutions on Meta and Apple MR headsets so the firm is still active in XR However the depth of its investments may reduce in favour of AI once again Mixed Reality Apple Vision Pro Version 11: What’s New?

Elon Musk Takes Aim At Sam Altman After Sora AI Reveal Musk wants OpenAI to return to its open-source roots instead of its current closed-source approach Notably OpenAI no longer reveals the weights it uses in its newer GPT models a metric that is crucial for AI models Musk has some specific demands that he wants the court to enforce against OpenAI This includes labeling GPT-4 as artificial general intelligence or AGI The lawsuit says that this will result in GPT-4 being out of the scope of Microsofts agreement with OpenAI so Microsoft should not be able to use it Next up Musk also wants Q* and other future next-generation large language models to be called AGI and as such beyond the scope of OpenAIs license to Microsoft Musk claims that OpenAI solicited tens of millions of dollars in donations from him by promising that the company would remain a non-profit dedicated to creating safe AGI for public benefit However by licensing its technology to Microsoft in exchange for billions of dollars Musk claims OpenAI has betrayed him and the Founding Agreement as well Microsoft has invested $13 billion in OpenAI so far He further hones in on the point that only OpenAI and by extension Microsoft know the internal details of GPT-4 Musk also underscored the fact that Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella intervened during the infamous firing of Altman from OpenAI Not only did Altman return to the company the previous board was also revamped and Microsoft got an observer seat on it as well – something that it did not have before Why It Matters: Musk has been having a go at Altman and OpenAI for a long time now He has been a vocal critic of OpenAI transitioning from a non-profit to a profit-oriented company after his departure in 2018 He has also criticized OpenAIs collaboration with Microsoft on multiple occasions Most recently Musk criticized OpenAI after it unveiled its latest product the Sora AI model that can generate videos using text prompts Check out more of Benzinga’s Consumer Tech coverage by following this link Read Next: ‘Not That Interested In Killer Robots: Instead OpenAI CEO Sam Altman Is Worried ‘Subtle Misalignments Could Make AI Dangerous Photo courtesy: Shutterstock © 2024 Benzingacom Benzinga does not provide investment advice All rights reserved Traders and investors use our platform Top website in the world when it comes to all things investing Mobile reviews with 49 average rating No other fintech apps are more loved Custom scripts and ideas shared by our users @profitable_trades @TradingView @ozonlayerfx @aggressivecalculator @most_luxurious_lifestyle @life_of_lorenafx @chartfeed @tradingview @TradingView @fxdelta @lifestylewith_ashley26 @TradingView @aitor_avatar @rok_trader @Cenobar @trading_toolsir @Market Mentor Network @itzi71 Whatever the trade"

overtook Apple (AAPLO) as the world’s most valuable company for the first time since 2021 after the iPhone maker’s shares made a weak start to the year on growing concerns over demand Microsoft’s shares have risen sharply since last year thanks to the early lead the company has taken in generative artificial intelligence through an investment in ChatGPT-maker OpenAI Microsoft’s stock closed 05 per cent higher giving it a market valuation of $2859 trillion It rose as much as 2 per cent during the session and the company was briefly worth $2903 trillion Shares of Apple closed 03 per cent lower giving the company a market capitalization of $2886 trillion Microsoft and Apple have jostled for top spot over the years “It was inevitable that Microsoft would overtake Apple since Microsoft is growing faster and has more to benefit from the generative AI revolution” said DA Davidson analyst Gil Luria Microsoft has incorporated OpenAI’s technology across its suite of productivity software a move that helped spark a rebound in its cloud-computing business in the July-September quarter Apple meanwhile has been grappling with weakening demand including for the iPhone its biggest cash cow Demand in China a major market has slumped as the country’s economy makes a slow recovery from the pandemic and a resurgent Huawei (HWTUL) chips away at its market share “China could be a drag on performance over the coming years” brokerage Redburn Atlantic said in a client note on Wednesday downgrading Apple’s shares to “neutral” At least three of the 41 analysts covering Apple have lowered their ratings since the start of 2024 Shares of Cupertino California-based Apple have fallen 33 per cent in January as of the last close compared with a 18 per cent rise in Microsoft Both stocks are expensive in terms of their share price-to-earnings (PE) ratio a common method of valuing publicly listed companies Apple is trading at a forward PE of 28 well above its average of 19 over the past 10

to Luke Lango’s “2nd Trillion-Dollar AI Trade” The US govt just unlocked an $8 trillion market to move in a new direction See how it could unleash 6000% potential upside MSFT stock is one of the best AI investments you can make today Advertisement Source: The Art of Pics / Shutterstockcom It’s funny how life comes full-circle sometimes Many years ago Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) became a gigantic company based on the company’s operating systems for personal computers Now there’s talk of a PC-market resurgence and Microsoft has developed artificial intelligence embedded programs for PCs It’s just another reason that MSFT stock can continue to provide supreme value for the shareholders As Microsoft continues to evolve its market capitalization grows over time The company relentlessly advances the latest and greatest in tech trends including AI-capable software Consequently we’re giving Microsoft stock a well-deserved “A” grade and are preparing for it to perform well in 2024 When we call Microsoft an “MVP” or “most valuable player” this is a baseball metaphor but there’s also a literal meaning to it That’s because Microsoft recently overtook Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to become the most valuable publicly traded company Apple had a market cap of $287 trillion while Microsoft beat that number with a market cap of $289 trillion The point here isn’t to put down Apple Rather we’re emphasizing that Microsoft’s smart strategy of investing early and heavily in generative AI technology is paying off big-time Matrix Asset Advisors Chief Investment Officer David Katz cited a couple of reasons Microsoft took Apple’s place as the market-cap leader First Microsoft “has done a better job of executing and demonstrating earnings growth” Furthermore according to Katz Microsoft “has a much clearer roadmap with AI and it has done a great job articulating how that will accelerate growth to make its long-term prospects even more compelling” By the time you read this the market-cap leader may be Microsoft Apple or some other company That’s not the most important issue though What really matters is that Microsoft never ceases to advance its AI-compatible programs for multiple use cases Not only did Microsoft invest in OpenAI’s ChatGPT gen-AI chatbot technology but the company also enhanced its browser cloud-computing and video-conferencing programs with AI functionalities Now with the financial-media buzz getting louder about a potential PC-market comeback Microsoft is ambitiously rolling out its AI-powered Copilot assistant software Yusuf Mehdi Microsoft corporate vice president emphasized the AI-tech functionalities that Copilot can bring to PCs “There’s never been a better time to get started with Copilot today whether it’s turning your ideas into songs creating beautiful images and polished drafts to adjusting your PC settings Copilot is your everyday AI companion for work and life” he said Moreover Mehdi contends that when Copilot is combined with AI-capable PCs “Every user becomes a power user” Reportedly Microsoft’s new keyboards for Windows-based PCs will even include a dedicated button to launch Copilot It’s another sign that Microsoft is going all-in on AI tech during a year when the PC market might turn a corner Clearly Microsoft isn’t a company that sits back and coasts on its past achievements The company continues to develop next-generation technology and this is why Microsoft stock provides ongoing value to the shareholders So don’t obsess over which company has the biggest market cap on any given day Just remember

119,"Going Into Earnings Is Microsoft Stock a Buy a Sell or Fairly Valued?","1/19/2024","https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/going-into-earnings-is-microsoft-stock-buy-sell-or-fairly-valued","We’ll be watching growth in Azure and commercial bookings Microsoft MSFT is set to release its fiscal second-quarter earnings report on Jan 30 after the close of trading Here’s Morningstar’s take on Microsoft’s earnings and our outlook for its stock With its 3-star rating we believe Microsoft’s stock is fairly valued compared with our long-term fair value estimate of $370 per share which implies a fiscal 2024 enterprise value/sales multiple of 11 times adjusted P/E multiple of 34 times and a 1% free cash flow yield We model a five-year compound annual growth rate for revenue of approximately 12% inclusive of the Activision acquisition We envision stronger revenue growth ahead as Microsoft’s prior decade was bogged down by the downturn in 2008 the complete evaporation of mobile handset revenue from the disposal of the Nokia handset business and the model transition to subscriptions (which initially resulted in slower revenue growth) However we believe macro and currency factors will pressure revenue in the near term We believe revenue growth will be driven by Azure Office 365 Dynamics 365 LinkedIn and emerging AI adoption Azure is the single most critical revenue driver over the next 10 years in our view as hybrid environments (where Microsoft excels) drive mass cloud adoption We believe the combination of Azure DBMS Dynamics 365 and Office 365 will drive above-market growth as CIOs continue to consolidate vendors We believe More Personal Computing will grow modestly above GDP over the next 10 years Read more about Microsoft’s fair value estimate We assign Microsoft overall a wide moat based on its switching costs network effects and cost advantages We believe the firm is a leader across a variety of key technology areas which should result in economic returns well in excess of its cost of capital for years to come We believe Microsoft’s different segments and products benefit from different moat sources High switching costs and cost advantages drive a wide moat for Azure which is clearly the growth engine for the Intelligent Cloud segment and one of the critical products the “new” Microsoft will be built around Read more about Microsoft’s moat rating Microsoft faces risks that vary among its products and segments High market share in the client-server architecture over the last 30 years means significant high-margin revenue is at risk particularly in OS Office and Server Microsoft has thus far been successful in growing revenues in a constantly evolving technology landscape and it is enjoying success in both moving existing workloads to the cloud for current customers and attracting new clients directly to Azure However the firm must continue to drive revenue growth of cloud-based products faster than revenue declines in on-premises products While we do not see significant ESG risks we note that Microsoft faces strong competition for software engineers on the hiring front and it also faces risks arising from a potential data

121,"Why upcoming tech earnings may be parabolic for the market","1/23/2024","https://finance.yahoo.com/video/why-upcoming-tech-earnings-may-172129783.html","Nvidia (NVDA) and Microsoft (MSFT) saw their stock prices jump thanks to their big push to invest and make advancements in AI Thanks to that outsized growth there is a potential that they will continue to maintain their dominance on the S&P 500 (^GSPC) As they hold their dominance the outcome of their earnings can have major sway over the broader market Ken Mahoney CEO of Mahoney Asset Management joins Yahoo Finance to discuss upcoming earnings from major tech companies and how they could have a sizable impact on the broader market that investors would not want to miss out on When it comes to expectations for the outcome of potential tech earnings Mahoney affirms : There could be a little sell on the news reaction but I think the guidance is going to be key The law of big numbers is incredible I mean Nvidia as an example last 12 months has doubled topline revenue expected to double topline revenue in 24 and 25 and the CEO of Nvidia said Hey were in the second third inning I hear this all the time Ken I missed it I missed it Well the CEO who is really at the epicenter of all this is telling you that were probably in the second or third inning You might not want to stay around until the ninth or extra innings but theres a pretty long runway to make some money akin to what we saw in the mid 1990s For more expert insight and the latest market action click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live Editors note: This article was written by Nicholas Jacobino RACHELLE AKUFFO: The AI-fueled surge in tech shares though pulling stocks out of their lackluster start to 2024 The S&P 500 and Dow notching another record-high close on Monday that was thanks to Wall Streets optimism for potential rate cuts an upbeat read on consumer sentiment and the AI euphoria continuing to power stocks to new record highs With tech earnings on the horizon our next guest sees earnings from the likes of NVIDIA and Microsoft pushing markets into a parabolic mode Lets bring him in Ken Mahoney Mahoney Asset Management CEO So Ken talk about this parabolic rise and as well as the risks that the tech sector could face that might upend some of this market euphoria KEN MAHONEY: I love the word parabolic I think my high school teacher would be very proud of me that Ive actually still used it I dont know how many years later 40 years later But again theres a lot of reason why they have a strong tailwind you know NVIDIA Microsoft and so forth But first off one thing that doesnt get mentioned a lot in the media I believe is a weaker dollar right? So inflation has come down interest rates have come down and a weaker dollar really helps out earnings from multinationals And I think the analysts on these companies have sniffed that out When you look at NVIDIA by the way even the last couple of weeks we saw Taiwan Semiconductor their largest contract manufacturer in the world for chips they own about 55% dominant They are smoking over there Theyre doing really well Zuckerberg and Meta basically last week say 350000 new chip orders coming in about $9 billion in capital expenditure So this is not like oh OK this is AI is something around a concept and isnt that pretty? Its resulting in real earnings And those companies like NVIDIA theyre in all the growth areas autonomous cars and so forth gaming And you go to Microsoft you get all the verticals and you get AI So you have cloud you have gaming you have Microsoft Windows and all that And then on top of that you get AI So I think theres a really strong reason why there is such a strong tailwind for the leadership especially these companies that already have strong foundational businesses and then add that to a creatively AI and all the different revenue sources and streams that could come from that AKIKO FUJITA: Ken how much of that upside in earnings has already been baked into the stock price though? We were saying yesterday if you look at the financials that kick things off last week they didnt necessarily get rewarded in a big way for any kind of beat Do you see things playing out differently for tech? KEN MAHONEY: I do You know we look at the banks I have to tell you first of all were growth managers So we wouldnt find ourselves in banks JP Morgan the best bank and best managed bank basically a lot of their earnings is interest income I mean thats not really exciting you know You want to hear about loan demand growing or some other parts of the business But I mean interest income was a big chunk of their earnings so thats not really good I think NVIDIA and Microsoft you know there could be a little sell-on news reaction but I think the guidance is going to be key I mean the law of big numbers is incredible I mean NVIDIA as an example last 12 months of double top line revenue expected to double top line revenue into 24 and 25 And the CEO of NVIDIA said hey were in a second or third inning Because I hear this all the time Ken I feel like we missed it I missed it I missed it Well the CEO you know whos really at the epicenter of all this is telling you that were probably in the second or third inning Yeah you might want to not want to stay around to the ninth inning or extra innings but certainly theres a pretty long runway to make some money akin to what we saw in the mid 1990s RACHELLE AKUFFO: So Ken if this is going to be a parabolic ride then how do you know when to get off versus getting thrown off as you mentioned there when it does get to that ninth inning point? KEN MAHONEY: Got you Hey Ken thrown off those wagons right? So look to avoid around trip lets say Im making this up Lets say you bought NVIDIA $400 and now its up to $600 Theres nothing wrong with taking 25% off the table 30% off the table Incrementally be smart because god forbid it comes back to $400 and you break even Thats what they call a round trip We dont want to invest in this round trip So theres nothing wrong with taking some piece off the table But the temptation is to sell and take these short profits I think these are longer-term winners especially if were in the second or third inning AKIKO FUJITA: Ken you mentioned NVIDIA as well as Microsoft I mean you could argue those are the stocks that have benefited the most on the back of this exuberance around AI What about some other names youre watching? If you look at the chip makers for example AMD as well as Intel I mean theyre really starting to push out their AI offerings as well Is that maybe a better value just given the run up that we have seen in a name like NVIDIA? KEN MAHONEY: Yeah AMD is hard I mean it was late October the spooky time when the Feds going to keep rates for longer and the market was selling off And AMD was $100 a share and you know kissed $174 a share just a couple of days ago So I dont necessarily see value in that But you can look at Google and Amazon I think Google is up about 5% year to date Amazons about 35% year to date Again NVIDIA is up 20% 25% AMD is about 25% So if youre looking and say hey I dont want to jump on that momentum train that parabolic move which you could fall off the wagon here and there Google and Amazon both have great opportunities in AI for the work they do especially Amazon with the cloud and Google what theyre doing So if you feel like you miss those names I think your next bet would be Google and Amazon RACHELLE AKUFFO: And what about small caps Ken? Any opportunities you see there because they did have their moment They seem to taper off towards the end of last year What are your expectations this year? KEN MAHONEY: Yeah I guess Im a contrarian with that I dont see that And I know they had a good run yesterday a good close which is nice I think this market still wants to liquid stocks big companies that are consistent They tend to beat estimates They raise guidance Were getting a lot of foreign investment You know multinationals are investing into our markets They tend to want to be in liquid names not small cap I think again if youre a really good stock picker maybe you could pick that out But as an overall index I still think the Magnificent Seven-- by the way minus Tesla Magnificent Six-- I would say are still the way to go Theyre going to be consistent for you There really shouldnt be too many surprises In the small cap space unfortunately especially around earnings season theres always a lot of surprises And some of those surprises are to the downside AKIKO FUJITA: Ken Mahoney Mahoney Asset Management CEO good to talk to you today Appreciate the time KEN MAHONEY: Right me as well Thank you Related Quotes"

126,"Phil Spencer sends an email to Microsoft employees informing them of a new round of layoffs","1/28/2024","https://www.gizchina.com/2024/01/28/microsoft-layoffs-gaming-department/","In an email to employees Phil Spencer recently informed Microsoft employees of a new round of layoffs This layoff mainly affects the gaming department Spencer said in the message that the company will have to let go of about 1900 people Players and industry insiders expressed dissatisfaction with Microsoft’s senior management Phil Spencer promised that the laid-off workers would get severance compensation and transition support However the email does not provide any information or details about the severance compensation and transition support Xbox head Phil Spencer explained the layoff decision in an internal email saying it was to “establish a sustainable cost structure” He thanked the laid-off employees for their contributions and promised to provide severance compensation and transition support However players obviously couldn’t accept this explanation and the Internet was filled with angry accusations against Spencer “Its been a little over three months since the Activision Blizzard and King teams joined Microsoft As we move forward in 2023 the leadership of Microsoft Gaming and Activision Blizzard is committed to aligning on a strategy and an execution plan with a sustainable cost structure that will support the whole of our growing business Together we’ve set priorities identified areas of overlap and ensured that we’re all aligned on the best opportunities for growth As part of this process we have made the painful decision to reduce the size of our gaming workforce by approximately 1900 out of the 22000 people on our team The Gaming Leadership Team and I are committed to navigating this process as thoughtfully as possible The people who are directly impacted by these reductions have all played an important part in the success of Activision ZeniMax and the Xbox teams and they should be proud of everything they’ve accomplished here We are grateful for all of the creativity passion and dedication they have brought to our games our players and our colleagues We will provide our full support to those who are impacted during the transition including severance benefits informed by local employment laws Those whose roles will be impacted will be notified and we ask that you please treat your departing colleagues with the respect and compassion that is consistent with our values Looking ahead we’ll continue to invest in areas that will grow our business and support our strategy of bringing more games to more players around the world Although this is a difficult moment for our team I’m as confident as ever in your ability to create and nurture the games stories and worlds that bring players together Phil” It is worth noting that this layoff occurred less than half a year after Microsoft spent $70 billion to acquire Activision Blizzard This is also happening at a time when Microsoft hit a market value of more than $3 trillion This has led many to question why Microsoft which has so much money is still laying off employees In addition to layoffs CNBC reports that Blizzard Entertainment President Mike Ybarra also announced his resignation Also an unnamed survival game Blizzard was developing was cancelled Microsoft has a long history of layoffs whose recent history dates back to 2009 The company’s layoff history reflects a series of significant workforce reductions over the years with the largest being in 2014 when the company announced plans to lay off 18000 employees amounting to a 14% reduction of its workforce at the time This marked the largest-ever layoff in Microsoft’s history including 12500 professional and factory personnel Previously in 2009 Microsoft eliminated 5800 jobs in line with the Great Recession of 2008-2017 In July 2014 Microsoft announced a second wave of layoffs totalling 2100 employees including 747 in the Seattle-Redmond area This brought the total number of layoffs to over 15000 out of the 18000 expected cuts In October 2014 Microsoft revealed that it was almost done with the elimination of 18000 employees In July 2015 Microsoft announced another 7800 job cuts in the next several months By May 2016 the company announced it was laying off 1850 workers More recently Microsoft announced plans to cut 10000 jobs which represents about 5% of its workforce of over 220000 employees This is the second-largest workforce reduction in Microsoft’s history The company cited a need to “align our cost structure with our revenue and where we see customer demand” Microsoft’s layoffs have been a topic of discussion and concern among employees and the tech industry In July 2023 Microsoft laid off over 200 employees in a fresh round of layoffs with an impacted employee sharing his story on LinkedIn emphasizing that layoffs have nothing to do with a person’s capabilities These layoffs reflect the broader trend of tech companies cutting jobs in response to changing market conditions and economic pressures Despite improving fundamentals technology companies have continued to lay off staff in 2024 Forbes believes that the layoffs could be a result of redundancies after the acquisition of Activision Blizzard The recent layoffs by Microsoft’s game department affecting 1900 employees have stirred criticism within the gaming community Despite Xbox head Phil Spencer’s explanation of the decision to establish a sustainable cost structure players and industry insiders remain dissatisfied The timing of the layoffs came shortly after Microsoft acquired Activision Blizzard for $70 billion Microsoft’s soaring market value has also raised questions about the company’s priorities and treatment of employees The outpouring of frustration and disappointment on social media reflects a deep concern within the gaming community about the human cost of corporate decisions in the industry

member and enjoy the very best from The American Conservative in print & digital Wicresoft started in 2002 by Microsoft and the Shanghai Municipal Government conducts business with at least three companies sanctioned by the US government over national security concerns and human rights violations Tech giant Microsoft owns nearly a quarter of a China-based company whose clients and partners include companies sanctioned by the United States government As of late 2023 Microsoft owned 22 percent of Shanghai Wicresoft Co Ltd (Wicresoft for short) a technology services and software company that began in 2002 as a joint venture between the US-based tech giant and the Shanghai Alliance Investment Co the venture capital arm of the Shanghai Municipal Government To get Wicresoft off the ground Microsoft invested $4 million in exchange for 50 percent ownership of the joint venture and pledged to become the China-based company’s first client according to a 2002 report from the Wall Street Journal Since then Wicresoft’s clientele has grown At least three of these clients however are sanctioned by the United States due to national security concerns and the companies’ alleged involvement in human rights violations against Uyghurs and other minorities in the Xinjiang province One of these Wicresoft clients is SenseTime Group Ltd or SenseTime a Hong Kong-based company that is “incorporated in the Cayman Islands with limited liability” per the company’s financial reports SenseTime’s website claims it is “a “leading AI software company focused on creating a better AI-empowered future through innovation” Since 2018 Wicresoft has been a supplier and contractor for SenseTime A job posting from Wicresoft in December 2023 for a position related to image and video data annotation claims that Wicresoft has more than 300 consultants embedded at SenseTime working on a wide range of projects “from early-stage research and development to late-stage implementation” In an article published by 51CTO in December 2022 covering the International Digital Services Conference in Shanghai claimed Wicresoft “has accumulated product technology and industry experience through extensive cooperation with SenseTime Technology laying a solid foundation for artificial intelligence applications in product development and industry integration” SenseTime Group Ltd appears on the US Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control’s (OFAC) sanctions list with a CMIC designation which stands for “Chinese Military-Industrial Complex Companies” The Non-SDN Chinese Military Industrial Complex (CMIC) list began under the Trump administration with Executive Order 13959 in November of 2020 The Trump administration used the 1999 National Defense Authorization Act’s Communist Chinese Military Companies (CCMC) list to create the new sanctions program that prohibits Americans from purchasing or selling publicly traded securities of persons or entities that were involved in the “military intelligence and other security apparatuses” of the Chinese government Nevertheless a CMIC listing does not prohibit transactions that do not involve the exchange of publicly traded securities The Biden administration has amended the Trump-era CMIC sanctions regime but has kept most of the program in place In June 2021 President Joe Biden issued Executive Order 14032 which placed the CMIC under the authority of the Treasury Department and expanded the government’s authority to list entities that “facilitate repression or serious human rights abuse” As of last spring the Center for a New American Security claimed that 68 entities are on the CMIC list CMIC sanctions “are sanctions intended to prevent US companies particularly technology companies from assisting wittingly or unwittingly the development of advanced Chinese weapons systems” explained former Trump administration Treasury and Commerce official Adam Korzeniewski in an email to The American Conservative “Penalties typically involve fines but can include criminal investigations and seizures” The reason for the US sanctions regime against China? “China develops weapon systems meant to counter US capabilities are willing to supply weapons to adversaries and regularly conducts espionage against the US” Korzeniewski wrote OFAC’s records show SenseTime was listed on December 10 2021 It described SenseTime as a “Chinese Military-Industrial Complex Company” that “operated in the surveillance technology sector of the PRC’s economy” and “developed facial recognition programs that can determine a target’s ethnicity with a particular focus on identifying ethnic Uyghurs When applying for patent applications Shenzhen SenseTime Technology Co Ltd has highlighted its ability to identify Uyghurs wearing beards sunglasses and masks” A SenseTime subsidiary Beijing SenseTime Technology Development Co is also on the United States Department of Commerces Bureau of Industry and Security’s (BIS) Entity List “The Entity List” Korzeniewski wrote “lists specific foreign persons—which definition can include persons companies organizations associations etc—that require special license for export import and/or transfer specifies what kind of licensure and the conditions for that business” Not only does this business activity require US government approval but the government also restricts what is done with goods and services with US origin down the line SenseTime Group Ltd reports indicate that Beijing SenseTime Technology Development Co is indeed one of its mainland-based subsidiaries and discusses how Beijing SenseTime Technology Development Co receives preferential corporate tax treatment from the Chinese government A BIS rule posted in the Federal Register in October of 2019 claims that Beijing SenseTime Technology Development Co is “implicated in human rights violations and abuses in the implementation of Chinas campaign of repression mass arbitrary detention and high-technology surveillance against Uyghurs Kazakhs and other members of Muslim minority groups” Cloudwalk Technology Co Ltd (Cloudwalk) is another Wicresoft client that has found itself sanctioned by the CMIC and Entity List CloudWalk was added to the CMIC list in December 2021 for its development of technology designed to surveil ethnic minorities including Tibetans and Uyghurs The Treasury Department said in a December 2021 release that CloudWalk and the other targeted companies “actively support the biometric surveillance and tracking of ethnic and religious minorities in China particularly the predominantly Muslim Uyghur minority in Xinjiang” “Cloudwalk has developed facial recognition software designed to track and surveil members of ethnic minority groups including Tibetans and Uyghurs and alert authorities if too many individuals gather in specific locations” the Treasury Department release continued In 2018 Cloudwalk entered into an agreement with the Zimbabwean government to install a mass surveillance network which included provisions that required the Zimbabwean government to transmit data back to Cloudwalk’s operations in China so that Cloudwalk might be able to “improve the ability of its facial recognition software to recognize individuals based on skin pigmentation” the Treasury department added The BIS added Cloudwalk to the Entity List in May of 2020 according to the Federal Register Cloudwalk and six other entities the BIS claimed are “enabling activities contrary to the foreign policy interests of the United States” The BIS also alleged that “these entities have been implicated in human rights violations and abuses in the implementation of Chinas campaign of repression mass arbitrary detention forced labor and high-technology surveillance against Uyghurs Kazakhs and other members of Muslim minority groups” just like SenseTime Though TAC could not determine the duration of the relationship Wicresoft Vice President Zhang Xiaohua at a Shanghai conference in 2020 boasted about Wicresoft’s relationship with Cloudwalk “[Wicresoft] is carrying out cutting-edge technology cooperation in various fields and directions with high-tech giants and unicorn companies such as Microsoft Baidu SenseTime and CloudWalk” a Google-translated report from China Daily paraphrasing Zhang’s remarks read Another Wicresoft partner a Chinese-government-backed voice recognition and AI developer iFlyTek found itself on the BIS’s Entity List in October 2019 for its alleged participation in the oppression of the Uyghurs Zhang according to China Daily boasted of Wicresoft’s relationship in 2020 “Wicresoft has attracted and trained a large number of technical talents and business experts and has incubated an AI intelligent voice laboratory which has become a highly valuable business for high-tech companies such as Tencent Alibaba AutoNavi Intel iFlytek etc Consulting and technical services partner” the Google-translated report claims While Zhang highlighted Wicresoft’s business with several sanctioned entities at the Shanghai conference in 2020 he boasted most of all about the company’s relationship to Microsoft “Zhang Xiaohua said that Wicresoft and Microsoft have cooperated for nearly 20 years” the Google-translated report from China Daily claims “Wicresoft services have penetrated into the R&D and operation of Microsofts full line of technology and software products” “At the same time it has fully participated in the industrial design and R&D of high-tech intelligent hardware in the Microsoft Asia Hardware Center” China Daily continued and has “fully participated in the establishment and management of the Shanghai laboratory one of Microsofts three AI&IOT laboratories in the world” While the summary of the sanctions regimes above show Microsoft is not in violation of these sanctions by holding a substantial stake in Wicresoft the proposition that Microsoft can own create invest in partner with and ultimately profit from a company that provides Microsoft-like services to sanctioned actors which in certain cases would require Microsoft to get the approval of the US government to do business with seems quite the racket Microsoft Korzeniewski claimed is acting against the spirit of the sanctions regime Roger Robinson the former Chairman of the Congressional US-China Economic and Security Review Commission told TAC “there appears to be no question that Microsoft has deliberately averted its eyes from US-sanctioned corporate human rights abusers that Wicresoft regards as valued ‘clients’ among them SenseTime IflyTek and CloudWalk” Companies often avoid sanctions Korzeniewski explained by sometimes “using neutral third-party entities in states allied or friendly with the US and the sanctioned foreign person(s)” “Before mass globalization of financial services in the contemporary sense“ Korzeniewski continued “US persons would use front companies or other illicit means like US persons who helped Soviet industry in the 1920s“ “Sanctions work with enforcement“ Korzeniewski argued “However these sanctions also increase the cost of efforts to evade or find work arounds for all the parties in general Sanctions primarily affect the behavior of US persons and allied states obeying such sanctions“ To make sanctions more effective Korzeniewski told TAC that “sanctions must be continuously reevaluated for adherence and effectiveness The US can expand sanctions so that current work arounds no longer are acceptable“ “Make no mistake continuing this calloused disregard for these and perhaps other Chinese corporate human rights offenders implicates Microsoft’s brand and corporate reputation” Robinson continued “It would do well to shed its investment in Wicresoft forthwith” Bradley Devlin is the political editor for The American Conservative Previously he was an Analysis Reporter for the Daily Caller and has been

Magnificent Seven Stocks Get Tested","1/3/2024","https://www.investors.com/research/breakout-stocks-technical-analysis/magnificent-seven-stocks-nvda-stock-msft-amzn-and-more-get-tested-3-ways-to-monitor-results/","BREAKING: Futures Mixed Fueled by the artificial intelligence boom Magnificent Seven stocks like Nvidia (NVDA) Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazoncom (AMZN) were the deserved darlings of Wall Street in 2023 But the first two trading sessions of 2024 have already brought new challenges for megacaps MSFT AMZN and NVDA stock In the first trading session of the year the Nasdaq stumbled dropping 16% to test its 21-day exponential moving average Mirroring that action Nvidia Microsoft Amazon and a host of others on the IBD Breakout Stocks Index also retreated to gauge support or resistance at that line On Day 2 of the new year those challenges continue as the Nasdaq pulled back over 1% again Wednesday Other bellwether tech stocks on this screen facing or failing tests at that benchmark include Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Shopify (SHOP) Workday (WDAY) Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR) ASML (ASML) and NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) Video streamer Netflix (NFLX) also headed downstream Tuesday slipping below its 21-day benchmark Netflix stock closed well above its 50-day moving average On Wednesday NFLX stock came off the days lows but still closed belowits 21-day line While one or two days does not a trend make Amazon Nvidia and other names on the IBD Breakout Stocks Index have struggled to hold support around that mark For NFLX AMZN MSFT NVDA and others the 50-day benchmark may soon serve as the second line of defense in early 2024 See Who Joins NVDA Stock On The IBD Breakout Stocks Index Weve already touched on one crucial measure to watch: behavior around key moving averages like the 21- and 50-day lines How tech leaders like Nvidia Shopify and Microsoft as well stocks from other sectors trade around those benchmarks will provide early signs of strength or weakness On Day 2 of trading in 2024 Nvidia stock again slipped On the bright side volume came in below average and lower than in the prior session A second vital factor to monitor is volume Tracking price and volume together remains the best — arguably the only — way to take a true measure of demand or lack thereof If NVDA stock or any other wavers or falls monitor both daily and weekly volume trends Is volume heavy or light on the downside? Dips and fluctuations are normal But sharp declines below key moving averages in unusually heavy volume signal a potential change in trend for the worse On the flip side if Nvidia Shopify Microsoft or others rise but volume remains well below average that can point to hesitation or a lack of institutional demand for a continued climb Finally keep tabs on a stocks relative strength line Is the RS line rising moving sideways or heading south? A rising relative strength line shows market leadership as compared with the S&P 500 which represents a wide swath of the market All three factors come into play when evaluating Microsoft Amazon Shopify Nvidia and others Currently NVDA stock provides a good example The AI and automation giant has formed an early-stage flat base with a 50558 buy point The stock now trades below its 21-day line but above its 50-day moving average The relative strength line moved sideways last month and has edged downward so far in the new year See if that can perk up when a potential breakout nears Also keep an eye on trading volume as NVDA stock closes in on the new buy point On the day of any breakout attempt look for volume at least 40% higher than normal to show conviction for the move As you watch Nvidia Microsoft Amazon Shopify and other names on the IBD Breakout Stocks Index analyze each against those same three factors And be sure to view individual stocks within the context of how the market indexes are faring The IBD Breakout Opportunities ETF (BOUT) from Innovator Capital Management tracks the IBD Breakout Stocks Index As with other index ETFs this fund allows you to invest in the entire index in addition to or rather than buying individual stocks Learn more here about the ETF and Innovator Follow Matthew Galgani on X (formerly Twitter) at @IBD_MGalgani YOU MAY ALSO LIKE: Magnificent Seven Stocks In 2024: Ready To Rock On — Or Roll Over?

Apples up 45000% Microsoft up 1200% I think a lot of investors would take that But essentially if you had to buy 2008 to 2010 to reach any comparable number with Apple and if you got in between 2000 and 2008 that was dead money That was a losing trade And thats because in the wake of the tech bubble and also the antitrust suit that Microsoft was facing 20 years ago it just became dead money for about a decade Let me now show you the story in terms of sales growth This is Apple sales growth going back into the late 90s This is when Steve Jobs took over And lets not forget Apple was left for dead almost went bankrupt How about that? But this incredible years-- these years of sales growth here a lot of them topping 75% Thats the iPod And then thats the iPhone And you can see things have trailed off The services side of the equation has gotten a lot of play here but it doesnt always live up to expectations Right now four quarters of declining revenue growth That is a negative situation for Apple Expectations are for that to be broken But well have to see how this plays out in earnings season Give it another month RACHELLE AKUFFO: Looking forward to that Our very own Jared Blikre Thank you so much Related Quotes"

Microsoft has a solid growth driver in the form of artificial intelligence (AI) pushing it higher Microsoft stock did see a dip in its stock price following the release of the companys fiscal 2024 second-quarter results on Jan 30 It seems investors had some concern about an increase in its operating expenses What those investors seemed to ignore however is that Microsofts fiscal Q2 revenue jump was the fastest since 2022 Lets take a closer look at the factors that have led to an acceleration in Microsofts growth and check how much upside this Magnificent Seven stock could deliver over the next three years Microsofts fiscal Q2 revenue (for the three months ended Dec 31 2023) was up 18% year over year to $62 billion The companys non-GAAP net income increased at a faster pace of 33% from the prior-year period to $293 per share The numbers were well ahead of consensus expectations of $277 per share in earnings on revenue of $611 billion Microsofts cloud business played a key role in powering its growth last quarter The companys Intelligent Cloud business segment which includes revenue from the Azure cloud platform increased 20% year over year to $259 billion Whats more Microsofts Azure cloud revenue increased an impressive 30% year over year exceeding the 277% increase that Wall Street was looking for Microsoft management pointed out on the latest earnings conference call that AI services accelerated Azures growth by 6 percentage points last quarter That was an improvement over the 3 percentage point increase seen in the first quarter of the fiscal year and Microsoft claims that the integration of AI-focused services into its cloud offerings is helping it gain market share CEO Satya Nadella said on the earnings call: We now have 53000 Azure AI customers Over one-third are new to Azure over the past 12 months He pointed out that the Azure platform gives customers access to a wide range of large language models (LLMs) and small language models (SLMs) which they can use to run AI training and inference applications with the help of accelerators from Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices As a result multiple corporations are lining up to use Microsofts Azure OpenAI service and the company is witnessing larger and more strategic Azure deals with an increase in the number of billion-dollar-plus Azure commitments This explains why Microsofts cloud business grew at a faster pace when compared to rivals Alphabets Google Cloud for instance saw a 26% year-over-year increase in revenue last quarter Amazon Web Services on the other hand saw a 13% year-over-year jump in revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023 This makes it clear that Microsoft is indeed gaining share in the lucrative cloud computing market Mordor Intelligence estimates that the size of the AI-based cloud computing market could grow from $67 billion in 2024 to $275 billion in 2029 at a compound annual rate of 32% So Microsofts growing share of the cloud computing market should allow it to capitalize on this huge opportunity and boost its growth Analysts anticipate Microsoft will finish the current fiscal year with $244 billion in revenue an increase of 15% over the previous year That points toward a nice acceleration over the 7% revenue growth Microsoft delivered in fiscal 2023 More importantly Microsoft is expected to sustain its healthy growth rate over the next couple of years as well MSFT Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year data by YCharts If Microsofts revenue indeed jumps to $319 billion at the end of fiscal 2026 and it maintains its current price-to-sales ratio of 135 at that time its market cap could jump to just over $43 trillion That points toward a 43% jump within the next three years However Microsoft could deliver stronger growth if it continues to capture a bigger share of the cloud computing market thanks to AI which is why investors can still buy this AI stock even after the impressive returns it has clocked in the past year Suzanne Frey an executive at Alphabet is a member of The Motley Fools board of directors John Mackey former CEO of Whole Foods Market an Amazon subsidiary is a member of The Motley Fools board of directors Harsh Chauhan has no position in any of the stocks mentioned The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Advanced Micro Devices Alphabet Amazon Microsoft and Nvidia The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy Invest better with The Motley Fool Get stock recommendations portfolio guidance and more from The Motley Fools premium services Making the world smarter happier and richer © 1995 - 2024 The Motley Fool All rights reserved Market data powered by Xignite and Polygonio"

141,"Microsoft Stock Forecast 2040 2050: How High Can MSFT Go?","2/16/2024","https://coincodex.com/article/25689/microsoft-stock-forecast-2040-2050/","Microsoft is the world’s largest company by market capitalization with an outsized presence in multiple sectors including cloud computing gaming productivity software and lately artificial intelligence Microsoft’s broad array of products and services as well as the recent stock price increase begs the question of how high MSFT could reach in the future According to different growth models Microsoft stock is forecasted to surpass $1000 by 2040 and potentially reach five digits by 2050 In this article we are going to examine Microsoft stock forecasts for the medium and long term accounting for the historical growth of important market indices and MSFT’s own historical performance But first here’s an overview of Microsoft stock’s price growth under various relevant growth scenarios *The values in the table were calculated using MSFT’s price of $40639 (as of February 16th) **S&P 500 has averaged 1113% CAGR since 1973 QTEC 152% over the last 15 years and MSFT 932% over the last 25 years Buy Microsoft Stock Your capital is at risk When the company first started trading in 1986 Microsoft (MSFT) stock price was about 10 cents per share (accounting for several stock splits over the years) Now more than 35 years later MSFT is trading at $406 over +406000% above its original price Meanwhile Microsoft’s market cap sits at $302 trillion Interestingly MSFT price first reached $50 in 2000 but it would take more than 15 years before the stock revisited that price point in 2016 After that Microsoft stock became a hot commodity and the price exploded reaching an all-time high of $382 in November 2023 At the time of writing Microsoft accounts for 69% of the entire weight of the S&P 500 an index measuring the value of the 500 largest US companies trading on the stock market For context the combined value of companies indexed by the S&P 500 is $4004 trillion According to our Microsoft stock price prediction algorithm MSFT’s price will face significant volatility in the next 12 months The price is projected to decrease below $300 in the next six months and proceed to correct upwards eventually establishing support around the $290 mark MSFT stock is forecasted to conclude 2024 with mostly bullish price action and reach a new all-time high above $440 in early 2025 Microsoft stock price could hit $511 in 2025 and reach the quadruple-digit territory in 2028 increasing by over +151% and hitting $1020 Our Microsoft stock forecasts for 2025 through 2030 are based on the average yearly growth of Microsoft stock in the last 10 years While this kind of analysis does have its drawbacks it still provides valuable insight into how the stock might act in the future particularly if the trends that have been present over the last 10 years persist going forward Microsoft stock’s price increased from roughly $27 at the start of 1999 to $291 more than two decades later – that means that MSFT’s annualized return over the trailing 25-year period has been 107% Going by its historical growth to calculate long-term profits Microsofts stock price could increase to $2443 by 2040 Interestingly Microsoft’s CAGR of 932% comes very close to the long-term average of the S&P 500 Index which has on average gained +1113% every year since 1973 Although the S&P 500 can be a helpful gauge of a large-cap companys performance over a lengthy period it evaluates businesses across various industries ranging from finance to healthcare Hence it may not be the most appropriate indicator for forecasting the expansion of a technology company Given that Microsoft primarily operates in the tech industry it is more fitting to rely on a tech-focused index fund like the NASDAQ-100-Technology Sector Index Fund (QTEC) to anticipate the future growth of one of the largest technology firms Over the last 15 years QTEC has been growing at a 152% CAGR If we use QTEC’s historical growth to project Microsft’s future growth the price of MSFT would increase to $4504 in 2040 Using Microsoft’s historical stock price performance as the basis for the long-term MSFT stock price prediction Microsoft shares could reach $7021 by 2050 Accounting for such a stock price the market cap of Microsoft would grow beyond $45 trillion which is over 15 times higher than it is today While this seems extremely unlikely at first glance there are indications that the global economy could expand sufficiently to support such market capitalizations in the future For context the global gross domestic product (GDP) grew from 12 trillion in 1985 to $101 trillion in 2022 a 742% increase in 27 years If that same GDP growth were to persist in the next 26 years the global GDP would reach $850 trillion Buy Microsoft Stock Your capital is at risk Stock price forecasts for MSFT are notably bullish – there are several credible growth scenarios that put the price target for MSFT into quadruple digits Given Microsoft’s encouraging business results in the past couple of years and its massive investment in AI (that is already paying off with the success of OpenAI’s ChatGPT) we can easily see why the company’s stock surpassing $1000 is not out of the question For more long-term stock price analyses you can check how much

142,"15 Worst Countries to Live in as an Expat","2/19/2024","https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-worst-countries-live-expat-112525059.html","In this article we will take a look at 15 Worst Countries to Live in as an Expat You can skip our detailed analysis and go directly to the 5 Worst Countries to Live in as an Expat In the life-changing decision of packing your bags and moving to a new destination multifarious variables need to be analyzed thoroughly Migration has been extensive over the past years-- 281 million people were estimated to be living outside their country of origin in 2020 While the drive behind migration could be influenced by multiple forces the basic intention is to experience a prosperous and higher quality of life in a safe and secure environment with the least amount of trouble Therefore an immigration decision that lands one in the worst countries to live in could create many problems An analysis of international migrant data reveals that the majority live in countries that can ensure higher opportunities for individuals and families In 2020 65% of migrants resided in high-income countries 31% in middle-income and 4% in low-income countries It was also observed that the primary reasons for international migration to high-income countries were labor family reunification and education Global data also indicates that Europe was the leading destination for expatriates in 2020 (87 million) followed by North America (59 million) and North Africa and Western Asia (approximately 50 million) The United States emerged as the country hosting the largest number of international migrants-- 51 million migrants in 2020 With such large numbers of people flowing in and out of countries immigrant integration has become an international agenda In fact first-time migration has been incorporated into the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Thus while countries worldwide are ensuring expat integration certain country-specific conditions determine the success or failure of this endeavor There are some countries that are ideal for relocation (check our article 20 Best Countries to Relocate to for more details) and others that are not such a great fit Expats evaluate their new destination based on various factors including but not limited to the quality of life (encompassing safety and security) healthcare and education facilities ease of settling in employment opportunities personal financial conditions housing language and bureaucracy Therefore countries that are unable to perform well in these indicators may develop a reputation as the worst choice for expats to live in For ages the United States has been a magnet for expats seeking better work opportunities Renowned tech companies like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) Google-- Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG) Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Meta (NASDAQ: META) among others have attracted foreign talent in large numbers However due to the country’s grueling immigration policies and high cost of living much of this talent is frustrated Furthermore substantial layoffs by the tech industry in the recent past have further fueled the fire and even provided an opportunity for other countries to accommodate such a labor force Canada for example has launched its own work permit program to attract these individuals Tech companies including Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) Google (NASDAQ: GOOG) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) continue to lay off employees despite better performance Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) laid off 1900 employees in their gaming division whereas Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) continuing their spree of layoffs cut down 180 more employees and shut down two gaming initiatives: Game Growth and Crown Channel Google (NASDAQ: GOOG) also confirmed laying off around a thousand employees Such working conditions and the rising cost of living due to inflation are causes of concern for expats Not only will this affect their quality of life but it will also foster dissatisfaction related to employment To determine the 15 worst countries to live in as an expat we relied on data from two different expat indexes: Expat Insider 2023 and Worldwide Expat Index 2023 by William Russell Expat Insider ranks countries on five essential indexes for choosing a country for relocation: quality of life index ease of settling index working abroad index personal finance index and expat essentials index On the other hand Worldwide Expat Index uses four components: happiness health employment and quality of life By averaging these two index rankings we identified countries with an overall worse outlook for expats A higher average ranking indicates a relatively worse choice of a country In cases where the average ranking turned out to be the same we used the Human Development Index (UN 2021) as a tie-breaker The country with a lower HDI value was considered the worst By the way Insider Monkey is an

the best stock picks to buy you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders Let’s take a look at our list of 15 Worst Countries to Live in as an Expat Expat Insider Index Ranking: 41 Worldwide Expat Index Ranking: 23 Insider Monkey Average Ranking: 32 Both indexes present a picture where Denmark excels in the working/employment and quality of life sectors as well as other expat essentials like the adoption of technological advancements However the country performs slightly poorly in the health category scoring below 495 out of 10 Life has also been pointed out as expensive in this country especially in the housing department Of even greater importance is the difficulty that expats encounter in settling down in the country due to the inability to make friends with the locals and have a social life Therefore overall Denmark is one of the worst countries to live in as an expat Expat Insider Index Ranking: 30 Worldwide Expat Index Ranking: 36 Insider Monkey Average Ranking: 33 As a land of opportunity the US has much to offer expats ranking high on job and work growth possibilities in the country The happiness score on the Worldwide Expat Index for the happiness factor is also in favor of the country indicating a general satisfaction that people experience in the US Nevertheless the country performs quite poorly in the health section on both indexes and the overall quality of life index is also not very encouraging The cost of living is lamented as expensive by expats which includes amenities such as public transportation housing and rent Thus while the US does have some attractive benefits that attract expats caution must also be taken regarding various problems they might face Expat Insider Index Ranking: 15 Worldwide Expat Index Ranking: 53 Insider Monkey Average Ranking: 34 Brazil receives a very low ranking according to the Worldwide Expat Score consistently performing poorly on all four components of the index earning a score of only 308/10 According to the Expat Insider report Brazil’s quality of life leaves much to be desired particularly receiving a low ranking in the safety sector and showing little improvement in the health department Individuals seeking better work or career opportunities in Brazil would also be severely disappointed However the country turns out to be a haven for expats in terms of ease of settlement Expat Insider Index Ranking: 38 Worldwide Expat Index Ranking: 31 Insider Monkey Average Ranking: 345 As with other European countries Belgium ranks fairly high for expats moving abroad with the intention of furthering their careers or finding lucrative jobs However the quality of life and health facilities are not attractive selling points for this country Furthermore expats have also complained about problems with integration into society Overall Belgium emerges as one of the worst countries to live in as an expat Expat Insider Index Ranking: 32 Worldwide Expat Index Ranking: 40 Insider Monkey Average Ranking: 36 While Cyprus has much beautiful scenery to offer its expats a closer look is necessary at some essential elements before making a relocation decision Cyprus does not score very well on variables like happiness health and employment; therefore it fares even worse in overall quality of life Expats have also expressed dissatisfaction with their work culture and it is expected that people looking for jobs would face hurdles in securing them Thus given such scores Cyprus turns out to be a potentially worse country to live in as an expat Expat Insider Index Ranking: 13 Worldwide Expat Index Ranking: 59 Insider Monkey Average Ranking: 36 Indonesia was observed to perform quite poorly on both indexes particularly concerning the quality of life and healthcare facilities for expats While the possibility of good career and job prospects is not entirely ruled out they are also not very alluring However expats are unlikely to face significant social obstacles in settling down in the country and the cost of living is relatively low With a combined score from the two indexes Indonesia does not fare well earning the 10th position in our list of the worst countries to live in as an expat Expat Insider Index Ranking: 50 Worldwide Expat Index Ranking: 24 Insider Monkey Average Ranking: 37 South Korea has emerged as a challenging country for settling down Finding friends and maintaining a social life seems difficult and the country does not offer very good work prospects or much satisfaction with work culture Expats have also reported financial problems While the quality of life is not altogether bad especially concerning healthcare it is still not very high South Korea scores quite low on the happiness factor as well making it one of the worst countries for expats to relocate to Expat Insider Index Ranking: 46 Worldwide Expat Index Ranking: 33 Insider Monkey Average Ranking: 395 Portraying a poor quality of life Malta must be carefully considered before being chosen as a potential relocation country Expats express dissatisfaction with the housing situation and the financial scenario in the country The working culture job prospects and salaries are also not very attractive However Malta does not present too many issues for newcomers in blending in with society Expat Insider Index Ranking: 35 Worldwide Expat Index Ranking: 46 Insider Monkey Average Ranking: 405 For expats planning on moving to Poland the language barrier is a real problem that must be accounted for before making this decision This could also be the contributing factor in making Poland a tough country for finding friends and setting up a social life However working conditions are fair enough in the country and the quality of living as well as the cost of living is mediocre Expat Insider Index Ranking: 34 Worldwide Expat Index Ranking: 48 Insider Monkey Average Ranking: 41 Hungary ranks low on healthcare facilities and the overall quality of life is not very high Expats have reported trouble settling in the country and finding local friendly faces Language is one of the biggest problems faced by expats The low score on the working abroad index also does not bode well for future immigrants However most expats have given positive feedback regarding financial aspects including the cost of living and disposable income Nevertheless the overall score places the country on the list of worst countries to live in as an expat Click to continue reading and see our 5 Worst Countries to Live in as an Expat Suggested Articles: 35 Most

Trillion-Dollar AI Trade” The US govt just unlocked an $8 trillion market to move in a new direction See how it could unleash 6000% potential upside These BlackRock stocks are some of its best holdings Advertisement Source: Shutter_M / Shutterstock BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) stocks stand as a towering testament to market influence and financial prowess Leading the financial stage as the largest asset manager on a global scale BlackRock boasts a whopping $10 trillion in assets under management at the end of the fourth quarter (Q4) last year The financial behemoth serves various clients from institutional and corporate to individual investors by effectively managing equity fixed-income and balanced portfolios across multiple funds and investment vehicles Its massive influence stretches across global markets including equities fixed income ETFs and more positioning it as a pivotal player in the financial domain Furthermore BlackRock’s consistent ability to return capital to shareholders emphasizes its robust influence Drawing on insights from HedgeFollowcom BlackRock reported a 3-year cumulative return of 34% from its top 20 holdings (weighted) Moreover BlackRock stocks recently made headlines as the firm reported quarterly earnings of $966 per share outperforming analyst estimates of $884 This represents a notable earnings surprise of 93% underscoring BlackRock’s financial health and its knack for surpassing analyst expectations That said here are three stocks that are the cornerstones of BlackRock’s impressive portfolio Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) a titan among Warren Buffett’s favored stocks remains a cornerstone of BlackRock’s portfolio Despite a trimming of AAPL stock by Buffett during Q4 BlackRock’s steadfast investment is noteworthy Holding 104 billion shares of Apple with an additional 11 million acquired in Q4 BlackRock’s commitment is a testament to Apple’s lasting appeal That is particularly significant in light of Apple’s fiscal first-quarter (Q1) performance for 2024 which despite a 13% sales dip in China still surpassed analysts’ expectations for sales and revenue Moreover the company’s strategic pivot towards service expansion and its foray into the burgeoning cloud computing sector positions it for sustained growth Moreover Apple’s innovative stride into the virtual reality landscape with the Apple Vision Pro headset should be a long-term growth catalyst With OpenAI CEO Sam Altman lauding the Vision Pro as the “second most impressive” tech marvel since the iPhone Apple’s trajectory seems set for the stars The sale of upwards of 200000 Vision Pro headsets already is a testament to Apple’s brand value Jeff Bezos’ relentless pursuit for greater customer satisfaction has transformed an online bookstore into a trillion-dollar behemoth extending its reach beyond eCommerce Moreover BlackRock’s sizeable investment in Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) holding 6272 million shares and boosting its stake by 138 million in Q4 reflects confidence in its trajectory That investment strategy is vindicated by AMZN’s Q4 results where the company surpassed expectations with a 14% surge in net sales along with an 82% improvement in operating cash flow year-over-year (YOY) Additionally Amazon Web Services (AWS) and advertising continue to impress with AWS boasting a 13% growth to $24 billion in Q4 Furthermore the launch of Amazon Bedrock which efficiently integrates top AI models and Amazon CodeWhisperer enhancing coder efficiency should redefine its eCommerce and cloud services These advancements coupled with improved Alexa models for more natural user interactions cement Amazon’s position as a leader in retail innovation Microsoft’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) strategic investment in OpenAI has positioned the company as a leading AI stock increasing its allure among investors With its software and cloud operations flourishing MSFT has generated ample cash flow fueling multiple growth endeavors The growing demand for cloud services positions Microsoft for sustained long-term expansion due to its formidable AI and cloud computing capabilities Moreover BlackRock’s investment in Microsoft totaling 5389 million shares with an addition of 53 million in Q4 is a major stamp of approval in MSFT’s continued expansion and innovation Microsoft’s Q4 performance was exceptionally strong with the company reporting a GAAP EPS of $293 surpassing expectations by 16 cents and a revenue of $62 billion up 177% YOY exceeding forecasts by $890 million Notably Productivity and Business Processes sales reached $192 billion marking a 13% increase while the Intelligent Cloud segment saw a 20% increase to $259 billion These figures testify to Microsoft’s robust financial health and dynamic growth across multiple tech verticals On

Feb 4 2024 capping a decade of stunning growth as he pivoted the slow-moving software giant into a laser focus on cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AP Photo/Stephen Brashear File) Satya Nadella marks his tenth year as Microsoft CEO on Sunday capping a decade of stunning growth as he pivoted the slow-moving software giant into a laser focus on cloud computing and artificial intelligence Microsoft’s stock has soared by more than 1000% since Nadella took the helm in 2014 compared to the more gradual 185% growth of the broader S&P 500 Microsoft now has a market value of $3 trillion — more than any US publicly traded company including its longtime rival Apple “Nadella’s had the biggest transformation of a tech company potentially ever” said Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives “The only one that would rival it was (Steve) Jobs coming back to Apple and turning it around with the iPhone” Microsoft has created $28 trillion in shareholder wealth in the past decade meaning an investor who bought a $10000 stake in Microsoft at the time Nadella took over and did nothing with those shares would have a stake worth about $113000 now “Our industry does not respect tradition — it only respects innovation” Nadella told employees in an inaugural memo 10 years ago an opening salvo that hinted at bigger shifts to come Microsoft declined requests for an interview Now a hero to Wall Street some were at first skeptical that such transformation could come from an insider who’d already spent 22 years at the Redmond Washington company He’s only the third Microsoft CEO following Steve Ballmer who lasted for 14 years and Bill Gates who co-founded the company in 1975 and took it public in 1986 Big changes came quickly under Nadella He marshaled resources to build up the Azure cloud computing platform a shift in priorities from the company’s longtime reliance on its flagship Windows operating system and the royalties it gets for each PC sold with it And he largely put the brakes on Microsoft’s ill-fated attempts to play catch-up in the smartphone market marked by his predecessor Ballmer’s $73 billion acquisition of Nokia’s phone business But some of the biggest changes were in the company’s culture a shift away from Microsoft’s brash external reputation and internal bickering to a more collaborative approach that Nadella has modeled in his own collegial personality and engineer’s mindset “Microsoft is known for rallying the troops with competitive fire” Nadella said in his 2017 autobiography “The press loves that but it’s not me” Much of Nadella’s strength is how he stands out from the typical “very strong ego CEO” said Raimo Lenschow a stock analyst at Barclays who covers 36 tech companies Instead of making bold pronouncements Lenschow said Nadella takes a more measured approach to explaining “where he thinks the future is going” And “whether it’s the person making food in the cafeteria an engineer finance executive a customer he treats everyone in the same way with respect” said Ives It’s not just Wall Street analysts who think so A tiny startup from Zeeland Michigan running a booth at January’s CES gadget show in Las Vegas caught a glimpse of Nadella’s curiosity when he showed up shook founder Tim Murphy’s hand and asked for a demo The product Audio Radar visualizes the sounds in video games for deaf and hard of hearing players “He’s very down to earth” said Murphy who was there with a small crew including his teen son “I gave him the pitch played some games and he was like ‘It’s wonderful what you’re doing’ Honestly I can’t really remember too much of what he said because I was just kind of shocked” Nadella has long made the accessibility of technology a priority informed in part by his experience raising a son who was visually impaired quadriplegic and had cerebral palsy Zain Nadella died in 2022 What’s brought Microsoft to its latest heights is its emergence as an artificial intelligence leader setting the agenda on how AI tools could get used in work and society While Nadella has been emphasizing AI for most of his tenure its role was not guaranteed and happened after years of careful planning that led to a close partnership with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI (OpenAI pays The Associated Press an undisclosed fee to license its archive of news stories) “Historically if you’re a cool startup that was doing something amazing Microsoft wasn’t really your first choice” Lenschow said “So the fact that he got OpenAI to commit to Azure was an amazing masterstroke it gives him a massive competitive advantage over Google and Amazon” That position was put in jeopardy late last year when OpenAI’s board of directors suddenly fired CEO Sam Altman A weekend of behind-the-scenes maneuvers and a threatened mass exodus of employees championed by Nadella helped bring back Altman and stabilize the startup assuaging clients and shareholders “He handled that like he was in the World Series of Poker playing against little kids” Ives said Nadella’s tenure hasn’t been without hiccups especially given how much of the world relies so heavily on Microsoft products — sometimes to the frustration of people using them Cybersecurity experts say its tendency is to sacrifice security for convenience including in its gung-ho rollout of AI large language models The company’s trademark suite of work tools Microsoft Office 365 has also been penetrated successfully in recent years in embarrassing high-profile compromises that have seen elite Russian and Chinese cyber operators access the email accounts of senior US officials and members of Microsoft’s senior leadership team It stepped in to provide cloud hosting to Ukraine just ahead of Russia’s 2022 invasion but the networks serving NATO allies are constantly peppered by intrusion attempts That and the worsening ransomware scourge have led Nadella to call for a cyber Geneva Convention with Russia and China And despite Nadella’s stated aversion to “competitive fire” Microsoft is once again drawing the kind of antitrust scrutiny that dogged Gates and Ballmer in earlier years Nadella’s confident testimony at a federal court hearing last summer helped persuade a judge not to block Microsoft’s purchase of video game giant Activision Blizzard but the company is now facing another round of questions on its partnership with OpenAI None of those challenges are likely to push Nadella 56 who made $485 million in total compensation last year and has also chaired Microsoft’s board since 2021 out of his leadership roles anytime soon “From everything I can gather he’s really enjoying himself” Lenschow said “We’re in very very very interesting times I would expect him to stay for a while” —- AP technology reporters Michael Liedtke and

recommendations in-depth research investing resources and more Learn More The Nasdaq Composite surged 43% in 2023 and one of the big investing themes driving investor enthusiasm was the booming demand for artificial intelligence (AI) technology The IDC projects spending on AI software to grow 31% per year and reach $251 billion annually by 2027 The best thing about the AI opportunity is that you dont have to make risky investments to do well Microsoft (MSFT -015%) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOG 204%) (GOOGL 215%) are tech juggernauts that have been investing in AI for years and are already seeing the fruits of those efforts Both stocks saw their prices more than double over the last five years and beat the market again in 2023 Lets compare these tech leaders to see which is the best AI stock to buy right now Microsoft is a widely recognized brand which will benefit the company as it introduces new AI services for businesses and consumers Over the last year it introduced Bing AI and Copilot for Microsoft 365 on the consumer side These offerings could attract more customers and solidify Microsofts dominant market share in the PC market As part of its investment in OpenAI Microsoft has started to introduce AI features for the Bing search engine and a Windows with Copilot preview Copilot could add a valuable new revenue stream with Microsoft charging a small subscription fee to use it with Office in Microsoft 365 Microsoft was very successful in turning its productivity software into a cloud subscription service AI should give the company more ways to monetize its software and its already doing just fine In the last quarter Microsoft said its productivity segment including Office LinkedIn and Dynamics products brought in $18 billion in revenue up 13% year over year Microsoft can also monetize AI through the Azure enterprise cloud service business This unit has been steadily gaining market share in cloud computing and it is currently No 2 behind Amazon Web Services Azure grew revenue by 29% year over year in the September-ending quarter with management saying that demand for AI services contributed a few percentage points to growth Altogether Microsoft expects AI to eventually bring in $10 billion in annual revenue which would make it the fastest business to reach that level of revenue in company history Over the last 10 years Microsofts revenue and earnings grew 10% and 14% per year respectively AI technology is extending Microsofts runway of growth and giving the company more ways to build valuable recurring revenue streams through subscriptions The Google parent has been investing in AI for several years Billions of people use Gmail YouTube and other Google services which has made Alphabet the leading digital advertiser The companys investments in AI will make it a major influencer in how people engage with this technology in the future Alphabet may not directly monetize certain AI features to generate more revenue like Microsoft But the company rolled out a feature last year in Workspace Labs that lets Gmail users draft an entire email from a simple prompt using AI New features like this could go a long way towards maintaining a large base of users and strengthening Googles brand Alphabet made a big splash in AI last year by launching Google Bard a conversational search engine powered by generative AI In December it introduced Gemini the companys most powerful AI model which outperforms human experts on massive multitask language understanding (MMLU) The company says that millions of people are now using generative AI across our products to do things they couldnt even a year ago Because people already use Google search and YouTube for researching products when planning to buy something smarter search powered by AI should drive up usage of these products and that suggests more opportunities for advertising -- the companys largest revenue source Alphabet controls about a quarter of the digital advertising market This fueled its growth over the last 10 years where revenue and earnings increased at high annual rates of 20% and 19% respectively Following a sluggish performance in 2022 as a result of a weak advertising market Alphabet is starting to build momentum again with analysts expecting double-digit growth in revenue for 2024 Both of these companies are similar in terms of the number of people that rely on their services and their dominant market shares in software and online search But since 2019 Alphabet has grown revenue faster than Microsoft and analysts project more double-digit growth for the search leader Data by YCharts Analysts expect Alphabet to grow earnings by 20% per year over the next five years compared to 15% for Microsoft Note that these estimates are consistent with each companys previous 10-year track record Moreover investors can buy shares of Alphabet at a lower forward P/E of 20 compared to 33 for Microsoft Investors can get more

BRAD SMITH: Well first of all I think what were doing is bringing Copilots to more products Were continuing to add features and functionality to each of the Copilots that we have making them more useful for people And then youll see new iterations of our AI technology and more to come And let me just say stay tuned watch this space JULIE HYMAN: We talked to someone this week who said this is the first time at two consecutive Davos that its been really the same theme dominating and thats generative AI Generative AI specifically although AI more generally is everywhere Is it too much or we put too many expectations on this technology thats going to change everything? BRAD SMITH: Well I do think that there is always a risk of technology being overhyped Thats the history of the tech sector In this instance I think this is one technology that will live up to the impact that people expect which is to say it will be greatly transformational for organizations for businesses for countries for society I do think one has to worry a little bit that people can get so exuberant that they lose sight of everything else that is important in the world And we need to recognize this is a phenomenon that will unfold over a decade at least But that said it is quite possibly the defining technology of our lifetime certainly this decade I think without question BRIAN SOZZI: Is it Microsofts race to lose? BRAD SMITH: I think its a number of companies race to win And I think one of those potential winners is certainly Microsoft Microsoft in partnership with OpenAI We feel very good about the momentum we have we feel great about the work that OpenAI is doing And I think you captured whats so important Were creating applications like our Copilots that I think are delivering real value to people I use it get feedback from others I guess we still have half the CEOs that we have to reach that we havent yet But people are finding that it makes me for example more creative It makes me more productive If I hit a block I turn to it and I then find theres some new inspiration idea that breaks through And more importantly and broadly whether its material science or molecular biology drug discovery healthcare in all very specific areas I think people are seeing that this is something that can make not just them more productive but provide real solutions to problems that many people every day worry about JULIE HYMAN: You mentioned OpenAI And of course there was the drama around OpenAI and Sam Altman last year that seemed at least in part from what we can understand seemed at least in part to be over how quickly we should be moving and how carefully we need to be moving when it comes to generative AI Are we moving too fast? BRAD SMITH: I dont think that the technology is moving too fast I think we all have work to make sure that whether youre in government or a business or a nonprofit were moving forward what I call safety and innovation at the same speed And I think we should look back at 2023 as a year when the technology race forward And interestingly so did the safety architecture I mean I feel very good about what OpenAI has been doing what Microsoft has been doing and others as well Its not just us But interestingly governments are moving faster to put guardrails in place first on a voluntary basis then through laws and regulation Then we have seen in the history of digital technology And while people tend to focus on Europe and the AI Act the United States with these White House commitments or executive order they look for differences and there are some I think what we sometimes miss is theres a lot of similarity Fundamentally what governments are saying is that they want this technology to bring new opportunities But they really do want to make sure its safe its secure that peoples rights continue to be protected And thats got to be right And so we have to find ways to work together And I take a lot of optimism from the fact that I think in fact we are and were doing it at a rapid pace BRIAN SOZZI: I was talking to the co-founder of Salesforce Marc Benioff and he had choice words to say about the lack of regulation for social media companies Immediately got me thinking well will regulators come out and over regulate AI and just squash innovation? Do you worry about that? BRAD SMITH: Well in a sense one should worry about everything and you can worry about doing too much you can worry about doing too little And its probably good because that increases the probability of getting it right But what you heard from Mark is really what you hear from many people in governments around the world They say we let social media go forward without putting any laws in place We dont want to do that a second time And theyre not Theyre not going to That is I think something that is very clear around the world Of course theres a risk that in some ways regulation will go too far there always is Thats why I think its so important that there be broad conversations including at a place like Davos where you see people from government people from civil society nonprofits people from tech all sitting down together And there are sometimes some pretty vibrant debates spirited even But theres starting to emerge I think some convergence And I think thats encouraging JULIE HYMAN: Finally on a different topic I want to ask you about something thats going on at one of your competitors right now Google CEO Sundar Pichai telling the workforce there that there could be more job cuts coming this year How are you thinking about the right size of the workforce at Microsoft and where those workers are deployed? BRAD SMITH: Well I think when we look at Microsoft broadly speaking we would say that the number of employees that we have today is about the right number Thats the number that were likely to have as we look to the future And it doesnt mean that every job stays exactly where it is or the function Thats part of any organization and certainly any business But were not sitting here today where we were a year ago A year ago we were saying gee we had too many people we had to downsize We went from about 230000 to 220000 Today were very focused on capital investment a huge data center AI infrastructure expansion on a global basis But that doesnt mean were going to have fewer people it does mean that were not going to be growing people jobs quite the way we were before This is a capital intensive industry now especially at the infrastructure level for AI Its a different industry than it was before JULIE HYMAN: So just to put a fine point on it it sounds like youre not looking at large scale job cuts any time soon from Microsoft BRAD SMITH: Yeah Related Quotes"

178,"XLK ETF: A Better Way To Invest In Microsoft But Volatility Comes First (NYSEARCA:XLK)","1/29/2024","https://seekingalpha.com/article/4665881-xlk-etf-better-way-invest-microsoft-volatility-comes-first","da-kuk da-kuk Since my last bullish publication on the Technology Select Sector ETF (NYSEARCA:XLK) in October 2023 it has appreciated by over 20% and now trades at a little over $200 This one comes three months later but in a crucial week both for monetary policy and tech earnings two potential volatility-inducing events Against such a backdrop one would normally opt for a Hold position but this time also my forecast is positive based mainly on XLKs top-holding Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and other software plays likely to benefit from AI moving towards exploitation or the usage phase In this respect given that the software giant is heavily overvalued as illustrated below while XLK is rated as a strong buy by Quant this thesis will make the case for exposure through the ETF route Some key metrics (seekingalphacom) Some key metrics (seekingalphacom) I start by showing how it is the turn of the software industry to benefit from artificial intelligence after 2023 was the year of semiconductor producer Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) For tech investors last year was marked by Nvidias meteoric rise as illustrated by the deep blue chart below resulting in gains of nearly 200% In sharp contrast Microsoft in orange delivered only one-third of the semiconductor giants performance Data by YCharts Now the main reason for Nvidias outperformance is the high demand for its H100 GPUs which are the very chips required for building infrastructures that can be used to train Generative AI LLMs (large language models) so crucial for applications like ChatGPT to function Now high demand has translated into pricing power signifying bumper revenues and profits but the question is whether Microsoft can also benefit The answer is yes if you take into account the demand for GitHub Copilot created jointly by Microsoft-backed Open AI and GitHub acquired by Satya Nadellas company in 2018 Looking deeper after deploying Nvidias chips into its infrastructure Microsoft now proposes Generative AI models that can be used to build cutting-edge applications through its Azure cloud which is accessible throughout the world In this way it allows thousands of corporations that did not have the capital to purchase Nvidias costly H100s to consume AI in an AI-as-a-Service format and pay in a pay-per-usage manner thanks to flexible tariffs This is the reason the company could beat analysts consensus revenue estimates of $6113 billion for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 during the earnings call around January 30 Any upside could also propel XLK higher but it is also composed of other software companies as illustrated below and which could benefit too wwwsectorspdrscom wwwsectorspdrscom One prominent example is Adobe (ADBE) which uses artificial intelligence to extend the capabilities of its technology through the development of products like Adobe Sensei not only for creating new digital experiences but also for making use of customer data to make sales predictions There is also Salesforce (CRM) which has announced the integration of ChatGPT into its CRM (customer relationship management) ecosystem to give rise to Einstein GPT announced in March last year Now Einstein AI which uses previous flavors of AI like machine language to discover recurring patterns in data was already here before the advent of ChatGPT but it was rapidly tweaked to Einstein GPT in only about seven months In contrast it takes longer for Nvidia which has to design a new chip by taking into consideration all the physical electrical and networking parameters and has to outsource production to Taiwan Semiconductor Company (TSM) in East Asia Hence from initially being announced in March 2022 it took the H100 about one year to be launched without forgetting that it is an upgrade from the A100 meaning that the total development efforts date to earlier This difference in the time to market or seven versus twelve months in a way shows the agility of software companies to adapt their products to innovations Additionally since analysts at Oppenheimer investment firm forecast that Generative AI should positively impact every sector of the economy this means that there is plenty of deployment work for software companies which should see the innovation adding about $280 billion of additional sales from 2023 to 2033 in what is envisaged to become a trillion-dollar market Therefore software companies which represent a sizable 3887% of XLKs holdings (as shown below) could also see higher demand for their products providing them the ingredients to improve both on the topline and bottom line in turn resulting in an appreciation of their share prices XLK breakdown (wwwsectorspdrscom) XLK breakdown (wwwsectorspdrscom) Talking valuations compared with Microsofts forward P/E of 36x XLKs multiple of 2708x is trading at a discount of around 25% ((2708-36)/36)) but there is more as the ETF is undervalued compared to NVDIAs 4974x by about 45% ((2708-4974)/4974) Now with the ETFs weight consisting of software at the tune of 3887% and semiconductors at 2636% respectively I obtain normalized discounts of 972% and 1186% as tabled below Averaging these two figures I obtained 1079% which applied to XLKs share price of $20175 comes to a target of roughly $2235 Table built using data from (wwwseekingalphacom) Table built using data from (wwwseekingalphacom) I believe this is a fair price target considering that the ETF has already produced gains of 48% in the last year alone and there are also volatility risks lurking on the horizon mostly due to high expectations (75%) of a rate cut in March In this respect the performance of equities in general is also determined by monetary policy and in case there is a higher probability of it being loosened it tends to rise Now in a week where some key economic data are released as per the table below imagine a scenario where there are stronger than expected employment numbers for January which could cast doubts about the downward trend seen in inflation up to now being sustainable The Fed may also want to exercise prudence given the tensions in the Red Sea resulting in cost-push inflationary pressures Table prepared using data from (wwwmarketwatchcom) Table prepared using data from (wwwmarketwatchcom) Thus the Feds chairman could delay the first rate cuts and there have been many such instances since 2022 with one of them being on October 19 when the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite shed nearly 1% after Mr Powell reiterated his stance that rates would have to stay higher to combat inflation Moreover there are also concentration risks emanating from Apple making up nearly 209% of XLKs assets Now analysts estimate that the iPhone makers revenue growth for its first quarter of fiscal 2024 which ended in December 2023 would be only 095% YoY However in case its management is not able to justify the 34% YoY consensus estimate for its FY-2024 which ends in September there could be a lot of volatility For this matter while the company certainly uses AI to enhance user experience for its devices Apple has yet to make a public announcement as I had detailed in a previous thesis This has become important especially after competitors Samsungs (OTCPK:SSNLF) S24 series will be equipped with LLMs as part of the Android operating system and Huawei has already carried out similar developments for its Harmony OS which drives its Mate 60 series models Staying within the realms of growth but with a revenue diversifier narrative one of Apples senior executives behind Apples electric vehicle project has made the switch to Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ:RIVN) This follows an earlier move by another executive leaving the company and joining the same automaker Thus investors would surely want an update on the Apple Car which could be probably launched in 2028 Therefore unless Apple comes with a strong announcement there should be volatility and with 2024 awaited as the year when the Fed eases a lot of expectations have already been priced in tech stocks with the XLK trading at a much higher multiple than the broader market or the S&P 500 To provide investors with an idea of XLKs rate sensibility the blue chart below shows how it has underperformed the S&P 500 as of March 2022 when interest rates were hiked at an aggressive pace only seen during the Paul Volcker era Thus rates remaining higher for longer may be detrimental to the tech ETF Data by YCharts Still I remain bullish due to two additional factors on top of AI-driven sales opportunities First as shown in the introductory table XLK enjoys superior grades when it comes to liquidity momentum risks and expenses Furthermore its Quant score of 485 is only second to the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) and the iShares US Technology ETF (IYW) Looking further down the list there is the Vanguard Information Technology Index Fund ETF Shares (VGT) which also charges fees of 010% and dedicates a sizeable part of its assets or 403% to software (applications and systems) but is ranked below at the 10th position with a lower liquidity level Second apart from its top four holdings which collectively make up 5445% of its weight the Technology Select Sector ETF also consists of 60 other stocks which are broadly spread over the remaining 4555% These include International Business Machines (IBM) and Accenture (ACN) just to name a few which have enhanced their product offerings including consultancy services using artificial intelligence Therefore in addition to Microsoft these should also gain market share from a wider diffusion of AI in corporate processes Next looking at XLKs other holdings the study by Oppenheimer stipulates that AI should also touch security data analytics and infrastructure software companies like ServiceNow (NOW) and Palo Alto Networks (PANW) without forgetting semiconductor ones like Broadcom (AVGO) and Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR) as AI becomes pervasive everywhere In this context by opting for the passive ETF route investors can avoid the hassle of searching for individual names that will benefit from artificial intelligence in addition to obtaining nearly 23% of exposure to richly-valued Microsoft As for Apple given that the iPhone is the very gateway that allows people young or old to access and consume AI applications any device-related update during its earning call at the very start of February can boost the stock and by ricochet XLK Such a catalyst is not priced at the target of $2235 which also takes into account monetary policy-related risks Finally given the likelihood of a volatile week ahead some may find it better to take a pause and wait for a better margin of safety before putting money to work but I reiterate my buy position as during uncertainty big tech has generally acted as a beacon of value

Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a companys business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision Earnings Estimate Revisions Here at Zacks we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a companys future earnings over anything else Thats because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends And if earnings estimates go up for a company the fair value for its stock goes up A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors interest in buying the stock leading to its price moving higher This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements For the current quarter Microsoft is expected to post earnings of $275 per share indicating a change of +185% from the year-ago quarter The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +02% over the last 30 days The consensus earnings estimate of $1114 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +136% This estimate has changed +01% over the last 30 days For the next fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $1270 indicates a change of +14% from what Microsoft is expected to report a year ago Over the past month the estimate has remained unchanged With an impressive externally audited track record our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stocks near-term price performance as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate along with three other factors related to earnings estimates has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Microsoft The chart below shows the evolution of the companys forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate: 12 Month EPS Revenue Growth Forecast While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a companys financial health nothing happens as such if a business isnt able to grow its revenues After all its nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues So its important to know a companys potential revenue growth For Microsoft the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $6103 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +157% For the current and next fiscal years $24241 billion and $27528 billion estimates indicate +168% and +136% changes respectively Last Reported Results and Surprise History Microsoft reported revenues of $5652 billion in the last reported quarter representing a year-over-year change of +128% EPS of $299 for the same period compares with $235 a year ago Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $544 billion the reported revenues represent a surprise of +39% The EPS surprise was +1283% The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period Valuation No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stocks valuation Whether a stocks current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the companys growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance Comparing the current value of a companys valuation multiples such as its price-to-earnings (P/E) price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF) to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued overvalued or undervalued whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system) which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on) is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued rightly valued or temporarily undervalued Microsoft is graded D on this front indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade Conclusion The facts discussed here and much other information on Zackscom might help determine whether or not its worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Microsoft However its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) - free report >> Our experts picked 7 Zacks Rank #1 Strong Buy stocks with the best chance to skyrocket within the next 30-90 days Recent stocks from this report have soared up to +675% within 30 days - this months picks could be even better See our reports 7 new picks today - its really free!

There isn’t anything they can do except wait for CEO Tim Cook to come up with a product that drives revenue like AI will In the meantime MSFT stock has more than doubled Apple’s performance over the past year (65% for the former compared to 30% for the latter) and looks ready to widen the lead in 2024 What are analysts saying about the gap in the two companies’ valuations? Is there any hope for Apple shareholders that 2024 won’t be sideways to a lower type of year in the markets? Let’s consider what the analysts say about Apple’s current problem CNBC recently reported comments from TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo According to the analyst iPhone sales especially in China will likely fall in 2024 as much as 15% “Kuo wrote that Apple’s weekly shipments in China have fallen by 30% to 40% from a year earlier in recent weeks ‘and this downward trend is expected to continue’ CNBC reported Kuo’s comments on Jan 30 ‘Apple may have the most significant decline among the major global mobile phone brands in 2024’” Between foldable phones and Huawei’s comeback in China Apple’s been pushed in the past year like never before It will need to respond to the competitive threats facing its biggest moneymaker According to Yahoo Finance data the analyst estimate for Apple’s revenue in the latest quarter is $10877 billion 7% lower than a year earlier That’s on top of a 5% decline in Q1 2023 Not every estimate has Apple’s iPhone revenue declining in Q1 2024 A Reuters report from Jan 31 suggested that its quarterly iPhone sales rose 3% the best growth in five quarters However almost all Apple analysts expect 2024 to be a challenging year for iPhone sales As a result its Services segment will have to do much of the heavy lifting in 2024 In Q1 2024 LSEG expects revenue from the segment including advertising App Store Apple Music Apple TV+ etc to rise 125% over last year to $234 billion The segment’s gross margin in Q4 2023 was nearly 71% It contributes 39% of Apple’s gross profit despite generating less than 18% of revenue In Q1 2023 its services revenue increased by 64% Generating double the growth a year later would tremendously contribute to the overall business I suspect advertising has something to do with it Statista data says Apple’s US ad revenue in 2020 was $22 billion In 2024 it’s expected to be $62 billion with a compound annual growth rate of 296% If it were to maintain this CAGR through 2028 its annual ad revenue would be $175 billion almost as much as its current Services revenue In March 2023 Investor’s Business Daily discussed how Apple’s ad business was underappreciated “‘We believe Apple advertising on its own apps is underappreciated’ Barclays analyst Tim Long said in a note to clients Tuesday ‘Most ad revenues are generated on the App Store with some contribution from News and Stocks This could expand to other apps like Maps TV+ Podcasts etc’” IBD reported Long’s estimate for ad revenue is $19 billion by 2026 $15 billion higher than my estimate above but two years earlier While analysts might be worried about its upcoming Q1 2024 report it’s clear that Services won’t be a part of the growth deficit facing Apple in 2024 I don’t think there’s any question that Apple remains a formidable tech company That said it’s clear that its Products business is facing revenue headwinds that should limit its growth As I write this AAPL stock has barely moved in 2024 up slightly over 1% It reports earnings on Feb 1 after the close By the time this is published the results could already be out Apple stock trades at 78x sales which isn’t cheap relative to its five-year average However compared to Microsoft’s multiple of 134x it’s the value play of the two Should AAPL stock fall on its earnings news long-term investors shouldn’t hesitate to buy on weakness On the date of publication Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer subject to the InvestorPlacecom Publishing Guidelines Will Ashworth has written about investments full-time since 2008 Publications where he’s appeared include InvestorPlace The Motley Fool Canada Investopedia Kiplinger and several others in both the US and Canada He particularly enjoys creating model portfolios that stand the test of time He lives in Halifax Nova Scotia Artificial Intelligence Consumer Discretionary Retail Technology Article printed from InvestorPlace Media https://investorplacecom/2024/02/aapl-stock-outlook-2024-can-apple-outsmart-microsoft/ ©2024 InvestorPlace Media LLC Market Analysis Stocks to Buy Crypto & Blockchain Market Analysis Stocks to Sell Stocks to Buy Stocks to Buy Stocks to Buy Financial Market Data powered by FinancialContent Services Inc All rights reserved Nasdaq quotes delayed at least 15 minutes all others at least 20 minutes Copyright © 2024 InvestorPlace Media LLC All rights reserved 1125 N Charles St Baltimore MD 21201 Not Yet a Premium Subscriber?

195,"Forget Microsoft: 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Instead","2/21/2024","https://finance.yahoo.com/news/forget-microsoft-2-artificial-intelligence-111500500.html","Interest in artificial intelligence (AI) skyrocketed since OpenAI launched ChatGPT in November 2022 The industry is developing rapidly and is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 37% until at least 2030 That trajectory would see the market hit close to $2 trillion before the end of the decade As a result excitement over AI triggered countless tech stocks to soar over the last year Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) has been one of the biggest winners with its shares up 56% in the last 12 months The company is one of OpenAIs largest investors a position that affords Microsoft with exclusive access to some of the start-ups most advanced AI models The Windows company is an exciting way to invest in AI However companies at slightly earlier stages in their AI ventures could have more room to run over the long term Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) are two attractive options One is carving out a lucrative role in the AI chip market while the other is leading in the software side of the industry Microsofts earnings could hit just under $16 per share over the next two fiscal years while AMDs and Amazons may reach about $7 per share On the surface Microsoft looks like a no-brainer However multiplying these figures by the companies forward price-to-earnings ratios (Microsoft at 35 AMD at 52 and Amazon at 41) would yield stock prices of $546 for Microsoft $346 for AMD and $283 for Amazon Considering their current positions these projections would see Microsofts stock rise 35% AMDs 99% and Amazons 66% by fiscal 2026 These estimates show that AMD and Amazon have significantly more growth potential over the next two years So forget Microsoft Here are two AI stocks to buy instead AMDs stock has climbed 111% year to date alongside its growing prospects in AI The tech company is gearing up to challenge AIs leading chip supplier Nvidia with a new line of graphics processing units (GPUs) -- the hardware necessary for training AI models Last December AMD unveiled its new MI300X AI GPUs designed to compete directly with Nvidias offerings Theyve already caught the eye of some of the industrys biggest players In November 2023 Microsoft announced Azure would become the first cloud platform to implement AMDs new GPU to optimize its AI capabilities Meanwhile Meta Platforms has similarly signed on to use AMDs MI300X chips However AMD isnt banking solely on stealing market share from Nvidia in GPUs AMD is seeking to lead its own space within AI by doubling down on AI-powered PCs According to research firm IDC PC shipments are projected to see a major boost this year with AI integration serving as a key catalyst And a Canalys report predicts that 60% of all PCs shipped in 2027 will be AI-enabled AMD supplies chips to PC and notebook manufacturers across tech with a 23% market share in laptop central processing units (CPUs) Consequently AMD could significantly profit from increased demand for AI-equipped PCs carving out its own niche in the burgeoning AI market As the biggest name in e-commerce and cloud computing Amazon has multiple use cases for AI and ways to bolster its business with the technology Since the start of 2023 Amazon responded to the rising demand for AI by expanding its cloud platform Amazon Web Services (AWS) In September the company debuted Bedrock a tool offering a range of models that customers can use to build generative AI applications AWS also introduced CodeWhisperer a platform that generates code for developers and HealthScribe a feature capable of transcribing patient-to-physician conversations In addition to improved cloud capabilities AI could help Amazon better track shopping trends and effectively recommend products to customers on its retail site Meanwhile the company recently announced an AI shopping assistant called Rufus that will improve the customer experience Amazon is on a promising growth path in AI and has the financial resources to continue investing in its business and keep up with the competition Over the last 12 months the tech companys free cash flow has risen by 904% to $32 billion In Amazons fourth quarter revenue increased 14% year over year to $170 billion beating analyst estimates by nearly $4 billion Its earnings per share hit $1 compared to expectations of $080 Amazon is in steep competition with Microsoft in the cloud market with both ramping up their AI expansions However Amazons leading market share in the industry potentially gives it a leg up Alongside massive growth potential in its earnings per share Amazons stock is a no-brainer buy over Microsofts for anyone looking to invest in AI Where to invest $1000 right now When our analyst team has a stock tip it can pay to listen After all the

The post-earnings fall from a high of $411 was overdue I’m a big-tech investor but valuations made me antsy My recent piece on Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) reflects it That stock kept climbing after my story and is now only slightly higher than it was when I sold it My personal view on MSFT stock is that you own it; don’t trade it I have always reinvested Microsoft dividends letting them compound giving me 63 shares of “free” stock for every 100 I own by my last count I expect Microsoft stock to have rough days in February as traders pick apart the most recent earnings Consumer revenue growth is slowing to below 10% while cloud services are up 21% and Office365 15% Is that sustainable? Microsoft has aggressively monetized AI on a gross level charging $30 per user for its Office Co-Pilot If you bought a consumer version of Office at roughly $100/year that’s now $460! How many of the 784 million consumer Office customers will buy Co-Pilot? More important what value will we get from it? These questions will drive analysts’ view of the whole industry The AI complex will catch a cold the next time Microsoft sniffles 2024 will be a year of heavy marketing at Microsoft which now has 221000 employees up 50% since I bought my shares in 2018 (The stock is up 800%) The company has moved from gross deals like one with (womp womp!) Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) to industry-specific offerings sold through case studies on early customers It’s the kind of beneath-the-radar selling International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) did in the 20th century when it was the business computing leader The fate of IBM now worth 2% of Microsoft with about one-quarter of its sales should keep Microsoft people paranoid Microsoft doesn’t have nearly the pre-eminence “Big Blue” did when I started covering technology 40 years ago What was a monopoly then is an oligopoly now engaged in “coopetition” Microsoft is ready to cooperate with Apple on its Vision Pro and sell Co-Pilot seats to Amazon while slurping data from Alphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOG NASDAQ:GOOGL) Chrome This is an era of Cloud “Czars” not a single Cloud Czar It’s a world where consumers businesses and governments are just starting to get their arms around It’s the reason the US economy is as dominant as it has ever been How long can the good times roll?

First lets put this $69 billion into perspective because for Microsoft its just not that much money At the end of June 2023 (the end of its last fiscal year) Microsoft had $111 billion in cash and short-term investments plus another $99 billion in long-term investments This was offset by $42 billion in long-term debt Microsoft was stockpiling cash a bit ahead of the payday for ATVI shareholders but such large figures arent too far off from the norm Now as of the end of calendar year 2023 Microsoft reported $81 billion in cash and short-term investments offset by total debt of $72 billion (a $27 billion short-term loan was taken out to help pay for ATVI adding to the now $45 billion in long-term debt on the balance sheet) ATVI certainly put a dent in the balance sheet but the payout certainly wont set Microsoft back for very long Data by YCharts The reason? Microsoft generates massive amounts of free cash flow (FCF) from its software empire -- more than $67 billion (or an FCF profit margin of 29%) in the last 12 months alone In other words Microsoft could acquire an ATVI-sized business every single year if it wanted and would have its coffers replenished by the year following at the rate its been cranking out cash In its last quarterly update before takeover (Q2 2023) ATVI reported a big jump in its own financial activity Revenue rose 35% year over year to $221 billion and $567 million in free cash flow Not bad But even when added to the Xbox segment let alone Microsoft overall ATVI just isnt that big Microsofts management said that Xbox segment revenue was up 61% year over year in the final months of 2023 compared to a year ago when there was no ATVI And on the earnings call CFO Amy Hood said ATVI added four points to Microsofts reported year-over-year revenue growth rate of 18% (so Microsoft would have grown 14% year over year without ATVI) Of course as the video game industry undergoes change from the ongoing mobile and cloud revolution ATVI will fit well into Microsofts overall cloud computing infrastructure and software distribution capabilities But the point is ultimately this: As big as the ATVI purchase may sound its actually a very small piece of the sprawling Microsoft empire Instead of buying Microsoft stock for ATVI focus instead on the Intelligent Cloud segment which grew 20% year over year to $259 billion (or 42% of revenue) Now thats a reason to buy and hold Microsoft stock right now and the key reason why the market is keeping the stock near all-time highs in spite of shares trading for a high premium of 30 times one-year-forward earnings Another decade of cloud industry (with a new AI twist) growth lays ahead and Microsoft is delivering the goods Nicholas Rossolillo and his clients have no position in any of the stocks mentioned The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Microsoft The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy Invest better with The Motley Fool Get stock recommendations portfolio guidance and more from The Motley Fools premium services Making the world smarter happier and richer © 1995 - 2024 The Motley Fool All rights reserved Market data powered by Xignite and Polygonio"

the Azure Maia AI chip able to train large language models is coming this year as reported by The Verge Other areas of focus for Microsoft have been gaming and social media A few of its big acquisitions in these areas were networking website LinkedIn video platform Skype Minecraft developer Mojang Studios and game companies ZeniMax and Activision Blizzard Microsoft had also greatly advanced its browser Edge and search engine Bing powering them with AI tools but its market share remains low in that space Looking into 2024 many analysts named MSFT a top pick as the giant begins to monetize its AI investments These included analysts at Mizuho Securities Wells Fargo Wedbush Securities Jefferies and Loop Capital Markets AAPL slides from $3 trillion Looking at other tech giants Apple surpassed $3 trillion in mid-2023 but in early February it sat slightly below that market cap Apple has held the title of the most valuable publicly traded company for years but over the past year or so the gap tightened At $26 trillion in mid-2022 it was worth both Microsoft and Meta combined – now Microsoft has reached the same level The world’s Number One phone brand has slowed its pace of growth cutting back on acquisitions and sales But while it saw net sales decline in 2023 compared to 2022 it did win over Samsung in the big picture holding 201% of the world’s phone market share according to preliminary data from IDC There are analysts – Ming-Chi Kuo of TF International Securities in particular – who forecast Apple’s 2024 sales decline further as consumers turn to foldable phones and Huawei resurges in China GOOGL AMZN NVDA (and META) under $2 trillion Sitting between $17 trillion and $18 trillion in market value are Alphabet (Google) Amazon and Nvidia Of these Nvidia witnessed the fastest rise – a whopping 1800% over the past five years The chip maker only recently reached the level of the other two tech giants – just in 2024 NVDA surged 46% That’s thanks to Nvidia’s expensive and highly-demanded chips that make generative AI work And while AI is still at the emerging stage meaning there’s no ceiling in sight to this segment Nvidia is also diversifying into software and expanding its international presence The company also makes graphics cards for gaming and operates data centers but it’s the AI boom that make analysts bullish about the stock Next up investors in Google operator Alphabet enjoyed a 165% stock increase over the past five years Of these top techs GOOGL is the cheapest stock based on the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio as The Motley Fool pointed out now trading near $145 per share Chrome remains the top browser in the United States holding just over half of the market while Google Search dominates among the search engines worldwide at about 91% Naturally Google was on top of the trend to embed generative AI into its search engine having launched its Bard and Gemini models in 2023 – and the latter has been evaluated as superior to ChatGPT’s GPT-4 On to Amazon this tech giant saw its stock gain 115% over the past five years – and it’s trading at 10 times its share price a decade ago This one remains the king of e-commerce and it continues to generate the majority of its sales from online stores with third-party seller services coming in second However its cloud infrastructure AWS as mentioned earlier remains the leading choice worldwide followed by Microsoft and Google in second and third positions in market share This giant is also going aggressive on generative AI applying it to cybersecurity and productivity among other things We’ll close this story with Meta Formerly the “F” in the FAANG for “Facebook” this tech giant has fallen behind the others commanding a market value of $12 trillion As a social media giant benefiting from targeted ads this one has probably struggled the most in the public eye battling multiple court cases from copyright infringement to children’s privacy and media addiction issues Still the giant remains the world’s Number One social media conglomerate after integrating Instagram and WhatsApp as well a diving into metaverse development and headsets One could say that what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger – and we the forever consumers of those perfect products of Instagram’s targeted ads hope that Meta will come out better (and safer) than ever BabyPeek is a genetic test that allows parents to discover features and traits as early as 10 weeks SMBs get more benefits from niche CRM providers Here are a few that make you stand out The app will officially launch on Web iOS and Android April 3rd"

ad","2/9/2024","https://coingeek.com/microsoft-seeks-to-shine-light-on-ai-transformative-power-with-super-bowl-ad/","Home » Business » Microsoft seeks to shine light on AI’s transformative power with Super Bowl ad Business 9 February 2024 As the Super Bowl approaches and excitement around it builds Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) has announced that it will have a Super Bowl commercial for the first time in four years and this time it will be dedicated to artificial intelligence (AI) Excited for all that people will achieve with this next generation of AI as we bring the power of Copilot to anyone anywhere on any device https://tco/FU9bDmw5gN — Satya Nadella (@satyanadella) February 7 2024 Microsoft is choosing to use its ad space to shine a light on the transformative power of AI particularly through Copilot Microsoft’s generative AI assistant that integrates into everyday workflows The core message of the advertisement is that AI is a transformative technology that allows its users to bring ideas to life and acquire new skills faster and more efficiently than ever before width=562 height=315 frameborder=0 allowfullscreen=allowfullscreen> The decision to spotlight Copilot during the Super Bowl could signal a broader trend that we will see in Super Bowl advertisements this year especially from tech companies Just as blockchain and digital currency commercials flooded the Super Bowl when non-fungible tokens (NFTs) were reaching their peak we’re likely to see a wave of AI commercials during the Super Bowl showcasing each company’s latest AI advancements and innovations Microsoft premieres AI product In their announcement of their upcoming Super Bowl commercial Microsoft also alluded to the idea that the AI initiatives and integration that it planned around its search product “Bing” would be sunsetted in favor of making Copilot Microsoft’s “singular experience for people looking to get more out of AI creation we are today introducing further image creation capabilities” Microsoft initially focused on integrating AI into Bing with the vision of transforming users’ search experience by understanding and anticipating user queries allowing the delivery of more relevant search results Additionally by infusing Bing with AI the tech giant aimed to increase the number of users of its product and enhance engagement However Bing remained unpopular as a search engine with Google (NASDAQ: GOOGL) taking the lion’s share of the search engine market with 91% dominance After recognizing the minimal impact of the AI-infused Bing approach the Microsoft team pivoted to Copilot a more personalized and creative AI experience that integrates into a user’s everyday workflow Copilot: The AI assistant that enhances workflow Copilot is an AI assistant that users can summon and seamlessly integrate into the task(s) they have in front of them on their screen It was designed to be a dynamic tool that adapts to the user’s needs offering tailored suggestions and solutions given the workflow they choose for Copilot to assist them in In-line image editing is the latest feature that Microsoft has added to Copilot This feature was announced at the same time Microsoft revealed they would have a commercial in the upcoming Super Bowl In-line image editing allows users to directly customize AI-generated images within the Copilot interface such as enhancing an object’s color to make it stand out blurring the background for a more focused subject or applying artistic effects like pixel art width=562 height=315 frameborder=0 allowfullscreen=allowfullscreen> Everyday AI integration Microsoft seems to have tapped into what users are demanding from AI systems Recently AI has been featured in popular media for its potential to revolutionize our work lives serve as personal assistants for daily tasks solve complex problems and even create unimaginable innovations Despite these visions that are being marketed consumer-facing AI products have predominantly been limited to generative AI chatbots and image generators While these products have gained traction for their unique abilities they are still very broad and when you take a closer look at how people are primarily using AI you would see that they have a preference for using generative AI chatbots in niches as specialized consultants and sophisticated search tools Microsoft’s Copilot takes that into consideration and boils these functionalities into a single application that integrates with the user’s current screen activity This integration eliminates the need to juggle multiple tabs or switch to split-screen mode and streamlines the AI-assisted task completion process that users already go through Microsoft’s investment in Copilot should not be overlooked either and it might actually be the start of a significant shift in how we interact with technology Microsoft has such a strong belief in Copilot that the company has introduced a dedicated Copilot key on its keyboards—the first new key in nearly three decades This key summons Copilot seamlessly integrating AI assistance with the user’s current on-screen activities While generative AI models have been the primary winners so far the race to deliver consumer-friendly products that leverage AI is ongoing On that front we also saw Microsoft announce AI PCs computers equipped with chips specializing in executing AI functions This reflects the eagerness within the tech industry to create consumer-facing AI products and wearables that could achieve mass adoption by not only riding the AI trend the world is experiencing but also delivering products and services that increase efficiency and productivity It’s clear that Microsoft among others sees immense opportunity in making AI an integral easily accessible part of our everyday lives which means we are likely to see other tech companies follow suit and launch their AI tools soon In order for artificial intelligence (AI) to work right within the law and thrive in the face of growing challenges it needs to integrate an enterprise blockchain system that ensures data input quality and

challenging but also included hopeful revelations about the power of this new technology according to an internal Microsoft presentation from late 2023 Business Insider obtained an excerpt of the presentation revealing some details about how this important AI product was created Originally Microsoft was working on its own machine-learning models for security use cases according to the presentation by Microsoft Security Research partner Lloyd Greenwald The initiative involving petabytes of security data stalled because of a lack of computing resources when everybody in the company was using Microsofts limited supply of GPUs to work with GPT-3 the predecessor to GPT-4 Greenwald explained Then the software giant got early access to GPT-4 as a tented project he said according to the audio obtained by BI Thats a term for a project to which Microsoft tightly restricts access At that point Microsoft shifted focus away from its own models to see what it could in the cybersecurity space with GPT-4 We presented our initial explorations of GPT-4 to government customers to get their feel and we also presented it to external customers without saying what the model is that we were using Greenwald said The pitch centered around the benefits of mostly using a single universal AI model rather than many individual models Microsoft still has several specific machine-learning models for solving specific problems such as attack campaign attribution compromised account detection and supply chain attack detection Greenwald said The difference is if you have a large universal model or a foundation model that they are called now like GPT-4 you can do all things with one model he added Thats how we pitched it to the government back then and then we showed them a little bit about what we were trying to do Greenwald noted that the capabilities Microsoft initially showed the government were childish compared to the level of sophistication the company has achieved now Microsoft spokesman Frank Shaw said the meeting pertained to technology built on GPT 35 and is irrelevant to the current Security Copilot built on GPT-4 The technology discussed at the meeting was exploratory work that predated Security Copilot and was tested on simulations created from public data sets for the model evaluations no customer data was used Shaw said Today our Early Access Program customers regularly share their satisfaction with the latest version of Security Copilot According to the audio obtained by BI Microsoft started testing GPT-4s security capabilities by showing the AI model security logs and seeing if it could parse the content and understand what was going on They would paste a Windows security log for example into GPT-4 and then prompt the model by telling it to be a threat hunter and find out what had happened Greenwald said in the presentation This was without any extra training on specific security data — just OpenAIs general model off the shelf GPT-4 was able to understand this log share some interesting things about what was in the log and say whether there was anything malicious Now this is in some ways a cherry-picked example because it would also tell us things that just werent right at all Greenwald said Hallucination is a big problem with LLMs and theres a lot we do at Microsoft to try to eliminate hallucinations and part of that is grounding it with real data but this is just taking the model without grounding it with any data The only thing we sent it was this log and asking it questions We had to cherry pick a little bit to get an example that looked good because it would stray and because its a stochastic model it would give us different answers when we asked it the same questions he added It wasnt that easy to get good answers Its unclear from the audio of the presentation whether Greenwald was saying that Microsoft used these cherry-picked examples during early demos to the government BI asked the company specifically about this and it didnt respond to that question We work closely with customers to minimize the risk of hallucinations by grounding responses in customer data and always providing citations Microsofts Shaw said Microsoft also dug in to see where GPT-4 got the information it already seemed to know about cybersecurity topics such as logs compromising situations and threat intelligence Greenwald said that Microsofts experience from developing Github Copilot showed that OpenAI models were trained on open-source code But these models were also trained on computer science papers patent office data and website crawls for 10 years So there was reasonable data on security in there it was all static in time all security data back from prior to late 2021 Greenwald explained Greenwald also shared another example of the security questions Microsoft asked OpenAIs models saying this is just what we demoed to the government according to the audio of his presentation Again Microsoft told the AI model to be a threat hunter but this time gave it a different security log from a specific incident and asked it to explain what was going on and to identify any IOCs or indicators of compromise These are digital traces that cybercriminals leave inside computer networks during attacks The model was able to figure out the IOCs what happened with the attack and how to remediate it — just by looking at the security log Greenwald said This output was from GPT 35 rather than the more advance GPT-4 he noted We were able to present to the government this is from GPT 35 these are experiments on what we can do Greenwald added These answers are pretty good and pretty convincing but GPT-4 answers were even better Thats what got CTO Kevin Scott CEO Satya Nadella and many others at Microsoft excited according to Greenwald The effort then moved out from the applied research organization under Eric Douglas and got an engineering team to try to turn this into what Greenwald called something more like a real product Microsoft has incorporated its own data into the Security Copilot product which helps the company ground the system with more up-to-date and relevant information We want to pull in security data we dont just want to just ask it questions based on what it was trained on we have a lot of data in Microsoft we have a lot of security products Greenwald said He cited Microsoft Sentinel as a cybersecurity product that has connectors to all that data He also mentioned ServiceNow connectors and information from Microsoft Defender the companys antivirus software along with other sources of security data A person familiar with the project said the idea is to intercept responses from generative AI models and use the internal security data to point in the right direction essentially creating more deterministic software to try to solve hallucination issues before the product is generally available expected this summer When Microsoft initially rolled out Security Copilot in late March the company said the service doesnt always get everything right and noted that AI-generated content can contain mistakes It described Security Copilot as a closed-loop learning system that gets feedback from users and improves over time As we continue to learn from these interactions we are adjusting its responses to create more coherent relevant and useful answers Microsoft

225,"How Microsoft catapulted to $3 trillion on the back of AI Mint","1/26/2024","https://www.livemint.com/companies/how-microsoft-catapulted-to-3-trillion-on-the-back-of-ai-11706250100474.html","Microsoft on Thursday became the second company ever to end the trading day valued at more than $3 trillion a milestone reflecting investor optimism that one of the oldest tech companies is leading an artificial-intelligence revolution In the past decade Microsoft’s success has come from smart bets by Chief Executive Satya Nadella One of his biggest gambles in recent years has been partnering with an untested nonprofit startup—generative AI pioneer OpenAI—and quickly folding its technology into Microsoft’s best-selling products That move made Microsoft a de facto leader in a burgeoning AI field many believe will retool the tech industry Because of the OpenAI relationship “Microsoft to me is ahead of Alphabet and Meta and has a great shot of being a software leader in AI said Synovus Trust portfolio manager Daniel Morgan who owns Microsoft shares Microsoft’s capitalization first rose about $3 trillion in midday trading Wednesday but closed below the mark Microsoft’s ascendence on the back of AI excitement may signal a changing guard atop tech Apple became the first company to close above the $3 trillion mark in June reflecting the lasting impact and resilience of the iPhone Earlier this month Microsoft briefly dethroned Apple as the most highly valued publicly-listed company in the world Apple has since regained the top spot Apple shares have underperformed versus other tech giants so far this year amid concerns about the company’s sales and its position in the AI race The AI boom unofficially kicked off in November 2022 with the release of ChatGPT a chatbot built by Silicon Valley nonprofit startup OpenAI that uses so-called “large language models to write poems craft emails and generate computer code Microsoft is the largest investor in OpenAI In multiple rounds over the past five years it has agreed to invest $13 billion in OpenAI in exchange for what is essentially a 49% stake in the earnings of its for-profit arm The relationship has also given Microsoft early access to OpenAI’s latest models which are trained and hosted on the company’s cloud computing service Azure Microsoft’s aggressive adoption and expansion of the technology have helped it leapfrog rivals in investors’ minds Since Microsoft’s multibillion-dollar investment in OpenAI in January 2023 the stock has gained nearly 70% adding more than $12 trillion to Microsoft’s market value Nadella has forged a close relationship with OpenAI’s CEO Sam Altman and incorporated his startup’s technology into top Microsoft products Investors have been bullish on the prospect that these AI tools—including an assistant Copilot that plugs into key Microsoft software like Word Outlook and Teams—will become a major new revenue stream for the company “They have a huge head start owing to OpenAI and innovating quickly and moving faster than other enterprise software companies have been able to said Rishi Jaluria an analyst at RBC Capital While the AI hype has boosted stocks across the tech sector Microsoft has ridden the wave better than the rest In 2023 Microsoft’s stock rose more than 55% outpacing the Nasdaq Composite Index which rose less than 45% Some investors worry there could be a bubble forming around the soaring prices of AI-driven stocks It is still unclear how much new revenue the AI boom will add to any of the companies Even for some of the biggest beneficiaries it could take years before enterprises and individuals embrace AI tools at the scale the technology’s biggest proponents expect Microsoft’s early attempt to integrate AI into its products has been hit or miss The AI chat added to its Bing search engine hasn’t done much to boost its market share against Google’s Its GitHub Copilot product which uses AI to speed up coding has been popular The sheer size of Microsoft and peers like Apple means that tech stocks play an outsize role in the broader stock market’s performance When the year began the two tech giants accounted for 14% of the market-value weighted S&P 500 according to S&P Dow Jones Indices Microsoft and Apple both now surpass the value of five of the 11 sectors within the S&P 500 according to Dow Jones Market Data including consumer staples energy real estate materials and utilities Microsoft’s recent success is the latest capper for one of the oldest companies in tech that has ridden its tight ties with corporate customers to thrive through multiple waves of technological change Started in 1975 Microsoft has navigated the evolution from personal computers to the internet to mobile devices—some shifts better than others Through it all its operating systems are still in most of the world’s computers and its workplace software remains a stalwart in companies across the globe In recent years as some tech companies have struggled with slowdowns Microsoft has found ways to grow revenue Its core businesses have generated enough cash to allow it to become one of the most acquisitive companies in tech Not long ago the Redmond Wash company was considered the stodgy old uncle of technology not on par with the leading names in the industry Despite its size it was left out of the FAANG acronym some investors once used to describe what were considered the most dynamic names in tech: Facebook Amazon Apple Netflix and Google “There was a time when Microsoft was not part of FAANG and now Microsoft is absolutely in the magnificent seven said Soma Somasegar a venture capitalist with Madrona Ventures and a former Microsoft executive The magnificent seven refers to the leaders in tech today: Google parent Alphabet Amazoncom Apple Meta Platforms Nvidia Tesla and Microsoft Nadella who’s nearly a decade into the CEO job has rapidly led the company across trillion-dollar valuation landmarks It crossed the $1 trillion market capitalization mark in 2019 and $2 trillion two years later Under Nadella Microsoft’s Azure cloud service has become the main engine of its growth and the company’s stock rises and falls based on how well the division does Today it is the second-largest player in the sector behind Amazon’s Web Services The AI boom is expected to accelerate growth at Azure Last quarter customer spending on Microsoft’s AI services was responsible for three percentage points of Azure’s revenue growth Write to Tom Dotan at tomdotan@wsjcom and Charley Grant at charlesgrant@wsjcom Download the Mint app and read premium stories Log in

237,"Microsoft: Preparing For A Quantum Leap (NASDAQ:MSFT)","2/12/2024","https://seekingalpha.com/article/4669491-microsoft-preparing-for-a-quantum-leap","NBC/NBCUniversal via Getty Images Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) may have leaped ahead of the competition in the arms race to develop the worlds first large-scale quantum supercomputer In anticipation of its arrival they have launched Azure Quantum allowing researchers to learn the techniques of quantum programming estimate the resources they will need to solve complex problems try out their programs in a simulated environment and experiment with current early versions of future hardware Microsoft has proven the power of its simulated environment by publishing a paper showing how it used quantum programming and AI to develop a new battery electrolyte that is now being tested in the lab A recent scientific discovery crystalizes the hardware research focus of MSFT showing that they are taking a different approach to the competition MSFT has created and controlled the exotic quasi-particle Majorana Zero Modes; Majorana particles come with inbuilt error protection giving future MSFT quantum computers a significant advantage over all other technologies currently being analyzed I already own Microsoft in my Family Fund and recently added to that position The quantum developments in this article give me confidence that MSFT remains an excellent long-term investment and will likely outperform most large-scale tech companies in the coming decade This is my fourth article on Quantum Computing; the other three focus on the pure-play companies D-Wave (QBTS) Rigetti (RGTI) and IonQ (IONQ) In each article I have tried to explain this complex areas technology and mathematics hoping to give people enough knowledge to make an informed investment decision In this article I will look at Topological Quantum Computing the chosen technology of MSFT Its a big deal; if ever realized the power of a quantum computer will transform the tech industry along with material science medicine and most other manufacturing operations A quantum computer is a device that uses the properties of Superposition and Entanglement exhibited by quantum particles to perform calculations The quantum particles used in this way are referred to as qubits Superposition relates to the amount of information that can be stored In todays classical computers a bit can store two values either 1 or 0 A qubit can store an infinite number of values; it is a mixture of two states; in my article on Rigetti I covered this in detail using an analogy of radar on a boat: the position of a boat could be 041 East + 091 North the two states would be North and East and the position of the boat is a superposition of the two states We use Dirac notation in quantum computing to write this superposition as 041 /0> + 091 /1> We are all familiar with the bits that drive todays computers; my iPhone 14 has 6GB of memory representing 48000000000 bits Each of those bits can hold the numbers 1 or 0 It sounds like a lot but it is inadequate to perform any real scientific research To put it into context a single gram of DNA requires 215 petabytes to hold its information That is 1720000000000000000 bits and I would need over 35000 iPhones to store a single strand of DNA; you can see how this quickly gets beyond the memory of any traditional computer An entire strand of DNA could be stored on a single qubit which is a game changer in itself Entanglement is the second quantum property exploited by quantum computing Einstein doubted its existence; he wrote in 1952 a system of delusion concocted of incoherent elements of thought when describing quantum mechanics following on from the now infamous EPR paper that sought to bring down the entire quantum mechanical research edifice and described entanglement as spooky communication Two Quantum systems are entangled if the measurement of one system is correlated with the other and these states are not separable I covered entanglement in detail in this article on IonQ; it means that two particles become like twins; measuring one gives you the values of the other This property is fundamental to the programming of quantum computers The two properties of entanglement and superposition form the basis of this new and developing form of computation In the early 1980s this area became known as computability and was a compulsory course when I studied for my undergraduate mathematics degree Researchers began to explore what algorithms could be developed to run on a Quantum Computer if one were ever built At the time it was a purely academic study as the prospect of devising such a computer seemed impossible; we called them Turing machines not quantum computers An algorithm is a set of distinct operations that must be performed on one or more qubits to solve a problem; information will be held in the qubits as they evolve in response to the operations being enacted on them In quantum computing these operations are called gates and are represented mathematically by matrices; hence it is often called gate-based computing One of the most valuable operations is the Hadamard operator if you apply it to the measurement 0 /0> + 1 /1> you get 1 /0> + 0 /1> I mention it here as an example but it comes up later in the piece In 1994 Peter Shore devised an algorithm that could factorize huge numbers into prime factors in very short time frames (with small numbers this is simple; working out that 15=5x3 or that 330= 2x3x5x11 is not a big deal) Factoring very large numbers made up of large prime numbers is believed to be impossible on classical computers of any size as the time needed is exponentially large Large number prime factorization is the method for securely performing online financial transactions Indeed whenever you type your credit card details onto a website it is secured using huge prime numbers The security depends on one-way hardness; if you know the prime numbers producing the large number is simple but if you know the large number working out the prime numbers is impossible with todays computers With Shores algorithm the problem is no longer hard and internet finance is no longer secure Shores algorithm was the first to show how quantum gate computing could solve problems beyond the reach of classical computers It led to an explosion of mathematical work to find the algorithms needed to solve many other seemingly intractable problems A quantum computer must contain a system of qubits all distinct from each other The computer must set the initial value or state of the qubit and the qubits should be able to hold this value The computer must then be able to apply a sequence of operations (gates) to the individual qubits and to more than one qubit simultaneously using entanglement Finally the computer must be able to measure the new state of the qubits and report its findings without error There are a host of potential architectures for building a quantum computer and many companies and universities are researching many different methods for delivering this goal when we investigate the possibilities we should consider the following questions Despite decades of research nobody has yet developed a computer to pass these five tests In fact nobody has yet managed to pass step 2 We are in the time of noisy quantum computers error-prone unreliable machines offering little advantages over what we already have similar to computers in the 1950s Here it is all about the Qubits; there are thousands of possibilities to develop systems with superposition and entanglement properties Current research covers nuclear magnetic resonance neutral atoms and photonics going as far as nitrogen-vacancy center in diamonds Two methods dominate most companies research: trapped Ion qubits and superconducting qubits Most big-name Quantum computing companies are trying to build their machines using superconducting Qubits Alphabet (GOOG) International Business Machines (IBM) Rigetti and Baidu are taking this approach A superconducting qubit is a loop of nanowire holding a cooper pair (a pair of electrons bound together at low temperatures) The two ends of the wire are separated by a Josephson junction (a thin strip of non-conducting material) Microwave leads are attached to the qubit to control it and the electrons can tunnel through the Josephson junction An effective qubit is formed exhibiting superposition and entanglement However the approach is bedeviled by errors The superconducting qubit must be cooled to below 10mK (possibly the coldest temperature in the universe) and shielded from the rest of the universe The qubits will decohere (suffer an error) with the slightest temperature change radiation magnetism or another passing photon; the qubits even affect each other as will their measurement Current superconducting computers fail rules 2345 and 6 Todays noisy error-prone superconducting computers struggle to make any real ground Companies have released information suggesting progress with these superconducting cubits but so far the claims have failed independent analyses In 2020 Google claimed their quantum computer had gained quantum supremacy only to be shot down by IBM as soon as the paper was published IBM showed how their noisy error-corrected 127 qubit computer could outperform a supercomputer in June 2023 They used a family of techniques called quantum error mitigation to correct the fidelity problems of their qubits In many ways they proved that their system fails point 2 Within a month it was demonstrated that the IBM achievement was possible on a classical computer showing it provided no improvement to what we already had D wave and IONQ (amongst others) are exploring these qubits Lasers ionize atoms (remove an electron) and they are trapped in electrical fields Further lasers are used to measure the state of the qubit The great advantage is that these devices do not need extreme cooling; they will work at room temperature The number of qubits in each of these systems is too small to develop the type of computing power needed D-Wave has developed its annealing computer for optimization problems but fails point 1 as the qubits are not independently addressable so it will never be an actual gate computer It is still a useful Quantum device and has real-world applications D-Wave continues to develop a gate computer; however its current annealing device may be sufficient to develop a profitable business as it can solve optimization problems previously thought inaccessible (I covered the D-Wave technology in this article) IONQ is making progress in this field; it is working towards its AQ35 system which it claims will have quantum supremacy However the fact that IBM thought they had Quantum Supremacy last year and were proven wrong has me worried When IONQ releases the results from their computer the claim may last as long as the two claims by Google and IBM in this area IONQ uses the measure of Algorithmic Qubits to represent the number of error-corrected qubits and the amount of work they can perform It may be that they can attain quantum supremacy with their small number of qubits Still they have recently lost their scientific lead and founder and we have no published scientific papers about the output of the IONQ devices to analyze If the IONQ AQ35 can deliver error-corrected quantum computing it will be going against the current view of the scientific community It is commonly accepted that a useful error-corrected quantum computer will need 1 million qubits (P65 An Applied Approach to Quantum Computing Jack Hidary) We are in a time of noisy quantum computers and nobody has yet managed to scale the machines Noisy means decoherence and errors the machines are not able to keep their state long enough for the successful application of a gate-based algorithm MSFT has been looking at Quantum computers for decades they have tried and rejected each of the methods already discussed not believing them to be scalable in an error-corrected state In a bold move MSFT decided to concentrate on the theoretical field of topological qubits and recently published news of a groundbreaking scientific breakthrough that may have them on the path to a quantum leap in computing power Topological Quantum computers intend to exploit the behavior of a set of quasi-particles known as anyons These exotic particles exhibit non-trivial statistical behavior abstracted from local geometric detail In plain English they are resilient to their surroundings and have built-in error protection The existence of anyons is hard to prove; they only exist in 2-dimensional spaces making them hard to come across in our 3-dimensional world but it does tell us where to look; they will exist on isolated sheets of atoms that are effectively 2-dimensional The most experimentally accessible anyon is the Majorana Zero Mode (MZM) MZM anyons are found in condensed matter superconductors and are a collection of excited electrons An energy gap separates their energy state from the rest of the spectrum This energy gap provides the MZM with its resilience to errors The energy gap gives the MZM qubits a hardware-protected coherence not found in other quantum computing technology; it is an enormous advantage that MSFT could exploit to deliver a quantum leap in share price performance This was my postgraduate area of study; it covered the difference between shapes In topology a soccer ball is the same as a football baseball or banana Each of these shapes can be squashed and pulled to make the other However a football cannot be made into a donut shape or a wedding ring without tearing a hole in the middle of it so topologically footballs and bananas are the same but donuts are different In the 2-dimensional world of MZM anyons a topological path around one anyon is different from a path around two anyons as you cannot change one into the other without passing through one of the anyons These paths can be used to store information and develop topological entanglement Anyon Energy Paths (Author) If this was 3-dimensional you could move the blue path over the top of one of the red anyons and squish it to the same size as the green path and the two paths would be topologically similar Still in two dimensions the paths are topologically different it is this difference that makes them suitable as qubits Anyons can be braided to provide the operations needed to carry out the quantum gates A sequence of exchanging the anyons corresponding to the logical gate operators the anyons are swapped with each other the paths start to resemble shapes like these Braided Paths (Author) The braided nature of the system provides added error protection; even if the system is subject to small perturbations the topology of the system is unaffected These perturbations would cause errors in other systems Topological qubits have never been developed; their existence was entirely theoretical Two superconducting nanowires with four MZMs will be required to form a functional qubit; adding a third wire would give a second qubit and enable gate operations If MSFT can do this they will have an error-protected quantum computer and have to scale it into a quantum supercomputer This development will be the next step for Microsoft after a recent scientific breakthrough In 2022 MSFT announced the first major breakthrough in its quest for a topological quantum computer the Azure Quantum team has engineered devices that allow them to induce a topological phase of matter bookended by a pair of Majorana zero modes These quantum excitations dont normally exist in nature and must be coaxed into appearing under incredibly precise conditions In 2023 further published work showed that MSFT had engineered an MZM anyon that passed the topological gap protocol a series of tests designed to ensure the presence of a topological MZM phase gap This represents the first significant step to a fault-tolerant quantum supercomputer It is a groundbreaking step that has MSFT leading the charge toward developing an error-corrected supercomputer Having proven that they can create and control Majorana Zero Modes MSFT still has a lot to go According to their roadmap this is step 1 of 6 Quantum Road Map (Microsoft) We do not have a time frame to go with this roadmap but it is safe to say the end of the map is in the next decade not this one but that does not mean Quantum Computing will not be a significant revenue generator for Microsoft before then Considerable revenue generation will likely arrive many years before the first quantum supercomputer In June 2023 MSFT announced the preview of Azure Quantum elements It contained three key points Microsoft is running a parallel development path On one hand it is developing the superconducting hardware On the other hand it provides a quantum HPC AI simulation (gate operations running on classical computers) that allows users to prepare for the future and begin to take advantage of the quantum gate programming Learning a new way to program is not straightforward; the level of mathematics needed to apply quantum gate computing will be beyond many programmers but MSFT Azure Quantum is preparing people for the arrival of Quantum supercomputers The Azure co-pilot can write the code when you tell it what you want and can explain what is happening This is image is from the quantum computing learning page on Azure it shows the use of superposition in dirac notation in lines 3 and 4 Lines (MSFT Quantum Azure) Line 10 shows how we address an individual Qubit Line 13 shows how we apply a gate operation to that qubit with a single letter for the type of operation Line 4 shows how we measure the qubit And finally line 19 illustrates how we put the qubit back to its initial state More lines (Quantum Azure) Azure allows people to write compile and run quantum gate programs directly in the browser It gives access to the current Quantum computers from several suppliers including IonQ Rigetti Quantinuum QCI and Pasqal There is little need to use quantum computers as MSFT provides a simulation that runs on classical computers This simulation has proven enormously successful; it uses quantum gate computing but not quantum computers its power is surprising On January 9th MSFT released a press release exploring a recent experiment by the Quantum team to develop a new battery material The team started with more than 30 million candidate materials These were identified by changing elements in known crystal structures with other members of the periodic table The Azure system used its AI chemical simulations to screen out chemicals that would likely be unstable leaving 500000 candidates Further screening with AI tried to predict electrical storage capacity reducing the number to 800 These 800 candidates were screened using physics-based AI models Candidates passing this test underwent a further screening process using the slower more traditional screening technique of force calculations leaving 150 candidates showing promise An additional round of screening removed any known compounds and rare or unavailable chemicals The final list included 20 candidate materials taken to the lab The whole exercise was completed in one week After further screening the 20 candidates were reduced to 1 by PNNL using humans to look at the structure of the potential candidates The leading candidate was synthesized and tested It proved to be a novel viable battery electrolyte using 70% less lithium than existing batteries Azure Quantum and AI are inextricably linked MSFT co-pilot will allow people to write quantum gate computing code easily and intuitively Quantum gate computing running in a simulated environment has proven its usefulness and companies will not want to miss out on the potential of this research tool even before the Quantum computing hardware arrives Azure is already a large and fast-growing division within Microsoft Server products and cloud services revenue increased 22% (up 20% in constant currency) driven by Azure and other cloud services revenue growth of 30% (up 28% in constant currency) (MSFT: 2024 8-K 2024-1-30) MSFT is pursuing topological quantum computing in contrast to the competition Recent scientific breakthroughs suggest Microsoft may be on track to developing fault-tolerant qubits giving it a significant and sustainable technological advantage over its peers MSFT has demonstrated that its Quantum Azure cloud offering can provide fundamental technical advances to the industry The Azure Quantum programming tool Microsoft advanced AI and the Azure co-pilot will allow people to develop advanced gate computing algorithms many of which will run on the quantum simulation platform provided by Azure in the cloud Quantum Azure allows researchers to learn the tools needed for quantum computing and run algorithms on MSFT simulations or noisy quantum computers from other manufacturers MSFT has proven that advanced tasks beyond the reach of classical computers can be addressed with its AI tools and Quantum simulator by developing a viable new battery electrolyte Azure is already driving significant revenue growth for Microsoft cloud-based services and the recent addition of Quantum Azure could further increase this leading to a quantum leap in revenue when they develop fault-tolerant quantum supercomputers This article was written by Analyst’s Disclosure: I/we have a beneficial long position in the shares of MSFT either through stock ownership options or other derivatives I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha) I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article I also have positions in GOOG and IBM Seeking Alphas Disclosure: Past performance is no guarantee of future results No recommendation or advice is being given as to whether any investment is suitable for a particular investor Any views or opinions expressed above may not reflect those of Seeking Alpha as a whole Seeking Alpha is not a licensed securities dealer broker or US investment adviser or investment bank Our analysts are third party authors that include both professional investors and individual investors who may not be licensed or certified by any institute or regulatory body"

Nvidias recent growth spurt was entirely driven by the explosive growth of the artificial intelligence (AI) market Nvidias top-tier data center GPUs are used to process complex AI tasks more efficiently than stand-alone CPUs and companies scrambled to purchase those chips to keep pace with the growth of generative AI platforms like OpenAIs ChatGPT All of the worlds leading AI-oriented companies -- including OpenAI its top backer Microsoft Amazon Alphabets Google and Meta Platforms -- use Nvidias GPUs Its GPU sales to China were throttled by export curbs over the past year but the markets demand is still outstripping its supply by a significant margin Nvidia generated 78% of its revenue from its data center chips in fiscal 2024 compared to just 56% of its revenue in fiscal 2023 That rapid expansion curbed its dependence on gaming GPUs which previously generated most of its revenue but were highly exposed to the PC markets post-pandemic slowdown and the volatile crypto mining market The bulls believe Nvidia will continue to dominate the AI market even as its rival AMD enters the ring with its cheaper data center GPUs and cloud giants like Meta and Google start developing their own first-party AI GPUs Based on those rosy expectations analysts expect Nvidias revenue to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 35% from fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2027 as its EPS rises at a CAGR of 37% Nvidias stock isnt cheap at 35 times forward earnings and 18 times this years sales but it seems reasonably valued relative to its growth rates If it maintains those valuations meets analysts expectations and still trades at 35 times forward earnings by the beginning of fiscal 2027 (which starts in Jan 2026) its stock might be worth $1085 per share with a market cap of about $27 trillion by late 2025 That would represent a near-40% gain from its current levels We should take those hazy long-term estimates with a grain of salt since Nvidia repeatedly beat analysts expectations over the past year but they imply the chipmaker probably wont be more valuable than Microsoft by 2025 Microsoft has also tapped into the AI markets explosive growth via its big investment in OpenAI and the integration of its generative AI tools into its own cloud-based services Analysts expect its revenue and earnings to rise at a CAGR of 15% and 17% respectively from fiscal 2023 (which ended last June) to fiscal 2026 Like Nvidia Microsoft also trades at 35 times forward earnings If it maintains that premium multiple and matches Wall Streets expectations it could trade at about $550 with a market cap of $41 trillion by early 2026 Simply put Nvidia wont catch up to Microsoft unless the bulls abruptly bid its valuations to unsustainable levels or Microsoft drops the ball and gets revalued as a slower-growth company Instead of wondering if either of those scenarios will happen investors should focus on Nvidias growth potential instead of its market capitalization Its still selling picks and shovels for the AI gold rush and it could still have plenty of room to run before longer-term headwinds like AMDs GPUs or first-party chips meaningfully affect its growth Suzanne Frey an executive at Alphabet is a member of The Motley Fools board of directors Randi Zuckerberg a former director of market development and spokeswoman for Facebook and sister to Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg is a member of The Motley Fools board of directors John Mackey former CEO of Whole Foods Market an Amazon subsidiary is a member of The Motley Fools board of directors Leo Sun has positions in Amazon Apple and Meta Platforms The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Advanced Micro Devices Alphabet Amazon Apple Meta Platforms Microsoft and Nvidia The Motley Fool recommends the following options: long January 2026 $395 calls on Microsoft and short January 2026 $405 calls on Microsoft The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy Invest better with The Motley Fool Get stock recommendations portfolio guidance and more from The Motley Fools premium services Making the world smarter happier and richer © 1995 - 2024 The Motley Fool All rights reserved Market data powered by Xignite and Polygonio"

250,"Rising to the Challenge: This Aspiring Magnificent Seven Stock Is One to Watch in 2024","2/26/2024","https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/stocks/MSFT-Q/pressreleases/24348208/rising-to-the-challenge-this-aspiring-magnificent-seven-stock-is-one-to-watch-in-2024/","The Magnificent Seven stocks have been leading the stock market higher over the last couple of years Without them -- and the ongoing frenzy for artificial intelligence (AI) investments -- Wall Street wouldnt be enjoying an official bull run yet But this elite group doesnt come with a lifetime membership Or investors will eventually move on to a new market-moving club with a different set of members The FANG and FAANG groupings used to be the gold standard but Netflix dropped out while Apple Tesla Microsoft and Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) moved in 60 years ago there was the Nifty Fifty And the paragons of industry in the Dow Jones Industrial Average(DJINDICES: ^DJI) index are always on a rolling schedule -- the current Dow only has 17 names in common with the version you saw 20 years ago Image source: Getty Images I would posit that the Magnificent Seven wont be the hot ticket forever either Tesla seems to be slipping away while a hungry bunch of potential next-level winners are gaining ground On that note it wont surprise me if Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD) punches a ticket to the next era-defining league of Wall Streets crown jewels Yes I expect the unstoppable AI trend to promote another name into the sequel Let me explain why AMD might belong in the Return of the Seven If Nvidia is the king of AI hardware I think of AMD as the crown prince And the kid looks hungry for a higher status over time For instance lets look at the worlds largest and most powerful supercomputers Many of these big-iron systems are hard at work training AI engines right now with a heavy focus on the generative AI back-ends used in tools like ChatGPT or DALL-E 3 In the latest top-ten list six systems rely on Nvidias AI accelerator chips in the A100 and H100 series But AMDs Instinct MI250X serves the same purpose in two of the ten largest number-crunching systems -- including the top spot So AMD has some catching up to do in terms of broad market wins but the company can compete at the highest level Moreover Nvidias AI accelerator chips reportedly cost about four times as much as a comparable AMD solution Its not surprising to see heavyweight generative AI system builders such as Hewlett Packard Enterprise(NYSE: HPE) and Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) offering both Nvidia H100 and AMD Instinct solutions side by side Im sure their hyperscale customers are clamoring for the most cost-effective AI computing options and AMD has certainly earned a spot in that discussion So AMD undercuts Nvidias pricing without sacrificing AI-crunching performance On top of that the company runs a diverse and flexible business with several potential game-changers in its product portfolio AMD offers everything from PC and server processors to AI accelerators and custom embedded chips The $35 billion Xilinx buyout made AMD a giant of custom semiconductors with a heavy interest in industrial automation and defense systems Im not throwing mighty Nvidia under the bus here just pointing out that AMD is a robust competitor in many ways and actually superior in a few fields Sure Nvidias annual revenues are about twice the size of AMDs and its profit margins are wider overall but I think its unfair to give Nvidia a $2 trillion market cap while AMD is stuck at just $295 billion The financial gap is nowhere near that large and AMD should pose a stronger challenge to Nvidias AI dominance over time Even if AMD never takes Nvidias AI throne investors could see massive returns from a milder reshuffling of the booming AI industrys power balance AMD is not just rising to the challenge but is also setting the stage for a seismic shift in the dynamics of Wall Streets elite The perennial underdog of the PC processor wars has come a long way under resourceful CEO Lisa Su The chip designer stands out as a stock to watch in 2024 and beyond and I think it deserves consideration for membership in the next Magnificent Seven or FAANG club Where to invest $1000 right now

251,"Mistral AI Company Partnering with Microsoft: Who is the French Startup Rivaling OpenAI?","2/27/2024","https://www.ccn.com/news/mistral-ai-microsoft-investment/","Mistral founder Arthur Mensch was committed to open-source AI until recently Photo by Toby Melville - WPA Pool/Getty Images Key Takeaways Nearly 5 years since Microsoft first invested in OpenAI to help fund its research into artificial general intelligence the Big Tech firm shows no signs of slowing down its activity in the space At just 15 million euros Microsoft’s latest investment in Mistral AI is dwarfed by its now multi-billion dollar partnership with OpenAI But don’t underestimate the French startup Nor the deal’s potential value to Microsoft Through its partnership with OpenAI Microsoft secured access and distribution rights to some of the most valuable AI resources in the world In a sector that moves as fast as AI even that doesn’t guarantee the company’s ongoing relevance Today Large Language Models (LLMs) dominate and thanks to OpenAI Microsoft controls access to some of the most sought-after models on the market via Azure AI studio But 2 emerging trends could potentially upset the status quo Firstly small language models are fast catching up with their larger peers At the current pace of development SLMs could soon be able to perform the same tasks as contemporary LLMs but at just a fraction of the financial and computational cost to users Secondly open-source models have emerged as viable rivals to OpenAI’s GPT family offering developers unrestricted access to increasingly sophisticated AI capabilities for free With a research focus on smaller open-source language models Mistral is everything OpenAI isn’t As Mistral founder Arthur Mensch has previously discussed the modern field of machine learning (ML) is built on open-source foundations and prior to the recent AI business boom permissive licenses were the norm 1 Who is Mistral? Mistral is a Paris-based AI startup who has released incredible open source LLM (Mistral 7B & Mixtral 8x7B) that gained popularity in the open source community Mistral Medium with 32k is their commercial model which boasts comparable performance to GPT-35 pictwittercom/SN2GxWxNAB — Min Choi (@minchoi) February 26 2024 However referring to OpenAI’s ironically closed approach to distributing LLM services he observed that “all of a sudden in 2020 with GPT-3 this tide reversed” Founded in 2022 Mistral initially open-sourced all its AI models which came in a range of small and medium sizes However that all changed on Monday with the launch of Mistral Large As the name suggests Mistral Large is an LLM It is also not open source Unlike previous Mistral products the new AI system will be distributed to paying customers via – you guessed it – Microsoft Azure Today we are releasing Mistral Large our latest model Mistral Large is vastly superior to Mistral Medium handles 32k tokens of context and is natively fluent in English French Spanish German and Italian We have also updated Mistral Small on our API to a model that is… pictwittercom/MO4m6UIJUV — Guillaume Lample (@GuillaumeLample) February 26 2024 In other words through its partnership with Mistral Microsoft has added another LLM to its existing lineup prevented a potential GPT rival from being offered for free and acquired a stake in the burgeoning SLM space Not bad for 15 million euros As well as making its first foray into the market for paid LLM services Mistral also unveiled Le Chat a new chatbot built on top of its large and small language models Described as “a pedagogical and fun way to explore Mistral AI’s technology” the new interface isn’t currently positioned as a rival to ChatGPT Instead Le Chat lets Mistral showcase how its underlying AI models function in a live environment But if the French startup continues advancing its technology at the pace it has been it may not be long before it stands shoulder-to-shoulder with more established AI giants With Microsoft controlling access to a growing number of AI models its deal with Mistral is already facing scrutiny from the EU’s antitrust authorities Even before the latest announcement the European Commission had already opened an antitrust probe into Microsoft’s relationship with OpenAI Following similar investigations by the Federal Trade Commission and the UK’s Competitions and Markets Authority the Commission is looking into whether the Microsoft-OpenAI partnership stifles competition in the AI market According to Bloomberg the antitrust probe will now consider the firm’s investment in Mistral too The issue is especially sensitive given the role startups like Mistral played during negotiations over the EU’s AI Act when the French government pushed for exemptions to protect the interests of European AI developers This is a mind-blowing announcement Mistral AI the French company that has been fighting tooth and nail to water down the #AIAct s foundation model rules is partnering up with Microsoft So much for give us a fighting chance against Big Tech A 🧵1/8https://tco/WJtKNkq1K8 — Luca Bertuzzi (@BertuzLuca) February 26 2024 As quoted by Reuters European Parliament member Kim van Sparrentak said that the argument for granting concessions to AI developers “seems to have been a front for American-influenced big tech lobby” Commenting on the latest deal she added that “the Act almost collapsed under the guise of no rules for ‘European champions’ and now look European regulators have been played”"

257,"None","2/6/2024","https://www.microsoft.com/insidetrack/blog/seven-things-we-learned-deploying-microsoft-sales-copilot-at-microsoft/","How Microsoft does IT Feb 6 2024 Lukas Velush We’ve entered the age of AI and our salespeople are reaping the benefits here at Microsoft Thanks to Microsoft Sales Copilot their days are more efficient their communication is more streamlined and their interactions with essential sales tools don’t require them to interrupt their flow of work Since we launched the tool internally here at Microsoft we’ve learned a few best practices for deploying it easily and making full use of its features This post shares some of our learnings so you can take advantage of our experience when you activate Microsoft Sales Copilot at your organization Everything we’ve done in terms of our Dynamics 365 sales platform aims to give time back to sellers so they can invest it into customers With AI and copilots our technology is doing even more to help us reach that goal — Alexandra Jones senior business program and change manager Microsoft Digital [See how we’re simplifying our sales with AI-powered Microsoft Sales Copilot Get insights from our Lori Lamkin and Nathalie D’Hers on the power of Microsoft Sales Copilot Explore getting the most out of generative AI at Microsoft with good governance] Microsoft Sales Copilot maximizes productivity with an AI assistant specifically designed for sellers Like our other AI-powered tools it increases productivity and efficiency by providing intelligent digital assistance within Microsoft Teams and Outlook The added value of Microsoft Sales Copilot is working with Dynamics 365 or Salesforce to access use and input customer relationship management (CRM) data As a result it eliminates distracting tasks that eat away at their time and get in the way of what they do best—building relationships and solving problems “Everything we’ve done in terms of our Dynamics 365 sales platform aims to give time back to sellers so they can invest it into customers” says Alexandra Jones senior business program and change manager in Microsoft Digital the company’s IT organization “With AI and copilots our technology is doing even more to help us reach that goal” For sellers trying to do their jobs it’s all about that flow of information within the flow of action — Kerry Barrass director of business programs Microsoft Customer and Partner Solutions The sweet spot exists at the intersection of AI-enabled intelligence and CRM integration into the spaces where salespeople operate every day Within Microsoft Teams Sales Copilot delivers real-time call insights AI-generated meeting summaries post-call analyses and action items and more In Microsoft Outlook its abilities include crafting contextual email responses summarizing lengthy threads and creating Teams Collaboration Spaces associated with accounts and opportunities Across both workspaces Microsoft Sales Copilot makes it easier to create update or view CRM contacts opportunities and other data associated with sales accounts That mitigates the need for sellers to migrate to a different tool as they conduct the essential business of using or updating their CRM “For sellers trying to do their jobs it’s all about that flow of information within the flow of action” says Kerry Barrass director of business programs within Microsoft Customer and Partner Solutions “While the conversation is fresh the tool distills information down into consumable chunks and actionable items” Those features come in handy because sales are complex and require strong coordination across large teams One of our typical sales accounts involves anywhere from 20 to 50 individual employees each with a vital role to play As a result it’s extremely difficult to get everyone on a call or piece together the narrative underlying email threads “When I get copied into an email thread I used to need a knowledge transfer meeting to get up to speed” says Emilio Reyes Le Blanc a technology specialist in Microsoft Sales “This technology means I can just open an email thread have Copilot generate a summary and contextualize my existing relationships from the integrated pane within Outlook” Taken together these features deliver greater contextual understanding more efficient workflows and higher data fidelity within our CRM systems One day a magic button popped up in my Outlook and I got a prompt to try Sales Copilot so I taught myself to use it One of the beautiful things about this tool is that its time to value is extraordinary — Emilio Reyes Le Blanc technology specialist Microsoft Sales Deploying Microsoft Sales Copilot has provided us with some helpful insights Sellers have an eye for value and when they saw what Microsoft Sales Copilot could do it generated a lot of excitement The tool’s intuitive features mean that from a user perspective it isn’t a complicated solution As a result we’ve experienced a substantial organic boost to adoption “One day a magic button popped up in my Outlook and I got a prompt to try Sales Copilot so I taught myself to use it” Reyes Le Blanc says “One of the beautiful things about this tool is that its time to value is extraordinary” When you’re deploying Microsoft Sales Copilot to your own sellers focus on visibility first When the excitement takes hold it will boost adoption among your self-motivated salespeople Encourage that uptake to score some early champions Not everyone is a self-driven early adopter—and that’s perfectly alright! Effective change management starts with understanding your audience and the complexities of your sales environment We recommend building hero scenarios for each user persona by taking a granular look at their challenges sales processes and day-to-day work Dig into their role descriptions and documentation and ask what they’re trying to accomplish From there you can piece together your enablement materials based on what provides value Consider different learning formats and modalities as well “You want to make readiness consumable and provide options” Jones says “Some people want to show up to a demo session and some people want to watch a video on their own time so it’s important to offer a variety of pathways to adoption” Multimodality that includes courses demos written documentation and more will help your readiness efforts reach the most people with the most impact It’s always important to engage your leaders That includes both organizational leadership and product champions “Advocates and champions are always important not just for leading from the front” Barrass says “You also get more candid feedback by empowering these people to be part of pilot groups” Naturally enthusiastic executive sponsorship is essential especially with new technology Not only do leaders provide direction and encouragement for their organizations but they can also choose to give people space to allocate time and prioritize learning Cultivate those sponsorships early and actively Microsoft Sales Copilot sits on top of our existing data repositories so it engages with that data in the same way as any other connected tool It’s less about the solution and more about having a robust infrastructure of administrative policies and technologies safeguarding your organization — Alexandra Jones senior business program and change manager Microsoft Digital The same goes for employee champions By running internal pilots targeting key user scenarios you’ll ensure you receive early feedback to guide product development and a core of users who can help lead adoption across your organization Your organization might be cautious about how AI tools interact with their data repositories so deploying Microsoft Sales Copilot is a good opportunity to review your data-loss prevention setup By ensuring your policies are up to date you can prevent accidental data loss or exposure “Microsoft Sales Copilot sits on top of our existing data repositories so it engages with that data in the same way as any other connected tool” Jones says “It’s less about the solution and more about having a robust infrastructure of administrative policies and technologies safeguarding your organization” It will be essential to initiate reviews within several key disciplines Those include HR legal security and the IT team responsible for maintaining and protecting your data estate Within your sales teams themselves administrators may have concerns about access If that’s the case encourage them to conduct a thorough security and role review Guide those conversations using Microsoft Sales Copilot product documentation For sellers themselves building trust in a new technology takes time People might need to work up the confidence to try more intensive or involved features especially if they’re reticent about AI technology “Just start with two or three features that are really going to appeal to people” Jones says “Encourage sellers to ask what works best for their role” We suggest salespeople start small with meeting and email summarization capabilities They might not be ready to trust email drafting tools just yet but when they see how the intelligence works through summarization they’ll understand how Microsoft Sales Copilot engages with information After sellers have built up their understanding and confidence around how this tool engages with data they can experiment with different features that apply to their work Anyone in sales operations will tell you that high data fidelity in your CRM is crucial Leadership needs to know their institutional data is resilient Accuracy and completeness ensure up-to-date contact data along with a comprehensive view of relationships across internal and external teams All this information helps sales managers make effective decisions generate accurate forecasts and properly understand attrition In other words the business value of CRM data management is enormous It’s also prone to disarray because it formerly required salespeople to switch over to the CRM and input information Microsoft Sales Copilot changes all that “Historically the way for this to work is you would write the email then go to a different window find the account record go to the contacts list create a new one put in all of the contact’s information and save it” Reyes Le Blanc says “But here I can do all that in one fell swoop” If you’re a seller get used to creating and updating CRM contacts from within Microsoft Teams and Outlook using Microsoft Sales Copilot This feature eliminates the need to re-enter information directly into the CRM and builds healthy habits around data fidelity That flow of information works the other way as well Be sure to use the contact card feature to view summaries of customer information from within Microsoft Outlook and Teams That ensures you’re working with the most up-to-date data directly from your CRM Prompt creation will become increasingly important as AI tools mature so it’s worth honing those skills using Microsoft Sales Copilot’s email drafting feature A simple rule to remember is that the more you put in the more you get out “If you have specifics off the bat like you know you want to schedule a meeting or there are a few key points to express include those in your prompt” Jones says “Be succinct and save your own time because that’s what the technology is for” Prompting is just like any other practice The more you work at it the easier it becomes Microsoft salespeople have already seen amazing success and we’re just getting started Within our sales organization 125K out of 35K sales roles are Microsoft Sales Copilot monthly active users—more than a third of the workforce For a technology in its first year that’s remarkable progress As a seller I can’t imagine working without artificial intelligence — Emilio Reyes Le Blanc technology specialist Microsoft Sales Reyes Le Blanc estimates that he’s saving two hours each month creating contacts in Dynamics 365 and five hours a month reviewing emails With over 6 million seller emails sent in our first quarter of this fiscal year the potential for email time savings alone is enormous He also finds his meeting notes much more accurate now that Microsoft Sales Copilot has his back especially when it comes to long lists of technologies or technical requirements It’s the ideal tool for gathering details via the meeting review feature and performing keyword or conversational analyses “This is a way to do more with less” Reyes Le Blanc says “As a seller I can’t imagine working without artificial intelligence” Considering our average salesperson participates in 17 meetings per week those efficiencies really add up As new features and integrations come into play Microsoft Sales Copilot’s horizons will only widen Start using AI to streamline your selling experience with Microsoft Sales

a state-of-the-art data centre campus in Kosmosdal Centurion in South Africa This investment in technology infrastructure will solidify the big tech company’s commitment to advancing data management capabilities According to the tech company “Still in the early phases of development Microsoft aims to build out its cloud infrastructure in new areas of South Africa to meet growing demand from public sector and private organisations for cloud and AI services and solutions in Africa” The company added that it is looking forward to working with the municipality local organisations and the residents of Kosmosdal as it develops the data centre plans in a sustainable way In a report by Broadband Microsoft was said to be the second “hyperscaler” to officially launch cloud computing services in South Africa after delaying the launch of its local Azure nodes several times Due to this Huawei surpassed them by a day Microsoft formally inaugurated data centres in South Africa in March 2019 located in Johannesburg and Cape Town Azure Availability Zones were introduced in the South Africa North region by Microsoft in October 2021 The company affirmed its 30-year presence in South Africa expressing dedication to expediting technology transformation and digital empowerment and making substantial investments in infrastructure innovation skills and enterprise development for the benefit of all South Africans According to the Bill Gate-founded company “This campus for data centres signifies the subsequent phase in Microsoft’s dedication to fostering and hastening the pace of digital transformation in South Africa and across the African continent ensuring inclusivity trustworthiness and responsibility in its approach” Read More: Microsoft hires former OpenAI executives Sam Altman and Greg Brockman to lead advanced AI team In September 2023 TechNext reported that Microsoft was considering an investment of at least $1 billion in South Africa with plans to potentially power its data centres using nuclear energy The company posted a job listing for a Principal Program Manager for Nuclear Technology suggesting a focus on integrating controversial nuclear energy into future data centres The successful candidate was expected to oversee the development and implementation of a global Small Modular Reactor (SMR) and microreactor energy strategy According to the job listing spotted by CNBC Microsoft’s potential move aligns with exploring the use of small nuclear power plants with an estimated cost of around $1 billion Such plants could have the capacity to power approximately 300000 homes but costs might escalate to as much as $68 billion depending on the nuclear reactor’s capacity If realized Microsoft could be allocating between $1 billion to $68 billion to each country hosting its data centres This undertaking is prominent considering the company’s vast network of over 200 data centres across 35 countries worldwide Notably South Africa stands as the sole African country housing Microsoft’s data centres with two facilities in Johannesburg and Cape Town Before last year September the company had earlier announced the general availability of Dynamics 365 and the Power platform at its enterprise-grade data centres in Johannesburg and Cape Town The company emphasized it to be a testament to its commitment to investing in South Africa During an online press conference Microsoft highlighted that this step would enhance cloud capacity and capabilities facilitating faster growth for organizations The South African data centres began offering Azure Microsoft 365 Dynamics 365 and Power Platform online services to support various organizations Additionally Microsoft pointed out that Power Platform a low-code/no-code solution enables individuals within an organization to swiftly build custom solutions without extensive reliance on IT resources Karin Jones Microsoft South Africa Director of Business Applications GTM mentioned that leaders in organizations are actively seeking digital solutions to enhance innovation flow across businesses breaking down silos between data sources people processes and insights She highlighted the significance of these cloud services being delivered from South Africa enabling local companies to securely move their businesses to the cloud while adhering to data residency sovereignty and compliance requirements Microsoft’s announcement coincided with Google’s launching of a new Google Cloud region in South Africa This followed the footsteps of Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure both of which had previously invested in significant cloud infrastructure and data centres in the country Microsoft Azure established data centres in Johannesburg and Cape Town in March 2019 making it the first global provider to do so AWS launched its Africa Region in Cape Town in April 2020 Karin Jones noted the growing recognition of cloud value in South Africa citing the State of Cybersecurity in South Africa report which revealed that nearly half (48%) of organizations in the country were utilizing the cloud as a platform and driver of digital innovation Furthermore 61% of South African organizations reported increased spending on cloud solutions in 2021 compared to 2020 Read More: Microsoft could be investing $1bn in South Africa with nuclear-powered data centre plans

Luke Lango’s “2nd Trillion-Dollar AI Trade” The US govt just unlocked an $8 trillion market to move in a new direction See how it could unleash 6000% potential upside These Magnificant 7 stocks have strong positive catalysts and attractive valuations Advertisement Source: Shutterstock When it comes to investing in equities buying stocks that are benefiting a great deal from current trends and those poised for a significant lift from future trends is a very good approach to take After all as we saw from the performances of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) during last year’s artificial intelligence (AI) boom company stocks that exploited trends could rally tremendously Another important factor when it comes to choosing the best stocks to buy is valuation Specifically stocks with very high valuations relative to their growth can often plunge a great deal if their issuing companies miss the Street’s expectations by even small amounts Given these points when choosing the three best Magnificent 7 stocks to buy I selected those benefiting from strong current trends and without very high valuations Microsoft is getting a huge boost from the AI boom That’s because MSFT is the largest investor in the popular AI-powered chatbot ChatGPT while the software giant is infusing AI into its operating system Moreover as the owner of the second-largest cloud infrastructure provider Azure MSFT will be able to sell many AI-powered services to its current customers Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) recently named MSFT one of its top three software picks Citing “the newest AI wave improving IT spending and the continued shift to the Cloud” the bank is generally bullish on the software sector What’s more Bank of America expects the strong demand for AI to accelerate the growth of Azure and MSFT Office offerings Also upbeat on MSFT stock recently was Dan Ives the well-known analyst at investment bank Wedbush Ives named MSFT as one of his top nine picks in the tech sector MSFT stock has a reasonably attractive forward price-earnings ratio of 33 Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS is the largest cloud infrastructure provider As a result AWS should get a huge boost from selling AI services As I noted in a Dec 6 column the tech giant “unveiled many new AI-oriented services it’s going to sell” including an “AI assistant…and a new AI chip” I believe the growth of Amazon’s e-commerce business will also accelerate as AI makes the experience even better and Amazon takes steps to deliver products even faster To a lesser extent the company should benefit from an acceleration of ad spending this year as “Ad spending growth is widely forecast to accelerate in 2024” Forbes reported last month Spending on “retail media” ads a sector in which AMZN is a “dominant” player is expected to jump almost 23% this year the website reported Amazon is expected to generate over $3 billion of ad revenue just from its decision to start placing ads on its Prime Video content Meanwhile I remain convinced that over the longer term pharmaceuticals will prove to be a needle mover for AMZN stock Amazon’s forward price-earnings ratio of 37 is elevated but more than justified by the company’s many powerful growth catalysts As a result I view AMZN as the best name among the Magnificent 7 stocks Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG NASDAQ:GOOGL) has a relatively small but rapidly growing cloud-infrastructure business Google Cloud that should get a big boost from selling AI services Moreover AI should significantly improve the company’s core search business and will likely spur an acceleration in the growth of its search revenue Indeed according to Forbes “Deploying generative AI search experiences opens the door for different ad formats and placements as well as an increase in surfaced links and content AI can also drive help revenues higher from bid optimization” Also noteworthy is that GOOG released its own AI-powered chatbot called Bard which should greatly enhance its search services and generate a significant amount of revenue for the company Finally the revenue of GOOG’s YouTube business jumped 125% in Q3 As a result I believe the stock will get a meaningful boost from the app’s rapid growth going forward GOOG has a very attractive forward price-earnings ratio of 206 times On the date of publication Larry Ramer did not hold (either

Microsoft’s OpenAI services February 1 2024 Microsoft reported a 24% increase in cloud revenue with AI “winning new customers” according to CEO Satya Nadella He revealed that Azure AI now has 53000 customers – and over one-third are new to Azure over the past 12 months during the earnings call for the company’s Q2 fiscal 2024 which runs from October to December 2023 Nadella said customers were flocking to its platform to access large language models from its partners such as Cohere Meta and Mistral “without having to manage [the] underlying infrastructure” Nadella told analysts that Azure OpenAI and then OpenAI’s own APIs on top of Azure were “major drivers” of the company’s AI services tailwind with over half of Fortune 500 firms using either service “There is a lot of the small batch training that goes on whether its a graph or fine-tuning and then lots of people who are starting to use models as a service with all the other new models but its predominantly Azure OpenAI today” Another factor the Microsoft CEO touted as a driving force for bringing in new customers was the company’s small language models (SLMs) like Phi While on par with the company’s larger models these smaller systems are small enough to run on a consumer device – meaning they do not cost as much to run Related:Microsoft is Now Worth $3 Trillion Thanks to Gen AI “Anker Ashley AT&T EY and Thomson Reuters for example are all already exploring how to use our SLM Phi for their applications and we have great momentum with Azure OpenAI Service” the Microsoft CEO revealed “We move from talking about AI to applying AI at scale” Nadella said By infusing AI across every layer of our tech stack we’re winning new customers and helping drive new benefits and productivity gains across every sector” Microsoft reported revenue of $62 billion up 18% from a year ago Net income rose 33% to $219 billion ($293 per diluted share) in the quarter The stock fell 27% to $39758 on Jan 31 the first trading day after the earnings report BofA Global Research analyst Brad Sills said Microsoft’s outlook for Q3 was lower than Street expectations due to weakness in games Also growth in company sign-ups for Office was “disappointing” due to lackluster adoption of Copilot for Microsoft 365 The rest of the business was “solid” according to his research note that was shared with AI Business Pricing for Copilot E3 ($36 per user per month add-on to 365 subscription) and E5 ($57 per user per month add-on) plans have been criticized as high when it was revealed last July Investors also punished Google-parent Alphabet’s stock this week even after posting a 13% increase in revenue to $863 billion and 52% increase in net income for the quarter ended Dec 31 2023 BofA Global Research analyst Justin Post said search revenue fell short of “high expectations” Related:Test Drive: Microsoft Copilot Pro is Useful But has Flaws Nadella told analysts the company expects revenue for Copilot for Microsoft 365 to grow “over time” The company did not disclose the number of users the service has amassed but Nadella likened the rate of adoption to the early days of the PC “Just like PCs became standard issue at some point after PCs being adopted by early adopters” he said of AI offerings like 365 Copilot The Microsoft CEO expressed optimism however contending that the improvement 365 Copilot could bring to work and workflows will change “as people summarize faster draft regulatory submissions faster chat to get knowledge from your business” Also benefiting from Microsoft’s AI push was GitHub which recorded revenue growth of over 40% year-over-year The company said that GitHub Copilot the AI-powered coding assistant tool helped drive that revenue growth Nadella told analysts that GitHub Copilot has over 13 million paid subscribers up 30% quarter-over-quarter Some 50000 organizations are using the business version of GitHub Copilot including the likes of Dell Etsy and

Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage lets see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Microsoft (MSFT) Microsoft currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 114 on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell) calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy Hold Sell etc) made by 37 brokerage firms An ABR of 114 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy Of the 37 recommendations that derive the current ABR 33 are Strong Buy and three are Buy Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 892% and 81% of all recommendations Brokerage Recommendation Trends for MSFT Check price target & stock forecast for Microsoft here>>>The ABR suggests buying Microsoft but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea According to several studies brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias According to our research brokerage firms assign five Strong Buy recommendations for every Strong Sell recommendation This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors giving little insight into the direction of a stocks future price movement It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements With an impressive externally audited track record our proprietary stock rating tool the Zacks Rank which classifies stocks into five groups ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) is a reliable indicator of a stocks near -term price performance So validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision Zacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR Although both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5 they are different measures altogether The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 128) In contrast the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5 Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers they mislead investors far more often than they guide In contrast the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions according to empirical research Furthermore the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year In other words at all times this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness When you look at the ABR it may not be up-to-date Nonetheless since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough it is always timely in predicting future stock prices Should You Invest in MSFT? In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Microsoft the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 44% over the past month to $1163 Analysts growing optimism over the companys earnings prospects as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate along with three other factors related to earnings estimates has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Microsoft You can see the complete list of todays Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>> Therefore the Buy-equivalent ABR for Microsoft may serve as a useful guide for investors Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

trillion market to move in a new direction See how it could unleash 6000% potential upside Heres why Microsoft should remain a top pick for long-term investors right now Advertisement Source: Asif Islam / Shutterstockcom Microsoft’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) recent investment in OpenAI has positioned the company as a top AI-related stock to buy with plenty of near-term momentum The company has adopted a well-rounded focus on its core business segments with software and cloud operations providing the sort of cash flow to fund various high-growth endeavors As the world demands more cloud resources Microsoft’s AI and cloud capabilities position it for growth over the long term This is central to my MSFT stock analysis Despite a modest dividend yield and a forward price-earnings ratio reflecting anticipation Microsoft’s strategic investments make it a contender in the high-growth segments of the tech market that matter Accordingly for long-term investors looking for a no-brainer pick among the mega-cap names here’s why I think MSFT stock should be on the list Driven by its Intelligent Cloud revenue with 20% increase Microsoft certainly should be proud of its Q4 2023 earnings report Azure AI customers surged driving an impressive increase of 60% in MSFT stock post-report Over the past three months Microsoft’s stock price has been a bit more volatile though the trend remains headed in the right direction The company’s return on equity (ROE) metric is indicative of the company’s health and how shareholder capital is utilized Microsoft boasts an impressive ROE of 28% easily surpassing the industry average of 10% fueling its 16% net income growth in the past five years This positions the company well for future investment even at these higher levels Microsoft’s three-year median payout ratio is 27% indicating efficient reinvestment and a well-covered dividend With over ten years of consistent dividend payments Microsoft prioritizes profit-sharing with shareholders Analysts project a steady future payout ratio of 22% aligning with the company’s current ROE of 28% This is a key part of my MSFT stock analysis Microsoft has embarked on a global AI initiative pledging $56 billion for European expansion Investments in Spain and Germany highlight the company’s strategic growth plans The clarification was valuable mainly since the Spanish announcement primarily focused on data center construction possibly to comply with EU data storage regulations Brad Smith the company’s president announced the investment on social media emphasizing Microsoft’s commitment to Spain’s security development and digital transformation This follows Microsoft’s previous investment of $345 million in AI-related initiatives in Germany Indeed US tech giants including Microsoft and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) aim to expand their AI presence in European governance and cybersecurity sectors This investment wave may sway European politicians favoring local AI startups toward some of the more prominent global mega-cap names Microsoft is a top stock choice among 910 hedge funds with 306 such funds currently holding stakes as of Q3 2023 Citi has endorsed Microsoft as a prime large-cap buy for 2024 estimating the company will report earnings per share just shy of $12 Praise is certainly due following Microsoft’s latest earnings report notably for its AI ventures Wedbush’s Dan Ives highlights Microsoft’s enterprise AI adoption potential foreseeing substantial demand Microsoft remains a top stock that analysts investors and the market will continue to focus on in 2024 I don’t see many scenarios where this company will give up its leadership in its core segments Accordingly MSFT stock remains a buy-and-hold recommendation in my books This concludes my MSFT stock analysis On the date of publication Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article The opinions expressed in this article

296,"Maltese startup TriStratus opens office in Cairo","2/25/2024","https://timesofmalta.com/article/maltese-startup-tristratus-opens-office-cairo.1085749","“When we set up the company we were just three colleagues but we were driven by the strong belief in pushing the boundaries of the cloud services industry We understood the transformative power of cloud solutions we saw a gap in the local market for a cloud-first and cloud-only partner and this made us more determined to push the boundaries of what’s possible in the cloud services industry” Founded in 2021 TriStratus emerged as a visionary Microsoft startup through the collaborative efforts of Kevin Abela Jonathan Abela and Asif Akram United by a shared commitment to innovation and excellence in cloud services the trio has steered the company into a new era of digital transformation Today TriStratus prides itself on being a fully remote company dedicated to delivering bespoke cloud solutions that empower businesses worldwide “We noticed how established IT companies primarily focused on hardware-based solutions and treated cloud services as an offshoot of their business We recognized the potential to become a cloud-first and cloud-only partner that prioritizes customer needs and drives business success through tailored cloud solutions and this led us to form the company” explains Kevin Abela TriStratus’ managing director After just three years in operation TriStratus has just opened its first overseas office in Cairo Egypt to be able to tap into the Middle East’s potential By the end of this month TriStratus will already be employing 26 people “Not bad for a startup that started operations during the Covid pandemic” added Abela TriStratus operates fully as a remote-based company allowing it to serve its clients efficiently from any location “We chose to operate like this because we want to practice what we preach Showing our clients that we can operate as a fully remote-based company encourages them to understand that exceptional cloud services are possible no matter their location” “We also feel that eliminating geographical limitations has allowed us to expand our services beyond Malta and serve clients on a regional basis which was an important factor in our fast growth rate” he added Unlike other companies TriStratus does not believe in migrating customers to the cloud just for the sake of it but its goal is to ensure they obtain maximum value from adopting the cloud driving growth efficiency and innovation for their businesses “We go beyond the technicalities by focusing on a customer-centric approach and by partnering with our clients to understand their unique needs and business goals which enables us to plan and deliver tailored cloud solutions that maximize value for our clients” he added In 2023 after just two years of operation TriStratus was awarded the prestigious Microsoft Partner of the Year Award a recognition that confirmed the company’s direction and vision for further growth “We always believed that this vision can only be accomplished by staying at the forefront of cloud technology by providing exceptional customer experiences to our partners seeking digital transformation and growth in the cloud era But leveraging our recognition as Microsoft’s Partner of the Year gave us a stronger competitive advantage” Abela reminisces about the company’s early days as a Microsoft startup “We found in Microsoft all the guidance and support that any startup would be looking for They helped us keep things real offered us mentoring and guidance the technological backing that we required to start and kept assisting us along the way “I think that no matter how much you believe in your project – and we did believe in ours – knowing that you have the backing of a global leader makes all the difference” “Really and truly startups operating in Malta can rest assured that the support is all there Today so many companies are partnering together specifically to assist startups across all aspects of running a business And with the technological backing and mentorship that the Microsoft For Startups Founders Hub can provide anyone with a great idea a well-devised plan and the right dose of passion and commitment can succeed” he added “Navigating the cloud landscape requires confidence and this is what we can offer businesses who want to achieve their full potential in this ever-evolving digital world “As for TrisStratus besides growing locally our vision is to continue expanding beyond Malta as we are in fact doing to become a dominant player in the regional cloud services market “More importantly we want to partner with those businesses who seek digital transformation and growth Because only when our clients grow that we can grow with them” concluded Abela You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform By subscribing you

303,"After Earnings and a Big Rally Is Microsoft Stock a Buy a Sell or Fairly Valued?","2/5/2024","https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/after-earnings-big-rally-is-microsoft-stock-buy-sell-or-fairly-valued","With better-than-expected results here’s what we think of Microsoft stock Microsoft MSFT released its fiscal second-quarter earnings report on Jan 30 With Microsoft’s stock up 57% in the past year here’s Morningstar’s take on the company’s earnings report and outlook Microsoft continues to impress with its solid second-quarter results including upside on both the top and bottom lines We find the firm’s outlook encouraging especially for Azure Though management will not admit as much we continue to see indicators that the demand environment has improved at least modestly Artificial intelligence stole the show again this quarter Azure is strong especially thanks to AI Large deals are also good as Microsoft Office E5 upsells very well Commercial bookings are in a good position Overall profitability is strong despite headwinds from the Activision acquisition We raised our near/mid-term estimates based on continued strong results from both a revenue growth and margin perspective We also see AI as a bigger boost to both than what we initially modeled Beyond that results are consistent with our belief that Azure is a leader in the public cloud and Microsoft’s near-monopoly positions with Windows and Office support our wide moat rating However shares have run sharply over the last year so the stock is fairly valued We think enterprise users are still cautious about the macroeconomic outlook and are not currently willing to aggressively invest in IT programs/projects With its 3-star rating we believe Microsoft’s stock is fairly valued compared with our long-term fair value estimate of $420 per share which implies a fiscal 2024 enterprise value/sales multiple of 12 times adjusted P/E multiple of 36 times and a 1% free cash flow yield We model a five-year compound annual growth rate for revenue of approximately 13% inclusive of the Activision acquisition We envision stronger revenue growth ahead as Microsoft’s prior decade was bogged down by the downturn in 2008 the complete evaporation of mobile handset revenue from the disposal of the Nokia handset business and the transition to the subscription model (which initially saw slower revenue growth) However we believe macro and currency factors will pressure revenue in the near term We think revenue growth will be driven by Azure Office 365 Dynamics 365 LinkedIn and emerging AI adoption and that Azure in particular will be the most critical revenue driver over the next 10 years as hybrid environments (where Microsoft excels) drive mass cloud adoption We also anticipate that the combination of Azure DBMS Dynamics 365 and Office 365 will drive above-market growth as CIOs continue to consolidate vendors We foresee More Personal Computing growing modestly above GDP over the next 10 years Read more about Microsoft’s fair value estimate We assign Microsoft overall a wide moat arising from switching costs network effects and cost advantages We believe the firm is a leader across a variety of key technology areas which should result in economic returns well over its cost of capital for years to come We think Microsoft’s different segments and products benefit from different moat sources The Productivity and Business Processes segment includes Office Dynamics and LinkedIn We assign it a wide moat based on high switching costs and network effects In our view high switching costs and cost advantages drive a wide moat for Azure which is clearly the growth engine for the Intelligent Cloud segment and one of the critical products the “new” Microsoft will be built around Read more about Microsoft’s moat rating Microsoft faces risks that vary among its products and segments High market share in the client-server architecture over the last 30 years means significant high-margin revenue is at risk particularly in OS Office and Server Microsoft has thus far been successful in growing revenues in a constantly evolving technology landscape and it’s enjoying success in both moving existing workloads to the cloud for current customers and attracting new clients directly to Azure However the company must continue to drive revenue growth for cloud-based products faster than revenue declines for on-premises products Microsoft is acquisitive and while many small acquisitions are completed that fly under the radar the company has had several high-profile flops including Nokia and aQuantive The LinkedIn acquisition was expensive but served a purpose and we think it’s working out well It is not clear how much Microsoft bought in the Permira-led Informatica LBO and it may have been an important strategic investment but Informatica was certainly not a growth catalyst GitHub was expensive but strategic and seems to be shaping up as a success while the ZeniMax deal should boost the company’s first-party video game publishing efforts While Nuance was not hard to digest the $69 billion Activision deal was completed in October 2023 and will likely be a bit more involved Read more about Microsoft’s risk

newly updated for 2023 Microsoft is all-in on AI having invested more than $10 billion in OpenAI to date and releasing a multitude of generative AI offerings in its ‘Copilot’ range throughout 2023 It’s clear that generative AI has had a profound impact on Microsoft’s market cap leading the firm to surpass Apple While AWS and Google Cloud have AI offerings of their own Microsoft’s sprint to ally itself with OpenAI and its race against time to bring AI to Bing ahead of similar efforts by Google speak to a focus and urgency on the technology Nadella has described Google as an “800-pound gorilla” in the browser market and previously emphasized the opportunity for Microsoft to claw back a share for itself through its AI features This strategy appears to be paying off with Bing hitting 100 million daily users for the first time ever in March 2023 driven by AI interest Microsoft’s control of GitHub has also teed it up nicely for the AI boom with Nadella’s focus on enterprise AI being key Early fears that Microsoft’s $75 billion acquisition of the developer platform would see it snuff out open source competition haven’t come to fruition ensuring the platform retains its 100-million strong developer community This in turn has allowed Microsoft to capture a hefty chunk of the AI pair-programmer market through GitHub Copilot Enterprise which leverages generative AI to improve developer productivity It’s this joined-up long-term vision for the company that Nadella has helped craft With its firm cloud offering AI capabilities and ever-growing portfolio of services the firm is in a stronger position than it ever has been and has grown far less reliant on consumer shocks In Nadella’s decade of power he’s been forced to contend with some serious challenges at Microsoft both direct and indirect His leadership of Microsoft on its journey to a cross-platform provider of cloud and intelligent computing services has been largely successful but course corrections have been necessary along the way As early as 2016 Nadella was pitching the potential of human-machine collaboration and predicting a future defined by talking bots Microsoft had been burned by the scandal around its Tay chatbot which had been given its own Twitter account in a public-facing test of its conversational AI abilities AWS Microsoft and Google see massive cloud opportunities in Japan - here’s whyVodafone eyes cloud overhaul and generative AI gains in $15 billion deal with MicrosoftSneak-and-peek Midnight Blizzard attack highlights “worrying flaws” in Microsoft security processes Malicious users flooded Tay with discriminatory tweets causing the chatbot to quickly begin producing racist and inflammatory tweets of its own leading Microsoft researchers to turn Tay off just 16 hours after setting it live This was a humiliating chapter in Microsoft’s journey toward useful AI Nadella later stated that Tay forced Microsoft to “take accountability” for its projects and subsequent endeavors have not become public-facing without extensive testing beforehand But his vision for Microsoft in which it would deliver AI services that respond to natural language inputs and backed by the power of Azure’s processing capabilities has now been brought to life A recent example of this can be found in the chaos at OpenAI in November which saw CEO Sam Altman ousted for several days amidst an apparent board revolt The much-publicized spat lasted five days in which time OpenAI had two interim CEOs and ended with Altman returning to the firm alongside a heavily reshuffled board Deliver engaging digital experiences across every touchpoint in 5 simple steps DOWNLOAD NOW The chaos put Nadella in a difficult position Microsoft had worked hard for the previous year to make OpenAI core to its value proposition with GPT-4 powering Copilot and the firm’s models forming the backbone of Azure’s AI offerings After publicly welcoming OpenAI CTO Mira Murati as interim CEO Nadella was forced to welcome her successor Emmett Shear just three days later as Murati left the post On November 20 2023 Nadella announced that Altman and Greg Brockman former president of OpenAI would be joining Microsoft to lead a new “advanced AI research team” This role seemingly evaporated just a day later with the news that Altman was back in charge at OpenAI The week of confusion put a spotlight on Nadella’s interest in OpenAI and by extension the relationship between the startup and Microsoft Shortly after the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) announced an initial review into OpenAI and Microsoft’s relationship and impact on competition in the AI market Nadella has described OpenAI and Microsoft’s ties as a “pro-competition partnership” but depending on the temperament of regulators may come to regret the lengths to which his bet on OpenAI has extended Nadella’s reign has arguably been one of curious contradictions While he has overseen the undisputable rise of the company in its cloud and intelligent computing segments he has also been the de-facto steward of decline when it comes to Microsoft’s devices division There are a number of factors at play here as PC shipments have suffered their worst decline in history and initial pandemic spend on devices wanes amid a return to office and economic woes Aside from Tay Nadella has also had to deal with his fair share of controversy New Microsoft Copilot updates target individual users small businesses with ‘Pro’ subscription tier and cheaper pricing“A long time coming” - Microsoft data residency plans will see firm store all cloud customer data in the EUGoogle Cloud just waived data transfer fees for customers and took a big swipe at Microsoft in the process HoloLens is a prime example of a Microsoft misstep under Nadella The firm pinned great hopes on its augmented reality headsets through which it hoped to carve out a solid place for itself in the burgeoning wearables market At the time they were announced Business Insider reported Nadella describing them as “the new desktop” but the market responded with apathy HoloLens hasn’t quite suffered the same fate as Google Glass which finally ended life in March 2023 after its enterprise model failed to generate business interest The goggles have endured as mixed reality headsets for industrial environments from manufacturing floors to construction sites in collaboration with the industry solutions firm Trimble The devices that Nadella initially sold as the future of consumer computing have also found a second life at the US Department of Defense A $480 million contract with the US Army signed in 2018 sparked protests within the firm Nadella spoke out in defense of the deal in 2019 telling CNN that Microsoft “made a principled decision that we’re not going to withhold technology from institutions that we have elected in democracies to protect the freedoms we enjoy” This could be a fight that Nadella will be forced to revisit as Microsoft scored a $22 billion order for HoloLens in 2021 – though Congressional reductions on this spending have reduced its value to approximately $165 million Reports by The Intercept that OpenAI’s fresh leadership team has removed its ban on using its models for military usage could add to these concerns for Nadella as his work to align Microsoft closer with the AI firm puts him in the firing line for future discussions on ethical AI Rory Bathgate is Features and Multimedia Editor at ITPro overseeing all in-depth content and case studies He can also be found co-hosting the ITPro Podcast with Jane McCallion swapping a keyboard for a microphone to discuss the latest learnings with thought leaders from across the tech sector In his free time Rory enjoys photography video editing and good science fiction After graduating from the University of Kent with a BA in English and American Literature Rory undertook an MA in Eighteenth-Century Studies at King’s College London He joined ITPro in 2022 as a graduate following four years in student journalism You can contact Rory at rorybathgate@futurenetcom or on LinkedIn How tech leaders can manage conflict in the workplace Equinix announces leadership changes with former Google exec joining as CEO CI/CD comes into focus as enterprises ramp up application modernization efforts By Daniel ToddMarch 21 2024 By George FitzmauriceMarch 21 2024 By Steve RangerMarch 20 2024 By Steve RangerMarch 20 2024 By Daniel ToddMarch 20 2024 By Solomon KlappholzMarch 20 2024 By Solomon KlappholzMarch 20 2024 By Emma WoollacottMarch 20 2024 By George FitzmauriceMarch 20 2024 By Steve RangerMarch 19 2024 By George FitzmauriceMarch 19 2024 Posted Posted Posted Posted IT Pro is part of Future US Inc an international media group and leading digital publisher Visit our corporate site © Future US Inc Full 7th Floor 130 West 42nd Street New York NY 10036"

No Microsoft did not announce it would disable computers of people who share “non-mainstream content” Microsoft has no plans to disable the computers of people who share certain content online There is no evidence Microsoft ever suggested doing this and the company denies they plan on doing it No there are no plans to disable any computers for users as described in these claims” a Microsoft spokesperson told VERIFY The false claim stems from the headline of an article on the digital media site The People’s Voice which doesnt even say Microsoft will disable people’s computers outside of the headline The article is instead about an NBC interview with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella in which Nadella talks about how Microsoft might detect misinformation such as deepfakes The People’s Voice has been fact-checked previously for multiple stories with false headlines The article itself is four paragraphs long none of which mention disabling computers The story references misinformation and disinformation not “non-mainstream content” The article also includes a link to a YouTube video posted by NBC News of an interview between Lester Holt and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella There is also no mention of disabling computers in that video clip NBC posted a longer version of the same interview with Nadella in two parts on its website and there is no mention of disabling computers there either Holt does ask Nadella a question about AI and misinformation in reference to the upcoming presidential election Nadella talks about ways tech companies can detect AI and misinformation but he doesn’t say anything about Microsoft or other tech companies policing it VERIFY also could not find any announcement on Microsoft’s website suggesting it would disable computers based on the content people shared online The VERIFY team works to separate fact from fiction so that you can understand what is true and false Please consider subscribing to our daily newsletter text alerts and our YouTube channel You can also follow us on Snapchat Instagram Facebook and TikTok Learn More » Text: 202-410-8808"

instead getting a bit nervous that the Fed and other influential central banks won’t race to dramatically cut rates while inflation lingers solidly above target levels On the other hand the selling

of the last decade Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Valuation-wise MSFT trades at a 10% discount to its 10-year highs at 325X forward 12-month earnings Microsoft appears far cheaper when factoring in its longer-term earnings growth outlook since its PEG ratio of 21 offers 5% value vs its 10-year median and a 32% discount to its highs—MSFT is also trading nearly in line with the Zacks

launches new benefits for partners with access to Copilot AI GenAI Azure tools Microsoft has started to roll out three types of partner benefits packages aimed at solution providers at different growth stages with the packages including access to Microsoft Sales Copilot product licenses Azure credits and more The three packages are Partner Launch Benefits Partner Success Core Benefits and Partner Success Expanded Benefits according to the Redmond Wash-based tech giant Monday marks the availability of the packages in major markets with the packages expanding to most other locations by the end of March “With the amount of innovation that Microsoft is releasing into the market particularly around our AI workloads its really important that we continue to deliver benefits that support our partners’ growth and to ultimately help deliver success to their customers” Julie Sanford Microsoft’s vice president of partner go-to-market (GTM) programs and experiences told CRN in an interview [RELATED: Microsoft 365 Copilot Goes GA Bringing GenAI To Enterprise Customers] Microsoft has about 400000 channel partners worldwide according to CRN’s 223 Channel Chiefs The packages complement the core and expanded benefits already available to partners with the Microsoft “solutions partner” designation and independent software vendors in the ISV Success program according to the vendor Sanford (pictured above) said that new and existing Microsoft solution providers can also leverage these benefits packages as stepping stones as they work toward earning designations Microsoft solution providers building their first offering or expanding capabilities should find a package relevant to their business according to the vendor Partner Launch Benefits is focused on product discovery and testing Partner Success Core Benefits has more robust tools and support And Partner Success Expanded Benefits is aimed at larger scaling “We wanted to make sure that we were providing offers for each and every” partner Sanford said “We really wanted to make sure we had offers in market that met the partner where they are” Here is a breakdown of the three different packages: Partner Launch Benefits Success Core Benefits Success Expanded Benefits Solution providers can buy each benefits package individually and on top of existing benefits Partners don’t have to start with the basic Launch Benefits package to buy a higher-tier package according to the vendor Each package has the Microsoft Sales Copilot tool aimed at bringing generative AI (GenAI) to customer interactions The packages also have the Copilot tool formerly known as Bing Chat and Bing Chat Enterprise The packages also have product licenses credits for the Microsoft Azure cloud offering and capabilities for building testing and delivering customer offerings according to the vendor Speaking of Microsoft’s Signature Cloud Support benefit the vendor provided an update Monday saying that SCS for Solutions Provider designated partners or partners with gold and silver legacy benefits packages will no longer be unlimited “as a result of our regular assessment of market conditions and the competitive landscape” Starting July 1 on a partner’s anniversary date the partner will be limited to 50 SCS incidents a year The change happens when partners renew their designation or legacy benefits package Microsoft promised that “additional details will be shared in the coming months” The new benefits packages come on the heels of the vendor making its Copilot for Microsoft 365 GenAI offering available for solution providers in the Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) program to sell to customers Customers with Office 365 E3 and E5 licenses can also purchase Copilot for M365 Microsoft also dropped the 300-seat minimum for M365 Copilot making the offering more available to smaller businesses and organizations and expanded Semantic Index for Copilot to O365 E3 and E5 licenses That Index tool is needed for relevant actionable responses to Copilot prompts according to the vendor Even without that minimum customers do need a product license for one of the prerequisite base stock-keeping units (SKU) for each seat of Copilot for M365 they purchase according to the vendor Sanford said that the new partner benefits packages come amid more investment from the vendor in workshops and bootcamps around Copilot and other AI offerings “Weve seen a tremendous amount of excitement from our partner ecosystem engaging in that content as well” she said “So we see the partner offerings and the benefits that they get out of these packages really complementing all of that support were doing from an enablement perspective” Sanford advised that Microsoft solution providers early in their AI adoption or customers’ AI adoption look to the available AI transformation playbook and other resources on the partner portal Solution providers who find areas where Copilot helps them internally can turn those into external customer offerings she said Customer organization boards have also shown support for AI use cases with demonstrable returns on investment within 12 months such as automating manual tasks

Advertisement Source: Asif Islam / Shutterstockcom Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has emerged as a top tech stock to buy in 2024 The company continues to capitalize on two major trends – Azure serves as a premier AI infrastructure platform while the company pioneers AI integration across tools like Copilot and applications such as Nuance Dax in healthcare This will have important implications for MSFT stock holders in the future With a 56% year-to-date surge and a 272% gain over the past five years there’s a reason why Microsoft continues to be among the most valuable companies in the world Beyond its 080% dividend yield the company’s strength lies in versatility high profit margins and robust growth Microsoft Azure a leading cloud computing application fuels a 21% year-over-year increase in “server products and cloud services” revenue Analysts foresee widespread enterprise adoption with a $450 price target emphasizing Microsoft’s leadership in AI and cybersecurity amid escalating ransomware threats and new SEC disclosure rules Overall Microsoft records a 13% year-over-year revenue growth and a notable 27% year-over-year increase in net income In 2019 Microsoft invested $1

December Industry experts hail ChatGPT as a game-changer and OpenAI reportedly generates annual revenue of $13 billion marking a 30% increase since the summer This strategic positioning contributes to Microsoft trading at a higher-than-average valuation Microsoft is a stalwart in index funds boasting over 50% year-to-date gains and a robust 272% surge in the past five years Continuously

333,"Combating abusive AI-generated content: a comprehensive approach - Microsoft On the Issues","2/13/2024","https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2024/02/13/generative-ai-content-abuse-online-safety/","Feb 13 2024 Brad Smith - Vice Chair & President Each day millions of people use powerful generative AI tools to supercharge their creative expression In so many ways AI will create exciting opportunities for all of us to bring new ideas to life But as these new tools come to market from Microsoft and across the tech sector we must take new steps to ensure these new technologies are resistant to abuse The history of technology has long demonstrated that creativity is not confined to people with good intentions Tools unfortunately also become weapons and this pattern is repeating itself We’re currently witnessing a rapid expansion in the abuse of these new AI tools by bad actors including through deepfakes based on AI-generated video audio and images This trend poses new threats for elections financial fraud harassment through nonconsensual pornography and the next generation of cyber bullying We need to act with urgency to combat all these problems In an encouraging way there is a lot we can learn from our experience as an industry in adjacent spaces – in advancing cybersecurity promoting election security combating violent extremist content and protecting children We are committed as a company to a robust and comprehensive approach that protects people and our communities based on six focus areas: 1 A strong safety architecture We are committed to a comprehensive technical approach grounded in safety by design Depending on the scenario a strong safety architecture needs to be applied at the AI platform model and applications levels It includes aspects such as ongoing red team analysis preemptive classifiers the blocking of abusive prompts automated testing and rapid bans of users who abuse the system It needs to be based on strong and broad-based data analysis Microsoft has established a sound architecture and shared our learning via our Responsible AI and Digital Safety Standards but it’s clear that we will need to continue to innovate in these spaces as technology evolves 2 Durable media provenance and watermarking This is essential to combat deepfakes in video images or audio Last year at our Build 2023 conference we announced media provenance capabilities that use cryptographic methods to mark and sign AI-generated content with metadata about its source and history Together with other leading companies Microsoft has been a leader in R&D on methods for authenticating provenance including as a co-founder of Project Origin and the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA) standards body Just last week Google and Meta took important steps forward in supporting C2PA steps that we appreciate and applaud We are already using provenance technology in the Microsoft Designer image creation tools in Bing and in Copilot and we are in the process of extending media provenance to all our tools that create or manipulate images We are also actively exploring watermarking and fingerprinting techniques that help to reinforce provenance techniques We’re committed to ongoing innovation that will help users quickly determine if an image or video is AI generated or manipulated 3 Safeguarding our services from abusive content and conduct We’re committed to protecting freedom of expression But this should not protect individuals that seek to fake a person’s voice to defraud a senior citizen of their money It should not extend to deepfakes that alter the actions or statements of political candidates to deceive the public Nor should it shield a cyber bully or distributor of nonconsensual pornography We are committed to identifying and removing deceptive and abusive content like this when it is on our hosted consumer services such as LinkedIn our Gaming network and other relevant services 4 Robust collaboration across industry and with governments and civil society While each company has accountability for its own products and services experience suggests that we often do our best work when we work together for a safer digital ecosystem We are committed to working collaboratively with others in the tech sector including in the generative AI and social media spaces We are also committed to proactive efforts with civil society groups and in appropriate collaboration with governments As we move forward we will draw on our experience combating violent extremism under the Christchurch Call our collaboration with law enforcement through our Digital Crimes Unit and our efforts to better protect children through the WeProtect Global Alliance and more broadly We are committed to taking new initiatives across the tech sector and with other stakeholder groups 5 Modernized legislation to protect people from the abuse of technology It is already apparent that some of these new threats will require the development of new laws and new efforts by law enforcement We look forward to contributing ideas and supporting new initiatives by governments around the world so we can better protect people online while honoring timeless values like the protection of free expression and personal privacy 6 Public awareness and education Finally a strong defense will require a well-informed public As we approach the second quarter of the 21st century most people have learned that you can’t believe everything you read on the internet (or anywhere else) A well-informed combination of curiosity and skepticism is a critical life skill for everyone In a similar way we need to help people recognize that you can’t believe every video you see or audio you hear We need to help people learn how to spot the differences between legitimate and fake content including with watermarking This will require new public education tools and programs including in close collaboration with civil society and leaders across society Ultimately none of

Foolcom All figures quoted in US dollars unless otherwise stated The rage for artificial intelligence (AI) stocks is showing no signs of cooling off Thats why Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) management made sure to mention AI tech prominently in both the press release and during the conference call detailing its fiscal second quarter of 2024 earnings Those results divulged just after market hours on Tuesday beat analyst estimates and featured some impressive numbers And while AI certainly played a part in that it was actually another set of offerings from the tech giant that really gave its quarter some muscle Microsofts second frame of the fiscal year saw the company book slightly over $62 billion in revenue which was a sturdy 18% improvement over the same quarter of fiscal 2023 and topped the companys guidance of $60 billion to $61 billion Not to be outdone non-GAAP (adjusted) net income advanced by 26% year over year to hit nearly $22 billion ($293 per share) Analyst expectations for the quarter were relatively modest On average they were expecting the tech giant to earn slightly over $61 billion on the top line and post a per-share adjusted net income figure of $278 Microsoft posted estimate-beating quarters throughout calendar 2023 but the rise in its shares was due more to its association with top AI app developer OpenAI Microsoft is a major investor in -- and partner of -- the company which is the entity behind the popular ChatGPT app Microsoft has assertively incorporated OpenAI functionalities into more than a few of its offerings including the Office software suite In the earnings release the only quote Microsoft attributed to its CEO Satya Nadella was about yes AI The companys leader briefly enthused about the technology saying that by applying it at scale its helping to gain new clients and improve productivity throughout its operations What didnt get as much attention and probably should have was Microsofts cloud computing products and services The company is the No 2 provider of such offerings -- behind Amazons mighty Amazon Web Services (AWS) -- and is doing well in drawing fresh revenue from this source During the quarter the companys Intelligent Cloud business segment saw its revenue balloon by 20% year over year to nearly $26 billion Inside that grouping the still-hot Azure and other cloud services saw their collective take rise at a 30% clip outpacing the analyst expectations of under 28% Even if AI -- still a relatively young technology -- wasnt a mighty driver of Microsofts growth for the quarter it still made a difference The company said it now has about 53000 clients for Azure AI its anchor cloud-based AI platform Nadella said that one-third of that figure comprises customers new to Azure within the past year This portends very well for Microsofts future However judging by the markets rather tepid reaction to the quarterly results -- the stock was trading slightly down after hours as of this writing -- investors havent yet fully considered this potential So even though the companys shares zoomed higher in 2023 in this year and beyond they can certainly hit even loftier heights

Microsoft Hong Kong As global sustainability progress becomes more pressing organizations need tangible transformative solutions to help them move forward faster Most have not progressed as much as they’d like While 85% of executives report that sustainability is strategically important to their company only 16% have integrated sustainability into their business strategies Today we’re introducing new data and AI solutions in Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability that provide capabilities organizations need to progress in their sustainability journey These include faster environmental social and governance (ESG) data analytics and insights an AI assistant to help accelerate impactful decision-making and reporting and other advanced capabilities — all designed to help organizations move the needle faster In May 2023 we unveiled Microsoft Fabric an end-to-end analytics SaaS platform that brings together all of an organization’s enterprise data including ESG data that the company may not have had access to before With Microsoft Fabric your teams can connect to data from anywhere uncover insights using AI-powered analytics tools in a unified experience and embed those insights

Manager with new AI capabilities Södra has improved sustainability practices like reporting through automated flows that enable employees to more easily collect detailed information “With the AI capabilities in Microsoft Sustainability Manager we can be more productive which is our ultimate goal” shares Cristian Brolin Chief Digital Officer at Södra “We found the Copilot feature very easy to use and my vision and ambition is that this will help accelerate the way we work We are excited to see how this solution helps accelerate our sustainability progress” For most organizations supplier activities can account for upward of 80-90% of their emissions footprint Getting a handle on this data is critical to meeting reduction targets and reporting requirements ESG value chain solution in Microsoft Sustainability Manager now generally available allows organizations to simplify data collection and provides a seamless and more secure process for suppliers Organizations can run advanced analytics on ESG value chain data in one place and find emissions reduction opportunities within their value chain At Microsoft our procurement team has found that getting data out of siloed reports spreadsheets and systems into one data estate and sharing learnings with others is key to advancing our own progress as well as others’ progress Through more automated data gathering and management such as through ESG value chain solution we can not only more easily share data but also respond more nimbly to changing regulatory requirements According to research by the United Nations and Accenture 98% of CEOs see sustainability as a core to their role and two out of three are forming partnerships and taking action on sustainability Many are also translating these actions into new business models and growth Allegiant Stadium home to the Las Vegas Raiders is using Microsoft Sustainability Manager to support a state-of-the art and energy efficient facility that hosted the 2024

Company","2/21/2024","https://www.microsoft.com/insidetrack/blog/disability-as-a-strength-three-practices-to-help-you-create-inclusive-experiences-at-your-company/","How Microsoft does IT Feb 21 2024 Dawn Lee Microsoft’s mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more Our Microsoft Digital Employee Experience team lives this mission every day by empowering employees across the organization with inclusive digital and physical experiences Leading our accessibility efforts over the past two years I’ve seen teams make great progress—not just in those experiences but also in the culture we’ve created across the organization It’s energizing when you hear someone share an accessibility tip in a meeting or see the “Accessibility: Good to Go” message in someone’s PowerPoint presentation We have continued to evolve the way we incorporate accessibility practices into our employee experiences—from meeting etiquette to the digital experiences that enable our employees to do their best work And with the recent explosion of generative AI using machine learning to further drive productivity improvements it’s important we continue to extend these practices to new experiences so everyone benefits We worked with the Accessibility team to create a quick guide of best practices for large internal meetings like Town Halls that serves as a checklist for administrators meeting organizers and leaders It helps us all be consistent on what to do when planning a meeting to help everyone fully participate —Michelle Strub executive communications lead Microsoft Digital Employee Experience Following are three practices our teams have learned and do regularly that can be applied across your own organization Adopting and championing these can increase productivity and higher engagement [Learn how to create inclusive content with the new Accessibility Assistant in Microsoft 365 Take our accessibility fundamentals training Learn about our responsible AI program Find out about our pursuit of inclusive AI] Meetings are critical to getting work done whether it’s communicating priorities driving alignment brainstorming ideas or making decisions Features in Microsoft Teams and Microsoft 365 help people customize their experience but we found many people weren’t aware of the options available And while our accessible events guide gives lots of useful information we found it was sometimes hard for people to know what to adopt and when “We worked with the Accessibility team to create a quick guide of best practices for large internal meetings like Town Halls that serves as a checklist for administrators meeting organizers and leaders” says Michelle Strub an executive communications lead in Microsoft Digital Employee Experience “It helps us all be consistent on what to do when planning a meeting to help everyone fully participate” It really brought to light the customer pain point by having the employee walk through and share their experience with the tool I tried to put myself in their shoes by closing my eyes and trying to follow along That’s when I realized how confusing it was —Jaimie Larsen product manager Microsoft Digital Employee Experience Companies can develop their own checklists to increase awareness of important practices building up adoption over time While some of these features were initially designed to support individuals with disabilities we found the following practical tips encouraged everyone to participate and engage effectively Creating connections is central to the human experience We’ve seen employees across Microsoft share their stories and the stories of others to improve understanding about why it’s important to create experiences that consider the needs of everyone Jaimie Larsen a product manager in Microsoft Digital Employee Experience was new to accessibility when she met with engineers across her organization to understand their needs and challenges She quickly realized that the engineers didn’t always understand the impact a poorly designed tool could have on someone’s daily work She found inspiration to start a quarterly series that featured employees and how they use different tools “It really brought to light the customer pain point by having the employee walk through and share their experience with the tool I tried to put myself in their shoes by closing my eyes and trying to follow along That’s when I realized how confusing it was” Larsen says Due to this session Larsen created a stronger understanding of the importance of the work to the engineering team for the specific tool and others were able to learn from it It’s been a multi-year journey as we have shared our expertise at Microsoft and worked with ServiceNow to develop practices and processes that continually improve the experiences for our employees —Sherif Mazhar principal program manager Microsoft Digital Employee Experience “It was great because we needed multiple teams to do work to make the experience better” Larsen says “This session really helped anchor the goal and impact for everyone” We partner with teams across Microsoft and external organizations to deliver employee experiences globally Using international accessibility standards including Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) teams have developed strong partnerships and commitment to ensure that accessibility is included as a key requirement and measure of success One of these partnerships has been with ServiceNow where Sherif Mazhar a principal program manager worked closely with ServiceNow to align accessibility goals and drive improvements together “It’s been a multi-year journey as we have shared our expertise at Microsoft and worked with ServiceNow to develop practices and processes that continually improve the experiences for our employees” Mazhar says Leaders at Microsoft and ServiceNow have aligned on accessibility goals and now review progress quarterly against common goals It takes time to build up relationships and expertise when the primary job someone is used to doing is not focused on technology I’ve found it helpful to explain the impact and show what happens rather than just talking about an issue It can be easy for people to get lost if you use too much technical jargon —Erika Retikis principal product manager Microsoft Digital Employee Experience Our Microsoft Digital Employee Experience team works with our colleagues in Microsoft Human Resources to build internal and external partnerships that are increasing accessibility awareness and knowledge Erika Retikis a principal product manager in Microsoft Digital Employee Experience has worked with multiple customer companies over the last few years and sees many unique challenges especially for those companies or teams that aren’t as tech savvy “It takes time to build up relationships and expertise when the primary job someone is used to doing is not focused on technology I’ve found it helpful to explain the impact and show what happens rather than just talking about an issue It can be easy for people to get lost if you use too much technical jargon” Retikis says Looking ahead: Artificial Intelligence needs accessibility from the start As we and other companies look at how artificial intelligence is embedded into different experiences it will be critical to think about accessibility from the start to ensure that the data and the experiences include everyone One area of focus is ensuring data sets include a variety of people and situations We also regularly include employees with disabilities at various product development stages to benefit from their perspective and create more accessible and inclusive experiences So when you are thinking about building and adopting inclusive experiences you should try and keep the above tips in mind as well as other best practices included in some of the resources below to ensure that your employee experiences are created with everyone at the center Tags: accessibility AI and Machine Learning culture Microsoft Teams Mar 22 2024 Dodd Willingham Microsoft is a big company with thousands of teams working in different ways based on the work they do Despite that complexity when our employees go looking for something they expect an internal search portal that will find exactly what they’re looking for instantly—just like when they search on the internet Yet when talking to Mar 21 2024 Lukas Velush Several years into the era of hybrid work most of us are used to appearing in a Brady Bunch-style gallery We click or tap an emoji to ask a question or applaud an achievement and still have to remember to not be “on mute” when it’s our turn to talk Half of workers have gone Mar 20 2024 Joshua

and development Mar 20 2024 Lukas Velush If you’re on a sales team you know that there are all kinds of distracting tasks that eat away at your time and get in the way of what you do best—building relationships with and solving problems for customers There’s no doubt that modern salespeople need to rely on too many tools and services to This content has been archived and while it was correct at time of publication it may no longer be accurate or reflect the current situation at Microsoft Hybrid work has inspired many changes at Microsoft including how we support employees with accessibility needs “We’re all working differently now because of hybrid work” says Dawn Lee Read more Building inclusive accessible experiences is a catalyst for digital transformation because without accessible tools people can’t do their best work And if people can’t do their best work the company its culture and its customers are directly impacted Building experiences that reflect the true diversity of the

In a sign of deeper US-China technology decoupling Apple has held initial talks about using Baidu’s generative AI technology in its iPhones the Wall Street Journal said China has introduced guidelines to phase out US microprocessors from Intel Corp and Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD) from government PCs and servers the Financial Times reported yesterday The procurement guidance also seeks to sideline Microsoft Corp’s Windows operating system and foreign-made database software in favor of domestic options the report said Chinese officials have begun following the guidelines which were unveiled in December last year the report said They order government agencies above the township level to include criteria requiring “safe and reliable” processors and operating systems when making purchases the newspaper said The US has been aiming to boost domestic semiconductor ’SWARM OF BEES’: Central bank Governor Yang Chin-long last week described the enthusiasm for exchange-traded funds as a “herding effect” in the market A record rally in Taiwanese stocks is luring retail investors to pile into exchange-traded funds (ETFs) as local regulators stepped up warnings on the herding behavior Two new stock ETFs this month raised a combined NT$2231 billion (US$705 billion) with the latest one which ended subscriptions on Friday last week setting a new record This brings the total inflows into equity ETFs to about NT$340 billion more than half of last year’s underscoring how the global market frenzy around artificial intelligence (AI) is spurring local demand for exposure to a technology-heavy market Central bank Governor Yang Chin-long (楊金龍) last week described the Hon Hai Technology Group (鴻海科技集團) yesterday showcased its latest liquid-cooled server racks at Nvidia Corp’s developers’ conference in San Jose California with the products aimed at helping customers build artificial intelligence (AI) data centers The racks are developed by Hon Hai subsidiary Ingrasys Technology Inc (鴻佰科技) and support Nvidia’s new GB200 flagship chip Hon Hai said in a statement To fuel a new wave of generative AI applications Ingrasys is leveraging the Nvidia GB200 NVL72 a next-generation AI liquid-cooled rack solution Hon Hai said “Our collaboration with Nvidia helps us deliver the latest accelerated computing technologies to our customers so they can The US is to award Intel Corp US$85 billion in grants and as much as US$11 billion in loans to help fund an expansion of its semiconductor fabs the US Department of Commerce announced yesterday marking the largest award from a program designed to reinvigorate the nation’s chip industry The package would support more than US$100 billion in US investments from Intel including efforts to produce cutting-edge semiconductors at large-scale plants in Arizona and Ohio the department said The money would also help pay for equipment research and development and advanced packaging projects at smaller facilities in Oregon and New Mexico In addition"

Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) develops computer software operating systems AI products and more The company tops our list of stocks that will make you rich in 2024 Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) was covered by 35 Wall Street analysts over the last three months and 33 maintained a Buy rating on the stock As of the February 23 market close the average price target of $46958 represented an upside of 1444% On January 30 Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) reported its Q2 earnings result with a GAAP EPS of $293 which beat the estimates by $016 The revenue grew by 177% YoY to $6202 billion surpassing the estimates by $890 million Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) was mentioned in Baron Funds’ fourth quarter 2023 investor letter Here is what it said: “Our biggest purchase in the fourth quarter was a new position we initiated in the software platform Microsoft Corporation While we have owned shares of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in the large-cap core growth Baron Durable Advantage Fund we have been reluctant to add Microsoft to this Fund for many years namely since we viewed it as a better fit for a post high-growth strategy However Microsoft’s transformation under the helm of Satya Nadella has changed the company’s trajectory as it went from a windows-centric on – premises technology provider to one of the top two global cloud providers Cloud now represents over 55% of total revenues and has been growing rapidly Over time Microsoft was able to build a $125 billion run-rate cloud business that is still growing at a rapid pace and continues to take market share while becoming a more important driver for the company For example in the last quarterly earnings release Microsoft Cloud grew 23% year-over-year in constant currency significantly outpacing the company’s 12% overall constant currency growth as well as the growth of its main competitors A 23% growth rate at this scale essentially implies that Microsoft added a run rate of around $24 billion of cloud revenues year-over-year Just to put this in perspective $24 billion is nearly the size of Mastercard’s business it is over 8 times Snowflake’s total revenue and is nearly 3 times ServiceNow’s total revenue We continue to view cloud as early in its penetration opportunity – according to latest estimates from Gartner global cloud spend is expected to be $564 billion3 which still represents only 12% of the total $47 trillion worldwide IT spending We also believe that Microsoft is one of the best competitively positioned large-cap companies with its vertically integrated software stack (infrastructure + applications) while the inflection in the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) and GenAI represents potentially the biggest addressable market expansion for the company in recent history We also view Microsoft’s competitive positioning in AI as advantaged thanks to both the fact that it does not face an innovators dilemma in its core business (as compared with Alphabet’s core search business which could potentially be at risk due to GenAI) Microsoft also has a tight partnership with OpenAI has a large proprietary data asset built over time and has a go-to-market advantage through a vast and robust partner ecosystem and its significant installed base and product bundling opportunities These should enable it to cross-sell its existing user base as AI becomes embedded

355,"Microsoft: 1 Reason To Avoid The Stock And It Isnt OpenAI (NASDAQ:MSFT)","1/10/2024","https://seekingalpha.com/article/4662225-microsoft-1-reason-to-avoid-stock-and-it-isnt-openai","Ben Kriemann/Getty Images Entertainment Ben Kriemann/Getty Images Entertainment I am bullish on mega-cap tech titans but I need to make one thing clear: my bullishness does not extend to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) While the company continues to impress in terms of resilient top-line growth strong profit margins return of cash to shareholders and its positioning for generative AI I am of the view that the stock is pricing in this optimism - and more There are arguably signs of irrational exuberance at play with investors seemingly focusing only on the company’s Bing to take potential in search but ignoring that the company’s Windows has been ceding market share incessantly MSFT remains one of the highest-quality names in the market today and deserves a premium valuation but the current multiple makes it very difficult to predict market-beating returns from here I reiterate my “avoid” rating and recommend investors look towards other mega-cap tech names with higher potential MSFT was one of the few tech names to suffer relatively modest declines during the 2022 tech crash and soar to all-time highs as of recent trading Data by YCharts I last covered MSFT stock in September where I recommended avoiding the stock due to the potential for a “lost decade ahead” (specifically the high likelihood of underperforming the broader market) The stock has returned double-digits since then and does not quite trade at levels worth getting bearish at I remain of the view that valuation issues will eventually catch up to the stock: you cannot outrun the fundamentals forever In its most recent quarter revenue growth was strong at 13% (12% constant currency) It is impressive that MSFT can sustain such resilient growth rates in spite of its large revenue base and the tough macro environment Due to operating leverage earnings grew even faster growing 26% to $299 per share FY24 Q1 Presentation FY24 Q1 Presentation The company’s core productivity and business processes segment which houses products like Microsoft Word saw revenues grow 14% constant currency ahead of guidance for 11% growth MSFT delivered strong operating leverage in this segment with operating margins expanding 300 bps to a stunning 536% I suspect that consensus estimates are expecting the rest of the businesses to converge towards this number FY24 Q1 Presentation FY24 Q1 Presentation Many investors may be drawn to MSFT for its cloud operations including Azure Azure grew at a 28% clip surpassing management’s already-impressive guidance for 25% growth MSFT appears to be benefitting from its association with OpenAI as customers are undoubtedly prioritizing generative AI capabilities in their cloud spending decisions FY24 Q1 Presentation FY24 Q1 Presentation MSFT saw a steep recovery in its “more personal computing” segment with revenues growing by 2% YoY and operating income by 22% This segment has proven to be quite cyclical and thus is of lower earnings quality than the rest of the businesses but remains an important cash generator nonetheless FY24 Q1 Presentation FY24 Q1 Presentation MSFT ended the quarter with $1438 billion of cash versus $714 billion of debt in addition to around $13 billion invested in OpenAI (or around $30 billion based on the projected $90 billion stock sale) The strong balance sheet and high profit margins enabled MSFT to generously return cash to shareholders through $48 billion of stock repurchases and $51 billion of dividends On the conference call management noted that cloud optimization trends remain present but “higher-than-expected AI consumption” more than offset that Management continues to expect AI to power Azure growth expecting 26% to 27% constant currency growth from Azure in the next quarter These are incredible numbers especially considering that cloud titan peers are not seeing the same strength Management went on further to guide for “roughly stable” revenue growth for the second half of the fiscal year again representing an incredible number I think many investors are expecting a solid recovery in cloud revenues upon a macro recovery but MSFT is already showing strong cloud results thanks to its first-mover advantage in generative AI The one potential negative was that management guided for full year operating margins “to remain flat year-over-year” implying some margin deterioration over the rest of the year given the strong first quarter results That is not necessarily a bad thing given that the company is likely investing heavily ahead of the generative AI opportunity and I wouldn’t rule out the company eventually outperforming on expectations Consensus estimates call for the company to generate $61 billion in revenue representing 157% YoY growth and representing some sequential acceleration Analysts expect the company to earn $276 in EPS representing 255% YoY growth Both these targets look achievable given the recovery seen in tech peers Subsequent to the quarter-end there was drama at OpenAI which first saw CEO Sam Altman ousted by the board of directors only to soon return along with a new board of directors In my view this drama is not so important as it pertains mainly to the company’s investment in OpenAI which makes up only a fraction of MSFT’s nearly $3 trillion market cap Moreover I view MSFT’s benefits from the OpenAI partnership to be mainly coming from integrating OpenAI capabilities into MSFT’s existing products something that is unlikely to be affected by leadership turmoil at OpenAI The important factor to focus on is instead MSFT’s continued ability to execute on sustaining resilient growth rates at Azure Thus far we have seen MSFT show an attractive combination of resilient revenue growth alongside margin expansion in spite of a tough macro environment Those are strong fundamental factors but fundamental analysis also must include a discussion of valuation At recent prices MSFT was trading at a nosebleed 33x earnings ahead of the company’s 5-year average of 30x earnings and representing a stark contrast with Alphabet (GOOGL) which trades at a notable discount to its own 5-year average Many tech companies trade at a discount to pre-pandemic valuations due to both the higher interest rate environment and lingering effects of the 2022 tech crash but generative AI appears to have powered incremental enthusiasm into MSFT’s stock Seeking Alpha Seeking Alpha I can make the argument that consensus estimates look very full if not aggressive given that MSFT is expected to show minimal deceleration in revenue growth over the coming decade in spite of being projected to generate an astounding $243 billion in full-year revenues this year The flipside is that earnings estimates may appear conservative if one believes that the company can hit revenue targets as consensus estimates are factoring in only 170 bps of net margin expansion to 359% in 2033 Seeking Alpha Seeking Alpha In my prior report I showed that using assumptions of 45% long term net margins 9% revenue growth and a 15x price to earnings growth ratio (‘PEG ratio’) MSFT might trade at around 61x sales implying a stock price of around $503 per share in 2033 That suggests around 3% annual return potential over the next 95 years (or around 6% inclusive of the earnings yield) I note that due to me using a 45% long-term net margin assumption we are not being affected by the possibly conservative consensus estimates for earnings If we further up our optimism and assume that MSFT trades at 10x sales in 2033 then the stock might trade at around $823 per share representing around 85% annual return potential over the next 95 years (or around 11% to 12% inclusive of the earnings yield) If MSFT generates a 40% net margin in 2033 (ahead of consensus estimates) then the stock would be trading at around 25x earnings based on that price target Some investors might point to the stock of Apple (AAPL) as offering potential support for believing that MSFT can sustain a premium valuation even after maturing for another decade There are some important differences between the two companies AAPL’s valuation multiple appears justified by the company’s strong network effects MSFT clearly has the perception of possessing similar benefits often being regarded as the Death Star of enterprise tech I have previously expressed some doubts in regards to that title though I acknowledge that integrating generative AI into its product suites has likely helped improve its competitive footing However I must point out that the company’s dominance of the operating system market has been undermined over the last decade with AAPL rapidly taking share It is ironic that just as MSFT is viewed as being a potential disruptor of search versus Alphabet (GOOGL) it may be on the opposite side of that equation with regards to AAPL Due to the competitive threats I find it unlikely that MSFT is able to sustain a premium 25x earnings multiple in a decade and even then the prospective return potential is not so attractive MSFT is firing on all cylinders as one of the biggest beneficiaries of generative AI The stock’s current valuation however prevents me from endorsing a buy rating - I reiterate my neutral rating as investors are likely to find better opportunities elsewhere among mega-cap tech names After a historic

362,"None","1/18/2024","https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/01/report-microsofts-ai-infusion-hasnt-helped-bing-take-share-from-google/","Front page layout Site theme Andrew Cunningham - Updated Jan 18 2024 9:52 pm UTC Not quite one year ago Microsoft announced a multi-year multi-billion dollar investment in OpenAI a company that had made waves in 2022 with its ChatGPT chatbot and DALL-E image creator The next month Microsoft announced that it was integrating a generative AI chatbot into its Bing search engine and Edge browser and similar generative AI features were announced for Windows in the apps formerly known as Microsoft Office Microsoft Teams and other products Adding AI features to Bing was meant to give it an edge over Google and reports indicated that Google was worried enough about it to accelerate its own internal generative AI efforts Microsoft announced in March 2023 that Bing surpassed the 100 million monthly active users mark based on interest in Bing Chat and its ilk; by Microsofts estimates each percentage of Googles search market share that Bing could siphon away was worth as much as $2 billion to Microsoft A year later it looks like Microsofts AI efforts may have helped Bing on the margins but they havent meaningfully eroded Googles search market share according to Bloomberg Per Bloombergs analysis of data from Sensor Tower Bing usage had been down around 33 percent year over year just before the AI-powered features were added but those numbers had rebounded by the middle of 2023 Microsoft hasnt given an official update on Bings monthly active users in quite a while—weve asked the company for an update and will share it if we get one—though Microsoft Chief Marketing Officer Yusuf Medhi told Bloomberg that millions and millions of people were still using the new AI features StatCounter data mostly tells a similar story According to its data Googles worldwide market share is currently in the low 90s and it has been for virtually the entire 15-year period for which StatCounter offers data Bings worldwide market share number over the same period has been remarkably stable; it was about 35 percent in the summer of 2009 when what had been known as Live Search was renamed Bing in the first place and as of December 2023 it was still stuck at around 34 percent Recent US data is slightly more flattering for Microsoft where Bings usage rose from 67 percent in December 2022 to 77 percent in December 2023 But that doesnt necessarily suggest any kind of AI-fueled influx in new Bing search users—usage remained in the mid-to-high 6 percent range through most of 2023 before ticking up right at the end of the year—and Bings US usage has floated in that same 6–7 percent zone for most of the last decade It even seems like Microsoft is making moves to distance its AI efforts from Bing a bit What began as Bing Chat or the new Bing is now known as Windows Copilot—both inside Windows 11 and elsewhere Earlier this week the Bing Image Creator became Image Creator from Designer Both products still feature Bing branding prominently—the Copilot screen in Windows 11 still says with Bing at the top of it and the Image Creator tool is still hosted on the Bingcom domain But if these new AI features arent driving Bings market share up then it makes sense for Microsoft to create room for them to stand on their own Thats not to say Googles search dominance is assured Leipzig University researchers published a study earlier this week (PDF) suggesting Google Bing and the Bing-powered DuckDuckGo had seen an overall downward trend in text quality especially for heavily SEO-optimized categories like purchase recommendations and product reviews When asked about Bings active user numbers a Microsoft spokesperson released the following statement to Ars: With the introduction of Copilot last year we set out to reinvent the way people find answers; building upon traditional search methods with new conversational tools that better harness the worlds knowledge Weve already driven tremendous results and growth for Copilot with more than 5 billion chats to date The search industry is in the midst of a transformation as AI is helping us turn information into action We are excited to see how Copilot continues to advance new behaviors in this next era of search January 18 2024: Weve updated this article to add a statement from Microsoft Join the Ars Orbital Transmission mailing list to get weekly updates delivered to your inbox Sign me up → CNMN Collection WIRED Media Group © 2024 Condé Nast All rights reserved Use of and/or registration on any portion of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement (updated 1/1/20) and Privacy Policy and Cookie Statement (updated 1/1/20) and Ars Technica Addendum (effective 8/21/2018) Ars may earn compensation on sales from links on this site Read our affiliate link policy Your California Privacy Rights Do Not Sell My Personal Information The material on this site may not be reproduced distributed transmitted cached or otherwise used except with the prior written permission of Condé Nast Ad Choices"

a significant ramp considering the scale that this growth is attached to with Azures revenue at a $74 billion run rate This AI-related growth has helped Azures growth re-accelerate after seeing decelerating growth for five straight quarters Azures AI customer growth has also been rapid and Microsoft is seeing an increase in larger commitments for Azure Microsoft reported that Azure AI customers totaled more than 53000 last quarter with one-third of these new customers over the past twelve months That implies a customer growth rate of approximately 50% YoY given that Microsoft added nearly 18000 customers through 2023 More than half of the Fortune 500 are using Azure OpenAI Services highlighting the strength of Microsofts AI offerings For Azure specifically management said on the earnings call that customers continue to choose Azure to simplify and accelerate their cloud migrations Overall we are seeing larger and more strategic Azure deals with an increase in the number of $1 billion-plus Azure commitments An increase in customer count and an increase in deal size are foundations for sustainable long-term growth and are supportive of further acceleration in the coming quarters Q4 was a busy quarter for Amazon as it rolled out many new features capabilities and hardware designed to capture generative AI demand with AWS showing a hint of accelerated growth AWS finally accelerated in Q4 for the first time in two years with Amazon reporting 132% growth in Q4 up just over 1% from Q3s 12% AWS is now quickly approaching a $100 billion annual run rate delivering $242 billion in revenue in Q4 and $908 billion in revenue for 2023 Whats more important is that AWS operating leverage has improved over the last two quarters with operating income growing at 3x the rate of revenue in Q4 AMAZON AMAZON AWS operating income increased 39% YoY on a constant currency basis in Q4 with the operating margin increasing 530bp YoY to 296% For the full year AWS operating margin was 271% down 140bp YoY as operating leverage decreased in the first half of the year as growth decelerated from the 20% range to the 12% range AWS remains Amazons primary generator of operating income (67% of Amazons total operating income in 2023) a trend that can strengthen with AI driving accelerated customer and revenue growth and decreased costs CEO Andy Jassy explained that AWS added more than $11 billion in incremental quarter-over-quarter revenue which on an FX neutral basis is more than any other cloud provider as far as we can tell AWS existing customers are renewing larger commitments over longer periods and migrations are growing and while cost optimization continued to attenuate larger new deals also accelerated That includes recent agreements with Nvidia to be the first CSP to deploy the GH200 Grace Hopper Superchips with multi-node NVLink technology and with Salesforce to deepen AI and data integrations between the two Bedrock is already witnessing strong adoption with management seeing many thousands of customers using the service after just a few months as AWS continues to add new models from Anthropic Cohere Meta with Llama2 Stability AI and our own Amazon Titan family of LLMs Although AWS quarterly growth rates look paltry compared to Azures 30% and Google Cloud in the high-20% range it is still showing all the ingredients for a sustained AI-driven acceleration Google Cloud revenue accelerated four points from 22% in Q3 to 26% in Q4 topping $9 billion for the first time helped by an increasing contribution from AI Q4s $92 billion in revenue implies that Google Cloud is just crossing above a $36 billion annual run rate less than half of Azures run rate and 60% below AWS $90 billion run rate Google Clouds operating margin in Q4 came in at 9% compared to 3% in the previous quarter and (02%) in Q4 last year Margins are naturally worse than AWS and Azure as Google Cloud does not benefit from the same efficiencies at scale; however it is positive to see strong QoQ and YoY improvement in operating margin as it bodes well for future performance at a larger revenue scale ALPHABET ALPHABET This acceleration in Q4 also helped narrow the gap to 4 percentage points with Azure compared to 7 percentage points in the previous quarter Google Cloud had previously topped Azures growth rates in late 2022 and the first half of 2023 before a rather swift deceleration in Q3 Whats crucial here over the next few quarters is Google Cloud continuing to close this growth rate gap with Azure and possibly surpass Azure once more - it should be theoretically easier to realize higher growth rates at a smaller scale more so when leveraging AI Like AWS and Azure Google Cloud is seeing strong momentum with AI products Management said that the strong demand we are seeing for our vertically integrated AI portfolio is creating new opportunities for Google Cloud across every product area while its generative AI portfolio helped win and expand deals CEO Sundar Pichai said that greater than 70% of gen AI unicorns are using Google Cloud and customers including Anthropic and Mistral AI are building and serving LLMs on Google Clouds AI Hypercomputer which combines Googles TPUs and GPUs AI software and Multislice and Multi-host technology to provide performance and cost advantages for training and serving models Google Cloud led the charge in monetizing AI via subscriptions with Duet AI for $30/month and management noted that customers are increasingly choosing Duet AI to boost productivity and improve their operations Duet AI will soon incorporate Googles Gemini its multi-modal family of LLMs developed to challenge OpenAIs GPT-4 Google Cloud is intensely focused on bringing the benefits of Gemini to its cloud customers and the rollout of the top iteration Gemini Ultra at a $20/month subscription could help Google gain share away from OpenAI and thus Azure while increasing revenue Big Techs cloud units reported strong growth in calendar Q4 with AI helping drive a noticeable acceleration for Azure while AWS and Google Cloud touted strong contributions from generative AI products The trio all possess the necessary ingredients for sustained accelerations or maintained growth at higher levels: increased customer migrations larger and longer duration contracts monetization opportunities within the suite via subscriptions and improvements in productivity and cost reductions for cloud customers Tech Insider Network Equity Analyst Damien Robbins contributed to this analysis We offer tech sector coverage that combines fundamentals and technicals After recommending a stock we provide entries and exits Our audited 3-year results of 47% prove we are a top-performing tech portfolio This compares to popular tech ETFs at negative 46% and the Nasdaq at 19% We are the only retail team featured regularly in Tier 1 media such as Fox CNBC TD Ameritrade and more Our services include an automated hedge portfolio of 10+ positions broad market analysis real-time trade alerts PLUS a weekly webinar every Thursday at 4:30 pm Eastern Learn more This article was written by Beth Kindig is the CEO and lead technology analyst for the I/O fund and has ten years of experience as a professional in the tech industry She is a regular speaker at tech conferences and on financial news programs such as: Fox Business TDAmeritrade CoinDesk NPR Bloomberg TV Asia Motley Fool podcast This Week in Startups and more discussing her stock analysis She is known for making bold calls on tech stocks Analyst’s Disclosure: I/we have a beneficial long position in the shares of NVDA MSFT either through stock ownership options or other derivatives I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Seeking Alphas Disclosure: Past performance is no guarantee of future results No recommendation or advice is being given as to whether any investment is suitable for a particular investor Any views or opinions expressed above may not reflect those of Seeking Alpha as a whole Seeking Alpha is not a licensed securities dealer broker or US investment adviser or investment bank Our analysts are third party authors that include both professional investors and individual investors who may not be licensed or certified by any institute or regulatory body"

Foundry division — formerly known as Intel Foundry Services until earlier today — has just landed a notable order from a big name According to Bloomberg and The Wall Street Journal Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella announced that his company will be tapping into Intels latest 18A (18nm) fabrication process for an upcoming in-house chip design But given Intels process roadmap this means we likely wont be seeing Microsofts new chip until 2025 While neither company disclosed the nature of said silicon Microsoft did unveil its custom-made Azure Maia AI Accelerator and Azure Cobalt 100 CPU server chips last November with an expected rollout some time early this year to bolster its own AI services The Cobalt 100 is based on Arm architecture and it just so happens that Intel has been optimizing its 18A process for Arm designs since April last year (it even became an Arm investor later) so theres a good chance that this collaboration may lead to the next-gen Cobalt CPU In addition to the usual efficiency improvements as node size decreases Intel 18A also offers the industrys first backside power solution which according to IEEEs Spectrum separates the power interconnect layer from the data interconnect layer at the top and moves the former to beneath the silicon substrate — as implied by the name This apparently allows for improved voltage regulation and lower resistance which in turn enable faster logic and lower power consumption especially when applied to 3D stacking In Intels Q4 earnings call CEO Pat Gelsinger confirmed that 18A is expected to achieve manufacturing readiness in second half 24 Given that Intels very own 18A-based processors — Clearwater Forest for servers and Panther Lake for clients — wont arrive until 2025 chances are itll be a similar time frame for Microsofts next chip At Intels event earlier today the exec shared an extended Intel Foundry process technology roadmap which features a new 14A (14nm) node enabled by ASMLs High-NA EUV (high-numerical aperture extreme ultraviolet) lithography system According to AnandTech this 14A leap may help Intel play catchup after its late EUV adoption for its Intel 4 (7nm) node though risk production wont take place until the end of 2026 Intel Foundry is the brainchild of Gelsinger who launched this department right after he assumed the CEO role in February 2021 as part of his ambitious plan to put Intel up against the likes of TSMC and Samsung in the contract chip-making market Before Microsoft Intel Foundrys list of clients already include MediaTek Qualcomm and Amazon The company

department is the heart of the organization juggling a myriad of critical yet complex tasks—from quote-to-cash processes like credit and collections to risk management and compliance Financial teams are not only responsible for these mandatory labor-intensive operations but are increasingly tasked with real-time insights into business performance and recommendations for future growth initiatives In fact 80% of finance leaders and teams face challenges to take on more strategic work beyond the operational portions of their roles¹ On the one hand teams are poised and ready to play a larger role in driving business growth strategy On the other hand however they can’t walk away from maintaining a critical and mandatory set of responsibilities Microsoft is introducing a solution to help finance teams reclaim time and stay on top of the critical decisions that can impact business performance Microsoft Copilot for Finance is a new Copilot experience for Microsoft 365 that unlocks AI-assisted competencies for financial professionals right from within productivity applications they use every day Now available in public preview Copilot for Finance connects to the organization’s financial systems including Dynamics 365 and SAP to provide role-specific workflow automation guided actions and recommendations in Microsoft Outlook Excel Microsoft Teams and other Microsoft 365 applications—helping to save time and focus on what truly matters: navigating the company to success By harnessing AI it automates time-consuming tasks allowing you to focus on what truly matters Finance teams play a critical role in innovating processes to improve efficiency across the organization As teams look to evolve and improve how time is spent to support more strategic work it’s evident there are elements of operational tasks that are more mundane repetitive and manually intensive Instead of spending the majority of their day on analysis or cross-team collaboration 62% of finance professionals are stuck in the drudgery of data entry and review cycles² While some of these tasks are critical and can’t be automated—like compliance and tax reporting—we also hear from majority of finance leaders that they lack the automation tools and technology they need to transform these processes and free up time¹ With the pace of business accelerating every day becoming a disruptor requires investing in technology that will drive innovation and support the bottom line In the next three to five years 68% of CFOs anticipate revenue growth from generative AI (GenAI)³ By implementing next-generation AI to deliver insight and automate costly and time-intensive operational tasks teams can reinvest that time to accelerate their impact as financial stewards and strategists Copilot for Finance provides AI-powered assistance while working in Microsoft 365 applications making financial processes more streamlined and automated Copilot for Finance can streamline audits by pulling and reconciling data with a simple prompt simplify collections by automating communication and payment plans and accelerate financial reporting by detecting variances with ease The potential time and cost savings are substantial transforming not just how financial professionals work but how they drive impact within the organization Users can interact with Copilot for Finance in multiple ways It both suggests actions in the flow of work and enables users to ask questions by typing a prompt in natural language For example a user can prompt Copilot to “help me understand forecast to actuals variance data” In moments Copilot for Finance will generate insights and pull data directly from across the ERP and financial systems suggesting actions to take and providing a head start by generating contextualized text and attaching relevant files Like other copilot experiences users can easily check source data to ensure transparency before using Copilot to take any actions Copilot for Finance connects to existing financial systems including Dynamics 365 and SAP as well as thousands more with Microsoft Copilot Studio With the ability to both pull insight from and update actions back to existing sources Copilot for Finance empowers users to stay in the flow of work and complete tasks more efficiently Copilot for Finance is well versed in the critical and often time-consuming tasks and processes across a finance professional’s workday providing a simple way to ask questions about data surface insights and automate processes—helping to reduce the time spent on repetitive actions While today’s modern finance team is responsible for a litany of tasks let’s explore three scenarios that Copilot for Finance supports at public preview Audits of a company’s financial statements are critical to ensuring accuracy and mitigating risk Traditionally accounts receivable managers were required to pull account data manually from ERP records reconcile it in Excel and look for inaccuracies manually With Copilot for Finance these critical steps are done with a single prompt allowing AR managers to act on inconsistencies and any delinquencies found with Copilot suggested copy and relevant invoices “Finance organizations need to be utilizing generative AI to help blend structured and unstructured datasets Copilot for Finance is a solution that aggressively targets this challenge Microsoft continues to push the boundary of business applications by providing AI-driven solutions for common business problems Copilot for Finance is another powerful example of this effort Copilot for Finance has potential to help finance professionals at organizations of all sizes accelerate impact and possibly even reduce financial operation costs” The collections process is another critical responsibility as it affects company cash flow profitability and customer relationships Collection coordinators spend their time reviewing outstanding accounts and attempting to reconcile them in a timely manner This often means phone calls emails and negotiating payment plans With Copilot for Finance collection coordinators can focus their time on more meaningful client-facing interactions by leaving the busy work to Copilot Copilot for Finance supports the collections process end-to-end by suggesting priority accounts summarizing conversations to record back to ERP and providing customized payment plans for customers Copilot for Finance can also help financial analysts to reduce the risk of reporting errors and missing unidentified variances Rather than manually reviewing large financial data sets for unusual patterns users can prompt Copilot to detect outliers and highlight variances for investigation Copilot for Finance streamlines variance identification with reusable natural language instructions in the enterprise context A financial analyst can direct Copilot to identify answers for variances and Copilot will gather supporting data autonomously Copilot will suggest financial context contacts and will provide auto summaries for streamlined tracking of action items and follow ups Copilot for Finance can generate fine-tuned financial commentary PowerPoint presentations and emails to report to key stakeholders Microsoft employs thousands across its finance team to manage and drive countless processes and systems as well as identify opportunities for company growth and strategy Who better to pilot the latest innovation in finance? For the first phase we worked closely with a Treasury team focused on accounts receivable as well as a team in financial planning and analysis—who need to reconcile data as a part of their workflow before conducting further analysis After trialing the data reconciliation capabilities in Copilot for Finance the initial value and potential for scale for these teams was clear “Financial analysts today spend on average one to two hours reconciling data per week With Copilot for Finance that is down to 10 minutes Functionality like data reconciliation will be a huge time saver for an organization as complex as Microsoft” “The accounts receivable reconciliation capabilities help us to eliminate the time it takes to compare data across sources saving an average 20 minutes per account Based on pilot usage this translates to an average of 22% cost savings in average handling time” Ready to take the next step?

The new workload in AI obviously in our case starts with one of the frontier -- I mean starts with the Frontier model Azure OpenAI But its not just about just one model right So you first -- you take that model you do RLHF you may do some fine-tuning you do retrieval which means you are sort of either heating some storage meter or youre heating some compute meters …you could even say these AI workloads themselves will have a lifecycle which is theyll get rebuilt then therell be continuously optimized over time” So there is a lot to unpack there Let’s start with clarifying some of the jargon to better understand the insights beneath the surface Fine-tuning is a technique for customizing a pre-trained AI model such as OpenAI’s GPT-4 model to new tasks for companies to utilize in their own processes and services using their own proprietary data RLHF stands for Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback To put it simply it is a technique used for training AI models whereby human assessors provide feedback to the system in terms of which outputs are preferable and which responses need to be modified in order to prevent any undesirable outcomes Note that these processes can be repetitive in nature as businesses continuously gain new data relating to how consumers use the new AI-powered products and services requiring more and more fine-tuning and RLHF driving recurring revenue for Azure Nadella also mentioned the process of “retrieval” which refers to AI models finding relevant information from a large collection of documents or data based on a user’s query In order for cloud customers to conduct retrieval they indeed need to store their data on the Azure platform leading to increased usage of Microsoft’s various data storage and management solutions In fact on the last earnings call Nadella offered details into the increased demand for such services: “Cosmos DB data transactions increased 42% year-over-year and for those organizations who want to go beyond in-database vector search Azure AI search offers the best hybrid search solution OpenAI is using it for retrieval augmented generation as part of ChatGPT And this quarter we made Microsoft Fabric generally available helping customers like Milliman and PwC go from data to insights to action all within the same unified SaaS solution Data stored in Fabrics multi-cloud data lake OneLake increased 46% quarter-over-quarter” And as these cloud customers launch their own AI-powered products and services and collect more and more consumer data the amount of data stored and analyzed on Azure will also increase enabling Azure to generate more revenue from Cosmos DB and Microsoft Fabric to the benefit of shareholders Another key point made by the CEO was that these workloads have “lifecycles” What does he mean by that? Well keep in mind that new and more advanced AI models will continue to be introduced over time which cloud customers will adopt to power their business services replacing their old workloads using previous generation models This will incur processes like fine-tuning and RLHF being conducted all over again which will repeatedly require more cloud computing instances on Azure conducive to recurring revenue for shareholders over the long-term All the major cloud providers are spending heavily on AI infrastructure in order to be able to optimally capitalize on the anticipated surge in cloud computing demand as industries and businesses inevitably transform in this new era Nonetheless despite the heavy AI-related capex Microsoft sustained the operating profit margin for the Intelligent Cloud segment (which includes Azure) at 48% through a disciplined cost structure and pragmatic growth approach Nexus data compiled from company filings Nexus data compiled from company filings In fact CFO Amy Hood also outlined how the Microsoft expects company-wide margins to expand this year: “As we scale these investments we remain focused on driving efficiencies across every layer of our tech stack and disciplined cost management across every team Therefore we expect full-year operating margins to be up 1 to 2 points year-over-year even as AI capital investments drive COGS growth This operating margin expansion excludes the impact from the Activision acquisition and the headwind from the change in useful lives last year” As per the disclosures available Microsoft’s Intelligent Cloud unit boasts the highest operating profit margins out of all three major cloud providers at 48% compared with 296% for AWS and 940% for Google Cloud (Note that Google Cloud also includes Google Workspace while for Microsoft the productivity applications business is separate from its cloud services) So not only is Microsoft delivering compelling cloud revenue growth to take market share but it is also doing so without compromising profitability enhancing Microsoft stock’s appeal as an investment security Copilot monetization details needed to sustain rally: While the market is now convinced about Azure’s AI growth story another important aspect of the bullish narrative is the rollout of Microsoft’s Copilot assistant for Microsoft 365 productivity suites After all the ‘Productivity and Business Processes’ segment accounted for 31% of Microsoft’s total revenue in FY Q2 2024 While the executives offered upbeat commentary regarding the pace of growth for the AI assistant the lack of financial details and projections regarding the monetization of Copilot was a disappointment for investors If executives continue to choose not to disclose Copilot monetization figures over the next few quarters it may undermine stock price performance MSFT Stock Valuation: Microsoft stock currently trades at a forward P/E of 3442x considerably above its 5-year average of 3039x given the notable re-rating of the stock over the past year as the market priced in the tech giant’s AI-driven growth prospects Bears argue that the expensive valuation raises the risk of a correction Although that being said the stock isn’t too expensive relative to historical valuations when considering the PEG ratio While forward P/E is a popular valuation metric it doesn’t take into consideration the company’s future earnings growth prospects Oftentimes a stock’s high P/E ratio can be justified if the company’s earnings are indeed growing at a high rate And this is where the forward PEG ratio comes in which measures the forward P/E relative to projected EPS growth rates The PEG ratio is essentially calculated by dividing a stock’s forward P/E ratio by the estimated earnings growth rate over a period of time And a PEG ratio of 1 is considered a fairly valued stock whereby the forward P/E ratio should equate the future growth rate of the company’s earnings Although it is important to note that highly sought-after growth stocks rarely tend to trade at a PEG of 1 and instead the market often assigns a premium to these stocks’ valuations based on factors such as market leadership position product strength and differentiation confidence in a company’s executive team as well as balance sheet strength Microsoft stock currently trades at a forward PEG of 230 While this is a lofty valuation take into consideration that the 5-year average PEG for the stock is 228 reflecting the market’s willingness to pay a considerable premium for the investment security given Microsoft Corporation’s dominant market position and safe-haven nature Hence from this perspective the stock is trading in-line with its historical valuation despite the new AI-driven growth prospects For context key rivals Amazon and Google are trading at a PEG of 234 and 128 respectively So Microsoft stock trades at a similar valuation to Amazon and a premium relative to Google Although it is worth noting that Microsoft Azure is much more profitable than Google Cloud In addition Microsoft’s flagship business segment Productivity and Business Processes (selling Microsoft 365 apps) is much better positioned to benefit from AI than Google’s main source of revenue Search advertising which is perceived to be disrupted by the generative AI revolution Therefore Microsoft stock deserves to trade at a premium relative to Google So while Microsoft stock is certainly expensive it should not deter long-term investors from taking a position in the stock as such high-quality names

395,"None","2/6/2024","https://www.khaleejtimes.com/business/microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-caps-a-decade-of-change-and-tremendous-growth","Mon Mar 25 2024 Ramadan 15 1445 Published: Tue 6 Feb 2024 7:43 PM Satya Nadella marks his tenth year as Microsoft CEO on Sunday capping a decade of stunning growth as he pivoted the slow-moving software giant into a laser focus on cloud computing and artificial intelligence Microsoft’s stock has soared by more than 1000 per cent since Nadella took the helm in 2014 compared to the more gradual 185 per cent growth of the broader S&P 500 Microsoft now has a market value of $3 trillion — more than any US publicly traded company including its longtime rival Apple “Nadella’s had the biggest transformation of a tech company potentially ever” said Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives “The only one that would rival it was (Steve) Jobs coming back to Apple and turning it around with the iPhone” Microsoft has created $28 trillion in shareholder wealth in the past decade meaning an investor who bought a $10000 stake in Microsoft at the time Nadella took over and did nothing with those shares would have a stake worth about $113000 now “Our industry does not respect tradition — it only respects innovation” Nadella told employees in an inaugural memo 10 years ago an opening salvo that hinted at bigger shifts to come Microsoft declined requests for an interview Now a hero to Wall Street some were at first sceptical that such transformation could come from an insider who’d already spent 22 years at the Redmond Washington company He’s only the third Microsoft CEO following Steve Ballmer who lasted for 14 years and Bill Gates who co-founded the company in 1975 and took it public in 1986 Big changes came quickly under Nadella He marshalled resources to build up the Azure cloud computing platform a shift in priorities from the company’s long-time reliance on its flagship Windows operating system and the royalties it gets for each PC sold with it And he largely put the brakes on Microsoft’s ill-fated attempts to play catch-up in the smartphone market marked by his predecessor Ballmer’s $73 billion acquisition of Nokia’s phone business But some of the biggest changes were in the company’s culture a shift away from Microsoft’s brash external reputation and internal bickering to a more collaborative approach that Nadella has modelled in his own collegial personality and engineer’s mindset “Microsoft is known for rallying the troops with competitive fire” Nadella said in his 2017 autobiography “The press loves that but it’s not me” Much of Nadella’s strength is how he stands out from the typical “very strong ego CEO” said Raimo Lenschow a stock analyst at Barclays who covers 36 tech companies Instead of making bold pronouncements Lenschow said Nadella takes a more measured approach to explaining “where he thinks the future is going” And “whether it’s the person making food in the cafeteria an engineer finance executive a customer he treats everyone in the same way with respect” said Ives It’s not just Wall Street analysts who think so A tiny startup from Zeeland Michigan running a booth at January’s CES gadget show in Las Vegas caught a glimpse of Nadella’s curiosity when he showed up shook founder Tim Murphy’s hand and asked for a demo The product Audio Radar visualises the sounds in video games for deaf and hard of hearing players “He’s very down to earth” said Murphy who was there with a small crew including his teen son “I gave him the pitch played some games and he was like ‘It’s wonderful what you’re doing’ Honestly I can’t really remember too much of what he said because I was just kind of shocked” Nadella has long made the accessibility of technology a priority informed in part by his experience raising a son who was visually impaired quadriplegic and had cerebral palsy Zain Nadella died in 2022 What’s brought Microsoft to its latest heights is its emergence as an artificial intelligence leader setting the agenda on how AI tools could get used in work and society While Nadella has been emphasising AI for most of his tenure its role was not guaranteed and happened after years of careful planning that led to a close partnership with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI (OpenAI pays The Associated Press an undisclosed fee to license its archive of news stories) “Historically if you’re a cool startup that was doing something amazing Microsoft wasn’t really your first choice” Lenschow said “So the fact that he got OpenAI to commit to Azure was an amazing masterstroke it gives him a massive competitive advantage over Google and Amazon” That position was put in jeopardy late last year when OpenAI’s board of directors suddenly fired CEO Sam Altman A weekend of behind-the-scenes manoeuvres and a threatened mass exodus of employees championed by Nadella helped bring back Altman and stabilise the startup assuaging clients and shareholders Nadella’s tenure hasn’t been without hiccups especially given how much of the world relies so heavily on Microsoft products — sometimes to the frustration of people using them Cybersecurity experts say its tendency is to sacrifice security for convenience including in its gung-ho rollout of AI large language models The company’s trademark suite of work tools Microsoft Office 365 has also been penetrated successfully in recent years in embarrassing high-profile compromises that have seen elite Russian and Chinese cyber operators access the email accounts of senior US officials and members of Microsoft’s senior leadership team It stepped in to provide cloud hosting to Ukraine just ahead of Russia’s 2022 invasion but the networks serving NATO allies are constantly peppered by intrusion attempts That and the worsening ransomware scourge have led Nadella to call for a cyber Geneva Convention with Russia and China And despite Nadella’s stated aversion to “competitive fire” Microsoft is once again drawing the kind of antitrust scrutiny that dogged Gates and Ballmer in earlier years Nadella’s confident testimony at a federal court hearing last summer helped persuade a judge not to block Microsoft’s purchase of video game giant Activision Blizzard but the company is now facing another round of questions on its partnership with OpenAI None of those challenges are likely to push Nadella 56 who made $485 million in total compensation last year and has also chaired Microsoft’s board since 2021 out of his leadership roles anytime soon “From everything I can gather he’s really enjoying himself” Lenschow said “We’re in very very very interesting times I would expect him to stay for a while” Get news and views from the world of golf delivered to your inbox every Wednesday business The launch of the Abu

But there’s another tech stock offering more value Image source: Getty Images Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) continues to trade on a tear though shares dipped slightly this week as the world’s largest company hit 52-week highs Yet according to analysts there should be even more room to run That might be true but the stock continues to be incredibly expensive and volatile So let’s look at why you might want to buy or avoid this stock and perhaps another tech stock to consider The biggest bullish bet for Microsoft stock comes from the company’s ability to continue its incredible revenue growth Yet analysts believe that growth should continue especially after company comments on its cloud business Microsoft stock reported its capital expenditure forecast for the future with spending to “increase materially on a sequential basis” This comes after more investments into both cloud and artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure What this points to is the company is likely to see a large increase in cloud revenue in the future Furthermore even though Microsoft stock continues to be the one to beat for AI there is reason to believe it could scale out at an incredible level Yet after hitting those 52-week highs shares of Microsoft stock are down trading at about US$404 as of writing This could mean a huge opportunity for shareholders in the future with the consensus target price now at US$451 as of writing Analysts have been increasing the guidance on the heels of even more product innovation and learning from their clients to drive even more innovation in the future And AI should continue to be a large part of this process AI alone contributed to a six-point increase in cloud growth in the latest quarter This means AI is becoming the core product for Microsoft stock Yet if you want in on AI there are other companies working with Microsoft stock on this AI future including a Canadian tech stock you’ll want to consider One company investors will want to consider is OpenText (TSX:OTEX) a company that also deals in cloud data and AI During its recent earnings report the company achieved record revenue results yet saw shares drop as it narrowed its earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization However in an interview with the Motley Fool Chief Financial Officer Mandhu Ranganathan stated that this is to help the company invest more in AI And a recent divestment of part of its Micro Focus acquisition will certainly help with that In fact the company announced last year it will be rolling out seven new AI vectors Each will help a different part of the company’s productivity and optimization And given that the company is a partner with Microsoft stock if OpenText stock does well so too will Microsoft stock and vice versa AI is the future and there are many companies around the world getting into it But if you want the best of the best for revenue growth and more cloud usage then I would consider Microsoft stock and OpenText stock However if you’re only going to choose one OpenText stock offers far more value than Microsoft stock at this point Despite dropping in share price that’s likely to turn around as the company grows cloud bookings and integrates more AI And with more cash coming their way buybacks have also been noted as part of the future So certainly consider this stock if you’re also looking at Microsoft stock today This article represents the opinion of the writer who may disagree with the “official” recommendation position of a Motley Fool premium service or advisor We’re Motley!

marketing customized end-to-end shopping experiences—these are a few of the baseline experiences expected by retail customers today As retail’s frontline workforce rises to meet these customer expectations they face crunched supply chains and a digital deficit of outdated technology and siloed systems Microsoft Teams In the race to deliver engaging in-store experiences Microsoft Teams is uniquely positioned to equip retailers such as La Vie en Rose and Domino’s with a single platform to transform their store team’s operations and deliver first-in-class customer experiences And with the potential to streamline tasks and save valuable time AI is quickly becoming a critical layer on top of existing communication solutions to help retailers deliver Even employees are ready and waiting for AI to be introduced with 65% of frontline workers optimistic about how AI will help them in their job With Microsoft Teams you can level up your retail workforce with smarter and simpler

streamlines information access for retail teams Learn more about Copilot in Microsoft Teams In November we announced Microsoft Copilot Studio a low-code tool designed to customize Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365 with plugins that connect to your existing systems and build standalone copilots For example a retail business can use Copilot Studio to create a custom Q&A copilot that connects to product information hosted on SharePoint making it easy for store associates to quickly get answers to customer questions Reaching the frontline with key information and news can be difficult both in targeting the right groups and then engaging them with the content once delivered It especially gets difficult if different communications are being sent to different apps adding cognitive load onto the frontline to find the right information across multiple communication sources Continuing to deliver on a single destination for frontline communications we’re excited to announce Copilot in Viva Engage in Teams available in public preview in January 2024 This Copilot experience uses AI-created conversation starters prompts and images to help inspire retail leadership and corporate communications teams to post in frontline communities and increase engagement with store teams right from the same place where they work And this AI-enhanced communication tool helps frontline retail teams increase the quality of questions being asked with suggested prompts Copilot in Viva Engage in Teams speeds up your ability to create impactful and dynamic communications for your organization

communications teams will soon be able to easily send important announcements like safety policy changes and store sales targeted to frontline employees based on location department and job roles from the Teams home experience These operational announcements will be pinned at the top of frontline workers’ home experience so they will never miss key messages that keep your business running smoothly

frontline workers’ daily work We’re building on the existing task publishing and automation capabilities in Microsoft Planner formerly known as the Tasks app in Microsoft Teams Your retail

a store audit task then task publishing will automatically take care of scheduling the publication Retail organizations will be able to enforce additional rules for a task to be marked as completed such as uploading photos completing a form as well as requiring approval before marking a task complete With this feature tasks can only be marked as complete once specific conditions are met ensuring high-quality work across the frontline Task publishing will also allow your organization to create a task that every member of the recipient team must complete Retailers can use this to publish a training task—for example health and safety trainings—to designated stores and locations These task management features will be generally available in March 2024 Sign up to be notified when these

The Zacks Style Scores developed alongside the Zacks Rank are complementary indicators that rate stocks based on three widely-followed investing methodologies; they also help investors pick stocks with the best chances of beating the market over the next 30 days Each stock is assigned a rating of A B C D or F based on their value growth and momentum characteristics Just like in school an A is better than a B a B is better than a C and so on -- that means the better the score the better chance the stock will outperform The Style Scores are broken down into four categories: Value Score For value investors its all about finding good stocks at good prices and discovering which companies are trading under their true value before the broader market catches on The Value Style Score utilizes ratios like P/E PEG Price/Sales Price/Cash Flow and a host of other multiples to help pick out the most attractive and discounted stocks Growth Score While good value is important growth investors are more focused on a companys financial strength and health and its future outlook The Growth Style Score takes projected and historic earnings sales and cash flow into account to uncover stocks that will see long-term sustainable growth Momentum Score Momentum traders and investors live by the saying the trend is your friend This investing style is all about taking advantage of upward or downward trends in a stocks price or earnings outlook Employing factors like one-week price change and the monthly percentage change in earnings estimates the Momentum Style Score can indicate favorable times to build a position in high-momentum stocks VGM Score What if you like to use all three types of investing? The VGM Score is a combination of all Style Scores making it one of the most comprehensive indicators to use with the Zacks Rank It rates each stock on their combined weighted styles which helps narrow down the companies with the most attractive value best growth forecast and most promising momentum How Style Scores Work with the Zacks Rank A proprietary stock-rating model the Zacks Rank utilizes the power of earnings estimate revisions or changes to a companys earnings outlook to help investors create a successful portfolio #1 (Strong Buy) stocks have produced an unmatched +2541% average annual return since 1988 which is more than double the S&P 500s performance over the same time frame However the Zacks Rank examines a ton of stocks and there can be more than 200 companies with a Strong Buy rank and another 600 with a #2 (Buy) rank on any given day But it can feel overwhelming to pick the right stocks for you and your investing goals with over 800 top-rated stocks to choose from Thats where the Style Scores come in You want to make sure youre buying stocks with the highest likelihood of success and to do that youll need to pick stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 that also have Style Scores of A or B If you like a stock that only as a #3 (Hold) rank it should also have Scores of A or B to guarantee as much upside potential as possible The direction of a stocks earnings estimate revisions should always be a key factor when choosing which stocks to buy since the Scores were created to work together with the Zacks Rank A stock with a #4 (Sell) or #5 (Strong Sell) rating for instance even one with Scores of A and B will still have a declining earnings forecast and a greater chance its share price will fall too Thus the more stocks you own with a #1 or #2 Rank and Scores of A or B the better Stock to Watch: Microsoft (MSFT Quick QuoteMSFT - Free Report) Microsoft Corporation is one of the largest broad-based technology providers in the world The company dominates the PC software market with more than 73% of the market share for desktop operating systems MSFT is a #2 (Buy) on the Zacks Rank with a VGM Score of B Additionally the company could be a top pick for growth investors MSFT has a Growth Style Score of A forecasting year-over-year earnings growth of 136% for the current fiscal year For fiscal 2024 one analysts revised their earnings estimate upwards in the last 60 days and the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $001 to $1114 per share MSFT boasts an average earnings surprise of 78% With a solid Zacks Rank and top-tier Growth and VGM Style Scores MSFT should be on investors short list Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) - free report >> Our experts picked 7 Zacks Rank #1 Strong Buy stocks with the best chance to skyrocket within the next 30-90 days Recent stocks from this report have soared up to +675% within 30 days - this months picks could be even better See our reports 7 new picks today - its really free!

So it seems like maybe theres some pretty good expectations baked in there ANGELO ZINO: Yeah I mean listen as far as Meta is concerned I mean if you look at the two best performers since the market lows in October in terms of the Mag Seven its of course been NVIDIA and the other kind of big outperformer has been Meta And a big reason for that is the valuation And the valuation to us is still somewhat enticing Were talking about 19 20 times on its calendar 25 basis but on a net cash basis even more attractive about 18 185 times So our view here is the numbers are going to look very good It should be another kind of beat and raise quarter given what weve seen out of the digital ad space here All eyes I think are really going to be on what they have to say on AI and how its improving their kind of ecosystem but also in terms of China China when you think about companies like Shein and Temu theyre spending a lot more on Metas ecosystem as they look to aggressively advertise outside of China because of the slowing market over there So within the US emerging markets like Brazil we think is going to be a big theme for Meta in 2024 We think theyre going to continue to show those beats and raises in the first half of this year Again offer some easy comps And in the second half of the year you do have a huge election going on right? So if there are investors out there looking to play the election here That is potentially a way to do it via Meta JULIE HYMAN: So finally while we got you I want to ask about Microsoft also just around them all up right? You mentioned AI of course as a factor for Meta Is AI the factor for Microsoft? Do you think investors are even going to pay attention to the rest of the business which is still most of the business? And do you think Microsoft is going to have to show some profitability tied to AI? ANGELO ZINO: So when we think about Microsoft really there are going to be three key secular growth drivers to this company right? The cloud is one AI is the other and then gaming is the other with that recent acquisition of Activision And we think all three areas are going to show very good prospects here for the December quarter On the cloud side of things they pointed towards some deceleration here for the December quarter from the September quarter still very healthy 27 or 28% If we see a number above that with greater contribution from AI AI was about three percentage points of contribution to cloud growth in the September quarter If we get something closer to 4 to 5 percentage points and again a beat on the cloud side of things we think thats where the upside potential is and where some excitement grows for Microsoft And then of course what they have to say about Copilot 365 that just launched in November We think theyre going to be very excited about it But the trajectory of Copilot of course is going to be a kind of a huge kind of area of interest out there for investors So thats what we would be looking out for Microsoft It is our top play in terms of it being a strong buy And 12-month target price is $440 Related Quotes"

Apples up 45000% Microsoft up 1200% I think a lot of investors would take that But essentially if you had to buy 2008 to 2010 to reach any comparable number with Apple and if you got in between 2000 and 2008 that was dead money That was a losing trade And thats because in the wake of the tech bubble and also the antitrust suit that Microsoft was facing 20 years ago it just became dead money for about a decade Let me now show you the story in terms of sales growth This is Apple sales growth going back into the late 90s This is when Steve Jobs took over And lets not forget Apple was left for dead almost went bankrupt How about that? But this incredible years-- these years of sales growth here a lot of them topping 75% Thats the iPod And then thats the iPhone And you can see things have trailed off The services side of the equation has gotten a lot of play here but it doesnt always live up to expectations Right now four quarters of declining revenue growth That is a negative situation for Apple Expectations are for that to be broken But well have to see how this plays out in earnings season Give it another month RACHELLE AKUFFO: Looking forward to that Our very own Jared Blikre Thank you so much Related Quotes"

sold land in Becker this week to Microsoft for a new data center the latest potential project in what is turning into a lucrative and energy-hungry business for the Minneapolis-based utility The $177 million sale of roughly 295 acres made public in records published by the state Department of Revenue is an early step toward what could be the second data center near Xcels large coal plant in Becker Little else is known about the Microsoft project Xcel declined to say more about the venture and Microsoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment But it could be a large project State utility regulators last year approved the sale of 348 acres of land in Becker to Elk River Technologies a mysterious company that could invest up to $1 billion in a new data center The Public Utilities Commission in October also approved Xcel electricity contracts with Meta Platforms for a $700 million data center project in Rosemount The potential rush of data centers is notable not only for the potential boost of jobs and other benefits to local communities Data centers — and electric vehicles — are at the heart of why Xcel is predicting a rare and significant jump in demand for energy on its Upper Midwest system In a new long-term energy plan the company forecasted an average of 2% annual growth in energy needs which it called a marked divergence from a long period of ultra-slow growth Gabe Chan a University of Minnesota professor who specializes in energy and climate policy said the spike in predicted energy sales is massive and fits with industry trends elsewhere in the country Really we havent seen this kind of load growth all hitting at the same time since probably the mass adoption of air conditioners Chan said Xcels plan says the company expects annual average growth of 2% for overall energy demand between now and 2040 and a similar rise in peak demand That may not sound enormous but over time it adds up Xcel is expecting to increase its electric load by roughly one-third over that time span when the company had projected only a slight uptick in its last long-range plan The primary cause of the spike is data centers and electric vehicles the company said followed by other energy use like the switch to electric space heating Electricity use has long been flat in the region and the country because of improvements in energy efficiency both in heavy industry but also in homes Chan said such as adoption of better air conditioners appliances and light bulbs Xcels predictions — and its request to build new power sources that it could financially benefit from — will likely be questioned as part of what will be a long regulatory planning process But the new uptick is also happening in many places nationwide Chan said Xcels forecast is even somewhat muted compared with the East Coast where regional grid operator PJM recently announced a sharp increase in forecasted growth primarily because of data centers and electric vehicles Beth Soholt executive director of Clean Grid Alliance a nonprofit trade group for wind solar and battery storage developers said the local grid operator has also struggled to plan and respond to load growth across its 15-state footprint and is seeing rising energy demand not just from data centers but also manufacturing spurred by the Inflation Reduction Act Chan said the rise in energy demand also comes as Xcel and others are shutting down coal plants creating the challenge of beefing up energy supply with enormous new fleets of wind solar and battery power while also losing large power sources The amount of new building that has to happen to replace whats retiring and to meet this one-third increase in load is really really big he said Nothing like this has ever happened before in at least the recent history of the grid Last year Xcel predicted that the number of electric vehicles in its service area would grow at least tenfold by 2033 from about 34500 light-duty cars in June to somewhere between 350400 and almost 1 million Chan said the substantial jump in EVs would put pressure on Xcels power distribution grid requiring costly upgrades to infrastructure such as substations Xcel said in regulatory filings that demand for data centers has surged because of an expansion in machine learning and artificial intelligence technologies which are more energy-intensive than traditional data processing methods The companies are largely after renewable and carbon-free energy options with Xcel the utility said The data center will bring investment and jobs to the area providing the economic development the community has been seeking Xcel spokesman Kevin Coss said about the Microsoft deal As the electric provider for the area we will be engaged in the site development process Data centers traditionally have been an attractive customer for utilities Chan said because their energy needs are large but consistent And the rise in energy sales to those data centers can benefit all Xcel customers But he said planning for the data centers is tricky as the power supply relies more on variable renewable energy Plus even as more are being built deals can fall through so utilities like Xcel must be careful not to build more power generation than it needs and leave ratepayers on the hook for infrastructure costs In 2022 Google backed out of a planned $600 million data center in Becker The data centers are often wrapped in secrecy too with much information about deals shrouded as trade secrets at the PUC Whether there is a larger company behind the Elk River Technologies facility is unknown for example Xcel declined to say on Friday The involvement of Meta in the Rosemount center was shielded for a while before the company was eventually revealed Both Elk River and Meta could be among Xcels largest customers State officials determined the Meta data center would ultimately benefit Xcel ratepayers A second even bigger center data center has been floated in Rosemount Last week before the Microsoft deal became public Xcel wrote in PUC filings that its actively engaged with several hyperscale and colocation data centers and the company is studying how to potentially connect projects to the grid Walker Orenstein covers energy natural resources and sustainability for the Star Tribune Before that he was a reporter at MinnPost and at news

Experts with SEBI registered creators Learn from Courses & Webinars by Indias Finest Finance Experts Invest Now Sam Altman’s goal of raising about $7 trillion to make artificial-intelligence chips tells a story beyond his borderline-insane ambitions First the infrastructure needed to build AI has become exorbitantly expensive Second most of that value is still — still! — held by a handful of large technology companies — and the oligopoly is only going to get worse For all the competition that was spurred by the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022 and the flurry of new startups that jumped into the hyped-up generative AI market most of those new players will likely fold or be folded into the incumbents over the next year or so The costs of doing business are too high for them to survive on their own Take Sasha Haco the chief executive officer of Unitary which scans videos on social media for rule-breaking content It would cost her company 100 times more than it charges clients to subscribe to OpenAI’s video-scanning AI tools So Unitary makes its own models which is a high-wire balancing act in itself Her startup needs to rent access to those rare AI chips via cloud vendors like Microsoft Corp and Amazoncom Inc’s Amazon Web Services Those chips have doubled in price since 2020 Haco says and they’re difficult to reserve “We’ve had times when we can’t get access to what we need and so we have to pay 10 times the price” she told me Unitary makes it work but Haco admits that no generative AI startup has figured out how to run a low-cost business at scale at least not in the same way that large tech firms have Another AI founder in San Francisco tells me that some of his peers who have to rent AI chips and cloud computing find that the only way they make money “is if people don’t use the product” “The best analogy is electricity” says Ronald Ashri CEO of startup Dialogueai which creates tailored chatbots for regulated industries “You’re plugged into a foundation model and that is your electricity and you are consuming it constantly The consumption is the single highest cost in the solution that we deliver to clients” Generative AI startups can build their technology in two different ways They can develop their own version of OpenAI’s GPT-4 or Google’s Gemini for instance a so-called foundation model that requires hundreds of millions of dollars in investment Or they can build on top of an existing model which only needs tens of millions in investment and which the vast majority of AI startups do today In both cases the prime beneficiaries are cloud-computing giants Microsoft Amazon and Alphabet Inc’s Google and AI chip maker Nvidia Corp Right now all these startups take money from venture capital investors and give it to cloud companies and Nvidia” says Rodolfo Rosini CEO of chip company Vaire Computing That’s why Nvidia has seen its shares more than double in the last year putting it near a $2 trillion valuation You would think that large tech firms would look across the landscape of AI startups and lick their chops at this dynamic hungry to acquire new talent and ideas But it’s not that simple Most new generative AI startups don’t have many hard-core AI research scientists to make them an attractive way to buy talent since they’re reliant on the bigger third-party models Those startups are often staffed with regular software engineers On top of that big tech acquirers like Meta Platforms Inc are already investing heavily in their own internal AI efforts says Nathan Benaich founder of London-based AI-focused venture capital firm Air Street Capital and many of those companies were cutting significant costs just last year An even bigger stumbling block is regulation Big tech firms are rightly wary of antitrust blowback on any major AI deals thanks to the recent wave of stricter antitrust enforcement Hence the shift to investing instead Big tech investments in AI startups hit more than $246 billion in 2023 up from $44 billion in 2022 — a shift aimed at avoiding regulatory scrutiny according to Brendan Burke a senior analyst at market research firm Pitchbook who also provided the figures Now that the US Federal Trade Commission is probing some of those investments — including Microsoft’s multibillion-dollar bet on OpenAI and Amazon’s investment in Anthropic — the pendulum could swing back towards conventional acquisitions Burke says The view is mixed among venture capital investors and startups about how much M&A will happen in the coming year What seems most likely: Regulatory pressure will prevent takeovers of leading AI startups that have valuations over $1 billion like Perplexity Cohere Characterai and Inflection They’ll attract investment instead — at least for the time being — with some of the long tail of smaller players getting scooped up while the rest of the upstarts fold under cost pressures The result will be a playing field that looks very similar to the one we have today where the biggest players continue to get larger That’ll be a win for big tech and arguably for consumers who will continue getting cheap access to AI But it’s a loss for competition and society too When the general-purpose AI that gets woven into all aspects of our lives is dominated by a small handful of firms that gives enormous power and influence to those firms We’d be better off

year already had some bulls saying its time to buy the dip in Apple stock But when one of Wall Streets largest broker-dealers joined the chorus before Thursdays opening bell it helped Apple recover billions in market value BofA Securities lifted its recommendation on AAPL stock to Buy from Neutral (the equivalent of Hold) citing the iPhone makers investments in generative artificial intelligence

implied upside of only 6% in the next year Importantly while some analysts have cited weaker iPhone sales in China as reasons to become more cautious on AAPL stock the BofA Securities team led by analyst Wamsi Mohan argued as part of its upgrade that Apples China weakness is largely offset by strength in other countries Although Apple routinely makes the list of Wall Streets top-ranked Dow Jones stocks worries over demand in China have AAPL off to a rough start in 2024 Apple stock is up about 38% over the past 52 weeks but shares have spent all of January in the red on a year-to-date basis hurt partly by downgrades Piper Sandler analyst Harsh Kumar cut his recommendation on the stock in early January to Neutral (the equivalent of Hold) from Overweight (Buy) citing a weak macroeconomic backdrop in China Kumars downgrade followed a more bearish downgrade by Barclays analyst Tim Long – to Underweight from Neutral – two days earlier Long also cited weaker revenue in China as a concern Apple has seen iPhone sales soften in China amid an economic slowdown and other factors Consumers are holding onto their pricey iPhones longer between refresh cycles analysts note while a new 5G phone from rival Huawei is also chipping away at iPhone demand While Apple stock has traded essentially sideways for six months on worries that growth has peaked fellow Magnificent 7 stock Microsoft overtook it as the global leader in market capitalization thanks to exuberance over generative AI Microsoft which enjoys a sort of first-mover advantage in AI via its partnership with OpenAI

Microsoft stock 20 years ago would have clobbered the broader market Check out the stocks billionaires are buying or hedge funds top blue chip stocks and youll see that much of the putative smart money agrees with the Streets view which gives MSFT a rare consensus recommendation of Strong Buy Microsoft continues to pursue long-term growth through its AI and cloud investments and may just hold the premier position in business technology writes Argus Research analyst Joseph Bonner who rates shares at Buy It also has a large and loyal customer base a large cash cushion and a rock-solid balance sheet Have a look at the above chart and youll see how bullishness like Bonners helped Microsoft stock return nearly 65% over the past 52 weeks allowing it to surpass Apple in market

453,"Microsoft says Russians hacked emails to learn what company execs knew about cyberattackers","1/23/2024","https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2024/jan/23/microsoft-says-russians-hacked-emails-to-learn-wha/","Microsoft researchers said they discovered Russian hackers breaching executives’ emails to learn what the Big Tech company knew about the hackers in a tailored cyber espionage campaign looking for a peek behind the curtain surrounding digital investigators’ work Sensitive knowledge about Russian hacking operations resides at Microsoft The company has unique insight on top cyberattacker groups and the company has worked with the US intelligence community to blunt cyberattacks targeting Ukraine The hackers responsible for the new breaches of Microsoft executives’ emails belong to the same group behind the cyberattack hitting the SolarWinds computer network management software company which the Biden administration linked to the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) The state-sponsored Midnight Blizzard hackers which Microsoft has also referred to as Nobelium led an attack on Microsoft’s corporate systems that was detected earlier this month the Microsoft Security Response Center disclosed on Friday The attack began in late November 2023 when the vandals used a password spray attack to infiltrate a test account Microsoft said on its blog The hackers then used the compromised account to access a “very small percentage of Microsoft corporate email accounts including members of our senior leadership team and employees in our cybersecurity legal and other functions and exfiltrated some emails and attached documents” “The investigation indicates they were initially targeting email accounts for information related to Midnight Blizzard itself” Microsoft said on Friday “We are in the process of notifying employees whose email was accessed” The hackers likely utilized information obtained from previous breaches particularly during the SolarWinds cyberattacks that compromised federal networks according to Demi Ben-Ari co-founder of cybersecurity risk company Panorays Mr Ben-Ari a veteran of the Israeli Air Force said Microsoft has likely remediated some problems from past hacking but there are always loose ends “Eventually what they wanted to compromise were I won’t even say privileged accounts because they might not have a lot of privileges but they have access to confidential information” Mr Ben-Ari said Microsoft has not disclosed precisely what was targeted and who internally was affected but many people working at the company have handled matters involving the cyberattackers Some employees familiar with Nobelium’s methods are publicly disclosed on Microsoft’s websites The company made a four-part video series called “Decoding Nobelium” published in 2021 detailing the Russian hackers’ tactics and techniques The Big Tech titan has also not shied away from publicly calling out the Russian hackers’ work For example Microsoft said in August that it found the same Russian hacking group leveraging Microsoft’s conferencing platforms to victimize government accounts and other espionage targets Microsoft’s interactions with governments are very likely of interest to the Russian-sponsored hackers as well Microsoft was among the private tech companies that teamed up with the US intelligence community to thwart Russian cyberattackers before they could corrupt Ukrainian networks and advance on US systems US officials said last year Amb Nathaniel C Fick shed new light on Microsoft’s cybersecurity work in Ukraine during remarks to the German Marshall Fund last year He said Russian cyberattacks were not as effective as many feared inside Ukraine partially because of Microsoft’s near real-time collaboration with the US intelligence community Whether the Russian hackers’ espionage is retaliatory for any of the Big Tech company’s previous work remains unknown Microsoft declined to answer questions including about the hackers’ motivation and targeting Microsoft is working with law enforcement in response to the latest hack according to a Friday filing by the company with the US Securities and Exchange Commission Microsoft has also said it was shifting the balance it calibrates between security and business risk “For Microsoft this incident has highlighted the urgent need to move even faster” the company said in its blog post “We will act immediately to apply our current security standards to Microsoft-owned legacy systems and internal business processes even when these changes might cause disruption to existing business processes” Microsoft said the attack was not the result of a vulnerability in its products and that the company has no evidence that customer environments were affected but that it would notify customers if any additional action was necessary Microsoft told the SEC it removed the hackers’ access to affected email accounts on Jan 13 the day after the breach was detected • Ryan Lovelace can be reached at rlovelace@washingtontimescom

the company wrote Upon undertaking such actions we determined that such activity did not materially impact the Company HPE said it is working with law enforcement and will provide regulatory notifications if required as the investigation proceeds So far HPE said the hack has not had a material impact and that it has not determined the incident is reasonably likely to materially impact its

Blog","1/29/2024","https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-cloud/blog/2024/01/29/building-a-foundation-for-ai-success-technology-and-data-strategy/","This is part three of a six-part blog series See part one part two and download the white paper AI is redefining the boundaries of what’s possible but the unique demands of AI—from vast data volumes and high-speed processing requirements to complex security and compliance challenges—require a strategic approach to data and technology infrastructure “It’s been over a year now since generative AI became mainstream We are through the science experiment phase and leading companies are now putting AI into action” says Wangui McKelvey General Manager Microsoft Azure Data Analytics In this post we’ll focus on the five data and technology fundamentals required to deliver meaningful sustainable and responsible value creation with AI: Building a Foundation for AI Success: A Leader’s Guide Successful AI projects begin with a clear prioritized and valued set of business objectives such as maximizing productivity and efficiency improving customer experience or growth-oriented objectives such as revenue acquisition or product innovation These goals will help you prioritize use cases against likelihood of impact and realistically assess feasibility based on data and infrastructure requirements It’s also useful to think of your technology investments in aggregate as an investment portfolio which will enable you to set clear success criteria and reallocate resources across projects as needed Moving successfully from proof-of-concept (POC) to production with AI depends on a mix of technology and business factors that ideally must work together Microsoft cloud “Understanding how your business strategy maps to your product strategy and then how your product strategy maps to your infrastructure is key” says Omar Khan General Manager Microsoft Azure Product Marketing “AI-optimized infrastructure will help accelerate both building AI solutions and integrating AI into applications” From a technology perspective the most critical requirement is access to infrastructure that is built for AI—with the ability to run large AI workloads and perform securely and reliably at scale Data is the fuel that powers AI technology so planning for any successful AI implementation requires that you identify the right data sources and ensure that the data is complete of high quality in the right format and representative of your target customers and business objectives Microsoft AI “Organizations continue to see their data as their competitive advantage” says Wangui McKelvey “Unlocking insights from their data across their organization in a single integrated platform empowers businesses to take advantage of AI If you don’t understand the insights you can deliver from your data with AI then you’re going to be left behind” The decisions you make today to buy build or modernize your technology infrastructure can significantly influence your ability to execute on future goals so it’s essential to choose a path that is supportive of your organization’s vision Here are some of the considerations and trade-offs: Regulatory compliance particularly with the General Data Protection Requirement (GDPR) and the coming EU AI Act introduces a set of technical legal and operational considerations for infrastructure choices1 Factors such as data sensitivity data residency scalability and governance all play a part in architecture decisions whether organizations choose on-premises cloud or co-located deployments One critical factor to consider is access to sophisticated security measures that utilize machine learning AI and global threat intelligence databases to contribute to a more robust defense against cyber threats “Contrary to common belief on-premises environments are often less secure than the cloud” says Omar Khan “Despite the sense of control associated with in-house infrastructure cloud-based security solutions have evolved significantly offering more advanced tools and technologies for threat detection and mitigation” Stay tuned for the next post in our series “Building a Foundation for AI Success: AI strategy and experience” in which we will explore the factors that contribute to a successful AI strategy and experience for customers We will follow

Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/53736 (KHTML like Gecko) Chrome/120000 Safari/53736 Attackers predominantly utilize this user-agent to access the OfficeHome sign-in application along with unauthorized access to additional native Microsoft365 apps such as: Proofpoint included the following Indicators of compromise: As the campaign is ongoing Proofpoint may update the indicators as more become available The company advised companies to pay close attention to the user agent and source domains of incoming connections to employee accounts Other helpful defenses are employing security defenses that look for signs of both initial account compromise and post-compromise activities identifying initial vectors of compromise such as phishing malware or impersonation and putting in place auto-remediation policies to drive out attackers quickly in the event they get in Join the Ars Orbital Transmission mailing list to get weekly updates delivered to your inbox Sign me up → CNMN Collection WIRED Media Group © 2024 Condé Nast All rights reserved Use of and/or registration on any portion of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement (updated 1/1/20) and Privacy Policy and Cookie Statement (updated 1/1/20) and Ars Technica Addendum (effective 8/21/2018) Ars may earn compensation on sales from links on this site Read our affiliate link policy Your California Privacy Rights Do Not Sell My Personal Information The material on this site may not be reproduced distributed transmitted cached or otherwise used except with the prior written permission of Condé Nast Ad Choices"

A superficial glance might lead you to believe that AWS has an unprecedented edge over Azure but a deeper look will prove the decision isn’t that easy To determine the best cloud service provider one needs to take multiple factors into consideration such as cloud storage pricing data transfer loss rate and rates of data availability among others From elementary schools to NASA clouds have touched every sphere of our lives Who said superheroes are just found in comic books? Let us begin with to know the winner of the AWS vs Azure battle All data scientists are assumed to be familiar with Amazon Web Services (AWS) Its original purpose after its 2006 introduction was to manage Amazons e-commerce activities Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a cloud computing platform created and operated by Amazon Amazon Web Services has a wide range of global cloud-based products for business use The pay-as-you-go pricing model is used for storage databases analytics networking mobile development platforms and enterprise applications On February 1 2010 Azure was officially released as Windows Azure However by the end of March 2014 it was officially known as Microsoft Azure Microsoft Azure is a cloud computing service that allows users to create modify test deploy and maintain applications It also provides free access for the first 12 months It makes our work easier by giving us virtual machines fast ways to process data tools for analysis and monitoring and so on Azures pricing is also easy to understand and less expensive People often say Pay as you go which means that you only pay for what you use Launch Your Career into the Clouds!Post-Graduate Program in Cloud ComputingExplore Program In the early 2000s Amazon was forced to re-examine its development platforms as they catered to their third-party clients Over the years they had created a jumbled mess of IT infrastructure where multiple teams worked in silos—often performing the same tasks—with no thought given to efficiency In an effort to improvise Amazon’s software team detangled the mess that was their infrastructure and replaced it with well-documented APIs All was quiet until 2003 when during a retreat Amazon executives realized that they had the skills necessary to operate and execute scalable effective data centers The rest is history AWS is the world’s leading provider of cloud solutions providing IT infrastructure solutions on an as-needed basis for companies of all sizes Prominent companies that utilize AWS include Netflix Expedia Hulu Spotify and Ubisoft AWS is a complex and highly customizable platform that works best for companies that run non-Windows services Here are some points mentions the difference between AWS vs Azure The AWS interface is feature-rich and simple to use and the service comes with extensive informative documentation Azure organizes all of your account details and stores them in one place However its documentation is more challenging to understand and locate The licenses offered by AWS are more flexible and come with a greater variety of features Microsoft Azure is more convenient for Windows administrators to set up and offers more SaaS options Using AWS virtual private cloud users may create secure private networks in the Cloud (VPC) Azure uses a virtual network instead of a VPC A VPN gateway that enables the communication between different networks AWS SageMaker uses Cloud-Watch to record model metrics and data over time For capturing and tracking data Azure ML Studio uses ML-Flow AWS supports Linux and has connectors for open-source apps and it is ideal for developers working on open-source software Microsoft Azure is just now opening its doors to open-source developers AWS has services like Elastic Beanstalk Batch Lambda and container services but only needs some to host apps Azure has many ways to deploy apps such as cloud services container services functions batches and app services Amazon made $135 billion in the first quarter of 2021 much more than the $1033 billion it made in the first quarter of 2020 Azures Q2 2021 revenue rose 50% surpassing experts predictions of 46% but falling short of last years 59% Boost Your Cloud Skills Land an Architect RoleCloud Architect Masters ProgramExplore Program In the AWS vs Azure battle AWS had an unprecedented upper hand AWS was first launched in 2002 and its earliest competitor Google didn’t arrive until 2009 Microsoft didn’t step into the cloud market until 2010 Microsoft believed that the cloud infrastructure was just a trend that was soon going to fade away However after Amazon’s success Microsoft had to play catch up When Azure first launched it was not received well and faced many challenges especially when compared to AWS AWS had been running for almost 7 years and as a result they had more capital more infrastructure and better and more scalable services than Azure did More importantly Amazon could add more servers to its cloud infrastructure and make better use of economies of scale—something that Azure was scrambling to do This was a setback for Microsoft—not only was Microsoft dethroned as the leader in software infrastructure but it was now being shown the door by a non-IT newbie The tide soon changed for Azure Microsoft quickly revamped its cloud offering and added support to a variety of programming languages and operating systems They made their systems more scalable and made peace with Linux Today Azure is one of the leading cloud providers in the world Both Amazon and AWS technologies have in their own way contributed to the welfare of society For example NASA has used the AWS platform to make its huge repository of pictures videos and audio files easily discoverable in one centralized location giving people access to images of galaxies far away Similarly People in Need a nonprofit organization uses AWS to scale an early warning system that alerts about 400000 people in Cambodia when floods threaten This technology has not only helped save hundreds of lives but has also made available a cost-effective method that can be replicated by other at-risk regions The Azure IoT Suite was used to create the Weka Smart Fridge which keeps vaccinations properly stored This has helped nonprofit medical agencies ensure that their vaccinations reach people who otherwise don’t have access to these facilities Azure is also used to find solutions to the world’s looming freshwater crisis By working with Microsoft Azure Nalco Water the main water operational unit within Ecolab uses cloud computing and advanced analytics to create solutions to help organizations reuse and recycle water Azure and AWS are both well-respected members of the cloud domain They fight for a larger piece of the cloud pie and take the world by storm while doing so Azure holds about 294% of all installed application workloads while AWS stands at 415 percent and Google holds just 3 percent of all installed application workloads In 2017 AWS’s market share featured at 471 percent with Q4 revenue of $366 billion while Azure’s market share didn’t rise above 10 percent with a revenue of $69 billion (of course Microsoft’s revenue figures are higher because their cloud division includes both Azure and Office 365) However in its recent Q1 FY 2018 earnings report Microsofts revenue from Azure grew over 90% this year doubling the growth rate of AWS Learn From The Best AWS Mentors!AWS Solutions Architect Certification TrainingExplore Program Cloud computing allows companies to get new products on the market faster increase efficiency lower operational costs improve interdepartmental collaboration reduce capital expenditures and increase innovation Companies that are ill-equipped to handle these changes could run the risk of falling behind However to make the move to the cloud organizations must have trained professionals on the job who are certified in cloud computing Certified professionals can easily address the concerns that may arise during the transition to the cloud and are familiar with the nuances of cloud-based computing Due to this need for certified professionals a huge demand for skilled employees has been largely unmet LinkedIn reports that cloud and distributed computing topped the list of sought-after skills in both 2016 and 2017 Dice reports that job listings for the AWS cloud platform increased by 76 percent between 2015 and 2016 In 2015 39 million jobs were affiliated with cloud computing Bootcamp in the United States and over 18 million worldwide For qualified professionals salaries are very high and competitive According to Forbes jobs in cloud computing are well compensated with an average salary of $125591 for AWS certified professionals With the onset of cloud computing several major cloud providers quickly rose to dominance but today AWS and Azure lead the industry These two cloud hosting platforms drive much of the job growth in the cloud computing space which leads to a dilemma for job seekers With both AWS and Azure as dominant players in the market which cloud certification makes the most sense for your career path? Should you pursue AWS certification or Azure certification? There are benefits and drawbacks to each certification which should be considered before choosing which one to pursue Boost Your Cloud Skills Land an Architect RoleCloud Architect Masters ProgramExplore Program When it comes to the differences between AWS vs Azure there are plenty Both come with their own advantages and disadvantages AWS and Azure are the two top players in the cloud technology space because both are very good at what they provide in different ways In order to narrow down which platform is the right one to become certified in an evaluation of the benefits of each certification is warranted The Benefits of AWS Certification: Although Azure is rapidly gaining market share AWS is still by far the largest cloud computing service provider in the world today AWS certification carries extra weight because of additional marketability due to the number of companies utilizing the platform In addition AWS certification grants access to the AWS Certified LinkedIn Community and other AWS certified professionals There are several AWS certifications for Developers and professionals to choose from including AWS SysOps Associate AWS Developer Associate gcp certification and Cloud Architect Certification The Benefits of Azure Certification: An Azure certification is backed by the Microsoft brand giving the added benefit to candidates familiar with the in-house data platforms Azure is used by over 55 percent of all Fortune 500 companies and gaining Azure certification increases the possibility of candidates finding a job in one of these companies In addition about 365000 new companies adopt Azure every year regularly increasing the need for Azure-certified professionals Several Azure certifications are available to choose from including Cloud Solution Architect Developing Microsoft Azure Solutions Architect Microsoft Azure Implementing Microsoft Azure and Cloud Architect Both AWS and Azure are considered to be adaptable reliable and resolute—much like the superheroes we all admire They help us solve global problems and make our lives easy They adapt to the needs of their customers and lend a hand to governments and companies in solving various social and logistical issues Sure superheroes have helped their citizens and kept them safe but cloud service providers like AWS and Azure have helped professionals revolutionize their industries without having to break the bank Cloud systems have made it possible for companies like Uber Salesforce and Facebook to exist—all services we take for granted today Launch Your Career into the Clouds!Post-Graduate Program in Cloud ComputingExplore Program Azure and AWS provide users with similar capabilities and both cloud systems are extremely comprehensive The availability of the greater Microsoft ecosystem including numerous productivity tools business apps and of course Windows influences the majority of Azure adopters AWS on the other hand can be less expensive and is frequently the preferred choice for first-time adopters 1 Innovation: AWSs innovative features can benefit your cloud operations It also aids in assessing your companys current status planning for the future and solving any issues that may have arisen 2 Easy to use - AWS is user-friendly The platforms design is optimized for user efficiency AWS Management Console lets you quickly access inbuilt apps and services or add a SAAS app The system can be used without coding or technical knowledge Companies hire AWS-certified IT professionals for smooth operations 3 Cost-effective - Small businesses like AWS because of its affordability No upfront payment is required The versatile technology lets users extend space to meet corporate needs Launching a product is difficult AWS clients can start with a basic package and upgrade as needed 1 Limitations on security: The availability of AWS resources varies by area The controls for Amazon EC2 and Amazon VPC administer these limits This is done to prevent users from squandering resources and unnecessary costs In addition it serves as a preventative step making it less likely that those with ill intentions will use its facilities to carry out attacks 2 Cloud computing issues - Although Cloud Computing has caused a stir in the IT sector it has its share of issues Millions of users could experience disruptions in service owing to power outages or network problems Backup security data leakage and user privacy have all been mentioned as points of contention 1 Improved scalability -With Azure you can build apps that function smoothly without interruption and expand from 10 to ten million clients without further coding The cloud storage services offered by Azure are robust secure and efficient in terms of both performance and cost Adding more processors to the application and adjusting its settings is without hassle 2 Business sustainability - Businesses prefer Azure because of its rapid reaction time and short development cycles encouraging curiosity about the platforms lesser-known capabilities 3 Higher availability and redundancy - There are three hallmarks of Azures service offerings Access to its cloud services is simple safe and expandable and it gives all three As a storage system it is unparalleled in both speed and efficiency 4 Hybrid capabilities - Azure offers hybrid capabilities that make it unique Azure offers seamless mobility and a stable uniform platform across on-premise and public clouds Azure offers hybrid connections to boost usability and speed including VPNs caches CDNs and Express-Route 5 Security and disaster recovery - No other cloud service can compare to Azure regarding data security Azure SQL databases and virtual machines may be backed up with only a click Microsoft Azures data recovery time is 66% faster than an on-premise IT solution in service interruption or data loss 1 Requires management - Youll still require data management even though youll save on IT hardware and upkeep locally Microsoft Azure doesnt manage cloud data centers It means youll require ground staff that knows about using Azure which involves server management and upgrading It would be best if you learned that talent or found another way 2 Requires expertise - Business computing power is one of Azures main challenges Moving from being on systems to the Cloud may mean losing processing power This cloud-based platform may cost several thousand dollars annually to generate the same computing power The article has explained the pros and cons and the differences between AWS vs Azure So who’s to say what will come next? In 2015 no one thought Azure could catch up; but they’ve proven the naysayers wrong The cloud wars are unpredictable and exciting Who would you count on - AWS or Azure? Will Azure overtake AWS? Will Google Cloud be the underdog that will disrupt the cloud domain? Only time will tell But one thing is certain - the battle between AWS vs Azure may continue but the cloud is here to stay In the ongoing debate between AWS and Azure the AWS Solution Architect Certification stands out as an important player in the professional world While both AWS and Azure provide a diverse set of cloud computing services and capabilities AWS is frequently praised for its extensive service offerings robust global infrastructure and pioneering role in the cloud industry I love Raiders of the Lost Ark like many people out there and so we structured the story based on it The way the heroes in the comicographic take punches thats Indy The comicographic does not have a definite conclusion and curiosity is maintained with the rat at the end thats all Raiders! The films soundtrack was the real power-booster for me while I illustrated the comicographic for 2 months I even dreamt about the music after I was done working on it! It is the finest popcorn movie ever made the only reason its not the greatest blockbuster film ever made is that it wasnt the 1975 movie with a certain Shark named Bruce dying in the end Its a real thrill paying homage to some of my favorite comic book artists through the comicographic like--Jack Kirby Alex Ross Jim Lee Frank Cho and many more - Chetan Ramesh Microsoft Azure and AWS both offer comparable services but both are trying to take the top spot It is clear from the AWS vs Azure comparison that AWS is more well-known than Azure yet the market share and revenue growth figures show that Microsoft Azure entered the market more quickly Due to its almost 7-year operating history AWS has greater resources infrastructure and superior scalable services than Azure More significantly while Azure was attempting to catch up Amazon could expand its cloud infrastructure by adding more servers and utilizing economies of scale more effectively Azure is regarded as a Platform as a Service (PaaS) as well as an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) provider Because of its parent business Azure is a very potent offering Microsoft offers an infrastructure support level that is comparable to a few other businesses On the other hand AWS has a big toolkit that is expanding exponentially much like Amazon itself AWS has more than 10 years of experience in the cloud computing sector making it the market leader and has been for some time Platform as a Service (PaaS) Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Software as a Service are the three categories under which AWS services fall (Saas) Both Azure and AWS may be difficult to learn if you dont know what youre doing or they can be quite simple if youre well instructed Many IT experts however argue that AWS is far easier to learn and obtain certification in Again more AWS learning materials (blogs eBooks video lessons) are available online Pay-as-you-go pricing is available from both Azure and AWS Azure is billed per minute whereas Amazon Web Services is billed hourly Azure provides greater flexibility in short-term subscription arrangements When the two are compared Azure is more costly Azure is the finest alternative for a robust Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) provider and even a Windows integration If a company needs infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) or a wide range of tools AWS may be the ideal option It will be determined by the needs of the users Amazon Web Services (AWS) Amazoncoms cloud computing business is the worlds largest cloud service provider The company offers over 200 fully featured services from its data centers including computing storage and database Azures income has increased by 50% but the figures are not public AWS now has a 40% market share whereas Azure has a 30% market share AWS looks to be the market leader in terms of market share and revenue Ask yourself the following five questions to find out: What kind of computing power will I require? How Much Storage Do I Need for My Companys Infrastructure? What Kind of Database do I Require? What Network Capabilities Does My Business Require? And What Am I Able to Afford? When comparing the incomes of AWS and Azure certified experts we can observe that AWS certified professionals are more likely to be paid than Azure certified professionals Amazon Web Services certainly wins the popularity game Despite having nearly a third of the market AWS is still ahead by more than 10% According to market data more than 415% of apps and services are used by Amazon Web Services Microsoft Azures notion of speed is altogether different although they do place a focus on locating data centers across the world to provide consumers the best chance of receiving their data when they need it One of the primary advantages of adopting Azure is how flexible it is due to its easier scaling It merely takes a single click to increase service levels and businesses are free to drop these higher service levels when they no longer want the extra storage computation or support Microsoft Azure has thought of almost everything including a whole end-to-end array of services Both Azure and AWS may be difficult to learn if you dont know what youre doing or they can be quite simple if youre well instructed Many IT experts however argue that AWS is far easier to learn and obtain certification in Finally the decision is yours If you want to get certified in the most popular cloud technology today choose AWS It has a larger market share than any other cloud service provider and will most likely continue to do so Shyamli is a Senior Research Analyst at Simplilearn She is proficient in Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Cloud Computing Android Development and other coding languages like C C++ and Java Cloud Architect AWS Cloud Architect Post Graduate Program in Cloud Computing *Lifetime access to high-quality self-paced e-learning content How to Become an AWS Solutions Architect?

artificial intelligence (AI) stocks are in and electric vehicle (EV) stocks are out While startup EV stocks Rivian (RIVN) and Lucid (LCID) are selling off hard in the early going after their latest quarterly reports AI chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) continues to defy gravity after its highly anticipated Q4 results with the shares leading todays rally on Wall Street Sitting out todays upside is EV giant Tesla (TSLA) whose market cap now stands at $6203 billion - down from a peak north of $1 trillion at its highs Todays remarkably lopsided earnings reactions could add fuel to the fire for those who argue that TSLA should be booted from the elite group of stocks known as the “Magnificent Seven which also includes Nvidia Microsoft (MSFT) Amazon (AMZN) Meta (META) Apple (AAPL) and Alphabet (GOOGL) While its an informal title the Magnificent Seven moniker isnt just window dressing These companies collectively added a staggering $51 trillion in total market cap during 2023 and the universe of all US-listed stocks would have advanced by just 126% last year without the Magnificent Sevens influence compared to 233% with their returns included Thats why debates are starting to flare about Teslas inclusion in the group as the Elon Musk-led company has been pressured by a litany of troubles since the start of the year With Tesla stock now down 226% on a YTD basis heres a look at three mega-cap stocks worthy of replacing the EV maker in the Magnificent Seven Founded in 1961 and based out of Palo Alto Calif Broadcom (AVGO) is a global leader in infrastructure technology providing a wide range of semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions for data centers cloud computing networking and wireless communications It currently commands a massive market cap of $5742 billion AVGO stock is up 154% on a YTD basis Moreover the stock offers a dividend yield of 171% backed by 13 years of growth In its third-quarter earnings report Broadcom beat Wall Streets expectations on both the top line and bottom line Revenues for the quarter came in at $93 billion up 4% from the previous year Adjusted EPS improved 6% to $1106 surpassing the consensus estimate of $1096 Notably the companys EPS has topped expectations in each of the past five quarters Further Broadcom is expected to be one of the primary beneficiaries of the booming AI market Its the second-largest AI chip company by revenue behind only Nvidia - powered by heavy demand from partners like Google Plus its recent acquisition of VMware should bolster AVGOs cloud credentials Analysts have an average rating of “Strong Buy” for AVGO stock which is already trading above its mean price target of $117143 However the Street-high target price of $1550 indicates an upside potential of about 20% from current levels Out of 25 analysts covering the stock 21 have a “Strong Buy” rating and 4 have a “Hold” rating After its latest blowout earnings report streaming giant Netflix (NFLX) is next up on our list as a potential new entrant in the “Magnificent Seven” club Established in 1997 Netflix is a global subscription streaming service primarily offering original and acquired films and TV shows that are personalized according to the viewers preferences Its market cap currently stands at $2481 billion Netflix stock has rallied 196% on a YTD basis easily outperforming the broader equities market For the December quarter Netflix posted a robust set of numbers highlighted by a significant jump in the bottom line While revenues rose by 125% from the previous year to $88 billion this pales in comparison to the streamers earnings growth EPS shot up from a mere $012 in the prior year to $211 in the latest quarter though still fell short of consensus estimates However investors overlooked the EPS shortfall as Netflix shattered subscriber growth expectations by adding 131 million members globally during Q4 With its laser focus on content and a large dedicated user base Netflix outshines its upstart streaming competitors with its shows dominating the ratings charts consistently Coupled with one of the lowest churn rates in the industry and a strong lineup of shows set for 2024 the company is well-positioned to maintain its dominance in streaming Analysts are largely optimistic about Netflix stock with a consensus rating of “Moderate Buy” and a Street-high target price of $700 This denotes an upside potential of about 196% from current levels Out of 40 analysts covering the stock 22 have a “Strong Buy” rating 1 has a “Moderate Buy” rating 15 have a “Hold” rating and 2 have a “Strong Sell” rating We round out our list with Eli Lilly and Company (LLY) whose market value has soared as its anti-obesity drugs explode in popularity Eli Lilly was founded in 1876 and is a pharmaceutical company focused on the research development manufacturing and commercialization of human and animal health products With its products selling in 125 countries worldwide the companys market cap currently stands at a mammoth $708 billion Eli Lilly stock is up by an impressive 32% on a YTD basis The stock also offers a dividend yield of 07% and these shareholder payouts have grown consistently for the past nine years Eli Lilly recently reported its results for the fourth quarter and delivered solid growth in both revenue and earnings Revenues rose by 28% from the prior year to $93 billion while EPS grew by 19% to $249 Both figures surpassed Wall Streets consensus estimates The drug giant also remains confident that revenues will continue to grow in 2024 Beyond its blockbuster weight-loss and diabetes drugs LLY recently landed approval for Ebglyss (approved in November by the European Commission for the treatment of atopic dermatitis) Jaypirca (approved in December by the FDA for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia) and Omvoh (approved by the FDA in October for the treatment of ulcerative colitis) Overall the company expects to generate revenues of $404 billion to $416 billion for fiscal year 2024 compared to $3412 billion in 2023 Analysts have an average rating of “Strong Buy” for LLY stock which has a Street-high target price of $950 This indicates an upside potential of about 23% from current levels Out of 21 analysts covering the stock 18 have a “Strong Buy” rating 1 has a “Moderate Buy” rating and 2 have a “Hold” rating Provided Content: Content provided by Barchart The Globe and Mail was not involved and material was not reviewed prior to publication How much is Microsoft Corp stock worth?

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella Image source: Microsoft In the second quarter Microsoft generated 42% of its revenue from its Intelligent Cloud division which handles its Azure cloud infrastructure platform along with its other cloud and server products It generated 31% of its revenue from the Productivity and Business Processes division which houses Office Dynamics and LinkedIn The remaining 27% came from the More Personal Computing division which manages its Windows Xbox Surface Bing and digital advertising businesses As the following table illustrates Microsofts year-over-year revenue growth accelerated for four consecutive quarters That acceleration was driven by the robust growth of its cloud and productivity divisions and the stabilization of its personal computing division

drove most of its growth as Azure gained more customers That growth was amplified by its investments in OpenAI which enabled it to weave the start-ups AI tools into its cloud-based services Within that business its Azure and other cloud services revenue rose 30% year over year in the second quarter compared to its 29% growth in the first quarter and 26% growth in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 Those two consecutive quarters of accelerating growth set it apart from other cloud software companies which suffered slowdowns over the past year Azure is also growing faster than its closest rivals In their latest quarters Azures larger competitor Amazon Web Services (AWS) grew its revenue 13% year over year while Alphabets Google Cloud -- which ranks a distant third in the cloud race after AWS and Azure -- grew its revenue 26% year over year Azures superior growth suggests its early-movers advantage in the generative AI market is paying off During the conference call CFO Amy Hood said Azures growth would remain stable in constant currency terms relative to the second quarter with a strong contribution from AI Therefore Azure probably wont lose its mojo anytime soon Microsofts productivity and business processes division suffered a slowdown in fiscal 2023 as more companies reined in their software spending But it returned to double-digit growth over the past year as Office

fiscal 2023 as sales of new PCs and gaming consoles cooled off in a post-pandemic market However that segment returned to growth over the past two quarters as those two markets stabilized -- and it should expand significantly as the Xbox division gobbles up Activision Blizzard Microsoft continues to ramp up its spending -- especially across its cloud AI and gaming ecosystems -- but its operating margin still expanded 490 basis points year over year to 436% in the second quarter For the full year analysts expect its operating margin to expand from 423% in fiscal 2023 to 437% in fiscal 2024 From fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2026 analysts expect Microsofts revenue to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15% as its EPS rises at a CAGR of 17% We should take those estimates with a grain

EPS at a similar rate over the next three years trades at just 21 times forward earnings That higher valuation could limit Microsofts upside potential and set it up for a steep drop if Azures growth abruptly slows down That said I believe Microsofts stock is still worth buying today Its firing on all cylinders expanding its business and seemingly growing faster than Amazon Google and other tech giants in the cloud and AI markets Its stock could go through some wild near-term swings but it should head much higher over the next few years John Mackey former CEO of Whole Foods Market an Amazon

Trade” The US govt just unlocked an $8 trillion market to move in a new direction See how it could unleash 6000% potential upside Two of the Magnificent Seven make the cut Advertisement Source: Shutterstock Last year was an amazing year for tech stocks Coming off a disappointing 2022 tech rallied to make up much of its losses and set the stage for further gains in 2022 The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite was up 43% in 2023 and many of the top tech-themed exchange-traded funds did even better If you were holding tech stocks you likely had a very good 2022 And tech is off to a solid start this year with the Nasdaq up 5% to keep pace with top tech ETFs Investors are still bullish on tech and advances in artificial intelligence machine learning and the Internet of Things Tech stocks have greater-than-average growth potential because of their disruptive tendencies Tech companies are looking to break new ground create new products or devise new ways to accomplish tasks Many tech stocks can also be considered growth stocks because they’re aggressively looking to scale up and show gains in growth and earnings While there are some amazing tech stocks to buy out there we’re using the Portfolio Grader today to identify the best of the best and figure out which ones have the best chance of catching fire in 2024 Some of the names on this list are well-known and others fly under the radar But all of them show massive potential as we roll into 2024 Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of those well-known names we talked about In fact it’s the biggest publicly traded company in the world with a market capitalization of more than $3 trillion About $1 billion of that came in 2023 when advances in generative AI helped push Microsoft stock up 56% Microsoft invested $13 million into OpenAI the maker of ChatGPT and infused the technology into its universe of products Microsoft reported earnings for its fiscal second quarter of 2024 on Jan 30 And while the results included revenue growth of 18% to $62 billion and earnings per share were up 33% to $293 MSFT stock has been a little stagnant ever since But I’m still a Microsoft bull I agree with analysts like BNP Paribas’ Stefan Slowinski who says that major free cash flow improvements related to Microsoft’s gen AI commercialization could begin in the next fiscal year MSFT stock will have a strong 2024 although I can’t promise another 50% gain It still gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader Synopsys (NASDAQ:SNPS) is a tech company that provides tools and serves companies that design and manufacture semiconductors Semiconductors continue to grow in importance because they power many electronic devices from solar systems to electronics computers and electric vehicles Advances in AI are made

AI It also collaborates with Microsoft and other major tech companies Synopsys meanwhile is making moves to be an even bigger player In January it announced plans to buy Ansys (NASDAQ:ANSS) in a $35

gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader At one point Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) was best known as a social media company And while it still has Facebook and Instagram as its dominant holdings Meta is evolving into something more: an advertising company a content company and a top tech company Meta is using AI to help it monetize its Facebook and Instagram platforms Advertising is hugely important for Facebook and Instagram as Meta works to keep audiences engaged and show users content and ads that are the most relevant The fourth quarter of 2023 was a good one Meta reported revenue of $401 billion up 25% from a year ago And net income of $14 billion was a huge increase from $46 billion in the same period last year Meta also saw an 8% increase in daily active users to 319 billion

498,"Investors in Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) have seen strong returns of 288% over the past five years","1/1/2024","https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-microsoft-nasdaq-msft-seen-120027116.html","The most you can lose on any stock (assuming you dont use leverage) is 100% of your money But on the bright side if you buy shares in a high quality company at the right price you can gain well over 100% For instance the price of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock is up an impressive 268% over the last five years On top of that the share price is up 20% in about a quarter But this move may well have been assisted by the reasonably buoyant market (up 12% in 90 days) So lets assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 5 years and see if theyve moved in lock-step with shareholder returns View our latest analysis for Microsoft In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement During five years of share price growth Microsoft achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 33% per year So the EPS growth rate is rather close to the annualized share price gain of 30% per year This indicates that investor sentiment towards the company has not changed a great deal Rather the share price has approximately tracked EPS growth You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values) We know that Microsoft has improved its bottom line lately but is it going to grow revenue? Check if analysts think Microsoft will grow revenue in the future It is important to consider the total shareholder return as well as the share price return for any given stock The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings along with any dividends based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested So for companies that pay a generous dividend the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return As it happens Microsofts TSR for the last 5 years was 288% which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return Its nice to see that Microsoft shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 58% over the last year And that does include the dividend That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years which is 31% Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately Given the share price momentum remains strong it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock lest you miss an opportunity I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance But to truly gain insight we need to consider other information too To that end you should be aware of the 1 warning sign weve spotted with Microsoft If you like to buy stocks alongside management then you might just love this free list of companies (Hint: insiders have been buying them) Please note the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges Have feedback on this article?

510,"MSFT Stocks Path in a Fluctuating Market","1/30/2024","https://www.valuethemarkets.com/analysis/microsoft-revenue-soars-ai-products-take-lead","By Patricia Miller Unpack Microsofts growth AI initiatives and strategic investments providing a comprehensive guide for MSFT stock investors Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: MSFT) showcased remarkable revenue growth marking its most robust performance since 2022 fueled by burgeoning interest in its new artificial intelligence (AI) products and consequent cloud computing investments The company reported an 18% increase in second-quarter revenue reaching $62 billion with profits hitting $293 per share outpacing the projections of industry analysts The Azure cloud-services division saw a 30% sales increase slightly exceeding market expectations and previous quarter performances Microsoft anticipates this growth momentum in Azure to persist in the upcoming quarter Investors have shown growing enthusiasm for Microsofts AI initiatives particularly its collaboration with OpenAI propelling its market value beyond $3 trillion and surpassing Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) as the worlds most valuable company Despite these advancements particularly in integrating AI into key products like Azure Office and Windows some investors expected more leading to a transient dip in share value Microsofts Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood emphasized AIs significant role in driving Azures growth and expressed confidence in Microsofts capability to meet the growing demand for AI-based services Microsofts commercial cloud products witnessed a 24% revenue surge while the Office cloud service for business users surpassed 400 million paid customers The company also made strides in its More Personal Computing unit and saw exceptional growth in its Xbox content and services revenue primarily due to the acquisition of Activision Blizzard Inc Notably Microsofts strategic $13 billion investment in OpenAI places it at the forefront of AI-driven application development despite brief management upheavals within OpenAI The tech giant remains optimistic about AIs potential to significantly enhance its bottom line although the exact financial impact and timeline remain topics of keen investor interest Nevertheless Microsoft investors are being presented with mixed signals Microsoft stock faced investor skepticism particularly after warnings from Microsoft and Google about impending significant expenses linked to competitive advancements in AI technology The apprehension was mirrored in Alphabets performance with its shares falling due to advertising revenues not meeting expectations Moreover both tech giants forecasted increased capital expenditures for 2024 reflecting substantial investments in AI and cloud infrastructure This financial outlook coupled with a cautious projection of Azures growth rate and an anticipated increase in capital spending for cloud and AI infrastructure suggests that investors considering investing in Microsoft should closely monitor the balance between the companys AI-driven expansions and its financial performance MSFT Stock Stability: The robust growth in Microsofts revenue especially the significant 18% increase in the last quarter showcases the companys strong financial health For retail investors this stability in MSFT stock is crucial as it indicates a resilient business model capable of thriving even in challenging market conditions offering a potentially safer investment option Leadership in AI Innovation: Microsofts deep involvement in AI particularly through its strategic partnership with OpenAI positions the company at the forefront of AI innovation Investing in Microsoft means investing in a company thats not just adapting to but shaping the future of technology This forward-thinking approach in AI investing could translate into long-term growth potential for retail investors Diverse Revenue Streams: Microsofts diversified portfolio including its Azure cloud-services and Office cloud service which recently topped 400 million paid users offers multiple revenue streams This diversity makes Microsoft stock less vulnerable to sector-specific downturns providing a balanced investment opportunity for retail investors seeking to mitigate risk Expanding Market Reach: The introduction of innovative products like Microsoft 365 Copilot targeting a broad spectrum of customers demonstrates Microsofts commitment to expanding its market reach For individuals investing in Microsoft stock this indicates a potential for increased market share and revenue growth driven by the companys continuous efforts to meet diverse consumer needs AI-Driven Growth Potential: Microsofts AI-driven growth exemplified by Azures performance and the companys aggressive AI investments indicates a future-oriented strategy AI investing particularly in a company like Microsoft which is already showing tangible outcomes from its AI initiatives offers retail investors an opportunity to be part of a transformative trend with growth prospects Here are some of the investing ideas that can be explored using this information: Given Microsofts consistent revenue growth and robust financial performance MSFT stock can be a compelling option for investors seeking value The companys diversified portfolio including its strong position in cloud computing and AI underpins its intrinsic value By analyzing Microsoft investor relations reports and financial statements value investors can gauge the companys true worth potentially uncovering a valuable investment opportunity when the market price does not fully reflect the companys fundamental strength Given MSFT has a P/E of 395 it is unlikely to be considered a value stock at this time Value investing searches for undervalued companies that trade for less than their intrinsic values with the expectation that they will eventually be recognized by the market Microsofts pioneering role in AI alongside its strategic partnership with OpenAI positions it as a leading player in a rapidly evolving industry Investing in Microsoft offers growth-oriented investors a stake in a company thats not just keeping pace with technological advancements but is at the helm of innovation The continuous expansion of services like Azure and the integration of AI into various products signal sustained long-term growth potential Growth investing focuses on stocks of companies expected to grow at an above-average rate compared to other stocks in the market; learn more in our article

of Contents Satya Nadella climbe­d up to be Microsoft Corporation’s CEO and leader in 2014 Known for trigge­ring Microsoft’s success his innovative thinking skyrockete­d Microsoft’s share’s worth by over 900% A reflection that indeed the firm is thriving under his stewardship Satya Nadella is worth more than $1 billion This is as a result of this unprecedented growth in Microsoft’s valuation as of 2024 The major part of Nadella’s wealth comes from his time with Microsoft which includes salaries stock options equity grants and dividends Yet even beyond his salary remuneration and holdings in the stocks of Microsoft he puts money into other investments This significantly increased his net worth Now we move into examining what made him become a billionaire in life Analysis shows that the sources that have contributed most to his wealth are pretty understandable in spite of his being a very reserved and private individual It is impossible to capture every aspect of his financial world however some available details give an indication on his major assets and earnings Satya Narayana Nadella born on August 19 1967 in Hyderabad India into a Hindu family had an upbringing shaped by his father Bukkapuram Nadella Yugandhar who was a renowned Indian Administrative Service officer and mother Prabhavati Nadella – a Sanskrit lecturer Set for the academia years Nadella went to Hyderabad Public School located at Begumpet In his high school graduation he decided to do a bachelor of technology degree in electrical engineering at Manipal Institute of Technology Karnataka from where he graduated in 1988 By then he had made up his mind to leave and go abroad for further studies thereby moving to America where back in 1990 Satya achieved his Master of Science Degree in Computer Science from University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee Continuing with his education endeavors Nadella later joined University of Chicago where he received his MBA from the Chicago Booth School of Business back in1997 during which period he became an American citizen This varied educational background laid the foundation for one of the world’s most powerful technology firms’ eventual top executive How the career of Satya Nadella evolved from an engineer to what he has become is a reflection of his exceptional abilities and strategic vision He began his professional career shortly after completing his studies rapidly showing that he had mastered computer engineering at Sun Microsystems This section outlines how Nadella’s journey unfolded leading him to be the head of Microsoft and later gaining wealth After completing his education Satya Nadella started at Sun Microsystems He was a software engineer there in 1990 He worked there until 1992 His time at Sun Microsystems gave him basic skills These skills set the stage for his future success Therefore switching from Sun Microsystems to Microsoft was a turning point in Nadella’s career In 1992 after leaving Sun Microsystems Nadella jumped at an opportunity to join Microsoft where he joined Windows NT software team His job primarily involved creating business operating system for the firm therefore sowing seeds of success within the same company at large Nadella’s rise in Microsoft has been through a series of promotions that show how much influence he is gaining in the company Having been initially appointed as the vice president for small business service he progressed rapidly to become corporate vice president for Microsoft Business Solutions But Nadella’s progress was far from over In 2009 he became senior VP of Online Services Division which ended in 2011 This led to his promotion as executive VP of Cloud and Enterprise Group This saw such division which contained key projects like Xbox Live and Bing grow its revenues from just $166 billion to $203 billion within two years only In this period Microsoft under Nadella increasingly focused more on cloud computing 2014 represented a significant step forward for Nadella when he took over as CEO of Microsoft after Steve Ballmer resigned following fluctuating share prices between 2000 and 2014 His CEO title won him high praise­ at Microsoft The market value booste­d by a whopping 969% during his time The post-2008 era unde­r Nadella gave Microsoft a market worth close­ to $3 trillion This falls short of what he has achieved since it first reached its highest price per share at $315 under his watch before becoming CEO proving how his leadership impacted on Microsoft’s value and growth Microsoft is one of the most influential companies that was led by Satya Nadella the CEO who served for almost ten years One of his major achievements was saving OpenAI from a potentially disastrous management crisis He made this move to not only keep OpenAI afloat but also to ensure that Microsoft was able to have some level of control over open AI through gaining a stake which had no voting rights on OpenAI’s board From the beginning of his tenure Nadella pursued numerous strategic acquisitions starting with Mojang creator of Minecraft (Swedish) in 2014 while later buying LinkedIn for $262 billion two years later and acquiring GitHub site for $75 billion in 2018 Additionally there were plans by Microsoft to invest about ten billion dollars into OpenAI Company that is known for creating ChatGPT an Artificial Intelligence tool which develops challenging conversations with human-like responses During the time when Nadella has been leading Microsoft has experienced outstanding growth in its finances Third quarter of 2023 alone saw the firm achieve a massive $ 529 billion in revenue an indication of how much Satya Nadella’s leadership took office after Steve Ballmer As for Satya Nadella’s financial compensation his payments from Microsoft except for the first few years of his elevation within the organization have come close to one billion dollars This figure combines salaries dividends bonuses and equity grants as they represent his considerable financial interests in the company The number of shares that he owns with respect to Microsoft stocks presently stands at 38234 units worth This is more than $300 million For instance within a span of 12 years he sold out Microsoft stock This action earned him around $586 millions showing how he actively manages his financial interest in this company Since 2011 Mr Nadella was involved in no less than eighteen deals on sales of Microsoft stocks One of these most remarkable deals happened in November 2021 when he sold approximately eight hundred thirty eight

It seems Microsoft (MSFT -123%) might have the respond to Nevertheless the tech titan recently turned the world’s largest company by current market cap it seems to have loads of place to expand thanks to AI Which is simply because Microsoft through investing about $10 billion in OpenAI has speedily expanded its AI product or service portfolio It begun in February 2023 with Bing AI run by OpenAI’s GPT-4 substantial language product This method aimed to offer consumers with a tailor made search motor practical experience As a result of integrating AI into its look for engine Microsoft enhanced performance though tests customer choices Bing AI was then tailored to present research final result summaries and offer users a much more succinct but enlightening practical experience A minimal around a thirty day period afterwards Microsoft started presenting Copilot AI as part of its Workplace 365 program suite Nevertheless this advertising angle appeared complicated for the reason that Microsoft also provides Azure OpenAI as a business-focused process This implies through substantially of 2023 Microsoft provided 3 different AI platforms with overlapping user bases all of which are solely driven by OpenAI’s GPT-4 language product variants Now you could be inquiring what is the issue with a range of items? More choices generally suggests additional revenue but the situation isn’t really the wide variety it can be the lack of a unified AI presence to bring in casual users and expand the technological innovation beyond small business purposes For illustration OpenAI’s ChatGPT at the moment captures 60% of casual AI use As ChatGPT proceeds to get recognition shoppers will have a tendency to have confidence in it extra than other AI products because of to term of mouth This is related to how Alphabet‘s Google revolutionized exploring and browsing in the 2000s Google first released its look for engine in 1998 and it took Microsoft eight a long time to react with its lookup motor LiveSearch This motor eventually became Bing but by 2008 when Microsoft rebranded it was already too late and Google dominated the market place The same year Google released the Chrome browser which grew exponentially in market place share and decimated Microsoft’s Internet Explorer consumer foundation These moves led to remarkable share-selling price advancement since Alphabet’s IPO in 2004 The fantastic information for Microsoft is that it is entitled to share of OpenAI financial gain distributions So at the very least in the quick time period the tech huge loses nothing at all if OpenAI wins significant and its products and solutions don’t (In addition Microsoft is undertaking lots of co-branded perform with OpenAI including giving OpenAI applications on Azure) Several latest technologies may well be changed by AI in the coming yrs dramatically reshaping how we use program Google’s look for engine may possibly even turn into out of date if people favor making use of AI to respond to their queries As such Microsoft has an option to defeat its previous of dropping buyers to its competition but only if it features the greatest and most successful AI expertise To achieve this approach Microsoft has previously started to unify its AI types under one particular brand with Bing AI turning out to be part of Copilot By transitioning towards advertising and marketing its AI services less than just one design the organization may possibly be capable to command more consideration for its solutions Microsoft also has an ace up its sleeve for creating Copilot a domestic name Many thanks to Microsoft’s iron grip on the day-to-working day software package almost all doing the job professionals have on their desktops its AI previously has a gargantuan user foundation irrespective of whether the buyers know it or not Around 12 billion people today make use of Office environment 365 for everyday duties This places Microsoft’s freshly branded Copilot AI in front of their eyes every single working day By obtaining this exclusive small business marriage with the system people may well develop into more accustomed to working with Copilot outdoors of the business office An edge of this scale also enables Microsoft to tap into these consumer databases to prepare its AI products resulting in much more fast iteration and introduction of new attributes Amongst Microsoft’s user databases and OpenAI’s language types the partnership can get started to supply much more than just a subscription-based mostly service to use a generic AI platform Rather Microsoft will be equipped to acquire products personalized to the demands of individual enterprise shoppers For the ordinary shopper Microsoft could likely implement the very same technique and make own assistants truly fit the individual making use of them These a product could go on to sap earnings from Google’s research motor due to the fact folks may possibly like employing their tailor made AI alternatively than go hunting for an remedy from Google For reference Google created $175 billion in 2023 from search profits Microsoft isn’t going to have to earn a ton of share there to make a big impact on its $228 billion major line If Microsoft performs its AI cards suitable and constantly specializes the attributes its AI merchandise present its income could skyrocket propelled forward by a unified encounter The times of “Googling” one thing may possibly be coming to an stop as the days of “Copiloting” arrive This benefits Microsoft and its buyers simply because it seems the new king of tech has nowhere to go but up Viktor Zarev has no place in any stocks talked about Suzanne Frey an

of resistance it is referred to as a Short Resistance Plan If 40933 begins to break higher the technical summary data tells us to buy MSFT just slightly over 40933 with an upside target of 41003 The data also tells us to set a stop loss @ 40838 in case the stock turns against the trade 40933 is the first level of resistance above 40748 and by rule any break above resistance is a buy signal In this case 40933 initial resistance would be breaking higher so a buy signal would exist Because this plan is based on a break of resistance it is referred to as a Long Resistance Plan The technical summary data is suggesting a short of MSFT if it tests 40933 with a downside target of 39836 We should have a stop loss in place at 41028 though in case the stock begins to move against the trade By

At least with the desktop market anyway Microsoft’s Edge browser is carving out more market share on desktop PCs and has hit a new record high for adoption at least going by one set of web browser stats These are the global statistics provided by Statcounter for last month January 2024 in which Chrome still leads by a long way (no surprise) sitting on a 6484% market share – but Edge is in second now on 1296% for desktop browsers As noted that’s the best ever performance for Microsoft’s Chromium-based browser which is almost at 13% Edge has been at just over the 11% mark before but drifted down to as low as 106% during the course of last year so Microsoft will be heartened to see it recovering no doubt Edge is quite some way ahead of its nearest rivals Safari (883%) and Firefox (757%) and in fact it’s not too far off having double the user base of Mozilla’s browser It’s also worth mentioning that elsewhere in the world of OS market share Statcounter has observed Windows 11 gaining 129% to be on a 2783% share That’s notable because we have seen some wobbles for Windows 11 adoption in the recent past so the OS is rising up the ranks again – just very very slowly compared to how Windows 10 progressed Microsoft Edge is slowly becoming more popular then by the looks of things (at least on desktop – mobile adoption is still not happening at all but that’s a very different kettle of browsing fish) So the question is: why is Edge gaining momentum in this respect? In fairness Microsoft has been making some notable progress with Edge in recent times The desktop browser is nicely performant (and continues to push forward on this front) and has witnessed some impressive feature additions such as bolstering search with a novel trick Not to mention a myriad of minor but useful steps forward (like integrated video translation chops) Get the hottest deals available in your inbox plus news reviews opinion analysis and more from the TechRadar team Plus Copilot is becoming a more and more recognizable AI brand now it’s in Windows and is part and parcel of Edge’s constant improvements so may be attracting users too Just as importantly Microsoft has been on a broad streamlining drive with its software notably Windows 11 (cutting away some default apps for example) and Edge too So the browser is getting useful new features while having some of the chaff cut away The result is a tighter app all-round and perhaps more people are now noticing that We always feel that Edge popularity is a bit of a tug of war though in some ways Pulling on one side of the rope is the progress with feature advancements and fine-tuning but on the other side yanking back there’s the more negative aspect of Microsoft’s constant prodding to try and get people to use Edge (or find out why they’re not using it) At the moment the positive aspects around Edge are winning but we can’t help but feel the tide of the battle against Chrome could turn Microsoft’s way even more if it laid off the nagging Via Neowin Darren is a freelancer writing news and features for TechRadar (and occasionally T3) across a broad range of computing topics including CPUs GPUs various other hardware VPNs antivirus and more He has written about tech for the best part of three decades and writes books in his spare time (his debut novel - I Know What You Did Last Supper - was published by Hachette UK in 2013) Fed up with Edge being pushed in Windows 11? Next update brings some good news but Microsoft still needs to do better Microsoft just updated Edge – and completely broke the browser according to some reports Quordle today – hints and answers for Monday March 25 (game #791) By Marc McLarenMarch 24 2024 By Alex WhitelockMarch 23 2024 By Wayne WilliamsMarch 23 2024 By David NieldMarch 23 2024 By Wayne WilliamsMarch 23 2024 By Mackenzie FrazierMarch 23 2024 By Wayne WilliamsMarch 23 2024 By David NieldMarch 23 2024 By Darren AllanMarch 23 2024 By Hamish HectorMarch 23 2024 By Wayne WilliamsMarch 23 2024 TechRadar is part of Future US Inc an international media group and leading digital publisher Visit our corporate site © Future US Inc Full 7th Floor 130 West 42nd Street New York NY 10036"

anything related to artificial intelligence (AI) Since then Microsoft (MSFT -015%) and Alphabet (GOOG 204%) (GOOGL 215%) have emerged as two AI leaders defining the category and its applications Microsoft is a close partner of OpenAI and Alphabet quickly revealed its answer to ChatGPT -- Bard -- shortly after ChatGPT was released Nearly a year after Microsoft unveiled its AI-infused Bing Chat and Alphabet launched Bard the two companies reported earnings for the October-to-December quarter Investors sold off both stocks on the news they reported suggesting that the AI stock boom may be overdone And yet both companies delivered solid numbers Lets dig into each companys recently released report and see which one is the better AI stock to buy today Image source: Getty Images Microsoft recently took the title of the worlds most valuable company from Apple and the companys earnings show why To be fair the enterprise software company closed on its acquisition of Activision Blizzard in October so its results are getting a modest bump from the quarter a year ago Microsofts fiscal 2024 second-quarter revenue rose 18% year over year to $62 billion which topped analyst estimates at $6114 billion Its operating income jumped 33% year over year or 25% on a non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) basis On the bottom line earnings per share (EPS) also rose 33% year over year or 26% on a non-GAAP basis to $293 That too came in ahead of estimates Microsofts cloud was once again a bright spot for the company as its intelligent cloud segment grew 20% year over year with Azure revenue up 30% Search and news advertising revenue growth was modest at 8% year over year indicating that Bing Chat hasnt taken off the way the company hoped Microsoft finished the after-hours session down 03% Alphabet delivered a solid fiscal 2023 fourth-quarter report overall as the company continues to recover from the slowdown in the digital ad market Revenue rose 13% year over year to $863 billion ahead of the consensus at $853 billion but ad revenue of $655 billion was slightly below expectations which helped drive the stock price down 6% in after-hours trading The weaker-than-expected ad-revenue growth seemed to indicate that Alphabet was losing ad-market share to competitors or that AI has yet to have a significant impact on ad spending On the bottom line EPS surged from $105 to $164 due to a $2 billion improvement in equity securities Operating income rose 30% to $237 billion Ad revenue rose 11% to $655 billion in part due to continued weakness in Google Network where revenue declined again Google Cloud its other closely watched business segment posted 26% growth to $92 billion and it reported operating income of $864 million up from a loss of $186 million in the quarter a year ago Both Microsoft and Alphabet saw strong stock-price appreciation last year and each company reported similar growth on the top and bottom lines in the recent quarter The difference between the two companies comes down to their AI strategies and Microsoft appears to have the edge here The company introduced its AI-powered Copilot into a wide range of products including the Office 365 suite Github Azure and Bing Microsoft management also said that AI drove six percentage points of revenue growth in Azure pushing it from 24% growth to 30% which is significant and likely to improve Finally compared to Alphabet Microsoft seems to have been better prepared for the AI revolution as it made acquisitions like Github that fit well with its AI Copilot tools and its investment in OpenAI has been a game-changer Alphabet on the other hand acquired the AI research lab DeepMind several years ago but didnt integrate with Google Brain until last year The Google parent has had the technology to roll out its own chatbot but it let OpenAI and ChatGPT set the narrative with AI chat Alphabet is no slouch in AI but the Google parent lacks the strategy and applications to fully leverage the power of generative AI in the way that Microsoft has Microsoft on the other hand has planned for this moment and has taken smart risks including allying with OpenAI It also has a much more diversified product range compared to Alphabet which makes most of its money from ads a business that so far has not seemed to benefit significantly from AI Microsoft stock is more expensive than Alphabet but its the better AI stock to buy here Its long-term prospects with the new technology still look considerably more promising Suzanne Frey an executive at Alphabet is a

While Apple’s been fiddling with blood oxygen measurements in wristwatches MSFT’s just about burned Rome by established itself as a firestarter in a handful of fast growth fields and in industries like cloud computing video games and OFC… artificial intelligence (AI) Now the House of Bill has eclipsed all comers renewed by its deep focus on generative artificial intelligence (AI) a sector that has garnered increasing investor favour Wall Street is bullish on Microsoft in the same way it’s gone off Apple According to a FactSet poll of Wall St analysts nine out of every 10 currently have either a Buy or Overweight rating on the stock The average price target implies a gain of 62% over the next year adding to its advance of circa 60% in 2023 Wells Fargo has made the most recent tweak to Microsoft’s price target lifting it to US$435 per share from US$425 The bank predicts a further uplift the company’s enormous valuation with artificial intelligence playing a key role “We see key AI-related product cycles taking shape as further upside” the bank noted on Monday That was when MSFT’s valuation clocked in at US$2887 trillion its most ever while – after peaking at US$3081tn on December 15 – Apple’s was worth a relatively humiliating US$2875t Apple is living on borrowed tech while Microsoft has learned fastest when it comes to using what Nvidia built; the shiny thing in tech AI XM Australia CEO Peter McGuire told Stockhead that Microsoft had a seat at the front of the AI revolution seeing the changes in real-time via its controlling stake in OpenAI the company behind the ChatGPT model Investors increasingly believe that even if the global economy loses steam demand for AI products will still remain elevated shielding corporate profits from any macroeconomic weakness Microsoft has incorporated OpenAI’s technology across its suite of productivity software a move that helped spark a rebound in its cloud-computing business in the July-September quarter AI is now front and centre of MSFT’s own business It’s transformed its Azure division into the go-to cloud service for AI-curious companies And it’s added another one trillion US dollars to its own market cap in the same time Already this week the software giant launched an AI comms tool and rejigged it as a pro-version consumer-first product and added it to the company’s monthly-rent-a-subscribe-software-forever model which has proven such a terrific way to bleed end users The timing is consummate from a business which knows as much about making money as it does about making computers Microsoft (MSFT) unwrapped the new Pro version of its Artificial IntelligenceAI chatbot Microsoft Copilot Subscriptions to Microsoft Copilot Pro are reportedly set to start at US$20 per month Every month The Gates machine has gone all out on AI – more so even than Nvidia and Amazon – and has since reaped a thrilling stock price harvest over the past year showing just how fast the AI season can shift Shares in MSFT have locked in a well over 60% climb in the last year more than tripling the 20% rise in the S&P 500 as AI afficianados recognised its early moves in generative exemplified by the early $10bn one-third move to get a piece in OpenAI’s ChatGPT secured in late 2022 Today Microsoft’s stake in OpenAI sits at 49% – valued at $86 billion – after a pumping $3 billion into the headline generating firm In that time Microsoft went straight into monetising AI and that’s been under the Copilot brand which leverages AI to go make its productivity software suite more sweet and productive Previously Copilot was selling at US$30 per month That can shift as MSFT backs it’s capabilities Even so Wall Street analysts have reckoned that at $30 a pop per month… Copilot could boost Microsoft’s fiscal 2025 revenue by as much as US$9bn Analysts are drawing parallels with the dotcom boom of the 2000’s when internet companies began to replace consumer and financial firms as the drivers of market movements On top of its stake into OpenAI MSFT has pumped R&D using its treasure vaults of cash wooing industry partners and broadened its reach through strategic acquisitions like LinkedIn and GitHub The mission to swallow up and maximise reams of inhouse data and unleash inhouse AI expertise has paid off In the 12 months since Nvidia burst into the US$1trn cap club and joined the most magnificent 7 tech firms Microsoft has successfully rolled out AI solutions willy-nilly Microsoft’s clients are mostly other businesses that are investing in their AI capabilities not regular consumers that are struggling under the cost of living crisis This sense of resilience has helped fuel the stonking rally in Microsoft shares which reached a new record high during a week of growing uncertainty and doubt around the pace and direction of interest rates worldwide Pete McGuire says hype surrounding artificial intelligence has started to translate into a massive earnings boost for Microsoft “That said the market reaction will depend on whether the actual results are stronger or weaker than markets anticipate as well as any guidance by management about the future outlook” For Q4 2023 The Street expects Microsoft to report earnings per share of US$278 which’d be a jump of circa 20% from the same quarter in the previous year Similarly revenue is projected to have risen by nearly 16% from last year “I think it’s worth highlighting that Microsoft has the kind of strong history of beating earnings estimates which brings to mind the word consistency having done so in all four of the preceding quarters” McGuire says “Hence another upside surprise seems like the most likely outcome which could generate even greater demand for Microsoft shares” On the charts McGuire says the most important spot to watch on the upside might be the 40000 psychological region “Looking at the chart (above) Microsoft shares are already trading at record highs so on the flipside in case of a disappointment in earnings that catches optimistic investors off guard the previous high of 39000 could come into play to halt any selloff “If sellers manage to pierce below it the focus would then shift towards the 37700 zone” McGuire says that the major red flag about Microsoft shares is how expensive they’ve become from a valuation perspective “The stock price is currently trading at over 32 times what analysts expect earnings to be this year which even for Microsoft is a stretched valuation” Pete says that excluding the pandemic years the last time Microsoft traded at a similar valuation was back in 2002 as the ‘dot com’ bubble was bursting “So the market has already priced in much of the future growth prospects which limits the upside potential for the stock as the bar has already been set quite high “All told the future for Microsoft as a company seems bright as the AI revolution might still be in its early stages That said the stock’s hefty valuation already reflects this optimism so the scope for further near-term gains appears somewhat limited” Link copied to clipboard Get the latest Stockhead news delivered free to your inbox Its free

cybersecurity defenses have never been higher and they could get even higher from here as the technology landscape changes while what’s at stake (more than just customer data) increases While generative AI blockchain and the Metaverse may be the buzzier themes to invest in tech I’d argue that it’s a mistake to count cybersecurity out I believe cybersecurity plays stand out as one of the most defensive ways to get next-level growth Cyber defenses are an absolute must even amid a budget-tightening cycle as the rate breadth and severity of breaches climb Therefore let’s use TipRanks’ Comparison Tool to weigh in on three cybersecurity plays that Wall Street remains upbeat on for 2024 Microsoft isn’t just a major player in the generative AI race; it’s very much a cybersecurity play with its Microsoft Security Copilot Indeed many Windows OS users may have chosen to forgo purchasing third-party security software in favor of Microsoft’s own security essentials For the most part Microsoft’s footing in cybersecurity has been impressive However after Microsoft’s own security was breached by Russian hackers questions linger as to whether the enterprise behemoth can stay a credible player in the cybersecurity scene Despite the hack I remain bullish on Microsoft’s ability to navigate this latest crisis As you’d imagine it can be quite embarrassing for a provider of cybersecurity solutions to be compromised by hackers The company is bound to go on the defensive but one thing is clear: the recent breaches are not a good look through the eyes of investors and customers The real risk is that the breaches could drive Microsoft’s cybersecurity customers to pursue alternative cybersecurity solutions In any case I expect Microsoft will bounce back from its recent cybersecurity fumble At the end of the day Russian hacker groups are incredibly sophisticated perhaps so much so that Microsoft may just be the first of many behemoths to take a hit Either way the breach shines a very bright light on the importance of having not just acceptable cybersecurity solutions in place but the very best on the market The cybersecurity breach hasn’t had too big of an impact on MSFT stock which is just a hair shy of all-time highs Nonetheless moving forward I expect more gains to be coming courtesy of AI rather than cybersecurity Microsoft stock is a Strong Buy according to analysts with 36 Buys and one Hold assigned in the past three months The average MSFT stock price target of $43421 implies 98% upside potential CrowdStrike stands out as one of the gold standards when it comes to cybersecurity software especially in the modern era Over the past year shares have skyrocketed by more than 180% With a recent parabolic pop propelling shares to new all-time highs I’d not be willing to bet against the firm as it looks to gain a share in the bustling cybersecurity market After the Microsoft hack I’d argue that CrowdStrike stands out as a potential share-gainer given its ecosystem of cybersecurity protection products Though the stock’s gotten noticeably more expensive in recent quarters I can’t help but stay bullish WestPark Capital recently downgraded CRWD stock to Hold from Buy citing the stock’s valuation as its primary concern Though shares slipped following the downgrade it didn’t take long for the stock to resume its impressive rally At this juncture CRWD stock may be tough to stop in its tracks as it looks to win over business from clients who are beginning to gain the full grasp of what’s at stake by skimping on cybersecurity spending At 245 times price-to-sales (P/S) CRWD is starting to get on the expensive side of its historical range again I believe the premium is warranted though given its “leading” product and a cybersecurity landscape that stands to get scarier in the age of AI At this juncture I consider CRWD stock as my favorite cybersecurity pure-play right now CrowdStrike stock is a Strong Buy according to analysts with 37 Buys and two Holds assigned in the past three months Nevertheless the average CRWD stock price target of $29100 implies 16% downside potential Speaking of parabolic moves check out shares of Palo Alto Networks which is also cashing in on increased enthusiasm for cybersecurity stocks in recent months Over the past year the stock is up over 130% With a $109 billion market cap PANW is a heavyweight in the industry and one that could use its size as an advantage to gain market share over rivals As a relatively large company Palo Alto has the funds to pour into improving its end-point cybersecurity offering by leaps and bounds That has me incredibly bullish on PANW stock even after its breathtaking ascent Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) recently pounded the table on Palo Alto naming it as its top pick in the cybersecurity scene For 2024 the bank sees rising demand powering industry gains further with PANW stock sporting a juicy $39500 price target from the firm (implying 15% upside from current levels) I think Morgan Stanley’s right to stick with PANW especially if more headline-making breaches follow the Microsoft one through the year Like CrowdStrike the stock’s valuation has expanded considerably amid the scorching rally with shares now going for 162 times P/S It’s hard to chase stocks that have already gone parabolic but if you lack cybersecurity exposure PANW stock is still worth consideration BellBring stock is a Strong Buy according to analysts with 30 Buys and three Holds assigned in the past three months The average PANW stock price target of $33419 implies 27% downside potential Despite scorching-hot runs to new highs I still believe it makes sense to keep top cybersecurity stocks atop your watchlist in a year where cyber attacks may be bigger news than the latest AI innovations The Microsoft hack was a bombshell piece of news to kick off the year and it may not be the last of the big breaches as we move into year’s end At writing analysts expect the most upside from Microsoft (98%) for the year ahead I’m in agreement; it’s likely the best Buy at this juncture Disclosure Related Quotes"

571,"Attackers Exploit Microsoft Security-Bypass Zero-Day Bugs","2/13/2024","https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities-threats/attackers-exploit-microsoft-security-bypass-zero-day-bugs","The Water Hydra cyberattacker group is one adversary using the zero-days to get past built-in Windows protections February 13 2024 Microsofts scheduled Patch Tuesday security update for February includes fixes for two zero-day security vulnerabilities under active attack plus 71 other flaws across a wide range of its products In all five of the vulnerabilities for which Microsoft issued a February patch were rated as critical 66 as important and two as moderate The update includes patches for Microsoft Office Windows Microsoft Exchange Server the companys Chromium-based Edge browser Azure Active Directory Microsoft Defender for Endpoint and Skype for business Tenable identified 30 of the 73 CVEs as remote code execution (RCE) vulnerabilities; 16 as enabling privilege escalation; 10 as tied to spoofing errors; nine as enabling distributed denial-of-service attacks; five as information disclosure flaws; and three as security bypass issues A threat actor dubbed as Water Hydra (aka Dark Casino) is currently leveraging one of the zero-day vulnerabilities — an Internet Shortcut Files security feature bypass vulnerability tracked as CVE-2024-21412 (CVSS 81) — in a malicious campaign targeting organizations in the financial sector Researchers at Trend Micro — among several who discovered and reported the flaw to Microsoft — described it as tied to a bypass of a previously patched SmartScreen vulnerability (CVE-2023-36025 CVSS 88) and affecting all supported Windows versions Water Hydra actors are using CVE-2024-21412 to gain initial access to systems belonging to financial traders and drop the DarkMe remote access Trojan on them To exploit the vulnerability an attacker would first need to deliver a malicious file to a targeted user and get them to open it said Saeed Abbasi manager of vulnerability researcher at Qualys in emailed commentary The impact of this vulnerability is profound compromising security and undermining trust in protective mechanisms like SmartScreen Abbasi said The other zero-day that Microsoft disclosed in this months security update affects Defender SmartScreen According to Microsoft CVE-2024-21351 is a medium-severity bug that allows an attacker to bypass SmartScreen protections and inject code into it to potentially gain remote code execution capabilities A successful exploit could lead to limited data exposure systems availability issues or both Microsoft said No details are available on who exactly might be exploiting the bug and for what purpose In prepared comments for Dark Reading Mike Walters president and co-founder of Action1 said the vulnerability is tied to the manner in which Microsofts Mark of the Web (a feature for identifying untrusted content from the Internet) interacts with the SmartScreen feature For this vulnerability an attacker must distribute a malicious file to a user and persuade them to open it allowing them to circumvent the SmartScreen checks and potentially compromise the systems security Walters said Among the five critical vulnerabilities in the February update the one that requires priority attention is CVE-2024-21410 a privilege escalation vulnerability in Exchange Server a favorite target for attackers An attacker could use the bug to disclose a targeted users Net-New Technology LAN Manager (NTLM) version 2 hash and then relay that credential against an affected Exchange Server and authenticate to it as the user Flaws like this that disclose sensitive information like NTLM hashes can be very valuable to attackers said Satnam Narang senior staff research engineer at Tenable in a statement A Russian-based threat actor leveraged a similar vulnerability to carry out attacks — CVE-2023-23397 is an Elevation of Privilege vulnerability in Microsoft Outlook patched in March 2023 he said To patch the flaw Exchange admins will need to ensure they have installed Exchange Server 2019 Cumulative Update 14 (CU14) update and ensure the Extended Protection for Authentication (EPA) feature is enabled Trend Micro said The security vendor pointed to an article that Microsoft has published that provides additional information on how to patch the vulnerability Microsoft has assigned CVE-2024-21410 a maximum severity rating of 91 out of 10 which makes it a critical vulnerability But typically privilege escalation vulnerabilities tend to score relatively low on the CVSS vulnerability rating scale which belies the true nature of the threat they present said Kev Breen senior director of threat research at Immersive Labs Despite their low score [privilege escalation] vulnerabilities are highly sought after by threat actors and used in almost every cyber incident Breen said in a statement Once an attacker has access to a user account through social engineering or some other attack they will next seek to escalate their permissions either to local admin or domain admin Walters from Action1 highlighted CVE-2024-21413 an RCE flaw in Microsoft Outlook as a vulnerability that administrators might want to prioritize from Februarys batch The critical severity flaw with a near maximum severity score of 98 involves low attack complexity no user interaction and no special privileges required for an attacker to exploit it An attacker can exploit this vulnerability via the preview pane in Outlook allowing them to circumvent Office Protected View and force files to open in edit mode rather than in the safer protected mode Walters said Microsoft itself identified the vulnerability as something that attackers are less likely to attack Nevertheless Walters said the vulnerability poses a substantial threat for organizations and requires prompt attention Jai Vijayan Contributing Writer Jai Vijayan is a seasoned

Microsoft In their 2023 Global Diversity & Inclusion Report in the section “Pay equity” Microsoft actually admits paying “all racial and ethnic minority groups” more than “white employees…with the same job title and level and considering tenure” They even go so far as to break down how much more each minority and ethnic group makes more than white employees “As of September 2023 inside the US all racial and ethnic minority groups who are rewards eligible combined earn $1007 total pay for every $1000 earned by US rewards-eligible white employees with the same job title and level and considering tenure Specifically for those who are rewards eligible US Black and African American employees earn $1004; Hispanic and Latinx employees earn $1004; and Asian employees earn $1012 for every $1000 earned by US rewards-eligible white employees with the same job title and level and considering tenure” Sure the difference in pay between people in minority and ethnic groups is about a fraction of a penny more than their white counterparts but if the difference were insignificant why brag about it?

583,"Mistrals deal with Microsoft is causing controversy","2/28/2024","https://sifted.eu/articles/mistral-microsoft-deal-controversy","Startup Europe Grown up reporting Backed by © 2024 Sifted EU Ltd All Rights Reserved Analysis February 28 2024 Daphné Leprince-Ringuet 5 min read In just a few months Mistral AI has become France’s most prized AI company Much of the goodwill has come from the promise of creating a European champion that could compete against US giants like ChatGPT creator OpenAI with an open-source product that reflects the continent’s push for more transparency in the sector From the start Mistral has made a point of providing open-source AI models — which means that users can download and use the technology’s source code for free — as a European alternative to less transparent products such as those developed by OpenAI which are known as closed source or proprietary So when the startup announced it is partnering with US tech behemoth Microsoft — in a deal that saw the tech giant take a stake in Mistral— to distribute its new large language model (LLM) Mistral Large which is not open source some sceptical eyebrows were raised Unlike Mistral’s first open-source model releases Mistral Large is a ready-made API that can be used for a fee and gives no access to the code Some critics see the move as a U-turn on Mistral’s original commitment to open source that is not unlike OpenAI’s shift from open to closed models It wasn’t long before social media filled up with debates as to whether this means the company is going down the same route as its US competitor “It is so over” wrote one user on an open source subreddit “GREED” wrote another “The idealistic stance they initially had around openness and transparency is now probably not going to be implemented fully” says Andreas Goeldi an AI-focused partner at Swiss VC firm b2venture “They still have open models and they seem to want to continue to do that but it is not as clear as it was until now” Some will see the uproar as hysterical hand wringing Mistral has always made clear its strategy was to offer commercial models alongside its open-source offering Monetising open source which is by definition free software is a challenge for many European startups Some like the UK’s Stability AI have also moved away from a fully open-source business model to generate more revenue “It’s always relatively hard to monetise open source and you have to find a way to make people pay anyway” says Goeldi “To turn this into a real business [Mistral] had to find a way to monetise it more” But it’s not only about the technicalities of AI models Mistral has always presented its open-source strategy as part of what makes it a distinctly European alternative to closed-source US companies like OpenAI “We have been pursuing a clear trajectory: that of creating a European champion with a global vocation in generative artificial intelligence based on an open responsible and decentralised approach to technology” said the company’s cofounder Arthur Mensch last December when the company released Mixtral 8x7B This is why the company’s release of a closed-source model at the same time as it inks a partnership with Microsoft has raised some concerns with critics who say the deal has the potential to further strengthen the tech giant’s control of the generative AI market In a leaked pitch deck seen by Sifted in June shortly after the company raised a €105m seed round the company wrote: “An oligopoly is shaping up… All major actors are currently US-based and Europe has yet to see the appearance of a serious contender” The European Commission has said that it will scrutinise whether the Microsoft partnership aligns with the bloc’s competition rules according to Bloomberg As part of the deal Mistral’s models will be distributed on the tech giant’s cloud computing platform Azure Microsoft will also provide Mistral with the computing infrastructure it needs to develop and train its models — in exchange for a small stake in the company It is a very similar setup to that of OpenAI — the only other AI company to have a distribution deal with Microsoft — and one that will reinforce the dominance of Microsoft in the sector “It’s one large step for Mistral one giant leap for Microsoft” says Yann Lechelle former CEO of French cloud computing platform Scaleway and now founder of open-source startup Probabl The deal has the potential to enable Mistral to access a much larger pool of potential customers and to significantly increase its revenues but does show that it’s hard to do business in this field without the support of a Big Tech partner “This partnership between Microsoft is a major and logical opportunity for Mistral” says Lechelle“Unfortunately it shows that distribution of any major…SaaS offering AI or otherwise depends and reinforces already dominating hyperscalers Whether this is problematic is up for debate Mistral’s deal with Microsoft could enable the company to grow bigger and eventually compete against monopolistic US technologies “I think they are trying to find an approach that enables them to keep their positioning — a European AI company that is sovereign and open source — while accelerating their revenue” says Maxime Corbani senior associate at deeptech VC firm Runa Capital And if anyone did think it could develop a world-leading AI company without signing a deal with a member of the oligopoly it sought to oppose Goeldi says it was shortsighted “It’s the reality facing Europe at this time” he says “Maybe people were a bit naive about how easy it would be to do this in standalone” Mistral have not responded to a request for comment Editors pick Interview Zenlys founder is back with

586,"Will Microsoft Ever Come Cheap With A Market Cap Of $306 Trillion? (NASDAQ:MSFT)","2/5/2024","https://seekingalpha.com/article/4667445-will-microsoft-ever-come-cheap-with-a-market-cap-of-3-06-trillion","boonstudio/iStock via Getty Images boonstudio/iStock via Getty Images We previously covered Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:NASDAQ:MSFT) in November 2023 discussing the Intelligent Clouds expanding top/ bottom lines and backlog attributed to the robust demand for OpenAI-enabled SaaS offerings across legacy and startup companies Combined with the sustained cloud migration and likely to be completed ATVI deal we had believed that its prospects might be very bright after all However these had also triggered the stocks premium valuations and prices then resulting in our cautious Buy recommendation only after a moderate pullback In this article we shall discuss why we have been overly greedy with us missing out on MSFTs rally by +163% over the past three months and the gap widening by +348% to our previous recommended entry point It is apparent by now that MSFT is an Alpha that one may chase at every dips since the CEOs brilliance the companys highly profitable growth and the growing partnership with OpenAI may never come cheap after all If anything the Market Capitalization continues to race upwards with it already nearly doubling to $306T since the November 2022 bottom of $16T For now MSFT has reported an excellent double beat FQ224 earnings call with revenues of $6202B (+97% QoQ/ +176% YoY) and GAAP EPS of $293 (-2% QoQ/ +332% YoY) Its top-line tailwinds are attributed to the excellent growth reported across three of its segments with the most notable one being its More Personal Computing at $1689B (+23% QoQ/ +186% YoY) thanks to the new PC replacement cycle of between three to four years after the 2020 boom The same has been reported by Intel (INTC) in the latest quarter with Canalys also projecting 267M units in 2024 PC shipments (+8% YoY) likely to trigger further tailwinds to MSFTs PC SaaS offerings At the same time MSFT also benefits from its partnership with OpenAI as observed in the sustained expansion in the Microsoft Cloud revenues to $337B (+59% QoQ/ +243% YoY) in FQ224 This is attributed to the application of AI across every layer of its tech stack driving new benefits such as growing consumer base cross selling and up to +70% in productivity gains The same is observed in Intelligent Clouds expanding operating profit margins of 481% (-03 points QoQ/ +68 YoY) implying its ability to generate improved returns despite the elongated sales cycle based on the Cloud backlog of $1769B (-91% QoQ/ +118% YoY) Therefore while the growth of MSFTs Cloud backlog has paled in comparison to its peers such as Amazons (AMZN) AWS at $1557B (+17% QoQ/ +41% YoY) and Alphabets (GOOG) Google Cloud at $741B (+141% QoQ/ +152% YoY) we are not overly concerned This is because MSFTs Cloud operating profit margins excel over AWS at 296% (-06 points QoQ/ +53 YoY) and GOOGs at 93% (+62 points QoQ/ +158 YoY) over the same time period The same is also observed in MSFTs bottom line driver the Productivity and Business Processes segment with expanding profit margins of 534% (-02 points QoQ/ +54 YoY) by the latest quarter naturally contributing to its accelerating bottom line Demand for its commercial offerings remain healthy as well thanks to the consistent license renewals ARPU growth and healthier than expected LinkedIn performance from the uncertain global labor market Lastly MSFT still boasts a robust net cash situation of $3606B (-646% QoQ/ -348% YoY) and a relatively reasonable effective interest rate range of between 246% and 549% despite the hefty ATVI price tag of $69B Readers must note that the tech giant still reports $2704B of short-term debt (+48% QoQ) with an elevated weighted average interest rate of 55% (+01 points QoQ) likely to bridge the recently completed deal However due to MSFTs robust profitability and Satya Nadellas stellar handling of the recent OpenAI crisis we are not concerned at all These developments demonstrate that the SaaS company is in good hands after all with the AI industry likely to experience rapid growth and expansion in the future MSFT Valuations Seeking Alpha Seeking Alpha Combined with the expanding AI SaaS TAM across gaming ad spending IT and business services from $186B in 2022 to $66179B in 2032 at an accelerated CAGR of +7994% we believe that MSFT remains well poised for excellent growth over the next decade The same profitable growth premium is also embedded in its FWD P/E stock valuations of 3442x compared to its 1Y mean of 3041x 3Y pre-pandemic mean of 2455x and sector median of 2448x MSFT is also notably trading way higher than its Cloud/ SaaS/ ad peers such as GOOG at FWD P/E of 2118x and META at 2037x though still lower than AMZN at 4425x implying the markets conviction of the formers ability to deliver record growth ahead The Consensus Forward Estimates Seeking Alpha Seeking Alpha The same has also been observed in the consistently raised consensus estimates with MSFT expected to generate a top/ bottom line CAGR of +146%/ +167% through FY2026 This is compared to the previous estimates of +124%/ +129% while building upon its historical growth at a CAGR of +127%/ +197% between FY2016 and FY2023 respectively Assuming that MSFT is able to hold to its higher P/E valuations it appears that the stock is trading at a slight premium of +8% to its fair value of $38060 based on the LTM EPS of $1106 and FWD P/E of 3442x However based on the consensus FY2026 EPS estimates of $1567 there seems to be a more than decent upside potential of +311% to our long-term price target of $53930 sustaining its growth story ahead MSFT 4Y Stock Price Trading View Trading View For now MSFT has rapidly broken out of its 50/ 100/ 200 day moving averages while also charting new heights way above the previous November 2021 top With almost all of the Magnificent 7 stocks recently reporting their stellar earnings aside for Nvidia (NVDA) scheduled on February 21 2024 and Teslas (TSLA) top/ bottom line misses it is unsurprising that sentiments are somewhat lifted with the market index skewed towards greed at the same time With MSFTs recovery easily outpacing the SPY and QQQ over the past few months we believe that the stock may never come cheap after all especially due to the multiple growth drivers over the next decade On the one hand while we may rate MSFT as a Buy investors may want to add according to their dollar cost averages and risk appetite preferably after a moderate pullback to its previous support levels of $370s for an improved margin of safety On the other hand we believe that MSFT remains a long-term winner and deserves a spot in most growth oriented investors portfolio with it similarly

1 – Microsoft’s new CoPilot Pro brings AI-powered office features to the rest of us On Monday Microsoft announced their CoPilot Pro premium service for $20 dollars per month The subscription fee gives users access to features including Microsoft 365 apps – Excel PowerPoint Microsoft Teams – with “priority access” to GPT-4 As stated on the Microsoft Blog it will also be available on iOS and Android For those who already use Microsoft 365 CoPilot Pro will activate CoPilot in all apps offering AI-powered capabilities for each (Source: The Verge) Why this is important for your business: CoPilot Pro will help your employees draft better emails write better documents create better presentations and take better notes – among other things – which will all combine to making them more productive My recommendation if your company uses Office 365 is to lean into this Start with a small group and expand its use Get training and consultation But take advantage of these tools as they’ll significantly help your people get more things done quickly 2 – ChatGPT will have video functionality and more accuracy in future versions – Sam Altman says ChatGPT-5 will be a big improvement An improved version of ChatGPT was the topic of conversation on the Unconfuse Me podcast where Sam Altman shared with Bill Gates what users can expect with GPT-5 Altman detailed that issues with accuracy and query commands are being worked on Images and video will also receive noticeable enhancements In the 10 months since GPT-4 was launched numerous accuracy issues were reported and many users voiced frustrations Altman also touched on what’s known as “hallucinations” meaning instances where the chatbot produces irrelevant data Now – ahead of GPT-5’s official launch yet to be announced – OpenAI is getting ahead of the glitches by promoting a much-improved product (Source: Tom’s Guide) Why this is important for your business: Microsoft is a significant partner to OpenAI (a Microsoft spokesperson says while details of the agreement between Microsoft and Open AI remain confidential it is important to note that Microsoft does not own any portion of OpenAI and is simply entitled to share of profit distributions) so Office users can expect to benefit from any new features in the highly anticipated GPT-5 3 – Mastercard is developing AI-powered tool for small business mentorship Mastercard is planning to launch Mastercard Small Business AI – a tool to help entrepreneurs and small businesses “adapt keep pace and thrive” in the evolving landscape of technology and consumer demands In partnership with Create Labs the AI will contain key data while also offering a “conversational experience” on various business-related questions (Source: ASBN) Why this is important for your business: I’m still a little unclear on what this service will actually do for small businesses but hoping its generative AI functionality will provide us with a better way for getting financing and cash flow guidance The launch is still a few months away so I’m assuming we’ll get more clarity as the time approaches 4 – Email automation from GoDaddy offers custom emails to deliver the right message at the right time Continuing with their mission to empower entrepreneurs GoDaddy has launched email automation to lighten the load of email marketing Available for new and existing users at no extra cost the feature is listed on GoDaddy’s product page (Source: CRN India) Why this is important for your business: Included are templates – welcome messages appointment reminders – and personalized emails that users can draft for specific recipients then schedule them to be sent at a chosen date and time Templates can be tailored with color schemes/graphics that reflect the users’ company or brand For GoDaddy customers using email this is definitely a good tool to try 5 – Before you buy a Windows 11 ‘AI PC’ in 2024 read this Chris Hoffman of Computer World recommends taking a pause if you’re in the market for the Windows 11 “AI PC” Promoted as a major boost in laptop performance AI PCs were also on display at last week’s CES 2024 event For more visit the link (Source: Computerworld) Why this is important for your business: As Hoffman points out we as consumers should “cut through the hype” and take a closer look First the AI-powered performance isn’t occurring on the device itself Hoffman says That process occurs on an external “data center” your laptop communicates with Technology is working toward a self-operating AI laptop which requires NPUs (neural processing unit) and “soon” every PC will have one Hoffman concludes the better option would be to get a laptop with a powerful GPU (graphics processing unit)"
605,"DOJ FTC consider antitrust probe into Microsoft-OpenAI: RPT","1/22/2024","https://finance.yahoo.com/video/doj-ftc-consider-antitrust-probe-212021938.html","The Department of Justice (DOJ) and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) regulators are currently discussing a potential antitrust into artificial intelligence firm OpenAI and its relationship with Microsoft (MSFT) — which owns 49% of OpenAI — according to reporting by Politico Yahoo Finance Tech Editor Dan Howley explains the antitrust concerns laid out in this Politico report For more expert insight and the latest market action click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live Editors note: This article was written by Luke Carberry Mogan - OpenAI is the latest tech firm reportedly caught in the crossfire of antitrust investigators The Justice Department and FTC are in discussions about a probe into the companys involvement with Microsoft thats according to Politico Yahoo Finances very own Dan Howley joins us now for more Dan DAN HOWLEY: Yeah I mean this would be a huge deal if either the FTC or DOJ went after OpenAI and Microsoft If you think about it Microsoft has invested billions of dollars into OpenAI to date Theyre more or less Microsofts AI arm at this point Microsoft has their own AI business of course But OpenAI really is a huge part of that And so if theyre forced to separate or break up their partnership we really dont anything along those lines if that would happen Or really how this investigation would unfold if it actually happens But it could throw a huge wrench into Microsofts plans for its growth on the cloud part Now we keep talking about AI in general But really where that kind of shows up is in its cloud business right? Its Azure business Its whether thats helping companies run their own AI capabilities or Microsoft running its own AI capabilities through Copilot for 365 or Copilot Pro which is a new consumer offering $20 a month per person So it would really damage what Microsoft is trying to build up here As well as OpenAI Because lets face it Theyre getting a ton of money from Microsoft And theyre using Microsoft to help build out their capabilities So theyre really super reliant on each other at this point And one of the points that they bring up in this Politico article is the influence that Microsoft had during the kind of kerfuffle with Sam Altman being ousted and then coming back I guess taking a long weekend we could say They were going to hire him right? And then seemingly they helped make everything copacetic again But the fact that theyre so reliant on each other at this point it raises concerns if this is an actual investigation or if theres even an inkling of it - Right I mean theres a lot of interesting stuff in here because theres now seems to be-- its very very early to the point where they cant even decide if its the FTC or the DOJ who should be doing an investigation if there even should be an investigation So that also raises the question its an election year right? So even if they figure that out is it going to change if someone else gets into office? DAN HOWLEY: Yeah I mean look these investigations take years right? I mean were talking about the potential for Apple to maybe sort of have an antitrust suit brought by the DOJ Weve been talking about since 2020 right? I mean weve been writing about that How this has been coming for so long? And so this is something that still could take years and years if again if it ever actually gets off the ground Theres no guarantee that will happen that these things are very complicated And sometimes they come and go And companies are totally left intact But I do think its just important to keep in mind how necessary the two companies almost are for each other Microsoft basically being the engine thats powering OpenAI And then OpenAI putting that horsepower to work for Microsoft So I mean theyre very intertwined at this point You can consider them You cant really consider in one company But you know its close enough where youre like oh you guys are real tight - Dan always great to see you Thanks for that Appreciate it DAN HOWLEY: For sure Related Quotes"

Nadella took over as Microsoft CEO on February 4 2014 the company was struggling Windows 8 had been a disaster Microsoft employees were constantly battling behind the scenes for supremacy And all the while consumers and developers alike were losing faith in the company cofounded by Bill Gates How times have changed In January as 56-year-old Nadella neared a decade in charge Microsoft overtook Apple to become the worlds most valuable public company and is now worth about $3 trillion Its a resurgence thats been credited to his savvy embrace of partnerships dedication to innovation and considered leadership style Heres how Nadella worked his way up the ranks of Microsoft and executed this startling turnaround This article has been updated since its original publication in 2016 Satya Narayana Nadella was born in Hyderabad India in 1967 His father was a civil servant and his mother was a professor of the ancient language Sanskrit From a young age Nadella wanted to be a professional cricket player and played in school However he realized that his athletic talent was outmatched by his passion for science and technology Hes credited his parents for giving him the confidence to become his own person Nadella received his bachelors degree in electrical engineering from the Manipal Institute of Technology in 1988 I always knew I wanted to build things he once said The institution didnt have a comprehensive computer-science program so he traveled to the US to attend University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee and graduated in 1990 He followed that with an MBA from the University of Chicago Nadella remained in the US and got a job on the technology team at Sun Microsystems then one of the most innovative tech companies But in 1992 he joined Microsoft where cofounder Bill Gates was still CEO and Windows had just begun its march to world domination I remember distinctly walking into building 22 at Microsoft in 1992 thinking thats the greatest job on earth I have and I dont need anything more he said in an interview with LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky Nadellas first projects included Microsofts ill-fated interactive TV product and the Windows NT operating system A baby-faced Nadella also helped pitch Microsofts Visual Basic in a telethon-style broadcast designed for developers circa 1993 At the time Nadella was one of a small number of Indian immigrants working at Microsoft Although he held a green card his wife Anu was still living in India When her visa application was rejected Nadella gave up his permanent resident status and took an H-1B visa in 1994 allowing him to bring his wife to the US Hes since been a dual citizen The unconventional immigration move did not go unnoticed by his colleagues What I didnt expect was the instant notoriety around campus Nadella wrote in his 2017 book Hit Refresh Hey there goes the guy who gave up his green card During his first years at Microsoft Nadella impressed his coworkers and managers alike by commuting every weekend from Microsofts Redmond Washington campus to Chicago to finish his MBA Hed finally graduated in 1997 His inquisitiveness and passion for innovation soon saw him rise within Microsoft By 1999 Nadella landed his first executive role as vice-president of the newly created Microsoft bCentral a set of web services for small businesses that included website hosting and email In 2000 Microsoft got its second CEO: Steve Ballmer One year later Nadella was promoted to corporate VP of Microsoft Business Solutions The group had been formed through a series of acquisitions including Great Plains which made accounting software for small and midsize businesses The team was also building a cloud-based CRM system to compete with Salesforce Eventually all these products would be rebranded as Dynamics By 2007 Nadella had taken another step up the ladder He was made senior VP of Microsoft Online Services putting him in command of the Bing search engine as well as early online versions of Microsoft Office and the Xbox Live gaming service In February 2011 Nadella was promoted to president of the Server and Tools division It encompassed cash-cow products for data centers such as Windows Server and the SQL Server databases But it was also home to one of CEO Steve Ballmers boldest gambles the Microsoft Azure cloud platform When Nadella took over the server and tools business it produced $166 billion in revenues By 2013 that was up to $203 billion At this point Microsoft was running into trouble On the PC side Windows 8 was a disaster the iPhone and Android were outrunning Windows phones by leaps and bounds and Bing just couldnt make a dent in Googles search dominance The company was facing an antitrust suit from the European Union and its stock price kept dropping In August 2013 an embattled Ballmer announced his departure sparking a search for a new CEO The search committee included Ballmer and Gates In February 2014 after much rumor and speculation Nadella was announced as CEO with the support of Ballmer and Gates He was awarded an $84 million first-year compensation package Nadella quickly won over employees by making big changes quickly in an effort to right the ship and win back customers He sent a company-wide email when he took over calling for Microsoft to prioritize innovation that is centered on our core value of empowering users and organizations He ended the message with an Oscar Wilde quote: We need to believe in the impossible and remove the improbable Change was coming to Microsoft Nadella proved he wasnt afraid to shake things up and invigorate the company by embracing partnerships with rivals including Apple Google and Amazon He started by adopting the rival Linux operating system for the Azure cloud – a once-unthinkable move But soon Nadella had overseen the release of Microsoft Office for the Apple iPad; spent $25 billion buying Mojang the studio behind the hit game Minecraft; and released first-class iPhone and Android apps including Outlook Innovation also led to the development of HoloLens Microsofts super-futuristic holographic goggles and its first laptop the Surface Book When something didnt work he was unafraid to ditch projects such as skipping Windows 9 to go straight to the superior Windows 10 Nadellas approach to leadership was credited with reforming the companys culture and has said he tries to create energy among employees Many workers are fond of his leadership style which emphasizes learning and making mistakes as a hedge against overconfidence and arrogance It doesnt matter if youre a top executive or a first-line seller — he has exactly the same quality of listening Microsoft executive vice-president Jean-Philippe Courtois has said Nadella 56 and his wife Anu have had three children and live in Bellevue Lake Washington Their oldest son Zain was born with severe cerebral palsy and required specialized care He died in 2022 aged 26 Becoming a father of a son with special needs was the turning point in my life that has shaped who I am today Nadella wrote in a 2017 essay on LinkedIn He called Zain the joy of our family whose strength and warmth both inspire and motivate me to keep pushing the boundaries of what technology can do Nadella has said the experience has encouraged him to lead with empathy telling Good Housekeeping it has had a profound impact on how I think lead and relate to people Nadellas philosophy is about partnering and ensuring Microsoft software and services are available wherever customers are — even if thats not Windows In fact in 2015 Nadella used an iPhone on stage at an event to show off his favorite Microsoft apps His predecessor Steve Ballmer famously pretended to stomp on one at a company meeting Thats also why his first big hire was former Qualcomm exec Peggy Johnson to be VP of business development She left to become CEO of Magic Leap in 2020 Under Nadella Microsoft has made some of its biggest acquisitions including the $26 billion purchase of LinkedIn in 2016 the $75 billion acquisition of code-sharing site GitHub in 2018 and the $69 billion deal with video games publisher Activision Blizzard in 2023 Nadella has said he has two main criteria when eyeing acquisitions: what value Microsoft can add and how much financial sense it makes Nadellas biggest move in recent years has been investing $10 billion in OpenAI During the week of leadership chaos at OpenAI Nadella stuck firm to ousted CEO Sam Altman offering him a job at Microsoft This provided crucial leverage for Altman to reclaim his position while cementing Microsoft as an essential partner for the pioneering AI company In his post on X announcing his return Altman highlighted Satyas support and said he looked forward to building on our strong partnership with Microsoft In investors eyes Microsoft is now well-positioned to continue its dominance in the AI revolution Microsoft is also making its own mark with a generative AI companion called Copilot to be integrated into its suite of apps Its a bet on a future in which every person and organization has their own personal AI agent to handle mundane tasks Gaming is the companys other focus A leak in September revealed it hopes to build a hybrid cloud gaming platform Vodafone and Microsoft have also recently announced a $15 billion 10-year partnership to bring gen AI digital and cloud services to European and African markets Nadellas been busy And investors love it: From 2014 to 2015 his first year Microsoft stock jumped 14% But over the past decade its soared by 1006% and revenue was up 13% on the year to September 2023 That growth is expected to continue in 2024 Microsoft started the year by knocking Apple off the top spot to become the worlds most valuable public company and becoming only the second to exceed a $3 trillion valuation Nadella has largely avoided controversy notwithstanding a couple of slip-ups over the years In 2014 he said women should rely on good karma to get raises and trust that the system will eventually reward their work He later told staff in an email hed answered that question completely wrong Nadellas also spoken out against improper relationships between executives and employees saying in 2021 that the power dynamic in the workplace is not something that can be abused in any form Nadella wakes up at 7 am and starts the day by thinking of one thing hes grateful for he told Balance the Grind He then does 15 minutes of stretching and a 30-minute run no matter where he is or how little sleep hes had He leaves work at the office walking out the door about 5 pm and spends the rest of the day with his family Nadellas also encouraged workers not to answer emails on weekends I want to be engaged in conversations and do deep work rather than over-scheduling and adding more burden to feel like Im productive he told Mens Journal In 2022 Nadella took home just under $485 million with $25 million from salary and almost $40 million in stock At one point Nadella owned more than 15 million shares in Microsoft but ahead of Washington states introduction of a higher rate of capital gains tax in 2022 he sold almost half his stake for around $285 million according to SEC filings That left him with about 830000 shares in the company worth about $335 million Comparatively founder Bill Gates has more than 100 million shares Nadella also serves on the board of trustees to his alma mater the University of Chicago as well as the Starbucks board Nadellas biggest tip for success? Dont wait for your next job to do your best work he told LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky in an interview last year January 31 2024: This story was updated to clarify that the specific figures associated with Microsofts investment in OpenAI havent been officially confirmed Read next Jump to"

investing resources and more Learn More Microsoft (MSFT -015%) and OpenAI opened up a brave new world with the launch of ChatGPT late last year The advent of generative AI technologies could disrupt a wide range of industries but its also prompted thorny questions about how this new technology should be regulated and whats fair game for training these new large language models which develop their intelligence from content on the internet That particular issue is at the heart of a new multibillion-dollar lawsuit that could shake up Silicon Valley as The New York Times (NYT -052%) is suing Microsoft and OpenAI alleging that they violated its use of the copyright to its articles The so-called paper of record filed the lawsuit last Wednesday in Federal District Court in Manhattan claiming that the generative AI pioneers are responsible for billions of dollars in statutory and actual damages for the unlawful copying and use of the Times uniquely valuable works The complaint also demands that OpenAI and Microsoft destroy the models that used the Times content Image source: Getty Images The 69-page complaint from the Times makes a variety of allegations including that some responses from ChatGPT lift passages from the Times content verbatim ChatGPT also offers users a way to circumvent the Times paywall for some of its articles as any user can simply ask Chat GPT to type out the Times articles The Times accuses ChatGPT of reproducing its articles with hallucinations or falsely attributing material to the Times that didnt come from it Altogether the complaints portray ChatGPT as a library of Times content that can be accessed directly or indirectly for free without the permission of The New York Times The Times isnt the first publisher to make such a complaint Getty Images for example sued an AI company for unauthorized use of its visual materials and a group of authors including Jonathan Franzen and John Grisham have sued AI platforms for using their work as well The battle lines are familiar to anyone who has followed this debate previously Tech companies have a history of enriching themselves on the backs of publishers from the early days of music-file sharing to battles over what news content should be allowed on social-media feeds or how videos on YouTube get monetized Throughout the conflict the media industry and traditional publishers have largely come out on the losing end In the Times complaint the subtext is nearly as important as the actual lawsuit The point the Times is making is that its content is valuable enough that it was specifically chosen to help train large language models like ChatGPT In fact in Common Crawl a database designed to be a copy of the internet the Times is the third most-cited source behind a database of US patent filings and Wikipedia In other words the value of the Times content extends well beyond the value of its business which currently has a market cap of $8 billion Its reporting sets the agenda for much of the rest of the news industry and its content influences public policy and corporate decision-making At this stage its impossible to say what the outcome of the Times complaint might be but investors should be watching the developments closely Considering the billions of dollars flowing into AI models and the multitrillion-dollar market caps of sponsors like Microsoft there seems to be both a rich target in suing the profiteers of AI and clear business value in the Times content for use in AI models The New York Times stock rose nearly 3% on Wednesday when the complaint was filed and tacked on another 24% on Thursday a sign investors think this could be a winning move for the newspaper publisher If the Times can find a way to tap into the massive generative AI market it could

They saved more than 10 hours a month But these productivity gains only come when companies take an intentional and programmatic approach to their rollout “Becoming an AI-powered organization doesn’t happen with the flip of a switch” says Jared Spataro Corporate Vice President of Modern Work and Business Applications at Microsoft “AI is unlike any technology we’ve seen before which means it requires a unique strategy to deploy and drive adoption Organizations that take a thoughtful and deliberate approach are going to be the ones to reap the benefits of AI” Here are five steps to nail your AI rollout—along with key lessons from companies leading the charge Get your data house in order What we’ve learned The magic of Copilot is its ability to reason over all the data and content in your organization—enabling it to deliver personalized relevant and actionable responses It automatically inherits your existing Microsoft 365 data and security permissions which makes it essential to have solid content management practices and data governance in place before rollout begins Futurist Amy Webb advises leaders to ask their teams: “When was the last time you did a data audit?” If you want a future where you can get the full value of AI she says you need to shore up your internal infrastructure Are all your confidential files labeled accordingly? You’ll want to make sure your data is labeled properly so only those who should have eyes on a file get access What early adopters are getting right In the highly regulated financial services industry security is a top priority “We wanted to find an AI solution that could provide us with great time-saving benefits without making us feel like we were placing ourselves at unnecessary risk” says Vicki Holman a Collaboration Platform Owner at Hargreaves Lansdown a UK-based financial services company With Copilot for Microsoft 365 “we found a highly secure alternative to the AI solutions employees were using outside of our well-protected environment” Because Copilot automatically inherits an organization’s security compliance and privacy policies for Microsoft 365 Holman and her colleagues felt confident that their new AI bet would safeguard their data “We had peace of mind using Copilot because we’ve already got our Microsoft 365 E5 licenses and we are quite mature in terms of the security and compliance we already have in place” “To build an AI-powered organization leaders need to help their teams embrace new mindsets and habits Before starting any project document email or presentation first ask yourself: how can AI help me with this task?” Be intentional about your rollout What we’ve learned To maximize the return on your AI investment you’ll need to make sure that the first people who have access are the ones who will glean the most value With Copilot we’ve found that a three-pronged approach is most effective: Give the technology to entire teams within a specific business function like customer service or sales That way they can share insights and learn from one another—multiplying the technology’s impact Allocate remaining seats to a variety of roles and levels from senior leaders to IT admins to project managers We recommend that most seats go to non-executive employees Define clear objectives for how each team will use the new technology such as “reducing ticket volume” for customer service This will help guide employees toward the most pressing business needs What early adopters are getting right Multinational technology company Lumen Technologies first gave Copilot to its customer service sales and customer experience teams The customer service team is using AI to surface relevant policies summarize tickets and access step-by-step repair instructions from manuals while the sales and customer experience teams are using it to enrich customer interactions with additional depth and context “Our people are seeing immediate productivity improvements with Copilot” CEO Kate Johnson says which ultimately helps them better serve their customers and makes it easier to do business with them Identify champions to lead the way What we’ve learned AI advocates are internal influencers: they show off exactly how Copilot can help in their day-to-day work and get work friends and colleagues excited to try it themselves (no #promocode needed) Ask managers to identify one power user from their team to be a representative and empower these advocates to lead internal trainings—like a Copilot 101 session for salespeople—and create quick video demos that can spread organically throughout the company Another idea from Wharton professor and AI expert Ethan Mollick: “I don’t think you’d be remiss as a leader of a large-scale Fortune 1000 company to take the top 20 percent most creative people in your company require they all use AI for a week and give a million-dollar prize to whoever comes up with the best way to automate parts of their job all while promising you’re not going to fire anyone as a result of this” Of course that won’t be feasible for many companies Another way to get started: task your internal champions with filming short social media–style videos of their favorite ways to use AI in their work and share them with your people in regular email or Teams dispatches What early adopters are getting right Our own early Copilot champions at Microsoft are discovering agile ways to share their skills—and their passion—across teams quickly scaling AI habits and helping everyone learn They’ve led virtual demo workshops Ask Me Anything sessions and Copilot tips Teams channels where they share favorite prompts One of the most impactful initiatives to date? Function-specific training sessions where each champion led an interactive training geared toward the day-to-day work in say marketing “Grassroots champions have been a key to Copilot adoption” says Daniel Vargas a Senior Director of Product Marketing—and unofficial Copilot ambassador—at Microsoft “When people embed AI into their daily work and share the things they’ve done with it it helps others see the potential and inspires them to explore the technology for themselves” Prioritize skilling What we’ve learned Without ongoing training AI won’t make much of a difference to your bottom line That’s why it’s vital to create—and maintain—virtual spaces for people to share tips ask questions and find resources Organizations should encourage people to share their most powerful AI prompts with their teams says AJ Brush a researcher on human-computer interaction and Partner Group Manager at Microsoft who keeps a running list of her favorites that she gets from co-workers (A good one she heard recently: “Go through my flagged emails and rank the top five in importance”) Copilot Lab our collection of prompt tips and prompt guidance can help companies grow that muscle What early adopters are getting right To get the most out of Copilot Morula Health a small business that provides regulatory medical writing services to the healthcare industry has been building out its very own prompt library Sharing great prompts helps the team save time as they use Copilot to keep action items on track write first drafts of blogs and redact documents That process says Philip Burridge Morula’s Director of Operations and Strategy “ensures sustained high-quality output allowing us to seamlessly integrate technology without compromising consistency” Help people build new work habits What we’ve learned To build an AI-powered organization leaders need to help their teams embrace new mindsets and habits Before starting any project document email or presentation first ask yourself: how can AI help me with this task? Working effectively with AI requires the ability to delegate exercise good judgment and apply subject-matter expertise—in other words you need to think like a manager You’ll also need to re-learn how to search In our global survey of 18100 people respondents said they spend more time searching for information (27% of their day) than creating (24%) communicating (24%) or consuming it (25%) AI eases this pain by scanning your entire data universe—emails meetings chats documents and more plus the web—to find what you’re looking for What early adopters are getting right In the Crop Science division of Bayer a global enterprise with a focus on healthcare and agriculture researchers and data scientists can use a few key phrases in Copilot in Teams to quickly locate studies and predictive models elsewhere in the company Via a customized Teams plugin Copilot not only calls up the relevant models it identifies who is responsible for the research—making it easier to connect with the expert source on a specific topic In one instance a researcher in the United States was working on a project that would require a significant amount of time to complete By using Copilot to investigate other models being created at the company the researcher identified a predictive model developed by a researcher in Germany preventing a duplicate model from being developed That saved two to three months of work—and sped up the time it took to get a solution to farmers And at global ad agency dentsu Copilot has changed workflows entirely “Before we would sit with a client in a room for an ideation session we would come up with ideas together we’d take that information and days or weeks later we’d come back with creative visualizations of these ideas” says James Thomas Dentsu Creative’s Global Head of Technology “With Copilot we’ve already got visuals and draft ideas of what things could look like with the client in the room which means we can get to the right idea faster” AI can transform your organization but only if you adopt it with intention and strategy And while there’s no one-size-fits-all approach to getting it right these insights can help guide leaders who want to get the most out of their AI investment Stay in the AI know with WorkLab: Sign up for our biweekly newsletter to get the latest AI research insights and trends delivered straight to your inbox Work Trend Index Special Report Interactive Quiz"

“2nd Trillion-Dollar AI Trade” The US govt just unlocked an $8 trillion market to move in a new direction See how it could unleash 6000% potential upside Kick off the new year by investing in three long-term gems Advertisement Source: Shutterstock For those prioritizing long-term investments the key is selecting stocks with a robust track record and resilience in unpredictable scenarios In the vast landscape of investments dominated by tech unicorns and financial giants three discreet millionaire-maker stocks stand out These stocks operating with resilience innovation and market finesse quietly generate wealth Also they act as undercover agents of fortune in the shadows Indeed investing early is a pathway to leaving a lasting legacy Also it assures substantial returns for future endeavors such as homeownership or funding education So the sooner one engages in legacy investing the greater the potential gains Therefore let’s dive into three millionaire-maker growth stocks that may have a few millionaires to mint yet In 2023 Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) staged a remarkable turnaround surging nearly 200% after a terrible 64% decline in 2022 Notably the company’s revival can be largely attributed to artificial intelligence (AI) initiatives This includes the launch of products like Imagine and Meta AI along with 28 additional AI programs They even feature influencers like Snoop Dogg and Kendall Jenner Additionally the potential for a significant Federal Reserve rate cut throughout the year promised positive market implications Further this could include a potential boost to the company’s valuation Meta’s strides in AI are notable and further advancements could prompt a valuation comparable to leading AI-focused stocks Additionally anticipated earnings growth of approximately 21% in the coming year will likely contribute to Meta’s favorable trajectory Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) thrives as a platform empowering businesses to establish and manage online stores Its subscription model ensures a steady income stream Recently the company marked its most successful Black Friday with merchants raking in $41 billion in sales Financially robust Shopify recorded a 25% year-over-year (YOY) revenue surge to $17 billion and a 36% YOY increase in gross profit With SHOP stock surging 115% year to date (YTD) momentum could propel it going forward in the coming year In its most recent recent quarter Shopify reported earnings of 31 cents per share marking a substantial 3429% increase from the same period last year Additionally quarterly revenue came in at $207 billion reflecting 19% YOY growth For the current fiscal year earnings are estimated at 70 cents per share This represents a remarkable 1650% change with revenue expected to reach $698 billion a 25% change Looking to the next fiscal year earnings are projected at $104 per share implying growth of 48% After a challenging 2022 Shopify rebounded reclaiming a $100 billion market cap The company’s restructuring including the sale of its logistics business boosted investor confidence With a leaner workforce positive operating income and AI opportunities analysts anticipate 20% revenue growth positioning Shopify as a top 2024 performer Tech giant Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a key holding for many institutional investors including Citadel making up nearly 2% of this asset manager’s portfolio Citadel increased its Microsoft position by 367 million shares across Q2 and Q3 Specifically it acquired 16 million shares in Q3 at an average closing price of $330 This strategic move bolsters confidence amid rising share prices Also it highlights Microsoft’s strength in AI and the cloud The tech behemoth surged over 260% in the past five years rewarding shareholders with a 08% dividend yield and $075 quarterly payout Heavy AI investments are expected to pay off with diverse products integral to daily life Steady 2023 net income growth is anticipated to continue Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard and its robust liquidity position coupled with strong leadership set the stage for future success Thus I’m remaining bullish on MSFT stock for a number of reasons Two reasons include the company’s entry into quantum computing and its robust ecosystem of software and hardware applications And the third reason is its investment in OpenAI which makes this stock worth owning for the long-term Indeed for those who believe this AI rally can continue MSFT stock is one to hold right now On the date of publication Chris MacDonald has a LONG position in META The

They can easily shut it down and move on to something else” Moving from on-premises to Microsoft Azure slashed the Microsoft SAP budget by 20 percent to 25 percent cost savings that came from fine-tuning usage snoozing systems at night and on weekends and by leaving behind old processes that weren’t needed anymore “We’re 100 percent in the cloud and since Azure is the trusted cloud provider our entire SAP landscape is now more secure than ever” says Karamfilov explaining that the employees who manage the company’s SAP in many instances were given new tools to work with “The shift to the cloud enabled us to start using machine learning and artificial intelligence to look at the data underneath our entire landscape and to start learning from that” Reutter answers questions about the company’s SAP on Microsoft Azure migration and lessons learned along the way At the time the move to the cloud represented how committed Microsoft was and still is to its partnership with SAP Karamfilov says Officially and publicly SAP has adopted a “multi-cloud strategy” where it supports all hyperscale cloud providers to enable customers to use their preferred cloud Also at the time SAP announced it had selected Microsoft Azure to run many of its internal mission-critical SAP business systems (since then SAP has moved a lot of those internal systems to the cloud on Microsoft Azure) [Learn how Microsoft uses telemetry and monitoring on its SAP on Microsoft Azure workload Here’s how Microsoft is examining SAP transactions with Microsoft Azure Anomaly Detector Find out how Microsoft is optimizing SAP for Microsoft Azure] Making the move to Azure Looking back at how Microsoft moved its SAP workload to the cloud the Microsoft SAP team had been thinking about making the move since 2013 but it was only in 2017 that Azure added virtual machine SKUs big enough to handle a Microsoft-sized SAP ERP system says Hans Reutter the Microsoft Digital engineering manager who led the cloud migration “It wasn’t just the size it was the complexity” Reutter says giving the example of several independent enterprise-scale purchasing processes needing to come together seamlessly at the point of purchase so the customer has a good buying experience “All of these production landscapes were highly dependent on each other because of the traffic that flows back and forth between them” We started with the low-risk stuff—the low-hanging fruit First we moved the sandbox systems because we knew that there wouldn’t be any impact on our customers if something went wrong —Hans Reutter group engineering manager Microsoft Digital Microsoft Azure developed the M-Series specifically to address the enterprise market demand for larger virtual machines capable of running SAP landscapes at companies just like Microsoft “We just happened to be one of the enterprises waiting for the M-Series” Reutter says “It was exactly what we needed to make our move to the cloud” With Azure’s M64 and M128 SKUs in hand Reutter’s team migrated the company’s largest and most complex SAP systems to Azure over one weekend (the team used smaller virtual machines to move most of the Microsoft landscape over the prior year) To understand how they did it Reutter says think horizontally and vertically “We started with the low-risk stuff—the low-hanging fruit” Reutter says “First we moved the sandbox systems because we knew that there wouldn’t be any impact on our customers if something went wrong” That was the base layer Next came the next least important layer and the next and the next The team worked up layer by layer until it eventually got to the most important production systems That was the horizontal approach “If we missed anything we found out really quickly—before we got to the really important systems” Reutter says The team wrote migration scripts found landmines and worked out kinks while working in the base layers which allowed it to get everything down pat by the time things got serious Now to the vertical The team also used an end-to-end vertical strategy migrating a few systems—from development all the way to production—all at once “We tested the whole stack to make sure there were no gaps or surprises” Reutter says “This vertical strategy allowed the team to accelerate learning and getting a jump on production processes” By getting it right in both dimensions they were able to migrate the mission critical systems seamlessly “It’s one thing to move some small stuff” Reutter says “You want to make sure the crown jewels land in a safe spot” And while the migration wasn’t without bumps it went smoothly and the crown jewels were kept safe Getting it right at home Juergen Thomas hears it all the time If a customer is considering moving his or her SAP systems to Microsoft Azure they always ask the same question The ask? “Does Microsoft run its landscape in Azure?” Thomas a partner architect who manages a team in Microsoft Azure that helps SAP customers move to the cloud was happy when he could start answering with a resounding “yes” and even more importantly that he also then had a good answer to their inevitable second question which is “how did you do it?” It’s proof that the Microsoft Azure platform can carry and sustain such a complex SAP platform on our Azure infrastructure We talk about it in customer briefings and conferences—it is our poster child Running our own backend business processes with SAP in Azure is a main differentiator between us and our competitors who don’t run SAP at all or not in their own clouds —Juergen Thomas partner architect Microsoft Azure “Then they immediately want to get into the details which is a good thing” Thomas says “It was very important to be able to say that Microsoft is leading again and is ahead of the mass of companies” Thomas says the story of moving the Microsoft ERP systems to the cloud has become a key showcase for the Microsoft Azure team because it shows Microsoft Azure can handle the biggest and most complicated SAP instances “It’s proof that the Microsoft Azure platform can carry and sustain such a complex SAP platform on our Azure infrastructure” he says “We talk about it in customer briefings and conferences—it is our poster child Running our own backend business processes with SAP in Azure is a main differentiator between us and our competitors who don’t run SAP at all or not in their own clouds” If you’re getting ready to move your SAP systems to the cloud here are four quick things to think about to help you get started Tags: Microsoft Azure SAP Mar 22 2024 Dodd Willingham Microsoft is a big company with thousands of teams working in different ways based on the work they do Despite that complexity when our employees go looking for something they expect an internal search portal that will find exactly what they’re looking for instantly—just like when they search on the internet Yet when talking to Mar 21 2024 Lukas Velush Several years into the era of hybrid work most of us are used to appearing in a Brady Bunch-style gallery We click or tap an emoji to ask a question or applaud an achievement and still have to remember to not be “on mute” when it’s our turn to talk Half of workers have gone Mar 20 2024 Joshua Deans Microsoft Digital (MSD) is the organization that powers protects and transforms Microsoft As part of its mission MSD builds and manages the cloud network infrastructure that supports Microsoft products and services MyWorkspace is a browser-based cloud-provisioning tool created by MSD to allow Microsoft employees to rapidly deploy Azure-based infrastructure environments for solution testing and development Mar 20 2024 Lukas Velush If you’re on a sales team you know that there are all kinds of distracting tasks that eat away at your time and get in the way of what you do best—building relationships with and solving problems for customers There’s no doubt that modern salespeople need to rely on too many tools and services to This content has been archived and while it was correct at time of publication it may no longer be accurate or reflect the current situation at Microsoft Editor’s note: This story has been updated with new details and updated terminology A new SAP on Microsoft Azure video also has been added below Microsoft expected that Read more This content has been archived and while it was correct at time of publication it may no longer be accurate or reflect the current situation at Microsoft It’s now much easier for Microsoft to extract important SAP telemetry insights from its business operations data Microsoft relies on SAP to handle a multitude of business processes Read more Microsoft has implemented auto-scaling SAP on Microsoft Azure to help its SAP workloads run more efficiently Why?

622,"EU checking if Microsoft’s OpenAI investment falls under merger rules","1/9/2024","https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/09/openai-microsoft-eu-merger-rules/","The European Union is checking whether Microsoft’s investment in generative AI giant OpenAI is reviewable under the bloc’s merger regulations it said today The development comes in the wake of the turmoil at OpenAI in late November when the then board voted to oust founder and CEO Sam Altman — a shock move that triggered an aggressive counter maneuver by OpenAI investor Microsoft which stepped in to say it was hiring Altman The tech giant also extended an offer to any other OpenAI staffers who wanted to jump ship during the leadership upheaval The episode ended with the return of Altman to lead OpenAI and a new board being appointed — a configuration that saw the departure of number of members who had voted to remove him Notably Microsoft also gained representation on the board for the first time in the form of a non-voting board observer The development along with the tech giant’s ongoing stake in OpenAI — where Microsoft is a major investor owning 49% of the for-profit OpenAI entity that a nonprofit to which the board belongs controls — appears to have stirred competition regulators’ interest in the arrangement Last month the UK’s competition authority launched an inquiry to decide whether the pair of tech giants are in a “relevant merger situation” Its invitation to comment closed on January 3 — but the scrutiny procedure remains ongoing Germany’s Federal Cartel Office (FCO) meanwhile has also looked at the connection between the pair Last fall just a couple of weeks before Altman’s shock ouster/swift return the FCO concluded the “cooperation” between OpenAI and Microsoft was not “currently” subject to merger control But it also warned then: “If Microsoft were to increase its influence on OpenAI in the future it would have to be re-examined whether a notification obligation exists under competition law” The Commission’s announcement today that it’s putting an eye on the arrangement coincides with it making two calls for contributions on competition — one focused on generative AI the other on virtual worlds — so it’s looking to build up its knowledge of the goings-on in these cutting-edge markets The EU said it’s inviting views from interested stakeholders “on the level of competition in the context of virtual worlds and generative AI and their insights on how competition law can help ensure that these new markets remain competitive” The deadline for contributions is March 11 “The European Commission will carefully review all input received through the calls for contributions Following that review the Commission may organise a workshop in the second quarter of 2024 to bring together all different perspectives emerging from the contributions and continue this reflection” it wrote The Commission also said it’s “looking into some of the agreements that have been concluded between large digital market players and generative AI developers and providers” saying it’s “investigating the impact of these partnerships on market dynamics” “Finally the European Commission is checking whether Microsoft’s investment in OpenAI might be reviewable under the EU Merger Regulation” it added Commenting in a statement EU competition chief Margrethe Vestager said: Virtual worlds and generative AI are rapidly developing It is fundamental that these new markets stay competitive and that nothing stands in the way of businesses growing and providing the best and most innovative products to consumers We are inviting businesses and experts to tell us about any competition issues that they may perceive in these industries whilst also closely monitoring AI partnerships to ensure they do not unduly distort market dynamics A spokesperson for the Commission declined to confirm which “large digital players” have been sent requests for information regarding the generative AI market They also told us there are no “particular concerns” the EU has identified yet vis-à-vis competition and generative AI as yet “It is essential for us to gather information and develop a thorough understanding of these markets as soon as possible There are no particular concerns identified for the moment we will need to analyse the input received” they noted Per the spokesperson a transaction would be notifiable to the Commission under the EU Merger Regulation if it involves ” a change of control on a lasting basis” Were that to happen the Commission would be empowered to examine whether the notified transaction negatively impacts competition — with the ability to impose far-reaching remedies to tackle any problems they identify Even potentially ordering a tie-up to be undone (as happened for instance in the case of the UK’s CMA and Facebook-Giphy back in 2021) — although it’s fair to say the EU’s competition unit under Vestager has historically been reluctant to block tech tie-ups outright preferring behavioral remedies to address concerns “While this transaction has not been formally notified the Commission has been following very closely the situation of control over OpenAI including Microsoft’s role on the OpenAI board and the investment agreements between Microsoft and OpenAI” the Commission spokesperson added — declining to speculate on any possible next steps Microsoft and OpenAI were contacted for a response to the EU’s announcement Update: A Microsoft spokesperson sent this statement via email: Since 2019 we’ve forged a partnership with OpenAI that has fostered more AI innovation and competition while preserving independence for both companies The only thing that has changed recently is that Microsoft will now have a non-voting observer on OpenAI’s Board While the bloc recently rebooted its approach to digital competition with an ex ante reform called the Digital Markets Act (DMA) that’s targeted at so-called internet gatekeepers the flagship new regulation risks looking outdated before the compliance deadline has even kicked in for the six tech giants it applies to This is because the DMA’s list of gatekeeper “dos and don’ts” is drawn from the EU’s past experience with Big Tech competition cases — lending the whole approach a rigid retrospective feel And while Microsoft has been designated a gatekeeper under the DMA for its Windows OS (aka its “core platform service”) not for its cloud infrastructure it’s the latter that the tech giant is leveraging to gain a strategic competitive edge in the fast unfolding generative AI market via its cozy partnership with OpenAI It’s not clear whether the DMA which gatekeepers are expected to be in compliance with by early March can do much to rein in the power of hyperscalers like Microsoft to use their vast muscle in cloud infrastructure to own the keys to dominance in the generative AI era However traditional merger regulations could prove a powerful regulatory check on tech giant overreach here — assuming competition authorities are able to use them That said carefully structured deals and cooperations between tech giants and AI startups are likely to have been designed to avoid this lever being pulled and it remains to be seen whether the EU will deem it has powers under merger laws to step in and scrutinize the detail of the commercial love-in between Microsoft and OpenAI As noted above the FCO previously found national merger rules did not apply Though the German authority made a point of noting that any deepening of the relationship between the pair would merit a review of its decision not to act (And well a lot has gone down at OpenAI since the FCO’s assessment last year) Digital rights and pro-competition groups are among those pushing for competition regulators not to sit on their hands this time In a submission to the UK’s competition authority made public today — which urges the regulator to investigate Microsoft’s investment in the AI giant — the Irish Council for Civil Liberties the Open Markets Institute Foxglove Balanced Economy Project Rebalance Now Article 19 and the Mozilla Foundation warn: “Weak antitrust enforcement has helped create a world in which a handful of dominant technology firms control most of the world’s digital technologies and markets — the bedrock of the modern economy These gatekeepers are now leveraging their unparalleled access to computing infrastructure data and expertise to shape the development and commercialisation of AI — including driving the narrative that ever-larger models and ever-greater scale are inevitable” “In a fairer and more open digital economy AI development would be pluralistic decentralised competitive and more responsive to the needs of consumers businesses governments and citizens Firms such as OpenAI or Anthropic might in time have threatened giants like Amazon Google and Microsoft Unfortunately this is not the path we are on” they also write arguing: “Only by acting early and aggressively against anti-competitive behaviour in AI can regulators prevent this oligopolistic control from being extended further” Microsoft and OpenAI tie-up faces ‘relevant merger’ scrutiny by UK regulator CMA Don’t expect competition authorities to wade into the Microsoft-OpenAI power-play — yet"

12 stocks to buy in 10 different sectors for the next 3 months If you want to skip our introduction to how spreading a portfolio across several sectors might help long term performance according to financial literature then you can take a look at the Top 5 Stocks To Buy In 10 Different Sectors for the Next 3 Months The spread of technology and the broad use of the Internet by people belonging to all walks of life has significantly increased the exposure that people have to information This is true for politics sports and finance - as both those who work in these industries and others whose well being is tied to their performance are able to stay abreast with the latest developments Social media stocks such as Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and private companies like Elon Musks well known X (formerly called Twitter) enable a connected world and a much well informed global populace For instance if youre interested to learn from those who spend the better part of their day dabbling in all things finance then you can always consult Twitter Diverse viewpoints are important when it comes to risking money on stocks and another common way of hedging an investment portfolios risk is through diversification as well In finance theory diversification reduces the variance that a broader portfolios returns might face In other words it reduces the wild downswings that might significantly reduce principal value in case of an untoward event in one industry providing investors with peace of mind and better chances of optimal cardiovascular performance Additionally the sheer plethora of information available to investors through the Internet and traditional media also allows them to rapidly tailor and trim their investments in response to news For instance it takes mere seconds for all major stock indexes such as the NASDAQ the S&P 500 and the NYSE to fall when the Federal Reserve surprises investors by beefing up interest rates or rise when macroeconomic and political stability is assured When it comes to investing in stocks that belong to different sectors a well-informed investor is easily able to keep up to date with the performance of sectors that are completely different from each other such as high technology biotechnology stocks and good old oil crude oil exploration and production stocks Even if we were to ignore complex mathematical complications of standard deviation and other variables that professionals rely on when investing in stocks in different sectors doing so also seems to make sense on an intuitive scale For instance lets consider two different sectors and recent stock market events to see how this might work After Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022 and the Federal Reserve started to increase interest rates in response to record inflation levels the bifurcation of the stock market into different sectors became clear Weve briefly mentioned one of these ie oil and energy above and the second sector is technology After the Russian invasion and the official settling in of the Federal Reserves latest interest rate hiking cycle oil stocks soared as investors correctly realized that they would benefit from a shakeup in the global oil industry At the same time tight macroeconomic conditions created by high interest rates and high inflation meant that big ticket technology and high growth stocks such as Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) posted double or even triple digit percentage losses on the stock market For the investor who was prudent enough to have invested in different sectors at the start of 2022 the juicy returns and dividends offered by oil stocks would have helped ease or even reverse the pain that technology stocks experienced in 2022 With these details in mind lets take a look at some top stocks in different sectors The notable picks are Amazoncom Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META)

productivity for our own people But every minute of productivity they get they’re using to enable our clients” Sweet’s big push has already paid off “The first users told us they saved at least 30 minutes a day and sometimes up to three hours” she says And while some companies might just dip a toe in the water with a small pilot program Accenture dove straight in “We didn’t start with our most junior people  ” she says “We started with our most senior leaders in the first cohort including me Now that’s sometimes counterintuitive But the real power of AI is reinvention and in order to reinvent you have to have leaders who understand the power of it themselves” Florian Häse Research Scientist Bayer What Bayer Does: Best known as the creator of aspirin today it’s one of the largest companies in the world with core competencies in the life science fields of healthcare and nutritionHäse’s Role: Working in the company’s Computational Life Science department Häse combs through reams of research to support the search for that one molecule that could lead to a new crop protection product to enable plants to thrive and boost yieldsHis Experience With Copilot: Bayer Crop Science is focused on finding new ways for farmers to produce more food for the growing world population To do that Häse has been using Microsoft Copilot to help pick through research data the company has gathered over the years and even decades “Not only does it assist me in finding that information but it also shows how to extract that information from unstructured data sources whether they’re reports or slide decks” he says Copilot also helps him keep up with the latest research which is essential in a fast-moving field “It can be quite a challenge to figure out who knows what at which point in time and getting that contact you need to solve the task at hand” he says Before Copilot he used to spend days and weeks finding that information “The process has certainly sped up” he says “Now you don’t miss out on opportunities to connect with the colleagues you should be talking to” James Thomas Global Head of Technology Dentsu Creative What dentsu Does: Global ad agency dentsu connects brand content commerce and experience for some of the world’s largest brands including Kraft Heinz Netflix and T-Mobile Thomas’ Role: Thomas is focused on growing dentsu’s Global AI Centre of Excellence (CoE) to help the company harness technology to create innovative award-winning content for clients His work used to involve getting input from clients researching brainstorming and “maybe days weeks even months later we’d come back with creative illustrations of the client’s ideas” His Experience With Copilot: He says that the process of transforming ideas into images has been reduced from weeks and months to minutes “We can be ideating we can have someone in the corner prompting and by the end of that session we’ve already got visuals” Thomas says Those visuals lead to quicker more effective communication with clients—a critical step to keeping clients excited and ensuring that the best new ideas prevail “The more creative the idea the harder it is to translate” he says “Being able to visualize a lot of these ideas really helps you know if you’re going down the wrong route or the right one It really gets us where we need to go a lot faster” Vicki Holman Collaboration Platform Owner Hargreaves Lansdown What Hargreaves Lansdown Does: The UK-based financial services powerhouse helps 16 million customers save invest and retireHolman’s Role: She’s the point person helping Hargreaves Lansdown with its cloud transformation and ensuring that teams get the most from it Her Experience With Copilot: Early users have been discovering new ways to cut hours of drudgery out of their workweeks from generating first drafts of a PowerPoint presentation by pulling material from an existing Word doc to crafting smarter clearer emails when the words just won’t come “The average respondents are saving two to three hours a week” Holman says “And 90 percent of them felt they would save even more time over the coming months as the product matures and they get a better understanding of how to use it” One of the unexpected advantages of Copilot Holman says is the positive impact it’s had on the company’s neurodivergent workers “I hadn’t anticipated it but the impact we’ve seen on people who have workplace accessibility needs has been incredible” she says Workers who can’t maintain focus through hour-long meetings she says can record meetings and listen to them later or get summaries of what they’ve missed “There’s the reduction of stress making it more enjoyable to be at work when you’re not struggling to do your tasks and find the information you need”

Your dreams entrepreneurial or otherwise will come true and youll become the happiest you imaginable It was all quite persuasive and placed AI at the very heart of the companys future Google too showed an exceptionally touching example of AI overtly improving someones life Here the company revealed how with the new AI-powered Pixel 8 those with blindness or low vision can now frame photographs beautifully as the phones AI assistant guides them to the optimum framing The feature is quite clearly labeled as Guided Frame with Google AI In both these cases the message was similar: AI isnt to be feared Its something that truly improves lives Yet as my eyes became increasingly squinty during the game I began to notice that not every company wanted to crow overtly about AI and its heady future Cybersecurity company Crowdstrike for example Perhaps you still recall -- though I wouldnt blame you if you didnt -- the Crowdstrike ad that featured an old wild western saloon in a little old wild western town Some oddly cyberpunkish characters ride into town -- but not on futuristic Trojan horses These are the so-called adversaries leaders of the Cyberattack community A lone young woman is prepared to fight them off Not with a gun but with a little bit of Crowdstrike software But listen to the sell from the voiceover: Protecting your business from cyberattacks can be unrelenting Todays adversaries move fast Crowdstrike moves faster As the cyberpunkists are routed -- the voiceover continues: Crowdstrike We stop breaches Notice the missing word? Well youll find it if or when you get to Crowdstrikes website: The worlds leading AI-native cybersecurity platform Its interesting then that Crowdstrike didnt feel moved to insert the AI-native element into its ad Also: The 3 biggest risks from generative AI - and how to deal with them Could it be that some companies are still concerned that the overt mention of AI may be offputting for some? Why a recent Pew study offered this headline: Growing public concern about the role of artificial intelligence in daily life And then there was Etsy This certainly wasnt the first brand Id associate with Super Bowl advertising Or indeed any advertising I rather thought of it as the very nice place to go where real people make real things for other real people to buy Also: This is why AI-powered misinformation is the top global risk Yet here it was in the big game with a curious concoction It too chose a historical scenario to sell a modern problem In this case the American people have just received the Statue of Liberty from France What can we gift the French in return? Why they have everything dont they? Well everything worth eating drinking and enjoying (Oh except perhaps baseball) A wise American warrior suggests the president could use Etsys new Gift Mode This requires you to prompt the Mode as to what sort of gift you seek The president therefore wonders what the French actually like and then the whole thing takes a peculiar turn when a young servant suggests Cheese So it is that the president uses this fine new Etsy tool to purchase a cheeseboard for the French Youll likely whisper that a cheeseboard is a fairly mundane offering in return for Americas quintessential statue I though will likely whisper that this Gift Mode -- apparently -- uses AI and human input to make suggestions Also: Generative AI in commerce: 5 ways industries are changing how they do business No mention of AI in the ad however Wouldnt one be a touch more fascinated by what an AI-powered suggestion tool might come up with? But no Etsy chooses merely to say Gift Easy with Gift Mode Perhaps youll tell me Im splitting hairs Perhaps Ill tell you Im bald But it remains interesting -- to me at least -- which brands will use the promise of AI to overtly sell their AI-powered items and which will choose to downplay that little detail focusing simply on the consumer benefit Or will there come a moment when if a product or service isnt in some way powered by AI it simply isnt any good?"

Anything’s possible in 2024 In January Bing only controlled 343% of the search-engine market while Google controlled 9146% Different people will take away different conclusions from this What we take away is that Microsoft has plenty of room to expand in the search-engine market Google is the king for now Yet Microsoft easily beats Alphabet in the area of AI technology advancement Just consider how much more successful OpenAI’s ChatGPT has been compared to Alphabet’s Bard chatbot There’s really no comparison there so Microsoft could actually pose a major threat to Alphabet and steal some of Google’s search-engine market share Microsoft isn’t the search-engine king – at least not yet We’ve pounded the table for Microsoft stock before and we’re still confident that the company can provide value as an AI-technology innovator So why wager your hard-earned money on second-rate tech companies?

646,"Satya Nadellas Decade at Microsoft: A Transformational Leadership","2/4/2024","https://www.cryptopolitan.com/satya-nadella-leadership-decade-at-microsoft/","Satya Nadella who took the reins as Microsoft’s CEO in February 2014 is celebrating his 10th anniversary in the role Under his leadership Microsoft has undergone a remarkable transformation emerging as the world’s most valuable public company with a market capitalization of $306 trillion surpassing even tech giant Apple Nadella’s tenure has been characterized by significant advancements in cloud computing and strategic acquisitions However as he looks ahead several challenges and opportunities await the tech visionary When Satya Nadella assumed the role of CEO Microsoft was facing a period of stagnation and mediocrity Its market capitalization stood at just over $300 billion and the company was struggling to keep pace with its competitors Under Steve Ballmer’s leadership Microsoft had fallen behind in key areas such as web search mobile and social media Nadella’s arrival marked a turning point for Microsoft Over the past decade he has not only rejuvenated the company but also led it to unparalleled success Microsoft’s market valuation has grown tenfold positioning it as the world’s most valuable public company Nadella’s strategic focus on cloud computing and artificial intelligence has solidified Microsoft’s position as a leader in these critical domains Across the tech industry Satya Nadella is widely lauded for his transformative leadership Many industry analysts and investors regard him as one of the greatest tech CEOs of all time His ability to reshape Microsoft’s trajectory and reverse the decline during the Ballmer era has earned him accolades and recognition as a visionary leader As Nadella looks forward to the next phase of his leadership several challenges and opportunities loom on the horizon: While Microsoft remains a dominant force in the business world the company must adapt to the preferences of younger generations who may not have grown up using Microsoft products Preparing for the era when Gen Z holds IT budgets is crucial and investments in products like OpenAI’s ChatGPT may be a step in the right direction Microsoft has a longstanding issue of retaining top talent Some employees have left for higher compensation at rival tech companies only to return after negotiating better packages With a substantial cash reserve of $81 billion Microsoft may need to utilize more of its resources to retain its top-tier talent Critics argue that Microsoft often struggles with new product categories typically requiring several iterations to get it right The company faces fierce competition in areas like tablets where the iPad remains a top choice Innovating and staying ahead in emerging markets is a challenge that Nadella must address Like other tech giants Microsoft faces increasing regulatory scrutiny Antitrust officials have recently blocked acquisitions at Adobe and Amazon and Microsoft’s push into AI has drawn inquiries in Europe Navigating regulatory challenges while continuing to expand is a balancing act Nadella must master Microsoft’s strategic partnership with OpenAI a leader in artificial intelligence is not without its complexities The two companies sometimes compete for AI services sales leading to internal tensions Managing this delicate partnership while maximizing its benefits will require careful attention Nadella’s ability to identify the next major growth driver for Microsoft will be critical While AI has been a focus the company must continue to explore new avenues for revenue and profit generation ensuring sustained growth in the ever-evolving tech landscape Satya Nadella’s legacy at Microsoft is already one of transformation and achievement However the challenges he faces in maintaining and furthering the company’s success are substantial As he enters the next phase of his leadership the tech industry will closely watch how he navigates these hurdles and continues to shape Microsoft’s future Satya Nadella took over as Microsoft’s CEO during a period of stagnation but his visionary leadership has transformed the company into the world’s most valuable public company with a market capitalization of $306 trillion Nadella’s transformative leadership at Microsoft has earned him recognition as one of the greatest tech CEOs of all time His ability to reshape the company’s trajectory and reverse its decline under Steve Ballmer is widely celebrated As Nadella enters his second decade as CEO

Lets find out Unlike the Nasdaq-100 index the Dow is filled with companies many might consider boring like IBM Coca-Cola Intel and Walgreens Boots Alliance In fact the Dow has significantly underperformed its peers (the Nasdaq-100 and S&P 500) for some time due to the exclusion of some of the biggest tech companies ^SPXTR data by YCharts Microsoft has been a member of the Dow Jones since 1999 but its strong performance has only come recently Microsofts stock was essentially flat from its inclusion in 1999 to the start of 2015 MSFT data by YCharts However if you bought the stock at the start of 2015 youre up over 700% (an eight-bagger) This success came from Microsoft naming Satya Nadella CEO in February 2014 when he initiated Microsofts focus on cloud computing This helped Microsoft substantially grow and its cloud computing division Microsoft Azure continues to be one of the best reasons to invest in the stock today However Microsoft is also considered a strong AI investment Microsoft is rolling out its Copilot product which gives users a generative AI program to assist them with daily tasks This can be used to write emails create complicated formulas in Excel or provide programmers with the code they need in GitHub This relatively new product could be a massive revenue growth driver if it catches on With a $30 per user per month price tag it isnt cheap But if it can make employees more efficient it may be a bargain add-on Regardless few companies in the Dow can say they are more innovative than Microsoft But is the stock a buy? Microsofts business has been executing at a high level for a while and the future also looks strong As a result the stock has garnered a hefty premium MSFT PE Ratio data by YCharts If you discount a period in 2018 when earnings were artificially inflated Microsofts stock has not traded at these levels in recent history Thats some cause for concern as 35 times forward earnings is quite expensive Although Microsoft grew revenue a respectable 13% in Q1 of FY 2024 (ending Sept 30 2023) that growth isnt associated with trading in the mid-30s price-to-earnings ratio range There is a lot of froth in the market caused by AI expectations and investor enthusiasm about whether the Federal Reserve can pull off a soft landing Thats whats driving these high stock prices and it could spell trouble for some if the results arent as expected As a result I dont think Microsoft is a top stock to buy in the Dow Some businesses are growing faster (or as fast) and trading at a much cheaper valuation than Microsoft (like Visa and American Express) making them more attractive than Microsoft Microsoft isnt a bad business; the stock is just very expensive for its current business state Where to invest $1000 right now When our analyst team has a stock tip it can pay to listen After all the newsletter they have run for two decades Motley Fool Stock Advisor has more than tripled the market* They just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now and Microsoft made the list -- but there are 9 other stocks you may be overlooking See the 10 stocks *Stock Advisor returns as of January 8 2024 American Express is an advertising partner of The Ascent a Motley Fool company Keithen Drury has positions in Visa The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Apple Microsoft and Visa The Motley Fool recommends Intel and International Business Machines and recommends the following options: long January 2023 $5750 calls on Intel long January 2024 $4750 calls on Coca-Cola long January 2025 $45 calls on Intel and short February 2024 $47 calls on Intel The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy Paid Post: Content produced by Motley Fool The Globe and Mail was not involved and material was not reviewed prior to publication All market data (will open in new tab) is provided by Barchart Solutions Copyright © 2024 Information is provided as is and solely for informational purposes not for trading purposes or advice For exchange delays and terms of use please read disclaimer (will open in new tab) © Copyright 2024 The Globe and Mail Inc All rights reserved Andrew Saunders President and CEO"

To earn $500 per month or $6000 annually from dividends alone you would need an investment of approximately $778940 or around 2000 shares For a more modest $100 per month or $1200 per year you would need $155788 or around 400 shares Read This: Top 4 Tech And Telecom Stocks That May Crash In January To calculate: Divide the desired annual income ($6000 or $1200) by the dividend ($300 in this case) So $6000 / $300 = 2000 ($500 per month) and $1200 / $300 = 400 shares ($100 per month) Note that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time How that works: The dividend yield is computed by dividing the annual dividend payment by the stocks current price For example if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and is currently priced at $50 the dividend yield would be 4% ($2/$50) However if the stock price increases to $60 the dividend yield drops to 333% ($2/$60) Conversely if the stock price falls to $40 the dividend yield rises to 5% ($2/$40) Similarly changes in the dividend payment can impact the yield If a company increases its dividend the yield will also increase provided the stock price stays the same Conversely if the dividend payment decreases so will the yield MSFT Price Action: Shares of Microsoft fell 02% to close at $38947 on Wednesday Read More: Real estate crowdfunders are cropping up quickly but one Jeff Bezos-backed platform is pulling ahead Read the full story to discover how you can invest in its offerings with just $100 Photo: Shutterstock © 2024 Benzingacom Benzinga does not provide investment advice All rights reserved Trade confidently with insights and alerts from analyst ratings free reports and breaking news that affects the stocks you care about"
662,"Microsoft: Is AI Growth Priced In? (NASDAQ:MSFT)","1/19/2024","https://seekingalpha.com/article/4663853-microsoft-is-ai-growth-priced-in","Chris Hondros Chris Hondros Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) started life as a technology leader It has grown its revenues by developing technologies in-house through investments in research and development and by the acquisition of other innovative companies Over the last 10 years Microsoft has invested almost $172 billion in research and development (13% of revenues) and $75 billion in acquisitions (almost 6% of revenues) Microsoft apparently believes that the next generation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) will reshape every software category and every business This is potentially a fundamental technology shift Over the years the technology sector has undergone a series of step-change transitions such as from PC / Server to Web / Internet and to Cloud / Mobile Generative AI has the potential to fundamentally transform productivity for every individual organization and industry There are suggestions that Microsoft was slow to embrace the changes that took place in historical technology sector transitions - the step changes that took place in search and in mobile Current management has indicated it wants to be at the front of the AI technology transition and as a result the company appears to be going all out to ensure that it becomes a Generative AI leader Microsoft has identified 3 priorities: Microsoft has used its financial size to drive its technology leadership and this is demonstrated by the following chart which shows the historical level of annual investment that the company has made to support its strategy: Authors compilation using data from Microsofts 10-K filings Authors compilation using data from Microsofts 10-K filings The key to Microsoft’s AI strategy is its investment in OpenAI Open AIs founders formed the company in 2015 as a not for profit AI research company As the company expanded its research initiatives it required more capital than many of its founders were willing to provide In FY2019 Microsoft made its initial investment of $1 Billion in OpenAI OpenAI is not a public company and therefore it is not obligated to make any public disclosures about any changes in its shareholders holdings There have been media reports that Microsoft made a further investment in April FY2023 and that its total investment may now be about $13 Billion It is rumored that this investment gave Microsoft a 49% shareholding in OpenAI but it is not entitled to board representation According to OpenAIs web site it has recently changed its corporate status from a not-for-profit company to a “capped-profit” model where shareholders have agreed to a defined exit multiple for their investments Microsoft claims that its OpenAI investment benefits are: Microsoft discloses very little about its OpenAI investment in its 10-K filings There is no disclosed balance sheet entry for the investment and there are no cash flow entries showing annual payments (additional capital) to OpenAI I am surprised that more questions are not asked by the investment community particularly in order to better understand whether the OpenAI investment is material to Microsofts valuation Microsofts CEO Satya Nadella many years ago defined Microsoft as a technology company aiming to build the best-in-class platforms and productivity services for a mobile-first cloud-first world The current divisional structure reflects that ambition and has been in place since FY2016 (with financials going back to FY2014): This division comprises a broad portfolio of productivity communication and information services that span devices and platforms The cornerstone product suites of this division are Office 365 Microsoft 365 LinkedIn and Dynamics The division’s historical revenues and reported operating margins are: Authors compilation using data from Microsofts 10-K filings Authors compilation using data from Microsofts 10-K filings The vast bulk of the division’s revenues come from subscriptions The chart shows that the division is exhibiting very steady revenue growth and was not impacted by the COVID pandemic The trailing 12-month (TTM) growth rate peaked during Q3 FY2022 and had been declining until recently The TTM growth rate appears now to be steady at around 10% This division predominantly comprises server products and cloud services such as Azure SQL server Windows server enterprise services and some of the recent acquisitions Nuance and GitHub The division’s historical revenues and reported operating margins are: Authors compilation using data from Microsofts 10-K filings Authors compilation using data from Microsofts 10-K filings This division will be Microsoft’s future growth engine The division’s 5-year revenue compound annual growth rate (CAGR) at the end of Q1 FY2024 was 22% but it should be noted that the current TTM growth rate is 17% The division’s TTM growth rate peaked at the end of Q3 FY2022 and has been declining each quarter ever since At the end of FY2022 the size of the cloud infrastructure services market has been estimated by industry consulting company GlobeNewsWire to be $113 billion They estimate that this market will grow at 18% per year for the next 10 years Statista estimates that at the end of FY2022 Microsoft’s market share in the cloud infrastructure market was 23% with the market leader being Amazon AWS with 32% This division predominantly comprises revenues from Windows’ product subscriptions sales of hardware devices sales of gaming consoles and game subscriptions and the sales of digital advertising and search engines The division’s historical dividends and margins are: Authors compilation using data from Microsofts 10-K filings Authors compilation using data from Microsofts 10-K filings The chart indicates that this is Microsoft’s most volatile division All the product groups in the division are volatile but particularly devices The division’s long-term annual revenue growth rate has been around 4% The following chart shows Microsoft’s reported aggregated sales and adjusted operating margins for the last 10 years: Authors compilation using data from Microsofts 10-K filings Authors compilation using data from Microsofts 10-K filings Readers should be aware that I have made 2 adjustments to Microsoft’s reported Income Statement to better represent its true operating costs and the investments required to support the company’s growth: My adjustments have increased Microsoft’s reported operating margins by approximately 3% (note that the earlier charts showing divisional margins were as reported by Microsoft with no adjustments) Aggregate revenues had been growing strongly for several years and the TTM revenue growth peaked at 20% during Q2 FY2021 More recently revenue growth has been slowly declining and was 8% at the end of Q1 FY2024 Margins have also increased significantly during this period and at Q4 FY2023 margins reached their highest levels at 453% Typical technology sector reported margins are 8% but this reflects the broad range of companies in the sector I estimate that Microsoft’s margins are in the sector’s highest decile The following table summarizes Microsoft’s cash flows for the last 10 years: Authors compilation using data from Microsofts 10-K filings Authors compilation using data from Microsofts 10-K filings This table helps to explain the approach that I have taken to restating Microsoft’s Income Statement Over the last 10 years $208 billion of investments were expended through the Income Statement and $216 billion was spent on “traditional” reinvestment (capex and acquisitions) Microsoft’s level of expensed investment as a percentage of revenues has been reasonably steady for the last 10 years at between 12% to 14% Microsoft is a spectacular generator of free cash flow By my analysis there are very few companies that generate more free cash flow per unit of revenue A high-level summary of Microsoft’s cash flows for the last 10 years is: The dividend has increased every year since FY2004 and based on the current cash flows I see no reason why that trend won’t continue into the foreseeable future The following chart shows the history of Microsoft’s capital structure over the last 10 years: Authors compilation using data from Microsofts 10-K filings Authors compilation using data from Microsofts 10-K filings Microsoft’s debt ratio is currently 3% and the sector’s median ratio is 4% Interestingly since FY2017 Microsoft has been reducing its debt load (which causes its cost of capital to increase) The company appears to have been reluctant to veer from the typical technology sector’s debt ratio even though its cash flows could easily support higher debt levels The following chart shows the history of Microsoft’s return on invested capital over the last 10 years: Authors compilation using data from Microsofts 10-K filings Authors compilation using data from Microsofts 10-K filings Readers should note that my calculated return on invested capital (ROIC) will be lower than that reported because of the adjustments that I made to the Income Statement to account for the expensed investments Microsoft’s ROIC has been reasonably stable and is excellent The technology sector’s ROIC has a wide range of values because of the diversity of the companies within the sector (from profitless start-ups to extremely profitable companies) The sector’s median ROIC is currently 16% At the time of writing this report the FY2024 2nd quarter has finished but Microsoft is not due to publish their updated financial statements for another 2 weeks At the end of Q1 Microsoft’s trailing 12-month (TTM) revenues were $218310 M (75% higher than the prior year) and the TTM operating margin is still rising The current consensus revenue forecast for FY2024 is $243310 M and it is projected that FY2025 revenues will be $277470 M This equates to a 14% annualized growth rate The current macroeconomic signals for the US are mixed The bond market is forecasting significantly lower inflation and lower interest rates for FY2024 In my opinion this appears to be indicating a slowing economy My scenario for Microsoft is: The optimism for Microsoft’s future is associated with its developments in the Generative AI space I believe that Microsoft’s Intelligent Cloud division can comfortably grow revenues at 20% per year for the next 6 years (slightly above the predicted market cadence due to its superior product offering) Similarly I think that the Productivity & Business Processes Division can continue to grow revenues by 15% per year for the next 6 years The subscription revenues are very sticky and unless there is a major long-term slump in employment I see little reason for this division not to be able grow volumes and prices into the future The Personal Computing division is more problematic than the others Revenues will get a near-term boost from the recent Activision acquisition but over the long term I am forecasting divisional revenue growth of 5% per year for the next 6 years Microsoft’s operating margins are already very high relative to its sector competitors I see no reasons why this should change over the forecast period Remember that I use an adjusted operating margin which is up to 3% higher than the reported margin The biggest unknown in this valuation is where the long-term operating margin for the Intelligent Cloud division will finish Management has been cautioning that near-term margins may decline during the product development stage Over the longer term I suspect that margins for this division may remain at their current levels or at best slightly higher as a result of market competition The Productivity & Business Processes division’s margins should continue to increase as the product suite continues to mature and requires less product development I am forecasting that the Personal Computing division’s margins will remain relatively flat over the forecast period Microsoft’s total reinvestment back into its business has doubled over the last 5 years and there appear to be indications that recent levels may need to be maintained for some time into the future to support the product development associated with Generative AI I measure capital efficiency for growing companies as revenue / invested capital Microsoft’s historical ratio was for many years around 15 (every $1 of investment generated $15 in revenues) The sectors global median ratio is 12 (less revenues are generated per unit of investment) Over the last couple of years Microsofts ratio has been trending lower towards the sectors global median and for my scenario I have used the global ratio in order to reflect the higher level of reinvestment required to support the expected growth I have created a very optimistic scenario for Microsoft Readers should be aware that historically Microsoft’s revenues and margins appear to have been reasonably sensitive to the strength of the global economy and particularly the level of unemployment If the global economy slows down and enters a significant recession over the coming months then I would expect that Microsoft’s business would also be impacted Microsoft is entering the next part of the economic cycle with a very strong balance sheet and a debt ratio lower than the sector average For these reasons I estimate that Microsoft’s current cost of capital is around the sector median which due to its low debt levels is probably higher than the typical US-listed company Over the long term I have forecast that Microsoft’s cost of capital will decline to the median level of all US-listed companies as management accepts that a mature company can increase its debt ratio Microsoft’s operating model is clearly superior to its sector competitors as demonstrated by its historically high revenue growth high operating margins and high returns on capital There is strong evidence to suggest that Microsoft has a sustainable competitive advantage which will allow its terminal ROIC to remain above its cost of capital at around 12% The following table summarizes the key inputs into the valuation: Authors valuation model assumptions Authors valuation model assumptions A couple of technical issues to be noted with the valuation inputs: The output from DCF model is in $USD: Authors DCF model outputAuthors DCF model output Authors DCF model output Authors DCF model output I also developed a Monte Carlo simulation for the valuation based on the range of inputs for the valuation The output of the simulation was developed from 100000 iterations: Authors DCF model Monte Carlo simulation output Authors DCF model Monte Carlo simulation output The simulation can help us understand the major sources of sensitivity in the valuation In my scenario the valuation is very sensitive to the expected revenue growth and to a lesser degree the operating margin These two inputs represent the greatest source of risk in the valuation The simulation indicates that at a discount rate of 82% the intrinsic value for Microsoft’s equity per share is between $276 and $472 with an expected value of $361 Based on my scenario Microsoft is currently priced within its fair value range The report has highlighted that Microsoft Corporation appears prepared to make the appropriate financial investments to ensure that it becomes one of the leading companies in the Generative AI market The company’s leadership apparently is committed to not missing out on the technology transition that AI may bring to all aspects of the commercial and social environment This commitment is demonstrated by the quantum of capital being reinvested back into the business My call is that Microsoft is currently a HOLD What are the investment risks going forward? The valuation has highlighted that the major influence on the company’s intrinsic value is the projected revenue growth rate A large component of future growth is the successful uptake of the generative AI developments If the AI market failed to achieve its expected market size or Microsoft failed to maintain its Cloud market share then the stock price could take a sizable hit The other risk which should not be ignored is the impact that a potential global recession may have on the near term for Microsoft’s existing business Microsoft’s almost annuity-like subscription business would be significantly impacted if global corporate employment levels were significantly lowered Microsoft’s shareholders have been extremely well rewarded as shown in the following table: Authors compilation using data from Yahoo Finance Authors compilation using data from Yahoo Finance There is a possibility that long-term holders of the stock may be very overweight Microsoft within their portfolio because of how well the stock has performed The current price action for the company remains reasonably bullish At some point it seems inevitable the current rising trend will break down At that point I recommend that holders: This article was written by Analyst’s Disclosure: I/we have no stock option or similar derivative position in any of the companies mentioned and no plans to initiate any such positions within the next 72 hours I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha) I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Seeking Alphas Disclosure: Past performance is no guarantee of future results No recommendation or advice is being given as to whether any investment is suitable for a particular investor Any views or opinions expressed above may not reflect those of Seeking Alpha as a whole Seeking Alpha is not a licensed securities dealer broker or US investment adviser or investment bank Our analysts are third party authors that include both professional investors and individual investors who may not be licensed or certified by any institute or regulatory body"

Lango’s “2nd Trillion-Dollar AI Trade” The US govt just unlocked an $8 trillion market to move in a new direction See how it could unleash 6000% potential upside Rewards await investors who buy and hold these stalwarts Advertisement Source: Shutterstock Blue-chip stocks act as a portfolio anchor that prevents steep losses And they often pay substantial dividends that can keep returns ticking over amid market volatility These stocks strategically offer an appealing hedge while investors take on more risk elsewhere Also they are often names that bounce back the fastest after recovering from a market downturn In fact these companies can potentially deliver strong gains in their own right Let’s explore three blue-chip stocks capable of outperforming peers as they show impressive financials and wide competitive moats Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is set to shine with several irons in the fire It’s ready to deliver value to shareholders such as through its investments in OpenAI to its development of quantum computers MSFT’s stock’s investment in AI will likely be a continued tailwind for the company A closed ecosystem it offers many lucrative upgrades and add-ons to drive higher margins This has led to the integration of AI features across Microsoft’s product suite including its Azure cloud platform and Office productivity services And the company is rolling out new features using generative AI such as with Copilot in Microsoft 365 Further it will help keep its existing subscription revenue from churning as well as attract new subscribers For valuation MSFT looks attractive as its forward P/E and price-to-sales ratios are all lower than their trailing values In essence this means Wall Street is predicting a rise in its top and bottom lines Thus MSFT is a blue-chip stock to place on your buy list Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is a healthcare giant that’s also a Dividend King Owning JNJ stock can lead to stable income over the long-run Also it serves as a defensive hedge while one makes risky upside bets JNJ appears unfairly undervalued A key reason it may not trade at its fair value is the looming uncertainty around its talc powder litigation Potentially that could erase a substantial amount of cash and value from its balance sheet However I believe that these fears are overblown For example JNJ guided last quarter that the the loss would not exceed $9 billion (maintained on its balance sheet) Additionally the payment can be made over 25 years which contains the risks from the litigation Finally JNJ trades at a steep discount relative to its trailing and forward ratios which could make it a strong performer in 2024 Altria (NYSE:MO) is most known for producing cigarettes but has also pivoted toward vaping and nicotine pouches as the smoking rate continues to decline worldwide Undoubtedly MO faces a difficult transition to a smoke-free business model And its top lines have shown some erosion over the last few quarters via a drop in sales However a company’s share price can become too cheap to ignore especially when paired with highly attractive dividends MO’s dividend yield hovers around the 970% mark and the company produces an enormous amount of free cash flow to support it Additionally MO buys back shares from the market and has a strong buffer to maintain future dividend payments and increases A near 15% drop in revenue or a 10% drop in net income would be required in order for the dividend to be threatened At this time both of those scenarios seem unlikely Altria has strong rebound potential to deliver

665,"Microsofts Bing market share barely budged with ChatGPT add-on","1/21/2024","https://www.straitstimes.com/business/microsoft-s-bing-market-share-barely-budged-with-chatgpt-add-on","When Microsoft announced it was baking ChatGPT into its Bing search engine last February bullish analysts declared the move an “iPhone moment” that could upend the search market and chip away at Google’s dominance “The entire search category is now going through a sea change” chief executive officer Satya Nadella said at the time “That opportunity comes very few times” Almost a year later the sea has yet to change The new Bing – powered by OpenAI’s generative AI technology – dazzled internet users with conversational replies to queries asked in a natural way But Microsoft’s search engine ended 2023 with just 34 per cent of the global search market according to data analytics firm StatCounter up less than 1 percentage point since the ChatGPT announcement Bing has long struggled for relevance and attracted more mockery than recognition over the years as a serious alternative to Google Multiple rebrandings and redesigns since its 2009 debut did little to boost Bing’s popularity A month before Microsoft infused the search engine with generative AI people were spending 33 per cent less time using it than they had 12 months earlier according to SensorTower The ChatGPT reboot at least helped reverse those declines In the second quarter of 2023 US monthly active users more than doubled year over year to 31 million according to a Bloomberg Intelligence analysis of SensorTower mobile app data Overall users were spending 84 per cent more time on the search engine the data show By year-end Bing’s monthly active users had increased steadily to 44 million according to SensorTower To build on the momentum Microsoft has been adding more AI tools to Bing In October the company integrated the latest version of OpenAI’s image-generating model DALL-E 3 Visitors can use it to create realistic-looking images with simple text prompts The offering does nothing to enhance Bing’s search abilities But its addition generated a spike in usage according to Microsoft’s corporate vice president of search and AI Jordi Ribas “We noticed an increase in usage by 10 times and that took us by surprise because if you think about it DALL-E 2 was already quite good” he said in an interview “It really made a difference in the engagement and the users that came to our product” Microsoft’s consumer chief marketing officer Yusuf Mehdi declined to specify how many active users Bing has “Look it’s still early days and new behaviors are being built” he said “We’re still learning new things but have millions and millions of people using the new tools” Even as the Bing team adds crowd-pleasers Google has been racing to develop its own AI tools In May it launched an experimental version of its search engine called the “search generative experience” which delivers conversational responses atop the familiar list of links Dubbed SGE for short it’s still not widely available However Google plans to embed its most powerful large language model Gemini into SGE sometime in 2024 The Alphabet division also retains considerable advantages It has more than 90 per cent of the market and is the default search engine on Apple hardware including iPhones giving Google crucial critical mass The more people who use it the more the search engine knows and the more Google can use that data to deliver and rank results in a way people find useful The retooling of search by both technology giants reflects a shared conviction that generative AI will fundamentally change the way people seek and receive answers online For Microsoft the shift is an opportunity to propel Bing forward But the incremental gains so far make clear that buzzy AI features alone probably won’t transform it into a formidable search player “We are at the gold rush moment when it comes to AI and search” said Professor Shane Greenstein an economist and professor at Harvard Business School who has studied the commercialisation of the internet “At the moment I doubt AI will move the needle because in search you need a flywheel: the more searches you have the better answers are Google is the only firm who has this dynamic well-established” Still he said Bing being the underdog has more latitude to experiment “Google has to be careful not to hurt its brand and product when it comes to testing new AI tools” he said “Bing can afford to take the risk It has nothing to lose” Microsoft is also betting that generative AI will change how advertisers allocate their search spending The current ad model rests on costs-per-click but AI-powered searches are getting consumers to answers faster and more directly without a litany of blue links according to marketing chief Mehdi “We have advertisers telling us they’re getting better outcomes as a result of our AI efforts and are deeply interested in how this works” he said BLOOMBERG Join STs Telegram channel and get the latest breaking news delivered to you Read 3 articles and stand to win rewards Spin the wheel now MCI (P)

Blog","1/22/2024","https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-cloud/blog/2024/01/22/how-carmax-organized-and-scaled-innovation-with-microsoft-ai-solutions/","With the adoption of generative AI spreading across industries it has been fascinating to see how Microsoft customers are applying this groundbreaking technology to tackle their unique business challenges I spoke with Shamim Mohammad Chief Information and Technology Officer at CarMax on the Pivotal podcast about his company’s approach to data and AI CarMax has applied AI to improve the experience for both customers and employees For instance it is using machine learning to provide the best images reviews and details for each car It has built patented technologies to optimize that process including a recommendation engine that can understand what the customer is trying to do and offer targeted car content When customers look at a car AI also helps aggregate information about the car from multiple data sets and turns it into easily digestible summaries for the shopper ChatGPT working in the background to draft these summaries frees time for CarMax’s employees to work on higher-value projects CarMax was one of the early adopters of Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service and its success in scaling AI has a lot to do with how it organized itself to drive innovation across the company Here are some highlights from my conversation with Shamim Microsoft is empowering the world to achieve more with AI CarMax has set itself up like a digital startup creating dozens of small cross-functional innovation teams Each team is focused on tackling a defined set of business challenges and resourced with engineering marketing and operations talent They are encouraged to move fast to build and test their solutions AI transformation Every few weeks these teams present their progress and results at a product showcase CarMax senior leaders watch these presentations provide feedback and decide which projects to scale When a good idea is proved effective teams are empowered to move their solutions to production with minimal bureaucracy This allows them to quickly iterate and scale When our teams have a good idea they can optimize and scale it on their own and then they present their progress on a biweekly basis and we make a joint determination how and if to proceed further as a team That’s how the teams work today at CarMax which is amazing I feel like I have this massively large company but it’s still working like a startup This cross-functional team structure would not have been possible without close leadership alignment When Shamim first became Chief Information Officer he partnered closely with the Chief Operating Officer and Chief Marketing Officer to organize these teams so that they could become digital-first That collaboration has thrived to this day CarMax has created a strong model for AI governance to support its innovation It set up an AI Center of Excellence that includes top technical leaders as well as leaders from legal operations finance and marketing foundations for AI success This center’s chief role is to ensure that any innovation with AI remains consistent with the company’s core values of transparency and integrity It focuses on educating CarMax teams about the power and risks of AI provides guidelines on how to use AI responsibly and offers tools to help teams evaluate their ideas and projects The work of the AI Center of Excellence has created a culture of responsible innovation within CarMax allowing teams to feel safe to experiment with AI It starts with creating a culture that empowers employees to experiment and learn And that’s supported by a strong data foundation Because if a company is not good with data they cannot be good with AI CarMax knew that the transformation it sought depended heavily on getting its data estate in order Starting five years ago the company invested to build a clean and organized data estate in the cloud That has allowed it to combine the power of AI with its massive trove of car and customer data It started by moving its data to Microsoft Azure It worked to make that data scalable updated and constantly refreshed It also applied strong data governance policies to ensure security and privacy Today that data is available for its teams to use Its early data estate investment has positioned it to drive AI innovation at an incredible pace Our teams have been leveraging our data and AI to create great customer experiences drive competitive differentiation and also make the lives of our associates better CarMax is an exciting example of what an organization can accomplish if it makes some foundational changes to prime itself for AI innovation Pivotal By clearly defining achievable goals providing teams with the environment to experiment and scale and putting strong AI and data governance in place it was able to unleash a wave of AI innovation that completely transformed its business CarMax’s journey offers important lessons for organizations wanting to succeed with AI If you want to hear more about CarMax’s approach tune into the episode on the Pivotal podcast Explore a

here’s what you need to knowThe 23andMe data breach is getting messier by the dayWhy the ‘mother of all breaches’ is a wake up call for everyone This breach comes in the wake of several high-profile attacks by the threat actor group which also goes by the names APT29 and Cozy Bear Most recently Midnight Blizzard conducted a sneak-and-peek reconnaissance attack on Microsoft with the intention of finding out what the firm knew about it As with the attack on HPE corporate emails and company documents were exfiltrated by the group Back in 2019 SolarWinds suffered at the hands of Midnight Blizzard in a hack which had far-reaching consequences on several US governmental bodies including the department of commerce and the treasury Receive our latest news industry updates featured resources and more Sign up today to receive our FREE report on AI cyber crime & security - newly updated for 2023 This isnt HPE’s first run in with Midnight Blizzard either Recent SEC filings state that this current attack is likely related to an earlier attack by the group in June 2023 In a previously undisclosed breach Midnight Blizzard gained unauthorized access to several SharePoint files on the HPE system though HPE determined that it hadn’t materially impacted the company Further to this current attack HPE claims to be cooperating with law enforcement while also assessing its regulatory notification obligations Though the full extent of the attack is unclear HPE seems confident that the incident is not “likely to materially impact the company’s financial condition or results of operations” Just a week after revealing it had fallen prey to Midnight Blizzard Microsoft has now revealed an investigation into the attack shows more victims could be coming In a blog post on January 25 the tech giant concluded it was not the sole target of the group and that it has been “targeting other organizations” operating in the global technology sector While Microsoft did not disclose who appears to have been targeted the company said it has begun notifying those potentially at risk or exposed to the group “Using the information gained from Microsoft’s investigation into Midnight Blizzard Microsoft Threat Intelligence has identified that the same actor has been targeting other organizations and as part of our usual notification processes we have begun notifying these targeted organizations” Microsoft said Discover a data center revitalization strategy that will help you dominate DOWNLOAD NOW It’s important to note that this investigation is still ongoing and we will continue to provide details as appropriate Chis Morgan senior cyber threat intelligence analyst at ReliaQuest said the Microsoft and HPE attacks highlight the significant threats technology companies face from state-backed threat groups many of whom are technically proficient and highly aggressive “The latest incident affecting HPE — which follows a recent intrusion made against Microsoft — serves as a reminder of the significant risk facing technology companies from nation-state aligned threats” he said “The attack which has been attributed to Russian-aligned threat group Cozy Bear (Aka Midnight Blizzard APT29) highlights the ongoing struggle to stay one step ahead of attackers who are agile well resourced and technically sophisticated” George Fitzmaurice is a staff writer at ITPro ChannelPro and CloudPro with a particular interest in AI regulation data legislation and market development After graduating from the University of Oxford with a degree in English Language and Literature he undertook an internship at the New Statesman before starting at ITPro Outside of the office George is both an aspiring musician and an avid reader Top SSE use cases 2023 ThreatLabz state of ransomware report CI/CD comes into focus as enterprises ramp up application modernization efforts By Daniel ToddMarch 21 2024 By George FitzmauriceMarch 21 2024 By Steve RangerMarch 20 2024 By Steve RangerMarch 20 2024 By Daniel ToddMarch 20 2024 By Solomon KlappholzMarch 20 2024 By Solomon KlappholzMarch 20 2024 By Emma WoollacottMarch 20 2024 By George FitzmauriceMarch 20 2024 By Steve RangerMarch 19 2024 By George FitzmauriceMarch 19 2024 Posted Posted Posted Posted IT Pro is part of Future US Inc an international media group and leading digital publisher Visit our corporate site © Future US Inc Full 7th Floor 130 West 42nd Street New York NY 10036"

left) speaks with participants of the WEDC’s Main Street Bounceback program in West Bend in December (Photo courtesy of WEDC) At the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp CEO Missy Hughes looks back on 2023 as a significant year for the state’s business community — at home and on the world stage In a late December interview Hughes rattled off some big hits for the state One is the federal government greenlighting the next phase for an ambitious proposal to establish a biohealth tech hub in Wisconsin Another is a new and promising future for the highly touted perennially doubted Foxconn site in Southeastern Wisconsin Hughes isn’t shy in her enthusiasm for the biohealth tech hub and its focus on “personalized medicine” — tailoring diagnosis and treatment of illness to a patient’s distinctive genetic characteristics “It’s going to transform health care” she declares Doctors treating a patient with a tumor won’t have to throw “the kitchen sink at this tumor” Hughes says Instead they’ll be able “to give the most effective treatment the most directly with as little damage to the rest of the healthy body as possible and get you back to work get you back to your family as quickly as possible It’s really honestly going to be game-changing” The federal CHIPS and Science Act passed in 2022 authorized and provided funding for the tech hubs But Hughes says the state was only able to take part because of groundwork laid well before by the participants The biohealth tech hub project brings together faculty from the University of Wisconsin and Madison and Milwaukee technical colleges health technology businesses and economic and workforce development agencies Universities conduct research businesses develop technologies that make use of those findings and health care providers then put those technologies to the test “That work is already happening” says Hughes “With the designation of the tech hub we’re able to expand on that” It brings together “a whole bunch of different skill sets that we already have in Wisconsin” — artificial intelligence research into gene functions drug development and advanced manufacturing Wisconsin’s was one of 31 tech hub projects that the federal government designated in October for initial funding with the prospect of larger federal investments to come Just getting this far gives Wisconsin additional allure for everyone from academics looking to relocate to employers eying the state Hughes says In March Microsoft announced a $1 billion investment to establish a data center on a 315-acre site in the Racine County village of Mount Pleasant — part of the land originally developed for Foxconn In November Microsoft announced it was expanding its footprint there with the purchase of another 1030 acres The Foxconn project that began under previous administrations in Madison and Washington DC and never approached the original promise sold in 2017 by then-Gov Scott Walker and President Donald Trump: a $10 billion high-tech flat screen manufacturing complex employing 13000 people Critics were skeptical from the start especially at the $3 billion in potential tax credits that the Legislature and Walker promised the company and questioned the $700 million that Mount Pleasant spent on infrastructure development Tony Evers ran for governor criticizing the project as a massive boondoggle Foxconn’s actual operational plans changed repeatedly leading WEDC to disqualify the company’s tax credit applications Midway through Evers’ first term WEDC and Hughes renegotiated the tax credits which for the first time enabled the company to actually qualify for them but at much lower cost to the state than the original credits would have cost if the company had ever qualified for them The April 2021 renegotiation was “right-sizing for what Foxconn is prepared to do in the marketplace” Hughes says — putting it on the same level as other companies that WEDC has rewarded with tax credits for job creation Having employed about 1000 people over the course of its history in the state “it’s a good company to have here in Wisconsin” she says of Foxconn “But they’re just like any of our other companies at this point” Reworking the deal was important to ensure an eventual return on the money sunk into developing the site “The way that I looked at it was it would be a shame for all of the infrastructure investment that happened to go to waste” Hughes recalls And as it became clear that the company would only use about a third of the redeveloped land WEDC “very aggressively went out … doing everything we could” to market the remaining vacant land Hughes says Microsoft showed interest with a $500 million investment initially later doubling that and then adding to it “We were very involved with having conversations” with the company she says Lawmakers and Evers included a sales tax exemption for data centers in the 2023-25 state budget — a further incentive for Microsoft Milwaukee 7 the economic development organization that covers seven southeast Wisconsin counties handled “the nitty gritty work of working through the new development agreement and the purchase and sale of the land with Microsoft and Foxconn Hughes says “A blue-chip company like Microsoft is the best outcome that we could have hoped for and worked for” she says While working with large business enterprises occupies much of WEDC’s agenda the agency has continued to dig more deeply into small business support Emblematic of that side of the operation is the Main Street Bounceback program now completing its second year of providing expansion grants of up to $10000 each to 9500 small businesses around Wisconsin Small business development is an important part of WEDC’s mission Hughes says because small businesses such as retailers and service providers help bring character life and value to the communities where they thrive In Prairie du Chien Main Street is bouncing back “Having communities where folks want to live and go downtown and spend time with each other is incredibly important” Hughes says “At WEDC we like to say we can walk and chew gum at the same time so we can focus on our small businesses and our large businesses” The Bounceback program gave the participating businesses opportunities to expand perhaps renovate or move into new space and to increase their value without owners having to drain their own savings Small businesses “often become large businesses if we give them enough support” she adds “Supporting small businesses along with the tens of millions of dollars that we give to large businesses every year in the form of tax credits is a way of evening things out” In the coming weeks WEDC expects to announce the first investments to be made by the Wisconsin Investment Fund a venture capital project The Wisconsin Investment Fund is being seeded with a federal grant — $50 million from US Treasury State Small Business Credit Initiative The Evers administration had sought $75 million in the state budget for venture capital but the budget committee’s Republican majority removed that request “We had a lot of conversations with the Legislature about how other Midwest states — Michigan Minnesota — are really digging in and investing in economic development” Hughes says “and I would have liked to have seen more willingness to really invest and think about the future with regard to economic development from our Legislature” Nevertheless she considers the investment fund one of WEDC’s big priorities for the new year “Access capital is going to be incredibly important — whether it’s our small businesses our mainstream businesses but also our startups or entrepreneurs who need significant capital to bring their product to market or to develop their software or their medical device” Hughes says Hughes is also looking to other opportunities afforded by the federal government The 2022 Inflation Reduction Act included a number of provisions aimed at addressing climate change including funding for the state green innovation bank “The governor has told WEDC we’re responsible for that” Hughes says Working with a commission that Evers established in June WEDC will be looking at projects “all around the state that help businesses become more sustainable Wisconsinites choose renewable energy” GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX There are also bank federal tax credits to reward cleaner energy choices in the legislation and WEDC will dig into “how can we help our communities and our businesses” make use of those incentives she adds “A lot of the recent federal funding is ‘get it while you can and be first in line’” says Hughes “We want to make sure that for those opportunities our businesses and our communities are up at the front of the line” Hughes says she’s also been glad to have an opportunity in the last year “to get back on the road and travel internationally” helping Wisconsin businesses make new connections around the world “I think it’s incredibly important for Wisconsin businesses to realize that they’re part of a global marketplace and that there are opportunities in Asia there’s opportunities in Africa there’s opportunities in Europe — and not only grabbing those opportunities but also just having that understanding that there are markets to expand to and places to sell your goods that are different and interesting and pursuing them” she says Exports are increasing Hughes observes “And I think that’s going to continue to create opportunities for Wisconsin businesses” by Erik Gunn Wisconsin Examiner January 3 2024 by Erik Gunn Wisconsin Examiner January 3 2024 At the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp CEO Missy Hughes looks

intelligence (AGI) levels comparable to a human’s level of reasoning Still if the roadmap of previous AI models is a reliable indicator of future rollouts we can expect GPT-5 to be significantly better at reasoning than GPT-4 Also a likely feature would be to expand its context window to allow for longer prompts This is an area in which other AI models like Anthropic’s Claude presently have an entrenched advantage It’s natural to assume that Microsoft will be the first beneficiary of the developments that OpenAI releases to the public Currently it’s providing an edge over its peers of companies like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) AI progress may accelerate this year and beyond which will give some buoyancy to MSFT’s stock price Just as I am bullish on tech stocks this year I am also fond of defensive sectors such as consumer staples and healthcare This brings us to Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) This is one of those companies you could park your money in and forget about for 20 years with minimal stress First if the indices continue to rally these blue-chip Dividend Kings and Dividend Aristocrats may be a valuable hedge At the same time investors take more risk elsewhere instead of betting the whole farm Secondly the valuation of these brands is reasonable with KO stock trading at just 24 times earnings Investors who seek income may also return to dividend stocks like KO in the midst of falling interest rates Coca-Cola doesn’t offer the most attractive yield but it’s still solid at 308% From a dividend investing perspective owning this company may be ideal for those with a long time horizon They will benefit from its strong dividend growth rate of 336% over the past year three years Due to its defensive nature the worldwide iconic KO is arguably worth a spot in every investor’s portfolio Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is another great defensive play Investors are unfairly underestimating its potential due to its pending talc litigation The reason I believe it’s unjust is because JNJ has already put aside $9 billion as it anticipates the legal costs Therefore the risk is contained Also JNJ’s investors consider it a defensive stock as some of its largest operating segments lie within growth-based industries such as medical technology and pharmaceuticals This blends the best of both worlds which many low-beta stocks like JNJ lack At present Johnson & Johnson is undervalued on an EPS basis as per its long-term averages Additionally it may be undervalued according to its forward and historical growth rates On the date of

684,"Big Techs earnings season has taught us 2 big lessons — so far","2/10/2024","https://finance.yahoo.com/news/big-techs-earnings-season-has-taught-us-2-big-lessons--so-far-152744093.html","Big Tech’s earnings season is in full swing and though AI chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) won’t report its results until Feb 21 there are plenty of insights to glean already Chief among them is that AI continues to push a huge portion of the conversation for corporate earnings and that fundamental business practices are still important So far Alphabet (GOOG GOOGL) Amazon (AMZN) AMD (AMD) Apple (AAPL) Intel (INTC) Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) have largely posted solid reports but not every company is seeing positive stock moves Shares of Apple and Google parent Alphabet fell after they reported disappointing sales in their China and advertising businesses respectively while shares of Intel and AMD were hammered on lower-than-expected outlooks for the current quarter Amazon Meta and Microsoft meanwhile are riding high thanks to big moves in their most important business segments including consumer sales advertising and the cloud And while it might not seem like it there are some common threads running through the stock market’s reaction to these earnings reports From AI investments to advertising and regional sales Big Tech’s latest earnings have laid out some valuable lessons If you need more proof that Wall Street’s obsession with AI is still going strong look no further than how many companies talked up the technology during their earnings calls Microsoft said its AI offerings added a 6% revenue boost to its Azure cloud business up from a 3% contribution in the prior quarter and 1% in the quarter before that That might not sound like a huge amount but it allows Microsoft to illustrate that its AI moves are beginning to pay off UBS analyst Karl Keirstead wrote in an investor note following the company’s earnings that the quarter-over-quarter increase in AI’s growth is proof Azure is seeing a “flow-through of AI demand”’ and a return on capital expenditures Wedbush analyst Dan Ives meanwhile said that Microsoft’s AI-powered Copilots are drawing plenty of interest from enterprise customers Microsoft’s Copilots are essentially AI-powered apps and include Copilot for Microsoft 365 and the Windows Copilot which now comes installed on Windows 11 computers “Copilot conversions appear to be exploding across the MSFT ecosystem as the AI Revolution has begun with partners/customers lining up for the Copilot deployments” Ives wrote in a note Microsoft wasn’t the only company to call out AI Amazon debuted its new Rufus generative AI shopping bot just ahead of earnings helping the company better illustrate how generative AI fits into its consumer offerings Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai also brought up his company’s AI investments at the top of its earnings call laying out how the technology is being integrated into Google Search while Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg hit on that company’s AI moves and investments “If we succeed everyone who uses our services will have a world-class AI assistant to help get things done every creator will have an AI that their community can engage with every business will have an AI that their customers can interact with to buy goods and get support and every developer will have a state-of-the-art open-source model to build with” Zuckerberg said during his company’s earnings call Intel and AMD meanwhile discussed their AI chips and the momentum they’re seeing in the space Finally Apple’s Tim Cook revealed that the company is diving deeper into AI with generative AI investments “We’ve got some things that we are incredibly excited about that we will be [showing] later this year” Cook said during the call I think there is a huge opportunity for Apple with [generative] AI and AI he later added in response to an analysts question We’ll likely learn more about Apple’s AI moves during its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June Investors hope the technology will provide a boost to iPhone sales by adding new features that get customers itching to upgrade While AI continues to drive much of the conversation around Big Tech earnings this season also taught us that business fundamentals are still key to driving share prices on Wall Street Alphabet and Apple proved that the hard way While both companies beat analysts’ expectations on the top and bottom lines they also missed anticipated revenue in specific business segments Alphabet fell short on ad revenue in the quarter posting $655 billion versus expectations of $658 billion Alphabet shares dropped following the news Apple meanwhile reported better-than-anticipated earnings and revenue as well as iPhone sales but the company’s stock took a hit on news that sales in China not only missed expectations but also fell year over year as well While analysts didn’t seem too concerned about the slowdown in sales in Apple’s third-largest market behind North America and Europe investors clearly were as shares went south after the report Nvidia will be the last of the Big Tech companies to report its earnings on Feb 21 Expectations for the company are sky-high after it posted better-than-anticipated earnings in the prior quarter And if it manages to beat with strong AI sales it’ll prove both of this earnings

into the stock analysis: SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust The SPY SPY is trading around the 49755 mark For those optimistic about the market an upward movement to 49817 would be a positive sign Should the momentum sustain above this level the next target for buyers would be to reach 49893 a crucial support point Holding above this could pave the way to 50017 with an ultimate bullish target for the day at 50091 On the flip side if the 49755 support level fails bears might drive the price down to test 49693 A presence of sellers could further push the price to 49596 Breaking below this level might lead to a test of the strong support at 49493 with the bearish target for the day set at 49427 Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 The QQQ ETF QQQ commonly referred to as the Qs is currently positioned around the 42732 level Bullish investors are looking for a rise above 42850 aiming to establish it as a new support level If successful the next goal would be to claim 42940 as a solid support potentially leading to a rise towards 43016 If the market sentiment remains positive a further push to 43118 could be seen with the highest bull target for the day at 43182 Conversely if the price struggles to stay above 42732 bearish forces might take over pushing the price down to 42664 Any observed weakness could lead to a further drop to 42577 Persistent sellers might challenge the support at 42482 with

day being 40492 If the support at 40030 cannot be maintained bears might aim to lower the price to 39921 A breakdown below this level could lead to a further decrease to 39838 Continuous downward

support level cannot be sustained bears might look to lower the price to 70735 Breaking below this could signal a move to 70492 A weaker market sentiment could result in a test of the 70204 level with

What was Satya Nadella’s reaction to becoming Microsoft CEO? And what was his first email to Microsoft employees? WSJ Talking about his reaction when he learned about Steve Ballmers departure Satya Nadella had revealed last year Having grown up at Microsoft first during Bill Gates tenure and then Steve Ballmers tenure I dont think I ever got up in the morning and thought that someday Microsoft would have neither Bill nor Steve And quite frankly when Steve announced that he was going to leave it was a real shock to me I remember quite distinctly one of the board members asking me Do you want to be the CEO? And I replied Only if you want me to be the CEO I told this to Steve Ballmer because the board members were like You know if you want to be the CEO you really need to want to be the CEO I said God Ive not thought about it I dont know Steve Ballmer was very interesting He said Its too late to change so just be yourself and see what happens Nadella further added In retrospect I think the board did what they had to do in the succession process They looked broadly on the outside and they looked deep on the inside and then they made their decision Also Read: Mark Zuckerberg Shares Pic With Satya Nadella satya nadella/getty In his first email to Microsoft employees after becoming the CEO Satya Nadella mentioned this: Today is a very humbling day for me It reminds me of my very first day at Microsoft 22 years ago Like you I had a choice about where to come to work I came here because I believed Microsoft was the best company in the world I saw then how clearly we empower people to do magical things with our creations and ultimately make the world a better place I knew there was no better company to join if I wanted to make a difference This is the very same inspiration that continues to drive me today It is an incredible honor for me to lead and serve this great company of ours Steve and Bill have taken it from an idea to one of the greatest and most universally admired companies in the world I’ve been fortunate to work closely with both Bill and Steve in my different roles at Microsoft and as I step in as CEO I’ve asked Bill to devote additional time to the company focused on technology and products I’m also looking forward to working with John Thompson as our new Chairman of the Board While we have seen great success we are hungry to do more Our industry does not respect tradition — it only respects innovation This is a critical time for the industry and for Microsoft Make no mistake we are headed for greater places — as technology evolves and we evolve with and ahead of it Our job is to ensure that Microsoft thrives in a mobile and cloud-first world As we start a new phase of our journey together I wanted to share some background on myself and what inspires and motivates me shutterstock Who am I? I am 46 I’ve been married for 22 years and we have 3 kids And like anyone else a lot of what I do and how I think has been shaped by my family and my overall life experiences Many who know me say I am also defined by my curiosity and thirst for learning I buy more books than I can finish I sign up for more online courses than I can complete I fundamentally believe that if you are not learning new things you stop doing great and useful things So family curiosity and hunger for knowledge all define me Why am I here? I am here for the same reason I think most people join Microsoft — to change the world through technology that empowers people to do amazing things I know it can sound hyperbolic — and yet it’s true We have done it we’re doing it today and we are the team that will do it again Click here to read the complete email getty Before Satya Nadella was named Microsoft CEO in February 2014 the Bill Gates’ founded company was headed by Steve Ballmer Steve Ballmer had served as Microsoft CEO from 2000-2014 and was a former assistant of Bill Gates as well Steve Ballmer had joined Microsoft as its 24th employee in 1980 Steve Ballmer had attended Harvard University where he met Bill Gates Ballmer had begun his career at Microsoft as an assistant to the president though his role at the time was more of a business manager For the latest and more interesting financial news keep reading Indiatimes Worth Click here Get the NEWS that fits your groove Subscribe to Indiatimes Newsletter and get handpicked updates based on your interests!

Preview","2/5/2024","https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-meta-platforms-amazon-apple-110000394.html","Chicago IL – February 5 2024 – Zackscom releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises This week’s list includes Microsoft MSFT Meta Platforms META Amazon AMZN Apple AAPL Alphabet GOOGL Tesla TSLA and Nvidia NVDA We have seen some awe-inspiring results from Microsoft Meta Platforms and Amazon in recent days that reconfirm their leadership position in this market These companies along with their peers in the ‘Magnificent 7’ group of stocks – Apple Alphabet Tesla and Nvidia – led the market higher last year and that momentum has continued this year Other than Tesla whose results disappointed the market once again and reflected the fourth quarter in a row of disappointing results all of the other Mag 7 members that have reported came out with impressive growth numbers The market wasn’t particularly impressed with the Alphabet and Apple reports but they came out with Q4 earnings growth of +518% and +131% respectively Tesla’s earnings were down -458% in Q3 on +35% higher revenues as the EV-maker continued to grapple with weakening margins in an increasingly competitive EV market Using estimates for Nvidia which will be coming out with its December-quarter results on February 21st and actual results for the other six members of the group total Q4 earnings for the group are expected to be up +487% from the same period last year on +145% higher revenues Please note that the Mag 7 companies currently account for 286% of the S&P 500 index’s total market capitalization and are expected to bring in 195% of the index’s total earnings in 2024 For 2023 Q4 the Mag 7 group has a bigger weightage bringing in 231% of all S&P 500 earnings Given their enormous earnings power and growth profiles it is hard to argue with the group’s market leadership Importantly analysts had been raising their estimates for the group even before the December-quarter results with these numbers now adding to the positive revision momentum Beyond these mega-cap players total Q4 earnings for the Technology sector as a whole are expected to be up +242% from the same period last year on +81% higher revenues This week’s blockbuster Tech results has pushed the aggregate earnings growth picture for the S&P 500 index to +43% from last week’s +11% growth pace Excluding the contribution from the Mag 7 stocks Q4 earnings for the rest of the index would be down -42% Including all the results that came out through Friday February 2nd we now have Q4 results from 230 S&P 500 members or 46% of the index’s total membership We have more than 500 companies on deck to report results this week including 106 S&P 500 members This week’s line-up includes a

712,"MSFT Stock Gave Reasons To Hold Earnings Were Our Reason To Sell","2/9/2024","https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/microsoft-msft-stock-swing-trade/","BREAKING: Futures Mixed With the market giving fewer chances for entries we were a little hesitant to take our profits as quickly on Microsoft Microsoft (MSFT) overtook Apple (AAPL) to become the most valuable company in the world with a market cap over $3 trillion And with the biggest gains coming from the biggest companies we couldnt ignore the swing trading opportunity in MSFT stock Heres why we bought it and why we were a little slower to sell it on the way up After nearly a 25% move from its September bottom Microsoft put in a near-term peak at the end of November (1) But it didnt give up much ground after that Instead it formed a flat base over the next few weeks with a depth of just 6% That pause allowed the 50-day moving average line to catch up to Microsofts price as it just grazed the line in the brief pullback that started the year (2) Once Microsoft cleared the near-term resistance we added it to SwingTrader (3) A slight flaw was a lagging relative strength line But since the base formed while the market had a strong December it was forgivable Thomas Carr (aka Dr Stoxx) gets philosophical in this weeks podcast as he searches for the truth in the stock market When Microsoft took out its November peak we locked in one third of the position with a 25% gain (4) Normally we continue to take off a third at a time as a stock progresses but weve slowed that down in this rally Given how hard it is to sometimes get that exposure back as stocks get extended weve been letting more and more stocks run That was an easy call with Microsoft as it found support at its short-term 5-day moving average line on its climb higher (5) So why did we eventually sell? The day Microsoft was due to report earnings it crossed 410 then started to lose steam (6) The reality is as a general swing trading rule we dont hold through earnings The big moves and binary nature of earnings reactions make them problematic for keeping losses small and taking gains quickly So the stock was due to come off anyway The reversal just made the decision easier After Microsoft announced earnings the stock came down below its 5- and 10-day lines as it dropped 27% and closed at its lows (7) The beat on earnings didnt excite investors as much as the weaker-than-expected guidance concerned them Admittedly given the recent gains it wasnt a difficult hold as a position trade But as a swing trade the short-term average line breaches would have most likely just gotten us a worse price But the stock isnt really broken which makes it worth keeping on the radar It held above its 21-day moving average line and just this week set up to take out its all-time highs (8) Missing out on earnings moves has been a challenge of this rally but we arent prevented from taking advantage of another potential move in Microsoft More details on past trades are accessible to subscribers and trialists to SwingTrader Free trials are available Follow Nielsen on X formerly known as Twitter at @IBD_JNielsen YOU MAY ALSO LIKE: Swing Trading Strategy Basics History In The Stock Traders Almanac Is Laying Out A Bullish Case Being On The Right Side Of Market Breadth Mark Minervini Gives His Outlook For 2024 MarketSmith: Research Charts Data And Coaching All In One Place 3/24/2024 The dovish Fed and the Nvidia-led AI boom continue to be the big stock market catalysts Uber and Eli Llly 3/24/2024 The dovish Fed and the Nvidia-led AI boom continue to IBDs 2024 list of Best Mutual Funds reveals how they beat the benchmarks ([email protected]) Get instant access to exclusive stock lists expert market analysis and powerful tools with 2 months of IBD Digital for only $20!

718,"Why Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) Could Be Worth Watching","1/14/2024","https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-microsoft-corporation-nasdaq-msft-120200998.html","Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) saw a decent share price growth of 19% on the NASDAQGS over the last few months The recent jump in the share price has meant that the company is trading around its 52-week high As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock However what if the stock is still a bargain? Today we will analyse the most recent data on Microsoft’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists Check out our latest analysis for Microsoft The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to our valuation model It’s trading around 456% above our intrinsic value which means if you buy Microsoft today you’d be paying a relatively reasonable price for it And if you believe that the stock is really worth $37154 then there isn’t really any room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading In addition to this Microsoft has a low beta which suggests its share price is less volatile than the wider market Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price With profit expected to grow by 50% over the next couple of years the future seems bright for Microsoft It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock which should feed into a higher share valuation Are you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in MSFT’s positive outlook with shares trading around its fair value However there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today such as the track record of its management team Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value? Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on MSFT now may not be the most advantageous time to buy given it is trading around its fair value However the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet in order to take advantage of the next price drop If youd like to know more about Microsoft as a business its important to be aware of any risks its facing For example - Microsoft has 1 warning sign we think you should be aware of If you are no longer interested in Microsoft you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential Have feedback on this article?

and we must increase enrollment in all manner of post-secondary education for Washington students so that Washington students are prepared for Washington jobs For context legislators have made significant commitments to create pathways for all students to pursue those credentials; we rank second in the nation in financial aid availability with a broad range of programs ranging from the Washington College Grant to the unique public-private partnership that funds the Washington State Opportunity Scholarship Unfortunately these resources are not being fully utilized; we are second-to-last in the nation for student completion of the FAFSA form that’s required to secure many sources of aid Thus we encourage legislative and education leaders to: Another key component of quality of life is safe and stable housing that is affordable and convenient to jobs services and community Put simply we need more housing of all types and for all income levels across Washington – and especially in the Puget Sound region In its 2023 session the legislature made substantial progress in support of that goal: A billion dollars in new housing investments were made including the historic investments in the Housing Trust Fund and the expansion of the Land Acquisition Program overseen by the Washington State Housing Finance Commission a program that Microsoft was proud to support with three-to-one matching funds and that is already producing results Additional progress was made in removing zoning and other regulatory barriers to the creation of new housing options But a Department of Commerce analysis shows that Washington still needs an additional one million housing units over the next two decades; this isn’t a problem that appeared overnight and it’s not a problem that can be solved in a single year So lawmakers must continue to pursue a wide range of additional housing strategies to address the growing demand for and rising cost of housing In addition to spurring housing construction and significantly increasing the supply of housing we must also take steps to address other impacts of the housing shortage Homelessness coupled with the opioid crisis and other behavioral health issues has led to unprecedented challenges for the state’s emergency rooms which are being overrun Challenge Seattle has issued a report that includes a series of recommendations for responding to this emergency and we are asking the legislature to review and adopt those strategies Transportation is critical to maintaining regional economic competitiveness supporting sustainable growth and preserving and improving our local quality of life The next major transportation budget will be developed in 2025 In advance of that however there are key decisions to be made around existing projects namely ensuring timely completion of the 520 bridge corridor project We also made some progress moving high-speed rail closer to reality when we received recognition and an initial grant from the Federal Corridor Identification Program This puts us in line for additional federal investment and it’s critical that we preserve the matching state dollars in the current transportation budget to leverage those federal investments In 2020 when Microsoft announced its commitment to become carbon negative by 2030 we pledged to also become active participants in public policy discussions to emphasize the unbreakable link between electricity policy and carbon policy and help advance global decarbonization efforts We must work together to get as much firm green power onto the power grid as quickly as possible This will require taking a hard look at our permitting and siting processes and identifying ways to make them more efficient so that green resources can be brought on line more quickly Use of digital tools including artificial intelligence must be considered to further improve resource siting and permitting processes Ultimately we cannot afford to focus on a single solution; we need an “all of the above” approach to plotting our clean energy future In addition to hydro solar wind and other energy sources traditionally considered renewable the state must now turn its attention to continuing to meaningfully advancing research and development of nuclear and fusion as potential sources of safe and abundant energy Microsoft is a technology company and today we are collectively in a new age of reason powered by technology led by people and fueled by innovation We are also at an inflection point and a unique AI moment How we manage and respond to rapid advances in artificial intelligence is critical to our collective future Just as new technologies will redefine the transportation and energy sectors artificial intelligence will redefine how technology serves all of us advancing humanity’s ability to think reason and express ourselves We are inspired by the vast potential of AI development to support public good; we are equally realistic about the risk of the technology being used in harmful ways As such Microsoft has been and will remain a leader in advocating for the responsible use of AI Our perspective on this issue as a company that has been working on these issues directly for a number of years is contained in our most recent Principles for Responsible AI We will work with the governor legislators and other elected officials as they engage in policy deliberations and we will support responsible approaches that promote innovation and opportunity for Washington state As we look forward to the 2024 legislative session we are energized by how lawmakers’ past decisions have positioned Washington state for success and we are even more optimistic about the opportunities that lie ahead Tags: affordable housing AI artificial intelligence carbon neutral education Responsible AI sustainability Follow us:"

The answer: Yes and some are still worth buying at their current prices Im breaking the seven up into buy sell and hold groups Starting with the sell set I think Apple and Nvidias stock prices far outpaced their businesses Nvidias 2023 success has been spurred on by the artificial intelligence (AI) arms race and its business has responded in kind In its fiscal 2024 third quarter (which ended Oct 29) revenue rose 206% year over year Furthermore management guided for $20 billion in fiscal Q4 revenue up 231% The stocks movement was warranted given the companys sales growth but Im concerned that investors are forgetting that Nvidia operates in a cyclical industry Nvidia goes through boom and bust cycles and right now is certainly a boom However its unknown how many AI data centers will need to be built in the near to medium term If demand for its high-powered chips is satisfied shortly the stock may come crashing back down to earth Plus its trading at 65 times earnings -- a quite expensive premium From a business standpoint Apple is the opposite of Nvidia Its sales declined throughout 2023 Even so its stock skyrocketed This makes little sense and more headwinds are coming up: a US International Trade Commission order this month forced Apple to halt the import and sale of some Apple Watches due to a patent dispute (although a court ruling temporarily allowed sales to resume) With all this in mind 2024 could be a tough year for the company And considering that Apple stock has a higher valuation than Magnificent Seven members Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) it doesnt make a lot of sense to own it compared to its peers I view Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) as holds currently Microsoft had a strong year as its revenues and earnings per share (EPS) steadily rose However Microsoft trades at a steep premium even on a forward earnings basis Microsoft is executing well but its valuation is a bit too much from a historical perspective to consider buying Still its far from a sell Tesla is one of the hardest companies to value on Wall Street as its valuation is wrapped up in expectations for future products Its also set to face some added headwinds Starting in 2024 some Tesla models will only qualify for half of the $7500 federal EV tax credit due to where the automaker sources materials for their batteries and where it produces them When judging whether any given moment is a better time to buy or sell Tesla stock I like to look at its price-to-earnings and price-to-sales ratio compared to historical trends For Tesla these are trading roughly near the midpoint of valuations seen since mid-2022 Im taking a wait-and-see approach to Tesla stock heading into the new year as the stock doesnt look like a bargain at these prices That leaves Alphabet Meta Platforms and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) in the buy now category These stocks trade at reasonable levels and are expecting strong tailwinds next year Even though Alphabet and Meta have AI investments they are mostly advertising businesses In 2022 and 2023 the advertising market was fairly weak as companies pulled back on their marketing spending due to fears that a recession was coming However now that we have lapped that pullback Alphabet and Meta are posting meaningful growth in their advertising businesses Their ad revenues grew by 9% and 24% respectively in Q3 Next year should be another strong recovery year for advertising which will boost both companies Amazon has also had a strong 2023 with its margins rising However this chart doesnt tell the full story as this takes into account Amazons profits over the past 12 months If you focus on its latest quarterly results Amazons margins are nearing (or have already set) all-time highs The fact that Amazon posted solid results in historically weak quarters bodes well for Q4 which is usually its strongest one No investor knows what a fully profitable Amazon looks like but 2024 could give us a glimpse making it a strong buy now Should you invest $1000 in Nvidia right now?

at the 22 Most Famous Hedge Fund Managers and Their Top Stock Picks For a quick overview of such stocks read our article 5 Most Famous Hedge Fund Managers and Their Top Stock Picks Hedge funds on average underperformed the market in 2023 as investors continued to pull out money amid rise in bond yields overall volatility and a changing financial landscape But the $34 trillion hedge fund industry saw many blockbuster returns from select hedge funds For example SoMa Equity Partners posted a massive 62% gain in 2023 according to a Reuters report Many notable hedge funds like Coatue Management of Philippe Laffont Millennium Management of billionaire Israel Englander Anson Funds Investments Master fund posted double-digit returns Chase Colemans Tiger Global which was devastated in 2022 due to its tech investments rebounded strongly in 2023 and posted a 285% gain in the period with most of the gains coming in the last quarter of the year helped largely by tech stocks While theres no shortage of hedge funds that performed extremely poorly during the year you have funds like Mulvaney Capital Management which reportedly posted a 5122% return according to Reuters This mixed bag of results and the average underperformance of the hedge fund industry when compared to the S&P 500s strong returns in 2023 only prove Insider Monkeys long-held thesis about the hedge fund industry recently summarized by its founder and research director Dr Inan Dogan: Hedge funds usually underperform the market during bull markets and outperform during bear markets Most investors don’t understand that hedge funds are “hedged” When the S&P 500 Index returns 20+% like it did in 2021 it is a certainty that hedge funds will underperform It is also a certainty that hedge funds will significantly outperform the market when the market declines 182% like it did in 2022 Hedge funds lost 425% in 2022 according to HFR That’s an outperformance of 14 percentage points Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here) That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator Top Stock Pick: Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) Israel Izzy Englander founded Millennium Management in 1989 with Ronald Shear As of 2023 the fund has a whopping $61 billion worth of assets under management The hedge fund operates relative value equity arbitrage fixed income and quantitative strategies As of the end of the third quarter of 2023 Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) was the biggest position of Millennium Management as the fund had a $16 billion stake in Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) In its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter ClearBridge Dividend Strategy stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT): “Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the largest holding in our portfolio Given its partnership with OpenAI and leading position in the cloud Microsoft is well-positioned to profit from the boom in AI However due to Microsoft’s tremendous scale and diversification the company is not dependent upon AI for its success Microsoft’s diverse portfolio of software and cloud offerings ensures the company will thrive even if the next hot thing like AI fizzles out In this way Microsoft is emblematic of our broader investing approach We seek to benefit from powerful trends but we do so with an eye toward managing risk and limiting downside in case the future turns out to be less rosy than hoped for” Top Stock Pick: Boston Scientific Corp (NYSE:BSX) Worth about $35 billion today Ken Griffin started Citadel LLC back in 1990 As of December 2022 the fund had assets under management worth over $62 billion As of the end of the third quarter of 2023 Microsoft was the biggest position of the fund but since it would be a repetition we focus on the funds second-biggest holding Boston Scientific Corp (NYSE:BSX) Citadel had a $11 billion stake in Boston Scientific Corp (NYSE:BSX) Baron Health Care Fund made the following comment about Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE:BSX) in its Q3 2023 investor letter: “We added to our

Boston Scientific last quarter We believe Boston Scientific can grow revenue in the high single digits driven by differentiated products used to treat atrial fibrillation among others The company held an Investor Day during the quarter at which management established financial targets for the 2024– 2026 period calling for an organic sales CAGR of 8% to 10% 150 basis points of margin expansion and strong double-digit adjusted EPS growth and improved free-cash-flow conversion We think this growth profile makes Boston Scientific a compelling name within the large medical device universe” Top Stock Pick: Horizon Therapeutics Public Ltd Co (NASDAQ:HZNP) John Paulson who has a net worth of about $35 billion as of January 11 rose to fame in 2007 when he earned a whopping $4 billion thanks to

exceeded consensus estimates of $118 per share Full-year estimates for 2023 and 2024 rose from $516 and $554 to $613 and $649 respectively However the market has become concerned about the impact of higher mortgage rates and most homebuilding stocks reversed a portion of the gains achieved earlier this year” Top Stock Pick: Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) James Harris Simons is an American billionaire award-winning mathematician and hedge fund manager who founded Renaissance Technologies in 1982 According to data compiled by Bloomberg Jim Simons’ secretive Medallion Fund — closed for

in which the fund had a $1 billion stake Here is what White Brook Capital has to say about Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its Q3 2023 investor letter: “The magnificent seven that underpin the S&P 500 performance which includes Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) now comprise almost 30% of the market capitalization of the S&P500 At least three of the seven stocks have heightened downside risk and suffer from already high penetration weakening end markets competitive risk and lofty valuation They have been remarkably resilient to increased interest rates and the potential for slowing growth Small and midcap stocks on the other hand have been systemically penalized by fears of recession and continue to price that eventuality even as significantly better outcomes have become more probable Today it’s relatively easy to find attractive investments in this segment” Top Stock Pick: Berkshire Hathaway Inc Class A (NYSE:BRKA) Guy Spier has risen to fame over the past few years thanks to his obsession with Warren Buffett and his value principles The author of the famous value investing book The Education of a Value Investor famously paid $650100 along with Mohnish Pabrai to have lunch with Warren

Company Gabelli is a value investor and has impressed the market with high returns over the past several years Talking to Columbia Business School the 81-year-old investor talked about the essence of value investing: Value investing isn’t focused on short-term market movements It’s about finding the ignored and unloved companies that nobody covers for whatever reason with a good business solid management and a good price But you do need to evaluate new trends as they come up AI for example might accelerate the problem of income inequality Also there are food water and energy shortages There’s the way capital is allowed to be allocated on a global basis — the regulatory hurdles and the challenges to the free market’s system of allocation So you have to figure out how to bridge all that The biggest stock holding of GAMCO as of the end of the third quarter of 2023 was Herc Holdings Inc (NYSE:HRI) Top Stock Pick: Amazoncom Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) Billionaire David Tepper is the man behind Appaloosa Management a Florida-based hedge fund Tepper who also owns Carolina Panthers managed to post about 18% to 19% gains in 2023 according to a report by Institutional Investor Teppers top

letter ClearBridge Large Cap Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Amazoncom Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN): “Much of that differential can be attributed to the performance of the Magnificent Seven (Alphabet Amazoncom Apple Meta Platforms Microsoft Nvidia and Tesla) a basket of mega cap growth stocks that accounted for 478% of the benchmark return for the quarter and 654% for 2023 The ClearBridge Large Cap Growth Strategy maintains exposure to six of the seven stocks with overweights in Amazoncom Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) Meta and Nvidia Amazon benefited from strong margin expansion across segments most notably its core e-commerce business while Meta saw accelerated revenue growth and share gains in online advertising Active management of our mega cap exposure contributed to the Strategy outperforming the benchmark both in the fourth quarter and through the narrow leadership market of 2023 We also attribute these improved results to solid stock picking being opportunistic in adding to or initiating new positions in growth companies at or near the bottom of their earnings cycle and maintaining a commitment to diversification across our three buckets of growth: select stable and cyclical” Top Stock Pick: Activision Blizzard Inc (ATVI) Billionaire Paul Tudor Jones founded Tudor Investment Corporation in 1980 As of the end of the September quarter the hedge fund had

about 51% ClearBridge Mid Cap Growth Strategy made the following comment about Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (NYSE:CMG) in its Q3 2023 investor letter: “In the consumer discretionary sector Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (NYSE:CMG) proved a detractor as investors were disappointed in management’s decision not to push additional menu pricing which resulted in full year guidance falling short of expectations However we believe this is just a timing mismatch as their value proposition relative to peers leaves room for continued strong pricing power” Top Stock Pick: Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) Worth $79 billion today Ken Fisher is one of the most renowned hedge fund managers in the world Ken Fisher founded Fisher Investments back in 1979 Fisher Investments today manages over $236 billion in assets Ken Fisher is bullish on the market He recently wrote in an article for that The Globe and Mail that he sees double-digit gains for both S&P 500 and the MSCI World Index with tech and big

(NASDAQ:AAPL) in 2023 Apple is the largest company in the world and produces terrific products that engage users for hours each day Despite the company’s size ubiquity and relevance however Apple’s growth has slowed dramatically Its fiscal 2023 earnings were flat with those of 2022 Apple trades at 30x earnings; sustaining that multiple will require a meaningful acceleration in revenues While such an improvement is possible we do not see any obvious catalysts for adding tens of billions of dollars to Apple’s topline Consequently the risk-reward skews negatively” Top Stock Pick: Procter & Gamble Co (NYSE:PG) Ray Dalio in 1975 founded Bridgewater Associates which went on to become the largest hedge fund in the world According to Forbes the hedge fund has over $124 billion in assets under management According to Bloomberg Bridgewaters flagship hedge fund lost about 76% in 2023 while its long-only All Weather fund climbed 106% in the period As of the end of the third quarter of 2023 Procter & Gamble Co (NYSE:PG) was the biggest holding of Ray Dalios Bridgewater as the fund reported owning a $700 million stake in Procter & Gamble Co (NYSE:PG) Hayden Capital made the following comment about The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) in its third 2023 investor letter: “It’s not just emerging markets either where one could argue a “scarcity premium” given fewer quality public companies Even in the US Coca-Cola trades at ~30x P/E despite having the same earnings as 10 years ago The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is likewise at ~27x P/E with earnings only ~12% higher than a decade ago (or a ~1% annual growth rate) This equates to a mere 33% – 37% earnings yield Both of these companies actually have lower revenues than 10 – 15 years ago too indicating that their profit growth is mostly from margin expansion This can only last for so long before there’s no more excess expenses left to cut I find it ironic that all these companies trade as “bond-equivalents” in the minds of investors – even commanding lower yields than US treasuries the safest security in the world But it’s clear that their businesses are not nearly as safe Proctor & Gamble is facing disruption from direct-to-consumer brands that offer their products for a fraction of the price But these companies are ~35% more expensive than US Treasuries despite the heightened risk On a risk-adjusted basis one could argue the implied premium is even higher Perhaps the explanation is simply the price volatility difference between these stocks and treasuries over the last two years For example 10-year Treasury bonds are down ~-20% since the beginning of 2022 By comparison KO and PG are remarkably down only -4 – 6% over that time frame” Top Stock Pick: Meta Platforms Inc

position as of the end of September 2023 was Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) in which the fund had a $27 billion stake In its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter ClearBridge Large Cap Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META): “Much of that differential can be attributed to the performance of the Magnificent Seven (Alphabet Amazoncom Apple Meta Platforms Microsoft Nvidia and Tesla) a basket of mega cap growth stocks that accounted for 478% of the benchmark return for the quarter and 654% for 2023 The ClearBridge Large Cap Growth Strategy maintains exposure to six of the seven stocks with overweights in Amazoncom Meta and Nvidia Amazon benefited from strong margin expansion across segments most notably its core e-commerce business while Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) saw accelerated revenue growth and share gains in online advertising Active management of our mega cap exposure contributed to the Strategy outperforming the benchmark both in the fourth quarter and through the narrow leadership market of 2023 We also attribute these improved results to solid stock picking being opportunistic in adding to or initiating new positions in

726,"Microsoft Rises Like A Phoenix From The Ashes (NASDAQ:MSFT)","1/21/2024","https://seekingalpha.com/article/4663991-microsoft-rises-like-a-phoenix-from-the-ashes","koyu/iStock via Getty Images koyu/iStock via Getty Images Back when I was in college from 2008 through 2013 the common consensus amongst those who understood the operations of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) was that the company was a behemoth of a bygone era After the Dot-Com bubble burst its market capitalization remained stuck in a fairly narrow range for well over a decade But in the past eight or nine years the company has revived remarkably like a phoenix from the ashes Latching on to new growth opportunities the business has seen its market capitalization explode higher And at just over $296 trillion it is currently the largest publicly traded company on the planet just behind consumer tech giant Apple Inc (AAPL) Given this massive upswing that the company has seen in recent years investors might very well be worried that shares are overpriced just like they were back in the late 1990s This might prove especially true in their minds if the predictions of rapid growth associated with the advent of quality AI prove to fall short But when you really look at the data and what is driving the company higher I would argue that while there is definitely an opportunity for AI to supercharge the companys growth moving forward it does not necessarily need to be successful in its AI initiatives to be a solid prospect for long term investors who want a high-quality business at a decent price In the past year or so the only articles that I have written regarding Microsoft have been focused on the companys journey to absorb video game giant Activision Blizzard the most recent here visible here Even most of my efforts there centered around how shareholders of Activision Blizzard would be set to benefit But the fact of the matter is that Microsoft offers a lot outside of its video game initiatives To be clear my goal with this article is not to dig down into each of its operating segments Odds are you already know a good amount about the business from that perspective But a brief refresher might not be such a bad idea Operationally speaking Microsoft has three different segments The first of these is the Productivity and Business Processes segment which focuses on a variety of offerings such as its ownership over LinkedIn its Microsoft 365 consumer subscriptions its Office 365 subscriptions and more Next in line we have the More Personal Computing segment which consists of a variety of odds and ends such as Windows its gaming initiatives and various devices such as the Surface Certain services such as Microsoft News and Bing are also included under this umbrella And lastly there is the Intelligent Cloud part of the company which involves the firms public private and hybrid server products and cloud services Most notably this involves Azure which is the primary competitor of Amazoncom Incs (AMZN) AWS There has been a tremendous amount of excitement regarding the role that AI could play in boosting the financial performance of Microsoft moving forward And management has been very active in incorporating AI into its business For instance when it comes to Azure the company makes it easier for developers and other parties to utilize advanced models for the purpose of achieving optimized AI functionality Customers are even able to integrate their AI programs into other solutions for the purpose of creating apps and various services On top of this there are other examples such as the companys ownership interest in OpenAI the creator of ChatGPT Last year the firm invested $10 billion into OpenAI This followed a $1 billion investment that the firm had made into the same company back in 2019 The company also has an AI companion called Copilot that it makes available for its customers Last year after seeing continued robust results I changed my rating on Palantir Technologies Inc (PLTR) from a sell to a hold acknowledging that the company had broken my resolve In one of the earlier bearish articles that I had written about the firm I acknowledged just how large AI could ultimately be not only for it but for everyone across the globe It was estimated for instance that AI could contribute up to $157 trillion to the global economy by 2030 I have no doubt that Microsoft will also be a beneficiary of this expansion However I think that the value it receives will come less from things like its OpenAI investments and Copilot and more from owning an ecosystem that facilitates AI innovation and grows from it Author - SEC EDGAR Data Author - SEC EDGAR Data Nobody truly knows what kind of upside this might have for the company But even if we just bank on the current picture continuing the end result for shareholders should be quite positive Look at revenue for instance over the past few years From 2021 through 2023 revenue for the company expanded from $16809 billion to $21192 billion For the first quarter of 2024 revenue of $5652 billion beat out the $5012 billion the company reported in the same quarter of the 2023 fiscal year And as you can see in the chart above profits have followed revenue higher the entire way Author - SEC EDGAR Data Author - SEC EDGAR Data As I mentioned earlier however there are multiple sets of operations that make up Microsoft For instance the More Personal Computer segment of the business has not done particularly well Revenue remained more or less flat from 2021 through 2023 And for the first quarter of 2024 sales came in only 25% higher than what they were one earlier All of the companys growth meanwhile has come from its other two segments But the most notable of these has been the Intelligent Cloud business This is the part of the company that I would imagine will benefit the most from AI growth irrespective of who the winner in models happens to be This is because the cloud makes AI far easier not only to set up and manage but also to monetize And as the owner of one of the two largest cloud platforms on the planet Microsoft is bound to be a major beneficiary Author - SEC EDGAR Data Author - SEC EDGAR Data We can see this playing out over the past few years The Intelligent Cloud part of the company has grown from 355% of total corporate revenue for the business in 2021 to 415% in 2023 By the first quarter of 2024 it totaled 429% Its worth noting that the Productivity and Business Process segment has managed to hold its own with its overall revenue share remaining more or less unchanged during this period of time So that part of the company is definitely going to be a major contributor to value creation for shareholders in the future Both it and the Intelligent Cloud part of the company have seen their contributions to overall profit for the business as a whole expand And the most significant movement there not surprisingly involved the Intelligent Cloud operations of the company Author - SEC EDGAR Data Author - SEC EDGAR Data From a margin perspective it has only been recent that the Intelligent Cloud portion of Microsoft has seen a meaningful improvement By comparison the Productivity and Business Process segment has seen its profit margin climb from 452% in 2021 to 536% by the first quarter of 2024 But as the firms cloud operations continue to expand I expect that margins will eventually increase as well Author - SEC EDGAR Data Author - SEC EDGAR Data Unfortunately we dont have a crystal ball that lets us understand exactly what the future holds But we do know that management is optimistic For the second quarter of the 2024 fiscal year the midpoint of guidance provided by management calls for revenue of $6090 billion while analysts anticipate sales of $6105 billion This would be a nice increase over the $5275 billion reported for the second quarter of 2024 If this comes to fruition about 415% of that revenue will have come from the firms Intelligent Cloud operations And when we start stripping out certain costs as estimated by management and assuming that the firms share count remains unchanged from where it was in the first quarter of the year we would anticipate a profit per share of about $274 That would be an increase over the $220 per share reported in the second quarter of 2024 That would mean that profits would climb from $1643 billion to $2060 billion As you can see in the table below I also included other profitability metrics from the second quarter of 2023 Investors should definitely be paying attention to what these end up being in the second quarter of this year This is because after all these would be the metrics that determine the true value of the business Author - SEC EDGAR Data Author - SEC EDGAR Data Those who do not believe that Microsoft deserves to move higher will point out that shares are not exactly cheap As you can see in the chart below the stock is pricey not only on an absolute basis but also relative to where it has traded at some points in the past But its definitely not at the highest point it has been in just the past 10 years Add on top of this the belief that the global cloud market is expected to climb by about 141% per annum from 2023 through 2030 taking the overall industry up to roughly $156 trillion compared to $619 billion last year and I believe that paying a bit of a premium of course such a high-quality company at the forefront of the space is not unreasonable Data by YCharts As things stand I believe that while Microsoft is far from being a value play its one of the true growth prospects that can achieve enough growth on the bottom line to justify the lofty price that the market is demanding in order to participate in owning a piece of the pie For those who have a several-year time horizon and who can accept volatility this is a kind of opportunity that could make a lot of sense Crude Value Insights is an exclusive community of investors who have a taste for oil and natural gas firms Our main interest is on cash flow and the value and growth prospects that generate the strongest potential for investors You get access to a 50+ stock model account in-depth cash flow analyses of E&P firms and a Live Chat where members can share their knowledge and experiences with one another Sign up now and your first two weeks are free!

728,"Microsoft: Azure Taking Share With AI Push (NASDAQ:MSFT)","1/23/2024","https://seekingalpha.com/article/4664547-microsoft-azure-taking-share-with-ai-push","Gary Hershorn/Corbis News via Getty Images Gary Hershorn/Corbis News via Getty Images Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) isnt the cheapest stock but it has set itself up to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of the AI revolution making it a Buy MSFT is a technology company that operates in three segments: Productivity and Business Processes Intelligent Cloud and More Personal Computing Its Productivity and Business Processes segment houses its Office 365 business that includes its well-known software programs such as Word Excel and Outlook It also includes employment social media site LinkedIn as well as Dynamics 365 which includes ERP and CRM applications The segment represented 33% of its FY23 (ended June) revenue and 39% of its operating income MSFTs Intelligent Cloud segment meanwhile is home to its public private and hybrid server products and cloud services offerings This includes Azure as well as SQL Server Windows Servers Visual Studio and System Center The segment also includes Nuance its voice recognition and transcribing business and its AI-powered developer platform GitHub The segment also includes enterprise and partner services The segment accounted for 41% of its FY23 revenue and 43% of its operating income Finally its More Personal Computing Segment is home to its Windows Operating System The segment is also comprised of its Xbox gaming unit and its Bing search engine Devices such as Surface HoloLens and PC accessories are also found in this segment The segment was 26% of its FY23 revenue and 19% of its operating income The company also has an investment and partnership with OpenAI the maker of ChatGPT While it seems like nearly every company is looking to drive growth through AI MSFT is at the forefront leading the charge It is going all-in on AI across its tech stack from Azure to Office 365 applications to Bing search to LinkedIn The biggest growth driver for MSFT has been with Azure which has been taking share as organizations continue to migrate to the cloud Fiscal year 2024 has been off to a hot start with Azure revenue up 29% 28% in constant currencies in FQ1 (ended September) For FYQ2 which will be reported at the end of the month the company is projecting Azure growth of 26-27% in constant currencies Given its usage model and the rapid consumption of AI that it has seen Id expect it to moderately top this number Company Presentation Company Presentation The strong Azure growth is being fueled by increased AI consumption Azure uses a pay-as-you-go model so the more customers use services such as Azure AI the more revenue MSFT generates Prices are often based on hourly rates or usage In addition to AI Azure is also benefiting from cloud migrations to Azure Arc which is MSFTs solution for hybrid and multi-cloud management It is the only cloud provider running Oracles (ORCL) database services which is allowing customers to migrate their on-prem ORCL databases to the cloud The company saw its number of Arc customers increase 140% in the quarter to 21000 as a result Speaking at a UBS conference at the end of November Corporate VP of Azure Alysa Taylor said: How critical data is to building out unique AI experiences the partnership that we have with Oracle was actually a direct request from our customers of being able to bring their Oracle databases into Azure And so we have a very unique partnership where you can run your OCI database directly in Azure So as youre modernizing and that governance management and modernization can happen in a very integrated way And for us it gives Oracles over 400000 customers the ability to bring OCI directly into Azure and run natively in an Azure environment And so weve worked to be able to architect that in a way that is most beneficial to customers so they can just literally take OCI run it in Azure and then have all of the ancillary Azure services that we talked about to be able to do the management governance and modernization In addition to AI helping Azure the company is also bringing AI services and Copilots its AI chatbot and assistant to various of its offerings This fall the company began introducing a number of Copilot options such as 365 Copilot AI assistant which can help users do things such as summarize documents and improve upon Excel analysis The add-on is being sold to enterprises for $30 per month per user with a minimum of 300 users needed On its FQ1 call MSFT said that 40% of the Fortune 100 was already testing the service as part of its early access program The company is also launching other copilots into areas such as sales and services as well as employee engagement & performance through its Viva offering Gitbub meanwhile has seen a huge boost after the introduction of its copilot with a 40% sequential increase in organizations subscribed to Copilot for business MSFT has even brought AI to LinkedIn earlier in 2023 introducing AI-assisted messages for recruiters This helped LinkedIn grow revenue by 8% in FQ1 despite a tough environment for recruiting and advertising MSFT could also see a boost in Windows revenue as AI is likely to lead to a PC refresh cycle Many programs that run AI need more powerful computing With Windows deployed on most non-Apple (AAPL) computers MSFT could see a nice boost from a part of its business that has struggled Gaming is another nice opportunity for MSFT especially after its recent acquisition of Activision Blizzard which was completed in October Xbox Game Pass has been doing well and Activision Blizzard will only improve the depth of its content Meanwhile it will be interesting to see how AI can be applied to games in areas such as NPCs (non-player characters) and customization MSFTs next-gen console isnt expected until 2028 but it could be one of the most important and profitable refreshes in its history When it comes to risks competition in the cloud service space is perhaps the biggest Amazon (AMZN) has seen its AWS growth slow in 2023 as well as its operating margins which were 262% through the first nine months of the year versus 300% last year AMZN is a company that will fight for shares and has shown in the past that it is willing to sacrifice margin Cloud Infrastructure Market Share (Statista/Synergy Research Group) Cloud Infrastructure Market Share (Statista/Synergy Research Group) Regulation is another risk According to reports both the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission are looking into antitrust issues with MSFT and its relationship with and investment in OpenAI With MSFTs biggest push being AI solutions powered by OpenAI this adds a bit of risk to the story MSFT currently trades at about 24x FY24 EBITDA (ending June) estimates of $1213 billion Based on the current FY25 EBITDA consensus of $1492 billion the stock trades at a 195x multiple Revenue is projected to grow 146% in FY24 and 141% in FY25 MSFT currently has a free cash flow yield of about 21% based on FCF of $633 billion in the last trailing twelve months MSFT is among the more expensive mega-cap tech stocks but towards the middle of large-cap software names MSFT Valuation Vs Peers (FinBox) MSFT Valuation Vs Peers (FinBox) Since after the pandemic MSFT has traded between 20-26x EBITDA Given that multiple ranges its fair value range based on FY25 EBITDA would be $410-$530 with a midpoint of $470 Given that the company historically tops estimates I would expect it to continue to do so led by Azure AI consumption and adoption of AI copilots MSFT has really taken the lead with AI and the company has a lot of potential growth in front of it due to this Azure has been the biggest beneficiary so far and it has clearly been taking shares away from AWS The rollout of AI to the rest of its products and services as well as a potential PC refresh cycle set the company up well in the coming years MSFTs stock is not cheap but it does actually trade at a bit of a discount to some of its large-cap software peers The stock is right on the brink of Buy territory for me but given its tailwinds I will start it out as a Buy with a $470 target I expect the company to continue to see strength in Azure and a nice boost to Office 365 when it reports its results later this month This article was written by Analyst’s Disclosure: I/we have a beneficial long position in the shares of GOOGL either through stock ownership options or other

It would be if only a typical user could get it installed Barousse is a power user He installed it Then couldn’t find it I had to go into my account information and click ‘update license’ he reported Then once I restarted Excel it was right there I wonder how much time he had to spend to unravel that mystery I wonder how much time a non-power-user would have to spend When he finally launched Excel Barousse was encouraged to try out Copilots features The application came with a bunch of pre-installed data which great when prompted Except that was Microsofts pre-installed data But what about actual data from an actual business? Different story Barousse uploaded a large Excel file with a million rows containing information about people searching for jobs No go He was unable to get any responses to his prompts He confirmed that the problem wasnt a local machine issue - he was running 50% of memory and using a MacBook Pro with a virtual machine in order to run Windows with 16GB of memory It was more than enough he said Stillnothing So he bailed on the million-row spreadsheet and instead tried Copilot on a spreadsheet with 40000 rows Things spun until one eternity later” and after thinking and thinking and thinking he gave up So he reduced the rows to 10000 then to 5000 and Copilot kept locking up Finally he got things going with just 500 rows of data which is not a lot if you want to rely on an AI tool like Copilot Pro to provide the kind of analysis that a human cant do But even with only 500 rows Barousse was underwhelmed with the result It provided bland looking visuals that kept repeating no matter how he asked to re-do them He was hoping to generate the slick looking multiple visualizations that Microsoft showed with its pre-installed data but he couldnt do anything like it with his data Another frustration: he couldn’t work with his local files Apparently Microsoft forces you to have your files saved in either OneDrive or SharePoint which limits a lot of options But at least it’s secure right? Uh not so much According to Barousse Microsoft says that when youre signed into Copilot with Microsoft Entra ID you get commercial data protection for free which means chat data isnt saved” because “Microsoft has no eyes on access and your data isnt used to train the model But this is for business users on networks Unfortunately individuals using Copilot Pro are out of luck Its still not as safe as it sounds to put confidential data into it he laments Barousse certainly doesnt want to make any enemies at Microsoft but you could tell he struggled to put a good face on this product He didn’t have much to say about Copilot elsewhere in Office but for sure he wasn’t thrilled with what he saw so far with Excel I am disappointed in the performance of Microsoft Excel” he said “Specifically I wasnt able to recreate a lot of the different functionality that Microsoft has shown as YouTube videos but more importantly Im most concerned about the data limitations that Co-pilot has in that I had to limit my data to around 500 rows to get Copilot to even work He also wants to make sure that viewers know that that Excel is in its preview version so its only gonna get better Wait a second…preview version? Yeah you have to read the little footnote about Excel on the bottom of Microsoft’s blog post announcing the product launch to find that out But Copilot’s problems are not just Excel’s problems Already there are a growing number of users complaining about performance issues and problems ranging from inaccurate suggestions to limited language support So when my clients are asking about Copilot Im telling them to stay away from it this year You should do the same Let Microsoft work out the kinks In the meantime try to figure out exactly what problem will it solve? How will it help your business? Who will use it the right way? What’s the ROI? Perhaps by the time you’ve thought about and answered these questions Copilot will actually work as promised I’m confident that it will But just not this year"

Image source: Getty Images From 2010 to 2020 IBMs annual revenue decreased from $999 billion to $552 billion That persistent decline was caused by two major mistakes First IBMs core business software IT infrastructure and mainframe divisions struggled as more companies shifted toward cloud-based services Second it divested many of its lower-margin segments which reduced its total revenue Streamlining its sprawling business initially seemed like the right move but it plowed most of its cash from its divestments into wasteful share buybacks instead of making meaningful investments in its own cloud ecosystem By the time IBM finally started focusing on the cloud it had already lost the public cloud platform market to Amazon Microsoft and Alphabets Google Those missteps caused many investors including Warren Buffett to abandon IBM From the beginning of 2010 to the end of 2020 its stock declined 4% as the S&P 500 advanced 237% Even after factoring in reinvested dividends IBM only delivered a total return of 38% compared to the S&P 500s total return of 322% Arvind Krishna and Microsofts Satya Nadella both led their companies cloud divisions prior to taking on their CEO roles Thats why it wasnt surprising when Krishna like Nadella immediately prioritized the expansion of IBMs cloud business Krishnas first big move was the divestment of its slower-growth managed infrastructure services unit Kyndryl spun off in November 2021 enabling IBM to focus on expanding its higher-growth hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence (AI) businesses Realizing that IBM couldnt go head-to-head against Amazon Microsoft and Google in the public cloud Krishna prioritized the development of hybrid cloud services that could process the data that flowed between private and public clouds The crux of that strategy is its Red Hat subsidiary which develops open-source software for a wide range of computing platforms The expansion of that hybrid cloud should also support its development of AI tools for processing all of that data At the end of 2021 IBM restructured its business into three simpler reporting segments -- software consulting and infrastructure -- and set a goal of generating sustainable mid-single digit revenue growth from 2022 to 2024 At the time it expected the mid-single-digit growth of its software business and the high-single-digit expansion of its consulting segment to offset the flat growth of its infrastructure division Segment 2022 Revenue Growth 2023 Revenue Growth Software 7% 5% Consulting 7% 5% Infrastructure 8% (5%) Total revenue 6% 2% Data source: IBM IBM easily cleared those targets in 2022 but the slower-than-expected expansion of its consulting and infrastructure divisions throttled its growth throughout 2023 But most of that deceleration occurred in the first half of the year and its growth accelerated again in the second half as its consulting and infrastructure businesses recovered For 2024 it expects its revenue to rise by the mid-single digits on a constant currency basis with currency headwinds reducing its reported revenue by a single percentage point Thats in line with analysts expectations for 3% growth IBMs prospects are brightening its stock still looks cheap at 19 times forward earnings and it pays a hefty forward yield of 38% For value investors it might look more appealing than Microsoft which trades at 37 times forward earnings and pays a paltry forward yield of 07% But Microsoft is also growing a lot faster than IBM: Analysts expect its revenue and earnings to both rise 15% this year as it expands its cloud and AI businesses Therefore I think its premature to call IBM the next Microsoft A few green shoots are appearing but IBM is still trying to carve out a defensible niche with its newest cloud and AI services while Microsoft remains a clear leader in both markets IBM could stabilize its aging business with single-digit revenue growth over the next few years but it shouldnt be seriously compared to Microsoft until it fires up a few more growth engines John Mackey former CEO of Whole Foods Market an Amazon subsidiary is a member of The Motley Fools board of directors Suzanne Frey an executive at Alphabet is a member of The Motley Fools board of directors Leo Sun has positions in Amazon The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Alphabet Amazon and Microsoft The Motley Fool recommends International Business Machines The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy Invest better with The Motley Fool Get stock recommendations portfolio guidance and more from The Motley Fools premium services Making the world smarter happier and richer © 1995 - 2024 The Motley Fool All rights reserved Market data powered by Xignite and Polygonio"

investing resources and more Learn More One of the most notable changes in the tech landscape over the past year was the advent of generative AI Sure artificial intelligence (AI) has been around in some form or fashion for decades powering a wide variety of everyday activities The use of facial recognition and voice-controlled assistants on smartphones tagging of photos on social media and even recommendations on streaming video and e-commerce sites all come courtesy of AI However generative AI is different capable of creating original content rather than merely analyzing existing information and using it to draw a conclusion Microsoft (MSFT -015%) has been at the forefront of the generative AI boom thanks to its sizable investment in ChatGPT parent OpenAI and its decision to integrate AI into a broad cross-section of its products and services However Microsoft just kicked off the new year by announcing one of its biggest changes in the past 30 years While the change itself might seem trivial at first glance it speaks to the growing influence of AI in every facet of everyday life Image source: Getty Images Microsoft recently announced the debut of Copilot a suite of AI protocols designed to increase productivity when using the companys products and services When the company released the results for its fiscal 2024 first quarter (ended Sept 30) it revealed that 40% of the Fortune 100 companies are using Copilot as part of Microsofts early access program Soon after Copilot was made generally available to its enterprise customers and investors have yet to understand the full impact of AI on Microsofts results Access to the technology is about to go much wider In a blog post published on Thursday Microsoft announced that it was adding a Copilot key to the Windows PC keyboard The new key will enable users to launch Copilot at the touch of a button further expanding Microsofts growing AI reach While that might seem important at first glance consider this: Its the first major change to the keyboard since the addition of the Windows key in 1994 The blog post went further announcing that it was making 2024 the year of the AI PC Microsoft also teased big changes ahead heralding a significant shift in which AI would be seamlessly woven into Windows from the system to the silicon to the hardware This helps illustrate the speed at which AI is reaching into every corner of technology and highlights the importance of this paradigm shift Microsoft recognized the groundbreaking potential of generative AI as evidenced by its $13 billion investment in OpenAI The company extended its advantage by quickly integrating generative AI into its most popular products and offering a suite of AI tools via Azure According to CFO Amy Hood The next-generation AI business will be the fastest-growing $10 billion business in our history Much of that growth will come from the cloud During its fiscal 2024 first quarter (ended Sept 30) Microsoft revealed that it was stealing cloud share from its rivals Azure revenue grew 29% year over year outpacing Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Alphabets Google Cloud which generated growth of 12% and 22% respectively Digging a little deeper Microsoft said roughly three points of Azures growth was due to increased demand for AI services Azures cloud growth had experienced seven consecutive quarters of slowing year-over-year growth before the recent uptick according to data supplied by research firm Canalys The report also noted the increased demand followed the debut of Copilot in September This supports Microsofts contention that AI is at the heart of its current growth spurt While estimates vary experts concur that the opportunity represented by AI is vast One of the more bullish prognostications comes from Ark Investment Management CEO Cathie Wood who suggests that AI software alone could generate $14 trillion by 2030 A much more conservative estimate comes from Bloomberg Intelligence which suggests that generative AI could grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 42% reaching $13 trillion by 2032 Putting the potential size of the opportunity aside Microsoft has

analyst recommendations in-depth research investing resources and more Learn More Windows is the overwhelmingly dominant operating system running on PCs around the world and its been that way for decades Microsofts (MSFT -015%) ubiquitous OS enjoyed a 72% share of the global desktop operating system market at the end of 2023 with Apples OS X a distant second at 16% These figures come from Statcounter and should be interpreted as ballpark estimates but its clear that Windows reigns supreme While Windows remains dominant it has lost some of that dominance over time According to Statcounter Windows market share has dropped more than 20 percentage points since 2009 The increasing popularity of Apples Mac computers explains most of that decline but not all of it Linux in all its variants has become far more prevalent over the past 15 years Linux had a market share of just 068% in 2009 In 2023 that share had ballooned to 382% Thats still tiny compared to Windows but a fivefold increase is notable nonetheless While the odds have always been stacked against Linux in the battle for OS supremacy a fairly recent development could pave the way for further erosion of Microsofts market share While Linux distributions have become more user-friendly over time with some even doing a pretty good job of mimicking the Windows experience they still require a level of technical know-how that is beyond the typical PC user Linux is extremely popular among software developers with around 45% of developers reporting Linux as their preferred OS But most PC users are not writing code or doing anything more technical than the occasional spreadsheet For users who are tech-savvy enough to use Linux but dont one reason for sticking with Windows is the state of the PC gaming industry Because Windows dominates in terms of market share PC games are often developed for Windows exclusively Going through the trouble of porting a game to Linux rarely makes commercial sense given its minuscule market share Steam the leading PC gaming platform recently published a list of the top-grossing games of 2023 Except for a handful nearly all of them are built for Windows only The latest Call of Duty is Windows-only Cyberpunk 2077 is Windows-only Grand Theft Auto 5 one of the best-selling games of all time is Windows-only The list goes on With almost no chance that major game developers will ever bother bringing their games to Linux natively Valve the company behind Steam has taken matters into its own hands Driven by the need to make its handheld Steam Deck which is powered by Linux a success Valve has been working on a compatibility layer called Proton Built on top of work done by others over the years Proton translates the Windows-specific bits and enables games built for Windows to run on Linux-based systems Proton is not perfect and some games still have major issues But according to ProtonDB a website that tracks compatibility more than 4300 games are verified to work well on the Linux-powered Steam Deck while over 13000 are playable This is a sea change compared to a few years ago Windows is still an important business for Microsoft with the OS generating $215 billion of revenue in fiscal 2023 which ended on June 30 The dominance of Windows also contributes to the dominance of Microsofts Office suite of productivity software as well as ancillary products like OneDrive cloud storage Windows will also be critical in Microsofts efforts to monetize its massive investments in artificial intelligence (AI) Copilot in Windows is an early attempt at an AI-powered assistant and while its functionality is limited it could evolve into a powerful tool for Windows users On the commercial side Microsoft already charges $30 per user per month for an AI-powered assistant that integrates with its Office applications Microsoft is likely aiming to eventually generate recurring revenue from AI-powered features built into Windows Windows will remain the dominant OS for the foreseeable future but the progress made in bringing PC games to Linux-based systems will likely peel away some tech-savvy users Windows accounted for just 10% of Microsofts revenue in fiscal 2023 but its dominance drives revenue in other parts of the company Windows is going to be at the center of Microsofts push to turn AI into a real business and any market

still the cloud leader But Microsoft is quickly closing the gap While Microsoft doesnt disclose revenue figures for its Azure cloud infrastructure analyst figures suggest that five years ago it was half as big as AWS Now its about three-quarters the size of its top rival analysts estimate Part of Microsofts recent momentum is because of artificial intelligence Amy Hood the companys finance chief said on Microsofts Jan 30 earnings call that 6 points of revenue growth in the Azure and cloud services division came from AI in the latest period up from 3 points the prior quarter In total revenue at Azure increased 30% in the quarter compared with 13% year-over-year growth at AWS Microsoft has been adding graphics processing units (GPUs) to its data centers so that clients can run AI models in Azure That includes GPT-4 a large language model that enables text conversations with OpenAIs ChatGPT chatbot Many businesses have been adding similar generative AI capabilities to their products We now have 53000 Azure AI customers CEO Satya Nadella told analysts on the companys earnings call Jamin Ball partner at investment firm Altimeter Capital said it seems that some companies are considering Azure specifically because of the excitement surrounding AI and Microsofts perceived lead in the market due to its close relationship with OpenAI AWS took months to come out with a model that could go up against GPT-4 The company is now offering a number of models in addition to its own including one from Anthropic which Amazon backed On the companys fourth-quarter earnings call Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said that AWS offers the most expansive collection of compute instances with Nvidia chips and that customers including Airbnb and Snap are using its homegrown AI processors An AWS spokesperson referred CNBC to Jassys comments from the earnings call including that the company added more incremental revenue in the quarter than any other cloud provider as far as we can tell Jassy also said that generative AI is expected to ultimately drive tens of billions of dollars of revenue for Amazon over the next several years As it stands now Azure is growing much faster And as cloud infrastructure has become a bigger part of Microsoft making up around 29% of the companys total revenue its also become a meaningful contributor of profit Microsoft which recently surpassed Apple to become the worlds most valuable public company generated almost $83 billion in net income in 2023 up from $67 billion the previous year The Intelligent Cloud segment containing Azure generated 46% of Microsofts total operating income up from about 27% in 2016 In addition to providing basic computing and storage Microsoft offers a variety of services for developers including high-margin databases and monitoring tools Gross margin in Microsofts cloud group widened from 42% in 2016 to 72% in the most recent quarter The division includes commercial Office subscriptions the commercial part of LinkedIn and Dynamics 365 enterprise software as well as Azure Hood has said efficiency gains can come from improvements in power cooling data center design chips and software Yun Kim an analyst at Loop Capital said in a note that Azures revenue growth could pick up We expect its Azure business to accelerate starting next FY (or C2H) as tailwinds from new workloads from both

February 2024 A unique partnership between Microsoft NAB and Communications and Information Technology Training (CITT) – a not-for-profit industry-based organisation – is helping improve the resilience of the state’s small business sector while providing cybersecurity students with practical industry experience The Student and Small Business Cyber Risk Project supported by the Victorian Government partners Victorian TAFE students who are enrolled in a cybersecurity qualification with an industry mentor and a small business in Victoria to conduct cybersecurity risk assessments Following a successful pilot in 2023 involving 64 students and 24 small businesses organisers are now calling for more small businesses and mentors to sign up for the 2024 intake They expect to enrol 200 new students this year with plans to roll out nationally over the next two years As part of the program students are partnered with mentors from NAB and Microsoft to conduct a cybersecurity risk assessment using publicly available tools The small business will receive a report with steps they could take to improve cybersecurity in their business “A lot of smaller companies struggle with a lack of skills or understanding of where to start when it comes to cybersecurity” said Mark Anderson National Security Officer at Microsoft Australia and New Zealand In many cases taking a few simple steps can be enough to protect against 99 per cent of cyber threats It’s been great to be involved in this unique and highly scalable program which is contributing to strengthening our nation’s cybersecurity defences – Mark Anderson National Security Officer Microsoft A/NZ According to the Australian Signals Directorate’s recent Annual Cyber Threat Report the average cost per cybercrime reported for a small business has risen by 15 per cent year on year to $46000 in 2023 Further research from NAB shows small businesses feel they are ill-prepared in the face of cyberattacks Only 15 per cent of small to medium enterprises (SMEs) in Australia conduct extensive training around scams and other cyber risks while only 4 in 10 felt that they were vigilant around their cybersecurity “As Australia’s largest business bank we feel a deep responsibility to support the small business sector” said Sandro Bucchianeri Chief Security Officer NAB “They are a huge driver of economic growth employing two in every three Australian workers Yet they remain one of the most vulnerable communities to cyber attack as they continue to face increasing costs of goods ongoing labour shortages and rising rates of cybercrime” “As we’ve seen over recent weeks cyber criminals are stepping up their tactics targeting high profile Australian businesses on a near-daily basis impacting everyone from our hospital system legal system and business community Initiatives like these will help the small business sector respond if they are caught up in a hack” said Mr Bucchianeri Partnering cyber students with small businesses The Victorian Government has invested approximately $400000 in the program with in-kind contributions from other stakeholders taking the program’s value to nearly $1 million The program is aligned with the Victorian state’s five-year $50 million cyber strategy and its $64 million Digital Jobs program both of which were launched in 2021 “The Allan Labor Government is proud to invest in exciting projects that enhance Victoria’s high reputation as a leading digital economy” said Minister for Skills and TAFE Gayle Tierney “The Student and Small Business Cyber Risk Project is a great example of government and industry working together to ensure Victoria has the skilled workers needed for in-demand industries like cybersecurity” Students who complete the program receive an industry certificate verifying their satisfactory participation in the project and improving their readiness to participate in the workforce “What makes this program unique is that it’s industry-driven industry-based and built in conjunction with organisations who know cybersecurity and Australia’s small business sector” said Dominic Schipano National Executive Officer at CITT “The program empowers TAFE students in Victoria on their journey to build a rewarding career in cybersecurity with not only a qualification but also valuable on-the-job experience At the same time it gives Victorian small businesses access to skilled and employable talent who will help them better understand cybersecurity within their business” Collaborative partnership enables innovative approach to cyber skilling CITT is managing the program and is closely supported by Microsoft and NAB alongside the Victorian TAFE Network The Victorian Small Business Commission and Victorian Skills Authority Microsoft in conjunction with CITT and its partners has developed the program’s learning resources and alongside NAB has provided mentors and facilitators who supervise the students during their placement with the participating small businesses Cybersecurity is a team sport and we all have a role to play This program is a great example of the impact that public-private partnerships can have in fortifying our nation’s cyber defences and paving the way for a safer digital landscape – Mark Anderson National Security Officer Microsoft A/NZ From a small business participant: One of the first businesses selected to participate in the project was Bravo Careers a Melbourne-based career development consultancy that offers services across ANZ Asia Europe and India Client Relations Manager Jonathon Hazelton was responsible for overseeing the project and the four students who were selected to assess the company “As a career-focused consultancy we manage a significant amount of sensitive data every day We’re also a small company and as with many businesses our size we have faced challenges in the past that made cybersecurity a priority But as a small group of employees this can be challenging as none of us are experts in this area That’s why we were interested in participating in the project” said Mr Hazelton “The risk assessment was key in helping us understand our current systems and processes and to receive guidelines and recommendations on how to improve them “ As a result of that we were able to make more informed decisions and develop a clear cybersecurity policy that covers aspects such as data collection access and storage It also helped us to adopt a more proactive cybersecurity approach rather than waiting for problems to happen – Jonathan Hazelton Bravo

IBM has worked on AI since the 1950s long before Bill Gates and Paul Allen founded Microsoft in 1975 IBMs latest AI platform watsonx debuted in the beginning of the third quarter last year Adoption quickly ramped up Big Blues watsonx book of business in the fourth quarter was about double that in the third quarter The companys AI success helped to propel Q4 revenue to 4% year-over-year growth reaching $174 billion Thanks to watsonxs rapid adoption Big Blues data and AI division saw 5% year-over-year revenue growth in 2023 An example of IBMs AI tech in action is the Sevilla Fútbol Clubs use of watsonx to analyze soccer players across thousands of scouting reports to determine who to sign Along with this compelling technology another strength in IBMs AI arsenal is its army of over 20000 consultants dedicated to artificial intelligence They help Big Blues clients develop and implement an AI strategy CEO Arvind Krishna noted on the Q4 earnings call We are the only provider today that offers both a technology stack and consulting services for deploying and managing generative AI IBMs consulting division saw Q4 revenue jump 6% year over year to $5 billion Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella sees AI as the next major wave of computing So the company is pushing hard to be a leader in the AI race As a result Microsoft became a multibillion-dollar investor in ChatGPT creator OpenAI and has incorporated AI technology across a wide spectrum of products As Nadella explained on a recent earnings call By infusing AI across every layer of our tech stack were winning new customers and helping drive new benefits and productivity gains For example in its fiscal second quarter ended Dec 31 Microsoft had over 1 million subscribers to its AI software development tool GitHub Copilot a 30% quarter-over-quarter increase from the first quarter And Microsofts AI approach has led to revenue growth The companys Q2 revenue was up 18% over the prior year to $62 billion Thanks to AI Microsoft looks to be undergoing a new wave of success This AI boon follows years of rising revenue from the companys shift toward cloud computing when Nadella became CEO a decade ago Microsofts Azure platform enabled this cloud computing shift and Azure continues to experience growth now that AI has been added to it The platform saw a 30% year-over-year increase in fiscal Q2 sales With Microsoft and IBM providing strong AI offerings its ideal to invest in both companies But before choosing just one of these tech stalwarts there are a few other factors to consider IBM boasts a more attractive dividend currently yielding over 3% compared to Microsofts less than 1% yield Moreover IBMs Q4 free cash flow (FCF) of $61 billion was an improvement over the prior years $52 billion This solidifies the companys ability to fund its dividend payments which it has increased for 28 consecutive years However Microsoft possesses varied businesses such as digital advertising and its ubiquitous Windows operating system This provides the company with income diversification For example its video games division saw a 61% year-over-year revenue jump in Q2 thanks to its acquisition of Activision Blizzard Putting these factors together along with its AI successes Microsoft edges out IBM as the better investment Microsoft stock retreated from its 52-week high recently so now is a good time to take advantage of the price dip and buy shares Where to invest $1000 right now When our analyst team has a stock tip it can pay to listen After all the newsletter they have run for two decades Motley Fool Stock Advisor has more than tripled the market* They just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now… and Microsoft made the list -- but there are 9 other stocks you may be overlooking See the 10 stocks *Stock Advisor returns as of February 20 2024 Robert Izquierdo has positions in International Business Machines and Microsoft The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Microsoft The Motley Fool recommends International Business Machines and recommends the following options: long January 2026 $395 calls on Microsoft and short January 2026 $405 calls on Microsoft The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy Better AI Stock: Microsoft vs IBM was originally published by The Motley Fool Related Quotes"

Now","2/25/2024","https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/stocks/MSFT-Q/pressreleases/24334293/2-strong-buy-rated-russell-2000-stocks-to-scoop-up-now/","The large- and mid-cap players have received a lot of attention since the artificial intelligence (AI) rush began in 2023 Most tech titans including Microsoft (MSFT) Amazon (AMZN) and Nvidia (NVDA) recently reported better-than-expected quarterly results and their stock prices have soared this year However the Russell 2000 Index (RUT) which tracks the performance of a large basket of small-cap companies should not be overlooked Two small-cap companies that I believe investors should be curious about right now are semiconductor company Semtech (SMTC) and energy company Matador Resources (MTDR) as Wall Street sees significant upside for these two stocks this year Investing in innovative tech companies as the AI era progresses is a wise decision Meanwhile including energy stocks in your portfolio will provide diversification as global energy demand continues to increase Lets find out more about why Semtech and Matador Resources are attractive investments now Founded in 1960 Semtech focuses on developing high-performance analog and mixed-signal semiconductors that can be used for a range of applications Semtech may not be directly competing with the larger players in the semiconductor industry However as AI advances Semtech has the opportunity to expand its business on a larger scale In the third quarter of fiscal 2024 Semtechs net sales increased 131% year on year to $2009 million However adjusted earnings per share (EPS) fell to $002 down from $065 in the year-ago quarter Both revenue and earnings surpassed analysts expectations In fact analysts expected the company to report a loss for the quarter but it reported a profit One of Semtechs key products is LoRa (Long Range) a low-power wide-area technology It has made significant headway in the Internet of Things (IoT) space offering long-range low-power connectivity to smart devices Management stated in the Q3 earnings call that many European-based utilities are interested in adopting LoRa-based solutions Furthermore its broad product portfolio serves a wide range of markets including data centers automotive and medical Recently the company announced its new product the AirLink XR60 5G Router Solution which will provide “5G and Wi-Fi 6 performance in an ultra-compact and ultra-rugged design for highly demanding environments” Looking ahead management expects macroeconomic conditions to cause a drop in net sales in Q4 to around $190 million (plus or minus $10 million) Furthermore EPS is projected to range from a loss of $005 to a profit of $006 By comparison analysts predict a loss of $004 per share on revenue of $1907 million in Q4 Analysts expect Semtech to continue reporting profits into fiscal 2024 Overall Wall Street rates Semtech stock a “strong buy” Out of the 12 analysts that cover SMTC 10 rate it a “strong buy” while one recommends a “moderate buy” and one suggests a “hold” While Semtech stock is down 62% YTD analysts average price target of $3140 suggests that Wall Street sees potential upside of about 546% over the next 12 months Wall Street has assigned a high target price of $42 for SMTC which could mean a potential price jump of 106% from current levels Founded in 2003 Matador Resources has become a key player in oil (CLJ24) and natural gas (NGH24) exploration The company currently operates seven drilling rigs in the US Matador’s shares have returned 2366% over the last five years The outstanding revenue growth from $8995 million in 2018 to $306 billion in 2022 mirrors the stock price performance Earnings have increased at a compounded annual growth rate of 239% during the same period On a YTD basis Matador stock has gained 58% compared to the S&P 500’s ($SPX) gain of 73% In the recent third quarter Matador produced over 135000 barrels of oil and natural gas equivalent (BOE) per day claiming it to be its best quarter of total production Matador like most energy companies pays quarterly dividends It yields 133% while the energy sector average is 424% Although the yield isnt particularly appealing the companys dividend payments have been consistent with a recent increase from $015 to $060 per share This is the fourth dividend increase since Matador began paying dividends in 2021 Furthermore the forward payout ratio of 95% indicates plenty of room for dividend growth At the end of the quarter the companys adjusted free cash flow was $1446 million Aside from dividend payments the company uses its free cash flow to pay down debt and invest in acquisitions Management stated that positive FCF has helped the company increase its acreage position to over 150000 net acres in the Delaware Basin The company also plans to add an eighth rig in the first quarter of 2024 Matador expects to finish the year strong with increased production and debt repayments Approximately 145000 BOE per day are expected in the fourth quarter Analysts are looking for revenue to increase by 13% to $799 million in the fourth quarter Revenue and earnings are expected to rise by 208% and 15% respectively in 2024 Turning to Wall Street Matador stock is a strong buy among analysts Out of the 10 analysts covering the stock seven rate it a “strong buy” two recommend a “moderate buy” and one suggests a “hold” The average analyst target price for the stock is $7009 which implies a potential upside of 154% in the next 12 months The high estimate for MTDR suggests the stock could go as high as 35% from current levels Provided Content: Content provided by Barchart The Globe and Mail was not involved and material was not reviewed prior to publication How much is

Bill Mann: Yes Nice to be seen Dylan Lewis: To see and be seen and be heard as well Bill were going to have you heard as well Weve got to look at the necessity-based approach to retail centers and shopping centers weve got earnings from Tesla and Netflix and weve got some legacy names that might be worth a closer look for investors Were going to start with the new largest name on the market Andy This is a company that we have seen at the mountaintop before It is there again this week Microsoft opened as the most valuable company in the world passing Apple as they sometimes do jockeying for the crown of most valuable company in the world What do you make of Microsoft now a little over $3 trillion Andy Cross: It is that jockeying right guys? Theyre neck and neck theyre right there By the time someone listens to this they maybe be switched around again So theyre both outstanding companies obviously some of the most successful businesses Certainly in our lifetimes if not almost ever when you think about just the quality of these businesses and what they have earned in both the marketplace Interesting Apple this month so year to date I know its only been a few weeks guys but the stock is up a percent or two or so When you look at the rest of those large tech companies Microsoft done very well and of course Nvidia driving so many of the gains so I think you will just see it continue They are now separating Microsoft is starting to separate itself because its tied to so many things and we saw what it is now trying to do in the gaming business with its Activision Blizzard acquisition of almost $70 billion So they will be neck and neck It will be very interesting to see how Apple if it starts to think about really exploiting or using I should say its strength in the computer space and the individual space the consumer market as it thinks about AI and all those investments We still have really not heard a whole lot about that from Apple yet Dylan Lewis: Bill I love checking in on Microsoft and the story because it is a good reminder for investors It was a long road to becoming a $3 trillion company and one of the most valuable companies in the world period let alone the largest and there were a lot of periods where it didnt seem as inevitable as it does now for Microsoft Bill Mann: No for a long period of time Microsoft was pretty much thought to be an also-ran It had a 14 year period in which it did not reach its previous high so Microsoft was not a company that was being taken seriously as a competitor within that space anymore and now Id like to put frames around things $3 trillion means that Microsoft is worth $428 per man woman and child on the planet Dylan Lewis: Its humongous Bill Mann: Its humongous and you have to wonder at what point does that just simply become too large for any company to be able to generate that level of economic return So its a massive number Im not saying they cant I mean I think a lot of people have underestimated Microsoft for a long time Four hundred and twenty eight bucks thats a lot Dylan Lewis: Thats incredible If you add Apple and Microsoft together you have almost $1000 per every person Bill Mann: Apple by the way has been buying back shares Theyre not committed to being the largest company in the world by market cap If they did they wouldnt be buying back shares at all I mean Andys exactly right maybe there have never been businesses that have been better at generating returns for investors or economic returns than the two of these Dylan Lewis: One of the ways Microsoft is looking for that next phase of growth is gaming The company recently acquired Activision Blizzard and we did see it was not all good news over at Microsoft this week There were announced layoffs of 1900 employees in gaming many of them are part of the newly acquired Activision Blizzard Group Andy what do you make of this as youre processing the news itself and the broader layoff picture were seeing? Andy Cross: Well first on the news Dylan and not surprising anytime a companys going to make a significant acquisition theyre going to think of how to rationalize costs and a lot of these I imagine theres a lot of overhead corporate costs dual roles theyve talked about and those just are redundant and it doesnt really make sense for the acquiring company as painful as it is for those layoffs to keep those roles and think about trying to get the two companies together in the back office side What is interesting though is this does come on top of the layoffs that Microsoft had a year ago Many tech companies as we were seeing not just in the gaming space I mean were seeing Twitch were seeing Unity were seeing Riot Games they are definitely simplifying reducing their work forces because of some of the gaming slowdown overall But it does echo with what we are seeing across a lot of the tech sphere when so many companies made so many investments in people Namely because I think they were worried they wouldnt be able to get people During the COVID period they were just worried about talent the grab for talent They made those large investments in those people They are now starting to deal with that because they are seeing that there are different ways to get value from their assets and it maybe it isnt so much in all of the people especially as you think about things like how does AI or how does this technology in general improve the operations of a company that doesnt require having all those employees? So its painful but it is a rationalization cost that large companies need to go through Bill Mann: Some of it has to do with the fact that Microsoft immediately canceled a game thats been in development for six years code named Odyssey at Activision So obviously a long time investment that Microsoft didnt seem to think was worth to continue to make A lot of it also has to do with the fact that we are in a different environment now in terms of the cost of funds and so in 2020 you could throw money at anything and there was almost no loss to it because money was free Its not free anymore even at a company like Microsoft Andy Cross: Itll be very interesting to see how this all works out with Microsoft as they continue to push more aggressively at the cloud How much is X-box units versus X-box cloud and all those different subscriptions? So I think the acquisition is exciting It is unfortunate and painful for those people who had to let go Bill Mann: Always have to remember that that is a human story Andy Cross: Yeah sure Dylan Lewis: Before we go to break were going to go global It has been a tough run for the Chinese stock market and for companies based in China over the last few years but if youre paying attention to some major moves Bill things might be getting a little interesting Alibaba co-founders Jack Ma and Joseph Tsai recently bought $200 million in Alibaba shares Is this signal? Is this this noise? Bill Mann: Did they? [laughs] Dylan Lewis: Was it them? Bill Mann: Was it them? Six trillion dollars in losses in the Chinese stock market from its peak and that by the way that is Apple plus Microsoft just wiped off their market gap And by the way they didnt start with an Apple at a Microsoft So it has been a brutal run for China and its possible you are seeing some moves within China They reduced their banking reserve ratios that were required in order to get some liquidity into the market and you are starting to see some big purchases by some of the big shareholders of these companies and I think it is very interesting that they came in with $50 million of Jack Mas money and $150 million of Joseph Tsais money that they are backing Alibaba the way they have Because Alibaba has come up against some real competition in the form of Pinduoduo and its Temu platform Dylan Lewis: Bill when I look at China I feel like Ive seen different chapters of risk and concern with the overall picture there Some of it was for a very long time government intervention and the lines between private and public and the strength of public and private enterprises Some of it also was demographic story Knowing that were seeing slowing demographics and slowing population growth were going to see some declines there is there anything else that youre worried about as you look to that picture or anything you feel like were getting wrong as we look at some of those stories? Bill Mann: Im sure were getting a lot of things wrong in China but it bears remembering that China has over the last couple of years gone from being a government by committee to really government by one guy So there are some real concerns in China There never were in place any real shareholder protections particularly for international investors into Chinese companies and I think that people have you know theyve finally been burned enough times that theyre not that excited to go back There were huge withdrawals from the Chinese market by western investors at the end of this last year That has continued apace I think China is at the point where they need to prove that they are a market that is safe for foreign investors before people will get excited about any of the demographic shifts Actually the demographic shifts arent that awesome so that might be anything on top but it has always been the case Hey a billion people and a half in China thats a huge market It remains to be the case but I think people are three times bitten and four times shy at this point Dylan Lewis: Is that to say youre not following Jack Ma and Joseph Tsai into shares of Alibaba? Bill Mann: Alibaba is a company that I actually feel fairly positively about and have in fact I believe in China if you want to invest in there just play the hits and Alibaba is one of them Dylan Lewis: Coming up after the break weve got a run down on the earnings beat with the results from Tesla and Netflix Stay right here This is Motley Fool Money Welcome back to Motley Fool Money I am Dylan Lewis joined in studio by Bill Mann and Andy Cross Gentlemen it was a busy week for earnings so we are going to dive right in Bill Tesla shares down 10 percent after the company reported this week Results were below expectations But am I reading it right that a lot of the attention was on the forward-looking growth estimates and a little bit less on what we saw in the reported quarter? Bill Mann: I think that thats probably true I mean in the run-up to the earnings Elon Musk the very interesting CEO of this company came out and said that he believed that were there not protections put into place that the Chinese EV manufacturers would pretty much demolish Thats a direct quote competition around the world If youve got a $600 billion company that primarily does electric vehicles outside of China thats something that I think you should pay attention to I mean the quarter was expected for them Im actually surprised the stock went down as much as it did based on the results because we already knew about the price cuts around the world for their existing fleet Dylan Lewis: I was going to say I mean I think we had to know margins were going to get compressed because of what you were talking about there with the price cuts Weve seen the growing traction and the growing deliveries by BYD We dont see them on the roads here in the United States but that is a story weve been aware of Are you surprised at all that this was the reaction or was there anything in there that really surprised you? Outside of whats getting all the headlines? Bill Mann: Look I think that I think that Elon Musk will remain a complete enigma The fact that he came out and you had balls longtime balls like Dan Ives come out and say the things they were talking about during the conference call These were not executives who were taking responsibility for margin compression They were not taking responsibility for some of the mistakes that were happening or the environment that Tesla is in I think youve got to be mindful of the fact that there actually are many more questions that are being asked about Tesla including things in governance like Elon Musk came out and basically said that he wants 25 percent of the company as if hes not already deeply incentivized enough with the billions and billions of ownership he has of the company There are some real questions there A lot of them have been a long time coming Dylan Lewis: Tough week for Tesla great week for Netflix Andy shares the streamer up 15 percent this week following earnings that showed the company can still add subscribers Andy Cross: The story of two different leaders in two different spaces I mean this was a clear case of the clear leader in streaming Showcasing gosh Oscar Worthy status By adding 131 million streaming subscribers pushing this stock to a two-year high still far below 20 percent below its all-time high But as they continue to make investments including the WWE Raw investment they made for $5 billion reportedly over 10 years The outstanding strategy of testing and learning into all these different parts of the market International expansion live entertainment documentaries sports documentaries gaming With really no corporate acquisitions they do it all internal house Netflix is now the go-to space for creators because they know theyre going to get the eyeballs 260 million global subscribers like I just mentioned They added 1312 million this quarter Thats 50 percent above expectations and the most since 2020 It almost doubled the ads they had a year ago The United States was the slowest growing one of the slowest-growing parts of the market But they still added 28 million In the US and in Canada the advertising membership grew 70 percent and equals 40 percent of all new subs in markets where they have the advertising tier a lot of those new additions are coming in the advertising tier revenue was up 125 percent versus up six percent a year ago operating income was at 15 billion That was up 172 percent When you just look at the Netflix story they continue to widen their lead over the competition which is a little bit of a disarray I think its safe to say The programming theyre making and the success theyre having on both the programming for their viewers who see Netflix as the place that I have to maintain my streaming subscription above anything else and thats showing up in the results Bill Mann: I thought it was super interesting in their report that they basically came out and said that they intend to raise prices a little bit over time This is a company that is fully confident with where they are right now What a shock from two years ago Dylan Lewis: Unbelievable one of my questions here Andy with looking at Netflix is we have seen the push for were going to crack down on password sharing Weve seen the push into ads Do we have to continue to expect this growth? Do we have to think those were quick levers and maybe that we cant expect that growth going forward? Andy Cross: Oh gosh I think just the different ways Like theyre just starting to get into the gaming They had some grand theft auto stuff last year Like I mentioned in different documentaries Theyre going to have different live programming events The WWE that acquisition of that content for Raw in the licensing agreement and international other assets that plays really well into their strength Again I know $5 billion and a lot of money Theyre going to invest 17 billion in programming just this year alone But thats the way that Netflix has been able to build these properties out They leak out a little content they try things they see what works they dont they get the data and they make those smart investments that play out for their members I think itll be Im not worried about their ability to innovate and find new things for us to enjoy on Netflix Dylan Lewis: Were going to wrap the earnings chat by checking in on Big Blue Bill IBM shares up eight percent post earnings sending the stock to its highest level since 2013 What has the market so excited about IBM? Bill Mann: IBM is like the nickelback of AI companies Isnt it? Like nobody wants to admit that they like it because I mean its a company thats disappointed for so long It is one of the few companies in the last decade that Warren Buffett bought and sold in disgust because they didnt do any of the things that he thought that they were going to do But IBM has a 25-year library and a head start in AI Theyve been doing it for a long time It is not by accident that you go back and you remember that Big Blue which was an AI device was IBMs and thats what competed against Gary Kasparov and chess That was a long time ago They are now seeing the market catch up with them One of the reasons that you dont see IBM talked about it as an AI company is that they dont do anything customer-facing They are doing things which make a lot of sense When you think about some of the issues with Chat GPT of providing like a ring fence around companys private data Allows it to interact with public data in AI without compromising that private data Its a really really interesting business Nice to see them get a bid Theyre at a multi-year high And by multi I mean many many year high I think it may be just the beginning for IBM Dylan Lewis: Bill I cant help but think back to the conversation we were having earlier about Microsoft and that lost period I think theres probably a younger generation of investors that have not had IBM on their radar at all because it has been during this very tough period for the business It sounds like youre saying maybe this is one that should be on peoples radar Bill Mann: I think it absolutely should be Look back and it wasnt that many years ago that the Fang acronym was invented and they left Microsoft off that was the biggest winner to me IBM has the potential and thats a really important word to be on the same trajectory as an Nvidia or a Microsoft A company that has been minding its business and not really in a wonderful way for a long time but they have actually been still building things while they were going they invested in R&D the entire time I think youre now starting to see a payoff Dylan Lewis: IBM saying hey I want to be a rock star Its your nickel back example there Bill Mann Andy Cross were going to see a little bit later in the show Up next weve got a rundown on why grocery stores are a bigger part of the retail picture Stay right here youre listening to Motley Fool Money Welcome back to Motley Fool Money Im Dylan Lewis As some of you are listening to this very radio show you might be out on the roads driving your car maybe passing a strip mall or shopping center and you might notice that the formula for retail has changed a bit in recent years Increasingly supermarkets and medical services are the features of the modern shopping center and thats partially the work of Jeffrey Edison Hes the co-founder and CEO of Philips Edison Company They are a real estate investment trust focused on retail with over 275 locations in 31 states Motley Fool Moneys Deidre Woollard caught up with Edison to understand the importance of necessity based goods in retail what consumers want right now both in terms of concepts and convenience and how foot traffic is trending in shopping centers Deidre Woollard: I want to talk about the journey of this company because you were in the private markets a long time Youve only been publicly traded since 2021 You came to the market in an interesting time How is being public changed the company or changed how you think about things if at all? Jeffrey Edison: Surprise I hate to date myself but weve been doing this for 30 years We started the business 30 years ago Bought a grocery anchored shopping center in Virginia and weve continued for a sustained period of time now 30 years staying in that business and developing what we think is the best team operating in that particular niche Our niche is we buy shopping centers that are anchored by the number 1 or 2 grocer and theyre in markets where the market supports not only the grocer which is about 35-40 percent of the space but also the small stores What weve targeted is that center where when somebody wakes up on a Saturday in the suburbs they go to get their necessity based goods They get their groceries they get their hair done they get their nails done maybe they get a workout in and get a smoothie We want to be the place near their home where they go to do that type of thing We continue to build this team over a sustained period of time You just started with friends and family and went into institutional funds and then got into the non traded at space raised equity there and we got to a size where being a listed public company and the access that gave us to capital was a logical next step in that process It really hasnt been a major change for us I mean weve been SEC filing for over 10 years so all the reporting stuff was all common stuff that weve done and were actually one of the only companies to come public where it was simpler from a reporting standpoint than it was before when we had multiple different groups Its been for us a journey but where were learning a lot about our new set of investors and how that and a lot of our investors have stayed with us over that period of time through that whole process and have been great supporters of us Those were almost all retail investors Now were much more involved with the institutional investors But our retail investors are still at a core ownership of the company Deidre Woollard: You mentioned big grocery stores one of the biggest ones has been involved in this merger Im talking about Kroger and Albertsons of course major tenant of yours We just found out that its going to be a little while longer before that merger takes place They pushed it back Does that new extended timeline have any impact on you or how are you thinking about that merger in general? Jeffrey Edison: I think in general if it happens it will be a positive impact on us because it will take a grocer that is going through other stuff and put them in a much more really strong financial position The market still is very reluctant to say whether its going to happen or not Albertsons trading 15 percent below where the strike price is on the merger The market which we look at pretty closely is still questioning whether theyre going to get SEC approval and what that process will go through These are really strong grocery locations where they will be grocery stores on a long term basis That improved capital that will come back with a Kroger ownership we think would have a positive impact on our overall portfolio Were Krogers largest landlord were Publics second largest landlord Were working with the grocers and have been now for 30 years on how their business works and where they can be successful Deidre Woollard: Interesting Well I listened to your investor day and one of the things that I heard you and the team talk about is medical Ive heard this from other red operators as well Tell us a little bit more about it What type of medical are you seeing? Are you seeing chains or local operators? Whats the story there? Jeffrey Edison: Retail is always changing and what a lot of people are realizing is that they have to do what the consumer wants and that is in all parts of retail Whats happening and we call it medtail Ln the medtail side is theyre seeing the advantages primarily on a cost basis but also on a convenience basis for the customer being closer to them Were seeing a wide variety of different medical uses coming into our shopping centers They are long term players who will be in our centers for a long term They bring additional convenience to the markets that were in Theyre an important part of our growth in Tennessee over time It includes everything from the chiropractor to the physical therapy to the dentist to urgent care All of those are part of that and some people are even including veterinary services for the animals in that medtail category Its a strong growing part of the demand for our shopping centers Deidre Woollard: Im wondering what foot traffic trends youve seen in the post pandemic time Certainly we always talk about the death of retail being overstated Have you seen a lot of return to your shopping centers? Jeffrey Edison: Yeah I think the days of that conversation are limited Its almost all being driven by two factors one the increased demand and the other the lack of new supply For the last 10 years theres been very little new retail product Theres been more destroyed retail than there has been a created retail What thats done its really limited the supply At the same time weve had a great operating environment for our suburban located centers Because if you look at suburbanization thats a trend that has continued which we think is very positive for us Working from home is a big part of that because people are around our centers more of the day Rather than being in the office and going down to have lunch theyll go to the shopping center and have lunch Thats been very positive for us Jeffrey Edison: Theres a sense of buying local which is our centers are great for 27 percent of our neighbors are local in nature and theyve been with us on average nine years in our centers These are bringing something unique to the merchandising mix of our center and an important part of why our centers have continued to operate at a really high level I think were 98 percent occupied today the highest level weve been at in the 30 year history Its a really positive operating by Those macro tailwinds are not short term I mean from our perspective we think theres going to continue to be suburbanization continue to be work from home continue to be migration to the sun belt All of those are long term trends and we believe that rents have to go up somewhere between 50 and 100 percent before really new development is economically warranted which is a major move Deidre Woollard: What do you think in terms of how tenants are using space? Weve seen so much change to curbside pick up and things like that Jeffrey Edison: The retailers are really good at what they do and theyre very good at reading where the consumer is Its very expensive to acquire new shoppers to your store so you dont want to lose any of your shoppers Because of that todays shopper wants an omnichannel approach to retail They want to be able to go and have BOPUS and pick it up at the store They want to go in and shop the store and they want to be able to order online and have it delivered to their house Our retailers have to have that omnichannel approach Its going to be long term successful from our opinion What weve done I think Ill get the numbers wrong a little bit but its like 90 percent of our grocers have BOPUS so that you can order it pick it up at the store and do it Its in the high 90s We have a front row to go which is our program where we have dedicated parking spaces for our small store spaces so they can get that Then weve had an extensive program of getting drive-throughs continuously added to our shopping center Again all the pieces that the consumer wants trying to create those for them Dylan Lewis: Listeners if you see something interesting related to investing while youre out in the world we want to hear about it Shoot any questions or ideas for show topics over to radio at Foolcom Coming up after the break Bill Mann and Andy Cross return with a couple of stocks on their radar Stay right here youre listening to Motley Fool Money As always people on the program may have interests in the stocks they talk about and the Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against Dont buy or sell anything based solely on what you hear Im Dylan Lewis joined again by Bill Mann and Andy Cross Weve got one more earning story before we get over to our radar stocks Andy its going to be a name that we dont talk about all the time on the show but I think its worth bringing up because some interesting results and some interesting insights and maybe to the future of streaming in what we saw from Comcast this week Andy Cross: Well in the news too after they hosted the Chiefs Bills playoff game on Peacock which was criticized a lot of course But when they decided to go purely with streaming but theres still 23 million viewers tuned into that That was a huge success and they talked a lot about that in the call I mean its $182 billion market cap company thats still smaller than Netflix is very interesting but still a very large company and many subscribers Of course the revenue was flat up 23 percent during the quarter EBITDA Theyre earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization flat Whats interesting though Dylan is that so much talk about the subscriber base The connected broadband subscribers were basically flat They continue to see people leave for video who dont want to have video and the phone But when you look at the broadband business and you look at their mobile business the mobile business actually is doing quite well Revenue with subscribers grew more than 20 percent in that quarter Broadband about flat What was really interesting is the Peacock that streaming platform that they have launched Revenues in Peacock was up 57 percent and hit 1 billion for the first time ever in a quarter The subscriber revenues were up 88 percent and advertising was up 50 percent If you back out some of the effects of the World Cup from last year so much talk about Peacock is that the future for Comcast it will be a big part of their growth is right now pretty much the only exciting part to the growth picture for Comcast But youve got a company that basically sells at 10-12 times earnings per share a middling grower stock not super exciting but also not super volatile If thats your interest Comcast might be worth it Dylan Lewis: I remember seeing the story that they had spent about $110 millions for the exclusive streaming rights to that playoff game Based on data we saw from Antenna they wound up with just under 3 million new subscribers during the days leading up to that game Do you feel like that was money well spent for Peacock? Andy Cross: I think it is If you just think again long term and the benefit and the more and more push toward streaming Their advertising business is strong on the streaming When you start looking at the investments theyre making in there and the experiences they have Of course with all the other advertising properties they have and with the theme parks and all that thing But making the right investments in Peacock and 23 million people viewing that That is an impressive number when you look at just the previous one of the other NFL games it was I think a second highest That game was on broadcast TV so this was just on Peacock Obviously well have to see the investments they make and will they ultimately pay out But I think from an initial go theres some excitement behind whats happening at Peacock Bill Mann: Was it actually an NFL game or was it actually just another Taylor site? Andy Cross: Yes exactly Now maybe if you X out the Chiefs and somebody else well have to see Dylan Lewis: That would be an incredibly captivating exclusive if they were able to get Taylor Swift exclusives I wouldnt be surprised if that drove three million sign-ups as well Andy Cross: I will say Peacock did lose $27 billion last year so they have a long way to go to catch up to the likes of Netflix But at least they are pushing aggressively into that streaming business Bill Mann: Thats one 200th of what China has lost Theyre in great shape Theyre fine To me ultimately its a sheriff eyeball They brought subscribers in Will those subscribers stick? It is only down to their willingness to continue to consume content from Peacock Andy Cross: Bill for folks watching the NFL games this weekend theres some splash around Peacock But also I think there are going to be a lot of ads for the sports betting sites DraftKings MGM and Caesars advertising heavily trying to get a lot of users a lot of new people acquired during this period Well have to wait until earnings to see if that pays off but what are some of your impressions seeing some of that? Bill Mann: I think its been a really fascinating five years for sports betting in the US Because you have gone from the major leagues keeping them at arms length Then all of a sudden like nudge nudge wink at arms length Now youre seeing things where ESPN is going to buy part of one of a betting network and NFL might buy part of ESPN Betting its not just that its here to stay but it is going to become a more and more integral part of the sports viewing experience for a lot of people I think Andy Cross: I think its going to be very hard for them to separate the egg whites and the egg yolk at a certain point it is going to be scrambled together Bill Mann: Thats a great allegory because I dont know how they would undo it if it does in fact impact competition Dylan Lewis: Lets get over to stocks on our radar Our man behind the glass Dan Boyd is going to hit you with a question Andy youre up first What are you looking at this? Andy Cross: Guys Im looking at Spotify ticker S-P-O-T Im sticking with the streaming theme here but turning more toward the ears rather than the eyes 226 million paying subscribers of about $11 per month which Im sure many of us are over 570 million total monthly active users They can access 100 million digital tracks 5 million accounting podcasts and thats a big part of what their business is A $41 billion market cap with almost 4 billion in cash and a little more than $12 billion of debt 88 percent of revenues come from those subscriptions But advertising is where some of the excitement is I know one thing were excited about they report earnings in a couple of weeks Im really interested to see what they are doing on the margin side They unfortunately had to go through some of those other layoffs we talked about They let go of a lot of people last year There was some excitement enthusiasm that might really boost the profitability Analysts are expecting profits this year so looking to see what Dan act and his team is saying about Spotify About the market the investments and the cost that theyve been able to save and how thats going to impact profits and margins Dylan Lewis: Dan a question about Spotify Dan Boyd: More of a comment about Spotify I hate their app I really do Its slow It sucks I dont love it but I still pay for it I think that says something about the company Dylan Lewis: It sure does Spotifys shareholders thank you for that Dan Dan Boyd: The hate listen is as good as a love listen Dylan Lewis: A shameless plug to our radio audience if you like Motley Fool Money Also available on Spotify as well as iTunes Wherever you get your podcasts Bill what is on your radar this week? Bill Mann: I want to talk about Mercado Libre There is something fascinating to me and this has been one of the most successful companies on the US exchanges over the last 20 years An absolute miraculous growth story in Latin America I say miraculous purposefully because their largest market has been Argentina Argentina is a long term disaster of an economy But they have a new president now Javier Milei who is saying that he wants to dollarize the economy That he wants Argentina to privatize a lot of their economy Its very heavily state owned Its going to be really interesting to see from Mercado Libres standpoint because if you think about it in some ways its an advantage for them to know how to operate in a basket case economy like Argentina If it becomes simpler to operate in Argentina does that help companies like Sea Limited who have been trying to come into Latin America if the ground becomes more simple? To me Mercado Libre has an opportunity but it has a little bit of risk wrapped up into it Dylan Lewis: Dan a question about Mercado Libre Dan Boyd: The stock has been a powerhouse over the last couple of years thats for sure But is the general strike that was called on Wednesday in Argentina going to be a problem looking forward Bill Mann: You said Wednesday? Not the Tuesday one or the last Wednesday one I think they will be fine They are very accustomed to operating in an economy where things are just a little wild Dylan Lewis: Dan which ones on your list? Dan Boyd: Its not Spotify Ill tell you that Dylan Lewis: Thats going to do it for this weeks Motley Fool Money radio show Show is mixed by Dan Boyd Im Dylan Lewis Thanks for listening Well see you next time Andy Cross has positions in Comcast MercadoLibre Microsoft Netflix Spotify Technology and Tesla Bill Mann has positions in MercadoLibre Dan Boyd has no position in any of the stocks mentioned Deidre Woollard has positions in Apple and Microsoft Dylan Lewis has positions in MercadoLibre and Spotify Technology The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Apple MercadoLibre Microsoft Netflix Spotify Technology Tesla and Unity Software The Motley Fool recommends Alibaba Group Comcast International Business Machines and Kroger The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy Invest better with The Motley Fool Get stock recommendations portfolio guidance and more from The Motley Fools premium services Making the world smarter happier and richer © 1995 - 2024 The Motley Fool All rights reserved Market data powered by Xignite and Polygonio"

As a group HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment with high oil prices and elevated interest rates could MSFT face a similar situation as it did in 2022 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months - or will it see a strong jump? The company surpassed the street estimates in the second quarter of FY2024 (FY July-June) posting an 18% y-o-y increase in net revenues to $62 billion It was due to a 13% y-o-y growth in productivity & business processes a 20% rise in the intelligent cloud and a 19% improvement in the more personal computing segments While the productivity & business processes were mainly up due to growth in Office 365 commercial revenues intelligent cloud benefited from Microsoft MSFT MSFT Azure and more personal computing from gaming-related income (Xbox content and services) On the cost front the total expenses as a % of revenues decreased in the quarter Overall it resulted in a 31% y-o-y jump in the net income to $219 billion The top-line rose by 15% y-o-y to $1185 billion in the first six months of FY 2024 It was because of higher revenues in each of the three segments – productivity & business process intelligent cloud and more personal computing Further the operating expenses as a % of revenues witnessed a favorable drop Altogether the net income grew 30% y-o-y to $442 billion Moving forward we expect the same momentum to continue in Q3 Overall Microsoft revenues are estimated to touch $2425 billion in FY2024 Additionally MSFT’s net income margin is likely to see a slight improvement in the year It will likely result in a net income of $847 billion and an annual GAAP EPS of $1143 This coupled with a P/E multiple of just below 37x points to a valuation of $419 MSFT Return Compared With Trefis Reinforced Portfolio Invest with Trefis Market Beating Portfolios See all Trefis Price Estimates"

Lets find out Unlike the Nasdaq-100 index the Dow is filled with companies many might consider boring like IBM Coca-Cola Intel and Walgreens Boots Alliance In fact the Dow has significantly underperformed its peers (the Nasdaq-100 and S&P 500) for some time due to the exclusion of some of the biggest tech companies ^SPXTR data by YCharts Microsoft has been a member of the Dow Jones since 1999 but its strong performance has only come recently Microsofts stock was essentially flat from its inclusion in 1999 to the start of 2015 MSFT data by YCharts However if you bought the stock at the start of 2015 youre up over 700% (an eight-bagger) This success came from Microsoft naming Satya Nadella CEO in February 2014 when he initiated Microsofts focus on cloud computing This helped Microsoft substantially grow and its cloud computing division Microsoft Azure continues to be one of the best reasons to invest in the stock today However Microsoft is also considered a strong AI investment Microsoft is rolling out its Copilot product which gives users a generative AI program to assist them with daily tasks This can be used to write emails create complicated formulas in Excel or provide programmers with the code they need in GitHub This relatively new product could be a massive revenue growth driver if it catches on With a $30 per user per month price tag it isnt cheap But if it can make employees more efficient it may be a bargain add-on Regardless few companies in the Dow can say they are more innovative than Microsoft But is the stock a buy? Microsofts business has been executing at a high level for a while and the future also looks strong As a result the stock has garnered a hefty premium MSFT PE Ratio data by YCharts If you discount a period in 2018 when earnings were artificially inflated Microsofts stock has not traded at these levels in recent history Thats some cause for concern as 35 times forward earnings is quite expensive Although Microsoft grew revenue a respectable 13% in Q1 of FY 2024 (ending Sept 30 2023) that growth isnt associated with trading in the mid-30s price-to-earnings ratio range There is a lot of froth in the market caused by AI expectations and investor enthusiasm about whether the Federal Reserve can pull off a soft landing Thats whats driving these high stock prices and it could spell trouble for some if the results arent as expected As a result I dont think Microsoft is a top stock to buy in the Dow Some businesses are growing faster (or as fast) and trading at a much cheaper valuation than Microsoft (like Visa and American Express) making them more attractive than Microsoft Microsoft isnt a bad business; the stock is just very expensive for its current business state American Express is an advertising partner of The Ascent a Motley Fool company Keithen Drury has positions in Visa The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Apple Microsoft and Visa The Motley Fool recommends Intel and International Business Machines and recommends the following options: long January 2023 $5750 calls on Intel long January 2024 $4750 calls on Coca-Cola long January 2025 $45 calls on Intel and short February 2024 $47 calls on Intel The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy Invest better with The Motley Fool Get stock recommendations portfolio guidance and more from The Motley Fools premium services Making the world smarter happier and richer © 1995 - 2024 The Motley Fool All rights reserved Market data powered by Xignite and Polygonio"

research investing resources and more Learn More This article was originally published on Foolcom All figures quoted in US dollars unless otherwise stated The launch of OpenAIs ChatGPT in November 2022 triggered a boom in artificial intelligence (AI) with countless tech firms pivoting their businesses toward the budding industry According to Grand View Research the AI market is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 37% through 2030 That trajectory would see the sector exceed a value of $1 trillion before the end of the decade suggesting theres no better time than the present to invest in AI-minded companies Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) are two attractive options with both companies investing heavily in the market and active in one of the biggest growth areas of AI: cloud computing These companies have emerged as some of the biggest threats in the industry and could deliver significant gains over the long term So lets take a closer look at these companies and determine whether Microsoft or Amazon is the better AI stock right now Microsoft was an early investor in AI sinking $1 billion into OpenAI in 2019 The company has since increased its investment achieving a 49% stake in the start-up The partnership with OpenAI has granted Microsoft exclusive access to some of the most advanced AI models which it has used to bring upgrades across its product lineup Over the last year elements of ChatGPT have been integrated into Microsofts search engine Bing a range of new AI tools have been added to its cloud platform Azure and its various Office services now offer improved productivity with the help of AI Microsoft is a behemoth in the tech world with millions of consumers and businesses relying on its software The popularity of its services and OpenAIs tech could be a powerful combination over the long term In the first quarter of 2024 (ending September 2023) Microsoft posted 13% in year-over-year revenue growth beating Wall Street estimates by nearly $2 billion Significant gains came from the companys cloud and productivity segments which saw revenue rise 19% and 13% respectively These divisions are hyperfocused on AI development which appears to be paying off Alongside free cash flow that hit $63 billion last year Microsoft is on a promising growth path The company has the brand power and financial resources to become one of the biggest threats in AI Amazon pulled off an impressive turnaround in 2023 after its stock plunged roughly 50% the year before Since last January its shares have soared over 62% thanks to a return to profitability in its e-commerce business and significant potential in AI Over the last year various cost-cutting measures have seen Amazons free cash flow skyrocket 427% to $16 billion The company has restructured its business to prioritize profit growth and is therefore investing heavily in its most profitable division: Amazon Web Services (AWS) The cloud platform is responsible for over 62% of Amazons operating income despite earning the lowest revenue out of its three segments In Q3 2023 AWS achieved nearly $7 billion in profits representing growth of 29% year over year The cloud market is expanding quickly boosted by the emergence of AI Businesses are increasingly looking for ways to boost efficiency with the help of AI and turning to cloud services to do so Meanwhile AWS leading 32% market share in cloud computing positions it well to see big gains as AI develops Amazons dominant position in cloud computing makes the company one of the best ways to invest in AI Microsoft and Amazon have emerged as two of the biggest names in AI over the last year These companies have similar potential in the industry thanks to booming cloud businesses and lucrative opportunities in other areas of tech As a result the best way to determine the better AI stock is to consider which is trading at a better value Data by YCharts PS Ratio = price-to-sales ratio PEG Ratio = price-to-earnings-to-growth ratio This chart compares Amazon and Microsofts price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratios These are helpful valuation metrics as they take into account a companys financial health against its stock price P/S is calculated by dividing a firms market cap by its revenue Meanwhile PEG divides a stocks price-to-earnings ratio by the growth rate of its earnings For both metrics the lower the figure the better the value In this case Amazons stock is a bargain compared to Microsoft So if youre between these two AI stocks Amazon is the better buy this month and a screaming buy at the start of 2024 This article was originally published on Foolcom All figures quoted in US dollars unless otherwise

Thats exactly what Russian government hackers want too On Friday Microsoft disclosed that the hacking group it calls Midnight Blizzard also known as APT29 or Cozy Bear — and widely believed to be sponsored by the Russian government — hacked some corporate email accounts including those of the company’s “senior leadership team and employees in our cybersecurity legal and other functions” Curiously the hackers didn’t go after customer data or the traditional corporate information they may have normally gone after They wanted to know more about themselves or more specifically they wanted to know what Microsoft knows about them according to the company Do you have more information about this hack? We’d love to hear from you From a non-work device you can contact Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai securely on Signal at +1 917 257 1382 or via Telegram Keybase and Wire @lorenzofb or email lorenzo@techcrunchcom You also can contact TechCrunch via SecureDrop “The investigation indicates they were initially targeting email accounts for information related to Midnight Blizzard itself” the company wrote in a blog post and SEC disclosure According to Microsoft the hackers used a “password spray attack” — essentially brute forcing — against a legacy account then used that account’s permissions “to access a very small percentage of Microsoft corporate email accounts” Microsoft did not disclose how many email accounts were breached nor exactly what information the hackers accessed or stole Company spokespeople did not immediately respond to a request for comment Microsoft took advantage of news of this hack to talk about how they are going to move forward to make itself more secure “For Microsoft this incident has highlighted the urgent need to move even faster We will act immediately to apply our current security standards to Microsoft-owned legacy systems and internal business processes even when these changes might cause disruption to existing business processes” the company wrote “This will likely cause some level of disruption while we adapt to this new reality but this is a necessary step and only the first of several we will be taking to embrace this philosophy” APT29 or Cozy Bear is widely believed to be a Russian hacking group working responsible for a series of high-profile attacks such as those against SolarWinds in 2019 the Democratic National Committee in 2015 and many more"
785,"3 Top AI Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Next 5 Years","1/1/2024","https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/3-top-ai-stocks-to-buy-and-hold-for-the-next-5-years-1032935462","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News Stock Advice & Trading Tips As we ring in a new year investors have plenty to consider when it comes to rebalancing their portfolios In 2023 AI stocks were among the leading gainers Accordingly outsized interest is expected in this group throughout the new fiscal year The prevailing theme that AI stocks will continue to provide exceptional performance and market-beating returns in 2024 is one that isn’t necessarily the consensus Some investors believe that certain stocks in this group have seen their valuations balloon to unsustainable levels And while some companies in this space have certainly seen their revenue and earnings growth surpass expectations that’s not the case across the board Therefore let’s dive into three AI stocks investors will want to keep their eye on in 2024 These three companies may be worth buying as long-term investments for those who will hold five years or longer In the generative AI boom Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has dominated by supplying essential tools to the sector The company’s advanced GPUs are crucial for training and running AI applications in data centers Thus demand is soaring indicating this trend is sustainable Nvidia’s Q3 revenue surged by 206% to $181 billion This was driven by sales of the company’s high-margin products like the $30000 H100 data center chip expected to fuel this growth moving forward As consumer preferences shifted to premium Nvidia GPUs the company’s Q3 net income margin rose from 46% to 51% with profits soaring 588% to $10 billion So this trajectory positions Nvidia as a potential global powerhouse Before the AI surge Nvidia dominated 80% of the data center market The rapid evolution of their GPUs for AI applications exemplified by the H200 chip signals their commitment to innovation However skeptics question the company’s ability to meet soaring AI chip demand promptly This could potentially pose an opening for competitors Despite trading at 65-times trailing earnings and 44-times forward earnings analysts project 65% earnings growth this year That would lead to a consensus target price of $66811 implying a 34% stock price increase Further out of 52 analysts 42 give NVDA stock a strong buy rating Frankly it’s hard to disagree with the experts I’m maintaining my bullish outlook on Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) as a global software and computing powerhouse The tech giant has built out a robust quantum ecosystem and remains a leader in other high-growth tech segments A pioneer in AI Microsoft has swiftly integrated this technology into tools like Teams Office and Copilot In healthcare Nuance Dax automates patient interaction documentation Analyst Dan Ives optimistic about Microsoft’s AI future has set a $450 price target on this stock Other analysts remain very bullish with plenty of upside being priced in by the experts Of course much of this has to do with Microsoft’s major investment in OpenAI and the potential of large language models and other AI-related applications Beyond AI the company plays a key role in cybersecurity This is especially crucial with rising ransomware attacks and new SEC disclosure rules intensifying the need to safeguard networks applications and data On the hardware front a high-risk high-reward strategy in research and development positions Microsoft for a competitive edge in quantum computing and AI Undoubtedly Microsoft will remain a top AI stock to watch in 2024 and beyond Google’s parent company Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG NASDAQ:GOOGL) is another company that’s expanding its horizons Outside of its core search business and YouTube Alphabet has emerged as a key AI player In fact it continues to be a tech powerhouse many investors feel the need to own CEO Sundar Pichai highlights their success in integrating AI into its portfolio A recent key development from Alphabet is its Wing delivery drone network resembling an intelligent data system Aimed at handling millions of orders Alphabet is currently engaged in talks with UK regulators This will be a catalyst to watch in the upcoming year Additionally the company has collaborated with NASA and the Universities Space Research Association to establish a Quantum Artificial Intelligence Lab This open-source library featuring applications spanning quantum computing includes Cirq a Python-based tool for quantum circuit creation Beyond software Google is actively engaged in quantum computing hardware development Thus like the other names on this list Alphabet is a well-rounded tech giant that’s more than just an AI play However the company’s core AI competencies should provide a nice catalyst for investors to ride if this bull market continues in 2024 On the date of publication Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or

in 2022 The tech-dominant Nasdaq Composite finished the year up 43% outperforming the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Despite the success tech stocks witnessed in 2023 there are a handful of stocks that I would still stock up on with no hesitation The following three tech stocks can be productive long-term pieces in investors portfolios Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 078%) (TSMC) may not be a household name like other big tech companies but it plays a pivotal -- and underrated Id argue -- role in the tech ecosystem TSMC is the worlds largest semiconductor (chip) foundry Semiconductor chips are vital because theyre like the brains of many of todays electronics TSMCs chips are found in smartphones car infotainment centers GPUs and dozens of other consumer electronics TSMCs top-of-the-line chips have made the company the go-to place for companies like Apple Tesla and Nvidia A lot of TSMCs 2023 stock bounceback can be attributed to artificial intelligence (AI) hype TSMC itself may not deal with AI but many of the companies that rely on its chips (such as Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices) do AI hype aside some encouraging news is that the smartphone and PC markets are expected to rebound in 2024 after slumping the past couple of years TSMCs chips for AI-related companies have gotten more attention recently but smartphones and other high-performance computing needs still make up the bulk of its revenue A rebound in these sales should help it get its revenue growth back on track TSM Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) data by YCharts There are a handful of big-name semiconductor companies out there but none have the technology to compete with TSMCs chipmaking expertise Its a company Id feel comfortable holding on to for the long haul After surging close to 62% in 2023 and through the first half of January Microsoft (MSFT -015%) recently topped Apple as the worlds most valuable public company with a market cap of over $29 trillion (as of Jan 18 2024) Microsoft was arguably the first tech company powerhouse and recent developments have the company back at the forefront of market dominance One thing that sticks out with Microsoft is that it has its hands in many pots Whether its enterprise and consumer software cloud computing gaming or AI Microsoft is involved in many industries and is a top player in most of them It shows in its financials too MSFT Revenue (Quarterly) data by YCharts All three of Microsofts broad business segments grew revenue year over year in the first quarter of its fiscal year 2024 (ended Sept 30 2023) Its Intelligent Cloud segment -- which includes revenue from its cloud platform Azure -- led the way growing 19% year over year to $243 billion Azure has seen its market share steadily grow through the years It has a ways to go before it catches up to leader Amazon Web Services (AWS) but the growth so far has been encouraging Investors should appreciate that Microsoft isnt too dependent on any one segment Its a well-rounded tech giant that should continue returning good value to shareholders Cybersecurity company CrowdStrike (CRWD -057%) has taken investors for a wild ride since its June 2019 initial public offering (IPO) It went public at $34 per share jumped to over $280 by August 2021 fell to $94 in January 2023 and thanks to a 142% surge in 2023 its now hovering near its all-time peak CrowdStrike has been one of the pioneers of AI-native cybersecurity solutions so its 2023 gains make sense considering how other big-name AI-focused companies fared CrowdStrikes business is more than hype though In the third quarter of its fiscal 2024 (ended Oct 31 2023) it made $786 million in revenue up 35% year over year More importantly CrowdStrikes annual recurring revenue (ARR) grew 35% year over year to $31 billion with $2231 million added in the quarter For a subscription-based business like CrowdStrike ARR better indicates long-term financial health because it reflects predictable income and gives insight into customer retention CFO Burt Podbere said it wants to hit $10 billion in ARR in five to seven years Whether CrowdStrike hits its ARR goal remains to be seen but one thing that gives me confidence it could happen is the overall need and growth of the cybersecurity industry Cybersecurity has become an indispensable expense for many businesses with online operations and CrowdStrike is one of the top companies in the industry Investors should expect volatility along the way but CrowdStrike looks like a long-term winner Stefon Walters has positions in Apple and Microsoft The Motley Fool has

missing earnings expectations just once in the last seven years demonstrating why its now the worlds most valuable company It’s been a rollercoaster few years for Netflix; struggling to maintain growth after its pandemic surge losing its place amongst the world’s top stocks FAANG’s replacement by the magnificent seven – and finally sparking a comeback in the last year with shares up more than 50% This resurgence is partly thanks to its new advertising plan and crackdown on password sharing Netflix has also stepped up its games service adding the world-renowned Grand Theft Auto which should provide a boost in the quarter The consensus is another big quarter from Netflix with net subscriber additions at nine million and revenue projected to see the fastest growth in three years at $87 billion The focus for the quarter is likely to be on the outlook for the full year 2024 with consumer spending set to slow and investors wanting to see strong profit growth with subscribers now at record levels It was a pretty torrid year for ResMed on the ASX The company perhaps best known for its CPAP masks saw shares drop 18% due to headwinds from the internationally trending Ozempic drug which some investors felt would dampen ResMed’s sales due to the connection between obesity and sleep apnoea On top of this the business has also suffered product recalls but the main headwind has been margins which look set to fall again this week Gross margins are expected at 56% down from a year ago The good news is that the consensus is for net income to rise by 9% to US$245 million and revenue growth in double digits thanks to strength across masks and software Its valuation also remains attractive at 23 times forward earnings much lower than its historical average pricing in recent challenges A good result would give shares the next leg up after a solid three months but a miss on estimates could put shares under pressure given its recent strong performance Sign up to receive alerts and news direct to your inbox Digbee Limited founder and CEO Jamie Strauss and Black Rock Mining Ltd (ASX:BKT) MD John de Vries discuss the significance of the second Digbee assessment for Black Rock Mining highlighting its utility in identifying areas of strength and opportunity from the first report and its role as a Copyright © Proactive Group Holdings Inc 2024 All Rights Reserved - Proactive Australia PTY LTD ACN:132787654 ABN:19132787654 Market Indices Commodities and Regulatory News Headlines copyright © Morningstar Data delayed 15 minutes unless otherwise indicated Terms of use"

top analyst recommendations in-depth research investing resources and more Learn More Editors note: This article has been corrected Microsoft does not own any portion of OpenAI; it is entitled to a share of profit distributions 2023 was a year of recovery after an economic downturn in 2022 triggered a dramatic sell-off that saw the Nasdaq Composite plunge 33% The challenging period highlighted vulnerabilities in many companies business models as they suffered repeated revenue declines However macroeconomic headwinds also showcased the strength of companies that successfully navigated the market downturn In 2023 the Nasdaq Composite rose more than 40% driven by growth from a few key stocks Tech stocks have played a crucial role in the markets recovery as advances in areas like artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing made Wall Street particularly bullish Tech is one of the most reliable industries with its stocks never down for long As a result the period after a market downturn could be one of the best times to invest in the lucrative industry Here are three stocks you can confidently buy after a market downturn Shares in Nvidia (NVDA 312%) plummeted 50% in 2022 as spikes in inflation curbed consumer spending in the PC market and other areas of tech However the company delivered an impressive turnaround last year when its shares soared around 240% As a leading chipmaker Nvidias hardware can be found powering a wide range of devices and systems from cloud platforms to artificial intelligence (AI) models video game consoles laptops custom-built PCs and more Demand for these products is rarely down for long Consequently a market downturn could be the perfect time to buy Nvidias stock at a bargain and reap the rewards over the long term Nvidias business model is diverse However its biggest growth catalyst for now is likely AI According to Grand View Research the AI market is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 37% until at least 2030 which would see it exceed a value of $1 trillion Meanwhile Nvidia has achieved a powerful role in the sector with its graphics processing units (GPUs) -- the chips necessary to train and run AI models In 2023 Nvidias GPUs became the preferred chips for AI developers worldwide leading to soaring earnings In the third quarter of 2024 (ending October 2023) the company posted revenue growth of 206% year over year as operating income rose 1600% thanks to soaring chip sales Data by YCharts This chart shows Nvidias earnings could hit $24 per share by fiscal 2026 That figure multiplied by its forward price-to-earnings ratio of 45 implies a potential stock price of $1080 If projections are correct its stock will rise 95% over the next two fiscal years The company has come back strong after a market downturn making its stock an excellent long-term investment Amazons (AMZN 040%) e-commerce business was also hit hard by macroeconomic headwinds in 2022 Consumer pullback led to steep declines in retail profits and a tumbling stock price However the companys performance last year proved why its one of the most reliable stock investments over the long term as it strategically brought its business back to growth Poor market conditions led Amazon to introduce a range of cost-cutting measures such as closing or canceling construction on dozens of warehouses laying off thousands of employees and sunsetting unprofitable divisions like Amazon Care The restructuring paid off as the companys free cash flow has soared 427% over the last year Amazons ability to successfully navigate economically challenging conditions makes it an excellent option after a market downturn The company is using its significant cash reserves to invest in AI and its highly profitable cloud platform Amazon Web Services (AWS) The companys price-to-sales ratio currently sits at an attractive 28 indicating its stock is trading at a value and is a no-brainer right now Microsoft (MSFT -015%) is not only a great option after a market downturn but also during one Data by YCharts In 2022 while companies across tech felt the pangs of poor market conditions Microsoft was not unscathed However the chart above shows that it was one of the few to still outperform the Nasdaq Composite experiencing more moderate declines than many of its rivals The companys greater focus on the commercial and digital markets such as productivity software and cloud computing made it less vulnerable to economic declines than its peers Moreover in 2023 the companys shares shot up 57% as it emerged as one of the principal names in AI Its investment in ChatGPT developer OpenAI generated a lot of investor enthusiasm and gave it access to some of the most advanced AI models in the industry Microsoft has so far used OpenAIs tech to bring AI upgrades across its product lineup including Bing Azure and its popular Office productivity programs The massive user base for these platforms could see the company become the go-to for consumers and businesses everywhere looking to boost efficiency with AI The companys stock trades at a premium with a price-to-earnings ratio of 36 However with proven reliability and $63 billion in free cash flow Microsoft has earned its high price tag Its a screaming buy for anyone looking for a consistent long-term investment Randi Zuckerberg

infrastructure","1/25/2024","https://fortune.com/2024/01/25/ftc-probes-microsoft-alphabet-amazon-ai-antitrust-concerns-openai-anthropic/","Alphabet Inc Amazoncom Inc and Microsoft Corp received inquiries from the US Federal Trade Commission on their investments and partnerships with artificial intelligence startups Anthropic and OpenAI part of a study on how AI is impacting competition in the technology industry The antitrust and consumer protection agency on Thursday said it sent subpoenas to the companies to gather information The probe focuses on more than $19 billion in investments by Microsoft Amazon and Alphabet’s Google a series of transactions that cemented alliances between the world’s cloud-services giants and the leading developers of artificial intelligence software Antitrust enforcers across the world have become concerned as many of the most promising AI startups now depend heavily on the old guard of dominant tech companies for their financing and infrastructure needs In comments during a public workshop Thursday FTC Chair Lina Khan said the agency is closely monitoring the industry and warned that AI companies “cannot use claims of innovation as cover for law breaking” “There is no AI exemption from the laws on the books” she said Google Amazon and Anthropic declined to comment Microsoft and OpenAI didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment The inquiry comes as technology giants take a bigger role in backing nimble AI startups in a bid to stake a claim in the booming sector Over the past year Microsoft has revamped nearly all of its products around AI tools powered by OpenAI’s technology while Google has said it plans to embed its most powerful large language model Gemini into its experimental search tool sometime this year Microsoft has invested more than $13 billion in ChatGPT maker OpenAI The ouster and subsequent reinstatement of Sam Altman OpenAI’s chief executive officer in November exposed how inextricably linked Microsoft and the company have become Those ties have already spurred antitrust reviews in both the UK and the European Union Meanwhile Google in October committed to back Anthropic with $2 billion and Amazon last year also agreed to an investment of as much as $4 billion Anthropic was founded in 2021 by former employees of OpenAI who left that company amid differences over the direction of the business Read More: Big Tech’s Massive AI Startup Deals By the Numbers Rebecca Kelly Slaughter one of the FTC’s three Democrats criticized the tech giants for structuring their transactions in a way designed to avoid the US merger law that would have required them to notify antitrust enforcers “It’s reasonable to wonder whether these investments could lead to a heavily consolidated market dominated by only a few” she said at the same workshop where Khan spoke But she warned “studying a market is a compliment to and not a substitute for appropriate enforcement” Microsoft didn’t report the OpenAI transaction to the agency because the investment doesn’t amount to control of the company under US law Bloomberg has reported OpenAI is also a nonprofit and acquisitions of non-corporate entities aren’t reported under US merger law regardless of value In the case of Google and Amazon the deals were structured as convertible notes a type of debt that will convert to equity at the startup’s next funding round Those don’t require notification to the agency until they’re converted The FTC is conducting the inquiry under its so-called 6(b) authority that allows it to issue subpoenas to conduct market studies The agency generally issues a report on its findings after analyzing the information from companies though that process can take years to complete The agency is still finalizing the results of studies on pharmaceutical middlemen and supply chains that it started in 2021 and 2022 Although the information is collected for research purposes the FTC can use any details it gleans to open official investigations or aid in existing probes Last summer the agency opened an investigation into whether OpenAI has violated consumer protection laws with its popular ChatGPT conversational AI bot The FTC and its sister agency the Justice Department share jurisdiction over antitrust probes and have been debating internally which should take the lead on AI The Justice Department has generally handled antitrust issues related to Microsoft since its blockbuster monopolization case against the Windows maker in the late 1990s The FTC however recently handled Microsoft’s acquisition of game developer Activision Blizzard Inc In addition the European Commission is looking into some of the agreements that have been struck between large digital market players and generative AI developers and providers The EU’s executive arm is investigating the impact of these partnerships on market dynamics The UK’s Competition and Markets Authority said in December that it also would probe Microsoft and OpenAI’s partnership — With assistance from Shirin Ghaffary Julia Love Matt Day and Jackie Davalos © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited All Rights Reserved Use of this

792,"Update: Microsoft follows Activision Blizzard merger with 1900 layoffs","1/26/2024","https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-microsoft-follows-activision-blizzard-merger-with-1-900-layoffs","Microsoft has confirmed the authenticity of the letters obtained by IGN January 25 2024 Update (01/26/24): Microsoft has confirmed the authenticity of the letters obtained by IGN in an email sent to Game Developer but has so far declined to comment on the scale of the layoffs including which departments and studios have been hit Since the news broke yesterday a number of Activision Blizzard and Xbox employees have indicated that major internal studios like Blizzard Entertainment and Sledgehammer Games have been heavily impacted Windows Central managing editor Jez Corden is also reporting that Microsoft is shutting down departments involved with the physical retail of Xbox products Update (01/25/24): The ZeniMax Workers Union released a statement on the layoffs In it the ZWU said the affected workers werent part of its union Written by senior QA tester Wayne Dayberry he noted how layoffs have hit [studios] that continue to deliver huge profits It hurts to see our coworkers who are so passionate be the first impacted by any cuts Your livelihood is not protected without a voice on the job he continued Companies will claim that we’re all a family But a family doesn’t layoff or outsource people While acknowledging how unions cant always shield against layoffs Dayberry argued they lead to better transparency policies He went on to call for more ZeniMax workers to join the ZWU and help set new industry standards The only way forward is for all of us to come together as workers to protect each other he said Well continue [supporting] workers at Microsoft and across the video game industry who want to have a union voice on the jobOriginal story: Microsoft completed its seismic $687 billion merger with Activision Blizzard just over three months ago Now the company is reportedly laying off 1900 people across its video game divisions Thats according to IGN which claims to have spoken with sources familiar with those plans and has obtained an internal memo penned by Xbox boss Phil Spencer that details the extent of the cuts In that message Spencer explains Microsoft will offer its full support to those who are impacted during the transition including severance benefits informed by local employment laws It’s been a little over three months since the Activision Blizzard and King teams joined Microsoft As we move forward in 2024 the leadership of Microsoft Gaming and Activision Blizzard is committed to aligning on a strategy and an execution plan with a sustainable cost structure that will support the whole of our growing business Together we’ve set priorities identified areas of overlap and ensured that we’re all aligned on the best opportunities for growth added Spencer As part of this process we have made the painful decision to reduce the size of our gaming workforce by approximately 1900 roles out of the 22000 people on our team The Gaming Leadership Team and I are committed to navigating this process as thoughtfully as possible The people who are directly impacted by these reductions have all played an important part in the success of Activision Blizzard ZeniMax and the Xbox teams and they should be proud of everything they’ve accomplished here Spencer said Microsoft is grateful for the commitment shown by its development teams over the years but said its now time to invest in areas that will grow its business and support its strategy of bringing more games to more players around the world Although this is a difficult moment for our team Im as confident as ever in your ability to create and nurture the games stories and worlds that bring players together he continued The news comes a week after Xbox laid out some of its plans for 2024 during a well-received Developer Direct that spotlighted first-party titles like Indiana Jones and The Great Circle Avowed and Senuas Saga: Hellblade II Those projects are being developed by the companys internal roster of Xbox Game Studios which includes notable names like Obsidian Playground Games Mojang Double Fine Bethesda Game Studios 343 Industries Rare and Arkane Following its purchase of Activision Blizzard in October 2023 Microsoft added even more names to that line-up and became the owner of major franchises like Call of Duty Diablo and World of Warcraft The fact Microsoft has chosen to put so many workers to the sword (including high-profile figures like Blizzard Entertainment president Mike Ybarra) less than four months after sealing its earth-shaking merger with Activision Blizzard wont go unnoticed It continues a dismal trend that has seen conglomerates like Embracer Thunderful Unity and more spend huge sums on M&A before turning those same studios and their employees into sacrificial lambs in the name of sustainability and shareholder value Game Developer has reached out to Microsoft for more information

Windows $56 billion LinkedIn the professional network acquired by Nadella in 2016 brought in $39 billion The company’s Xbox gaming division brought in $39 billion — and will be greatly boosted by the completion of the $69 billion deal to acquire Activision Blizzard Inc helping it regain ground in its rivalry against Sony particularly as the video game business switches to a more subscription-based model just as software did This all before the realization of the extreme potential of artificial intelligence where Microsoft has a clear leadership position thanks to its $10 billion investment in OpenAI Direct revenue might be slow in coming and computing costs will weigh heavy but AI will boost just about every part of Microsoft’s portfolio — and through its cloud business it stands to benefit when other companies turn to Microsoft for help utilizing AI too Releasing Microsoft from its Windows ball-and-chain has meant Nadella can afford to have a cloud business smaller than Amazon’s an advertising business smaller than Alphabet’s and Meta’s and a hardware business certainly much smaller than Apple’s It means Microsoft can afford to experiment with wild new technologies — like its faltering HoloLens — without investors piling on the pressure for it to be the company’s grand vision of the future like Apple’s Vision Pro Microsoft’s $3 trillion valuation comes from being a jack of all trades as they say though many people neglect to use the full saying “A jack of all trades is a master of none” it goes “but oftentimes better than a master of one” Read also: © 2024 Bloomberg LP Listen to the story of Cyril Ramaphosas rise to presidential power narrated by our very own Alec Hogg Narration by Alec Hogg BizNews © 2024 BizNews Inc The Rational PerspectiveTerms & ConditionsComments Policy"

Microsoft cooled down made modest concessions to reassure gamers and the CMA approved the deal Now Smith thinks this was for the best after all He told Today last week that he thought the CMA had been “tough but fair” But if Smith had a better antenna he’d have a much better idea of how the public views such mega-mergers Maurice Saatchi articulated some of this popular disquiet in an important contribution to the debate last week Globalisation had created cartels Saatchi wrote “in which there is a huge imbalance of power between the customer and the corporation; a sense of powerlessness and unfairness that results from a world of global companies whose governance (and maybe taxes) are beyond public control” It was startling to see the former chair of the Conservative Party and a bogeyman of the Left now put the phrase “free market” in scare quotes But Saatchi is far more in tune with the public than much of the Tory party or Westminster’s intellectual apparatus – which regards any obstacle to huge companies as the first shots of the Bolshevik revolution Being a competition regulator is not easy and means being targeted by everyone The regulator can easily get it wrong For example with the benefit of hindsight we can now say that the UK Competition Commission (as it then was) was foolish to block UK broadcasters from collaborating to fight emerging global players like Netflix and Amazon in 2009 They wanted to pool their content and share infrastructure for a new global venture with a definably British flavour Instead of hanging together the regulator ensured they must operate separately In its “horizon scanning” report published in December the CMA outlined a number of areas of concern in digital markets It cited the integration of new services into giant platforms and the cost of access to the platforms for developers Generative AI is likely to concentrate power further since you need to be very big to run it And ominously the CMA worries about how dominant tech players are moving into finance energy and health Last week Google flexed its muscles and began to block third-party cookies in response to calls from privacy groups many of whom it funds That’s bad news for competition in the digital advertising market but good news for Google – which maintains its own tracking apparatus through control of the web browser and the platform While regulators slept Big Tech grew very big indeed Between 2012 and 2020 Amazon Google and Facebook comfortably outgrew US GDP and the other 497 Fortune 500 companies “Only Big Tech monopolies can unilaterally and collusively control what every American sees says shares buys and sells online” wrote former Bush administration official Scott Cleland for the Heartland Institute The counter-argument is that greater size leads to greater efficiency and these gains are passed onto the consumer The principle has sustained competition policy for decades and particularly when it comes to mergers But awkwardly a reminder of how “efficient” the tech giants really are could be deduced from a recent essay in The Baffler by a former Microsoft manager called JS Tan Towards the end of his tenure Tan admits he was working less than three hours a day Such experiences are rife: a significant number of software developers are doing barely any work at all in Silicon Valley “How is it that the tech industry the purported cradle of innovation has become a redoubt of waste and unproductivity?” Tan asks The answer of course is that insulated from real competition and with giant profits they couldn’t really care less For free-market utopians this is all a little awkward Falling prices don’t lie they insist Look at all the free stuff we get! The counter is that this is a new world entirely one of global information dominance where platforms uniquely control both supply and demand We could all be dead before they face any competition Lord Saatchi’s intervention is significant because he realises this A lasting psychological consequence of today’s cartels he writes is that people give up believing in markets entirely Entrepreneurs who think the game is rigged go and do something else instead While the US is producing Republican populists who want to take on cartels and Big Tech like JD Vance counterparts in Westminster just aren’t interested If capitalism is to survive it depends on how much it can extract confidence in the very idea of the market"

call for comments from the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) as part of its current investigation of the Microsoft-OpenAI partnership The CMA must investigate Microsoft’s most recent investment and ensure that a small number of dominant technology firms are not permitted to dictate how AI develops Read the submission below 8 January 2024 Submission to CMA on Microsoft-OpenAI “partnership” merger inquiry 1 This submission from diverse civil society organisations welcomes the Competition and Markets Authority’s investigation into the Microsoft-OpenAI partnership Our submission is structured in four sections: The Microsoft-OpenAI “partnership” 2 Microsoft’s most recent investment (announced just under a year ago) in OpenAI reported to be worth up to $10bn was the largest sum committed so far by a large digital gatekeeper to “support” a leading AI startup Microsoft’s “support” to OpenAI dates back to a $1bn investment in 2019 followed by another similar-sized investment in 2021 3 We understand Microsoft has argued that the latest investment while much larger in size did not change the nature of its relationship with OpenAI which it claims remains at arm’s-length Until recently these arguments appeared to have been successful as none of Microsoft’s several rounds of investment were investigated by any competition authority including the CMA 4 That this is highly unsatisfactory is confirmed by the fact that the German competition authority the Bundeskartellamt opened a formal investigation into whether Microsoft should have notified the investment based on German merger control rules The Bundeskartellamt concluded (in its decision dated 25 September 2023) that while Microsoft did not formally violate German merger control notification requirements this did not mean that there were no substantive issues with the investment and that the case would have to be re-examined if Microsoft increased its influence on OpenAI Recent events at OpenAI appear to have met this condition as the CMA’s investigation recognises Why this investment must be investigated 5 The events of late November 2023 involving the CEO and the Board of OpenAI in which Microsoft played a prominent role (ostensibly to protect its investment) expose as a fiction the idea of an “arm’s-length relationship” between the two companies Indeed they demonstrated that Microsoft has a real role in the operation and strategic direction of OpenAI with profound implications for competition between the two companies and in AI more generally More broadly Microsoft’s investment in OpenAI should be seen in the context of the past two decades of economic history 6 Weak antitrust enforcement has helped create a world in which a handful of dominant technology firms control most of the world’s digital technologies and markets—the bedrock of the modern economy These gatekeepers are now leveraging their unparalleled access to computing infrastructure data and expertise to shape the development and commercialisation of AI—including driving the narrative that ever-larger models and ever-greater scale are inevitable 7 In a fairer and more open digital economy AI development would be pluralistic decentralised competitive and more responsive to the needs of consumers businesses governments and citizens Firms such as OpenAI or Anthropic might in time have threatened giants like Amazon Google and Microsoft Unfortunately this is not the path we are on 8 Instead smaller AI firms are becoming increasingly dependent on the tech giants’ infrastructure and financial support Microsoft’s partnership with OpenAI as well as Google and Amazon’s combined $6bn investment in Anthropic illustrate this point Letting the largest incumbents dictate how AI develops by leveraging their current monopoly power into future markets and technologies will serve their profit margins but will not serve the public interest We have seen how the failure to block anti-competitive investments and acquisitions in social media digital advertising and other markets harmed innovation privacy and choice and allowed the online “public square” to be captured by a handful of private platforms with little interest in promoting the public good and protecting democracy 9 Only by acting early and aggressively against anti-competitive behaviour in AI can regulators prevent this oligopolistic control from being extended further Why Microsoft’s investment in OpenAI gives it significant influence 10 Commercial arrangements between dominant tech companies and smaller AI firms – seemingly designed to avoid the antitrust scrutiny that would accompany outright acquisition – give dominant tech companies access to startups’ technology and influence over their commercial strategies in ways that are highly likely to be anti-competitive These companies are deliberately reconfiguring their “deals” to look like innocent “agreements” which is fundamentally a circumvention of scrutiny This is particularly true for Microsoft’s partnership with OpenAI 11 First Microsoft influence over OpenAI goes far beyond its reported $13bn financial investment As OpenAI’s exclusive cloud provider Microsoft can prevent its cloud rivals from doing business with OpenAI while enjoying a significant and consistent revenue stream Although the details have not been disclosed to the public Microsoft also appears to benefit from privileged access to OpenAI’s technology and the ability to license this technology on its behalf 12 Meanwhile as mentioned above the recent turmoil at OpenAI further exposed the strength of the tech giant’s influence over its smaller partner When OpenAI’s supposedly independent not-for-profit board fired CEO Sam Altman Microsoft reportedly placed heavy pressure on the board to reverse its decision before offering jobs to Altman and every other OpenAI employee This effectively forced the OpenAI board to back down resulting in the reinstatement of Altman as CEO and the appointment of a new board with Microsoft joining as a non-voting observer These events make clear that despite OpenAI’s nominal independence it is Microsoft that ultimately pulls the strings when it comes to critical strategic and business decisions 13 Second Microsoft has a prominent role throughout the AI stack as both an upstream developer and a downstream service deployer (terms the CMA uses in its report on AI Foundation Models) reinforcing OpenAI’s dependence while enabling Microsoft to leverage the startup’s technology to further entrench its own dominance across different markets Microsoft develops and commercialises AI models and tools and builds and runs popular user-facing applications and platforms including Microsoft Office Bing GitHub and LinkedIn 14 Most importantly Microsoft also controls the Azure high-performance computing infrastructure and the Windows operating system upon which such tools platforms and applications are hosted In addition Microsoft has access to immense amount of data gathered through these services and platforms As an illustration of how deeply the two companies are intertwined Microsoft was the “provider” of data for Codex the OpenAI model that powers Microsoft’s GitHub CoPilot Publicly accessible code repositories on GitHub were used as training data by OpenAI to develop Codex 15 In short as a recent article in the MIT Technology Review put it “they [Microsoft] own and control the ingredients necessary to develop and deploy large-scale AI” This power puts Microsoft in an unprecedented position of influence and oversight when it comes to OpenAI’s inner workings and decision-making 16 Without regulatory intervention the Microsoft/OpenAI “partnership” risks undermining fair competition in the

Here we list the many ways he has invigorated this tech biggie after taking it over when it was considered a slumbering giant when former CEO Steve Ballmer exited Unwilling to simply bask in the glory of Microsoft Windows OS virtually at the start of his journey in 2014 Nadella quickly pivoted the lumbering giant to power up its Azure cloud computing platform It instantly opened up a fresh revenue stream as the bet paid off and the dependency on the Windows platform lessened Not just that more recently it was a masterstroke when he got an exciting startup like OpenAI to tie-up with Microsoft and commit to Azure Another big decision that was made then was to abandon the companys attempts to crack the smartphone market on which Ballmer had focussed a lot of Microsofts energy and money - something that was not paying off at all Ballmer had even bought the iconic Nokia company for over $7 billion However Nadella has gone on record recently saying that it is a decision that he now regrets All of this was achieved without any hype or big announcements he simply seemed to rally the Microsoft employees explained his gameplan and asked them to work in a more collaborative manner rather than the competitive approach of earlier Nadellas ability to get things done without making a spectacle of it all in the media has earned him kudos too The same was clearly visible when he handled the surprising sacking of Sam Altman as CEO of OpenAI and managed to bring him back without any visible consequences or bad press In fact he emerged as the wise and professional elder who disciplined his young charges and set them back on course As far as his personal approach and relationship with employees is concerned Nadella is respectful toward everyone listens to then patiently and then explains to them what he thinks the future holds and how Microsoft should go out and conquer it Nadella has shown that if he fixates on something he will pursue it with full focus and energy Even though Nadella may be quite collaborative in approach as is clear in dealings with employees or others like OpenAI he has not hesitated to give his killer instincts free reign especially when it comes to takeovers This was most recently seen in the takeover of Activision Blizzard His testimony ensured that Microsoft did not draw the kind of antitrust scrutiny that most analysts had feared would stop the deal from happening While success has been his shadow throughout his career there were certain setbacks and none was more glaring than when Russian and Chinese hackers were able to penetrate the supposedly impregnable Microsoft Office tools - emails of US government and Microsoft officials were accessed In effect it indicated that the company was willing to sacrifice security at the altar of success In essence Nadella is focused on innovation but most of all on growth and anything that comes in the way is quickly dispensed with He is a changemaker and as things stand and looking at how comfortable he feels and acts in public he will continue at Microsoft for a long time bolstering his case for being on top of the best-ever CEOs list alongside the iconic Jobs Facebook a mess?

LEWIS WARD: Thanks for having me So yeah its true that Microsoft has been emphasizing the software and the capabilities of offering games on pretty much every screen that consumers have for several years now So this is an extension of a strategy thats been out there for many years and obviously they want the best experience to be on Xbox console hardware And then theyve pushed into PCs to a significant extent over the past few years And then mobile is more aspirational But something they clearly view as a growth opportunity outside of most developed economies is going to be can we put those same games in the cloud and offer it on iOS and Android devices that people have counted in the billions worldwide? DANIEL HOWLEY: But Lewis I want to ask when it comes to Microsoft their console sales are slower than the PlayStation 5 I think the estimate was take-two it said there were 77 9th generation consoles sold the Xbox Series S and X and the PlayStation 5 And Sony recently said that they sold 50 million PlayStation 5 So I guess that leaves 27 million Xbox units So almost 2 to 1 difference What does it mean now that theyre thinking of taking these or they are taking these first party titles to other devices We heard Phil Spencer say that theyre sticking with the hardware strategy But it seems increasingly like theyre moving to a software focused side of things LEWIS WARD: absolutely So the four titles are not like the crown jewels its not halo its not gears of war or Forza It seems to be sea of thieves a live service game grounded was another one that appears to be I dont think theyve finally released the titles But thats certainly the online speculation And yes I think there was a large share of Xbox players who were concerned that a lot of the crown jewels of the Xbox Game Studios are going to be eventually playable on PlayStation 5 and so that was the thing that really caused a lot of consternation lets say among the Xbox fan base But Phil Spencer and company really tamp that down yesterday by saying no this is a limited approach that were taking with four specific games that are a few years old at least They are successful games very high Metacritic ratings and so the idea is to basically monetize a sunk investment at this point And if they put it on PS5 and switch it sounds like theyre going to go to both all four games are going to go on both by the end of this year Its going to be a few I dont know several million dollars coming into the Xbox ecosystem from a revenue angle and hopefully grow some more fans even on competitors hardware as it were So I think thats the plan the vision DANIEL HOWLEY: I guess what does it say then that people were nervous that Microsoft was just going to move out of the hardware business I guess it gives the feeling that theres a sense that theres a lack of security for Xbox LEWIS WARD: and I mean I guess there was a leak or something a week or two ago that hinted that it could be much more than what was ultimately announced yesterday and presumably its plausible that some games we dont know about will follow the same trajectory I might add that Minecraft is a hugely successful game for Microsoft Thats on every platform under the sun and no one seems to particularly care about it But yeah at the end of the day there has been significant concern that perhaps theyre even going to get out of the hardware business or that again some of their real mainstay franchises first party stuff are going to show up on other console platforms And in effect as far as Im concerned Phil Spencer and company Matt Booty Sarah Bond basically said that is not going to happen for the foreseeable future at least So to my mind the podcast interview really should have assuaged a lot of the concerns that were expressed by Xbox gamers that expressed concerns that that might happen Related Quotes"

Supermicro is the worlds third-largest server company with a market share of 5% according to History-Computer Dell leads the market with a 19% share followed by HPE with a 13% share Grand View Research expects the global server market to grow at a steady compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9% from 2023 to 2030 Supermicro differentiates itself from its slower-growth competitors by mainly producing high-performance servers instead of low- to mid-range servers Its design partnership with Nvidia grants it access to its top-tier GPUs before other server makers and that competitive edge enabled it to capitalize on the explosive growth of the generative AI market Supermicro now generates roughly half of its revenue from dedicated AI servers powered by Nvidias GPUs Bank of America estimates that Supermicro already controls 10% of the dedicated AI server market -- and it expects its share to rise to 17% within the next three years as the entire niche market expands by 150% From fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2020 (which ended in June 2020) Supermicros annual revenue grew at a CAGR of 17% Its revenue dipped 7% in fiscal 2021 as the pandemic disrupted the global server market but surged 46% in fiscal 2022 and grew 37% in fiscal 2023 as the AI markets growth accelerated From fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2026 analysts expect its revenue to continue rising at a CAGR of 42% Supermicro still doesnt seem expensive right now at 3 times this years sales Assuming its price-to-sales ratio holds steady its market cap could reach $61 billion by fiscal 2026 -- marking a near-40% gain from its current levels But to reach Microsofts current market cap of $3 trillion by 2050 with the same price-to-sales ratio Supermicro would need to generate $1 trillion in revenue To reach that target it would need to grow at a 24-year CAGR of 18% from fiscal 2026 That might seem achievable relative to its previous growth rates but Supermicro could face some unpredictable challenges before 2050 Nvidia could deepen its ties with Dell HPE and other server makers to drive the growth of the data center GPU market The AI market could stall out after the next few economic downturns and Supermicro could be revalued as a legacy server maker like HPE and Dell -- which both trade at less than 1 time this years sales -- instead of as a hypergrowth stock Simply put Supermicro needs to keep hitting home runs over the next three decades to reach Microsofts current market cap But even if Supermicro somehow becomes a $3 trillion stock by 2050 Microsoft would likely be worth a lot more Supermicro is still a great growth stock but its futile to compare a server maker to a diversified software giant like Microsoft -- which owns the worlds top PC operating system (Windows) the most popular productivity software suite (Office) and the second-largest public cloud platform (Azure) Supermicro certainly has the potential to become a trillion-dollar stock over the next few decades if it plays its cards right but I doubt it will ever come close to matching Microsofts valuations Bank of America is an advertising partner of The Ascent a Motley Fool company Leo Sun has no position in any of the stocks mentioned The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Bank of America Microsoft and Nvidia The Motley Fool recommends Super Micro Computer and recommends the following options: long January 2026 $395 calls on Microsoft and short January 2026 $405 calls on Microsoft The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy Invest better with The Motley Fool Get stock recommendations portfolio guidance and more from The Motley Fools premium services Making the world smarter happier and richer © 1995 - 2024 The Motley Fool All rights reserved Market data powered by Xignite and Polygonio"

Well not exactly A look at the numbers signals that some of these genuinely magnificent stocks could soon run out of steam Here are the four stocks in this group worth buying in 2024 and the three to leave behind in 2023 Nvidias chips which specialize in demanding high-compute applications have become a focal point of the artificial intelligence (AI) breakthrough The company has quickly established dominance controlling as much as 90% of the market for AI chips Thats pushed the business to new heights accelerating revenue growth to 200% year over year in its most recent quarter to $18 billion AI demand doesnt seem to be going anywhere which should create plenty of growth for Nvidia moving forward Analysts believe the companys earnings will grow by 42% annually over the coming years arguably justifying Nvidias valuation at 40 times 2023 profits Thats a PEG ratio of just 1 signaling the stock is still attractive despite its massive 250% climb in 2023 Not every Magnificent Seven company has grown enough to keep up with its stock Apples revenue has fallen over the past year and net income is up just 1% Apples business can be cyclical gyrating between periods of growth depending on key iPhone releases Thats fine but it can complicate things when share prices and operating results go in different directions Analysts have lowered their growth expectations for Apple moving forward At more than 29 times 2023 earnings that PEG ratio over 3 makes buying Apple here a tough pill to swallow Investors should wait for the price to make sense again Wall Street was down on Meta in 2022 when the company was fighting a slowing advertising business harmful privacy changes to iPhones and expensive metaverse projects that werent showing any return on investment Shares fell to $89 before CEO Mark Zuckerberg righted the ship by cutting costs working through the iPhone challenges and getting revenue growth and profits back on track Astonishingly the stock is still attractive at just 25 times 2023 earnings with expected annual growth of 20% on average moving forward It turns out that Meta is still a great business and Wall Street forgot that in a big way The rally in 2023 undid the pessimism but there is still room for the growth Meta can achieve in 2024 and beyond ChatGPT was a viral sensation in 2023 and Microsoft swiftly jumped in tying itself to its creator OpenAI with a multibillion-dollar investment and extended partnership Between enterprise software cloud computing gaming and more Microsoft is one of the worlds largest and most diversified technology companies Its cloud positioning amid the AI opportunity has seemingly boosted analyst expectations for its earnings growth in the coming years Mid-teens growth is nothing to dismiss but its becoming harder to call Microsoft a growth stock at its whopping $28 trillion market cap At a forward P/E over 33 the stocks resulting PEG ratio over 2 isnt as appealing as some other Magnificent Seven stocks Its not abhorrently expensive but after its 57% single-year gallop there are better deals out there Its OK for investors to be picky Interestingly e-commerce and cloud leader Amazon trades at a similar PEG ratio to Microsoft of just over 2 So why should investors consider buying Amazon over similarly valued Microsoft? Amazon is famous for investing its profits into the business which can understate its true profit potential The stock trades at 57 times its bottom-line earnings but just 22 times its operating profits which are earnings from day-to-day business Over the past decade thats over 20% below Amazons average price-to-cash-from-operations ratio Amazon has tons going on including investing in developing its AI technology a critical ingredient to its future Thats not touching on e-commerce which still has room to grow over the coming decades (e-commerce is just 15% of US retail) Electric vehicle and energy company Tesla is another example of share price and fundamentals heading in opposite directions Tesla began cutting prices in 2023 to boost unit sales The idea is that more units made and sold will let Tesla lower its prices a cycle that will price competitors out of the market Its a bold move that has brought short-term consequences to Teslas operating results Gross profit margin is down 22% over the past year Hopefully unit sales will grow enough for Tesla to realize the cost savings its striving for soon Analysts have aggressively lowered their expectations for Teslas future earnings growth due to the price cuts If analysts are correct Teslas stock has become far more pricey at a PEG ratio over 4 After the stock ran 130% last year investors might be better off waiting to buy until the numbers prove Tesla right in its price-cutting strategy Alphabets dominance with Google and YouTube overshadows its behind-the-scenes AI potential The company is leaning on AI to help customers maximize their advertising spend on its platforms (how Alphabet makes most of its money) Its massive pile of user data and pole position among the worlds most trafficked websites makes Alphabet a boring but effective money-printing machine The company spends much of that cash flow buying back tons of stock lowering the number of outstanding shares by 10% in the past five years That recipe of growth and buybacks has analysts expecting earnings to compound at over 17% annually The stocks 57% run in 2023 has raised its valuation but it remains a solid deal for long-term investors at a PEG ratio of 14 Should you invest $1000 in Nvidia right now?

847,"Monopoly Definition and 11 Near Monopoly Stocks in the US","1/20/2024","https://finance.yahoo.com/news/monopoly-definition-11-near-monopoly-072202115.html","In this article we will take a look at the 11 near-monopoly stocks in the US If you want to see more stocks in this selection go to the 5 Near Monopoly Stocks in the US A pure monopoly by definition refers to a company with no competition whatsoever – a sole provider of a particular product or service An illustration of this was Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) which at one point stood as the exclusive seller of software and operating systems for computers leaving consumers with only one option for these products The connection between monopolies and US consumers is rife with contradictions Americans harbor suspicions about companies that wield a dominant influence over their industries closely monitoring how these entities leverage their size and market dominance to maximize profits Paradoxically while Americans express concerns about monopolistic power they readily embrace the advantages associated with economies of scale Large market leaders are often preferred over small family businesses attempting to compete fostering an environment that encourages rather than discourages the expansion of market share by substantial corporations Monopolies wield significant pricing power a crucial factor that investor Warren Buffett carefully considers when selecting stocks for his globally tracked portfolio During his 2011 testimony before the US Congress Buffett cited pricing power as a vital criterion for evaluating a business He emphasized that a business with the ability to increase prices without losing market share to competitors exhibits a robust business model While pure monopolies are rare some contemporary companies exhibit what can be termed near-monopolies Benefiting from economies of scale these corporations establish formidable barriers that discourage new entrants from challenging their dominance Market leaders like Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazoncom Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) that have penetrated a sector and captured a substantial portion of the market are deemed as some of the best monopoly stocks in that regard In a bid to expand their market share and revenue these companies often diversify their product offerings While they may allows some space for competition companies like the ones mentioned above boast considerable market power exerting significant influence over the industry In theory a near-monopoly may not pose a problem but in practice such a system may not work in the best interests of consumers unless it is closely monitored In the absence of competition monopolies may set excessive prices offer poor-quality products and eliminate alternatives to maximize their own profits While the law doesnt outright prohibit monopolies various regulations have been implemented to ensure that such companies operate fairly The Sherman Antitrust Act is a significant piece of legislation used to break up companies that hinder competition and prevent mergers and acquisitions that could lead to a virtual monopoly While these regulations may limit the profits of monopolies investors often find these stocks appealing The substantial market share held by monopolies is likely to contribute to growth and value over time mitigating some of the inherent risks associated with investing in any security A laptop and phone open to Googles services in an everyday setting Our Methodology Weve identified 11 stocks in the US that exhibit near-monopoly characteristics based on their substantial market share Several of these companies are part of the FAANG group The major technology corporations within this list maintain a dominant market presence across various sectors such as cloud computing e-commerce mobile application services mobile operating systems search engines social networking and web browsers Additionally the remaining stocks in the selection assert near-monopoly positions in diverse sectors including alcoholic beverages personal credit rating and satellite radio The rankings are determined by the number of hedge funds holding stakes in these stocks as of Q3 2023 Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 9 Pearson plc (NYSE:PSO) is a British multinational publishing and education company with its headquarters in London Initially established as a

plc(NYSE:PSO) generates approximately two-thirds of its revenue and profit from the US market With a market share exceeding 40% the company is a dominant force in the fields of assessment publishing and online program management in the US In contrast the remaining segment of the education publishing and assessment service market is highly fragmented with numerous smaller players At the end of Q3 2023 9 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database reported having stakes in Pearson plc (NYSE:PSO) a slight increase from the previous quarter The collective value of these stakes is over $1587 million Among these hedge funds 13D Management was the company’s leading stakeholder in Q3 2023 Much like Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazoncom Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) Pearson plc (NYSE:PSO) operates as one of the best monopoly stocks in the US Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 21 Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (NYSE:BUD) is an American brewing company with its headquarters situated in St Louis Missouri Currently recognized as the worlds largest brewing company Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV possesses an array of global brands including renowned names such as Budweiser Michelob Stella Artois and Becks While the company has suffered controversies in the past few months it continues to hold the distinction of being the largest beer producer globally by volume In 2022

end of the quarter In its Q2 2023 investor letter Broyhill Asset Management a boutique investment firm commented about Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (NYSE:BUD) Here is what the firm said: “The largest detractors to performance over the quarter were First Horizon Corp (FHN) Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (NYSE:BUD) and Bayer (BAYRY) Problems at Anheuser Busch InBev began on April 1 with Dylan Mulvaney’s social media post which ignited a fiery backlash amongst Bud Light customers across ‘Merica With volumes down sharply and competitors gaining share at BUD’s expense operational deleveraging is set to weigh heavily on US margins amid peak demand pressure in the second quarter Despite severe US headwinds (second-quarter operating profit maybe half of last year’s levels) we still expect BUD to grow consolidated operating profit at a mid-single-digit rate for the full year With current issues well understood and investor sentiment in the gutters we see significant upside in a stock which is approaching a double-digit FCF yield With FX headwinds and rising input costs reversing course increasing margins are likely to drive positive surprises into FY24 as continued deleveraging accrues more value to shareholders” Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 24 Sirius XM Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:SIRI) is a US-based broadcasting corporation with its headquarters located in Midtown Manhattan New York

start to the year shares of Apple Inc partially retraced their gains this quarter Mixed second calendar quarter financial results with iPhone iPad and Wearables revenue coming in just shy of consensus expectations coupled with elevated investor concerns about the macro economy and potential weakness in consumer spending later this year pressured shares Despite these quarterly fluctuations in product sales we are encouraged by several long-term trends including: (1) revenue from higher-margin services like the App Store iCloud and Apple Pay which are growing faster than the overall business driving better revenue visibility and higher free-cash-flow (FCF) margins; (2) continued gains in global market share in smartphones wearables and other hardware categories; and (3) consistent returns of capital to shareholders via share repurchases and dividends On top of these trends in the core business Apple is thoughtfully investing in new categories like augmented reality search financial services and streaming media content We took advantage of weakness in the quarter to add to our position in Apple” Click to continue reading and see 5 Near Monopoly Stocks in the US

855,"Microsoft CoPilot vs ChatGPT: How Do They Compare?","1/29/2024","https://tech.co/news/chatgpt-vs-microsoft-copilot","Going into 2024 generative AIs are the buzziest tech topic But just one of them — ChatGPT — is getting nearly all the attention Granted Elon Musks new tool “Grok” is attempting to steal some limelight but lets not forget one of the oldest competitors: Microsoft Copilot Microsofts AI-powered Copilot service works with any Microsoft application you can name: Its accessible for Microsoft 365 Edge Bing and Windows 11 Microsoft has announced Copilot will even roll out on Windows 10 despite plans to end support for that generation of the platform within a few years What does Microsoft Copilot do that ChatGPT or others dont? What makes it worth figuring out? Heres everything you need to know Copilot is a chatbot designed for a back-and-forth conversation with any given user This is similar to the basic iteration of ChatGPT Copilot lets users pick what style of conversation they want to have: More creative more balanced or more precise It will help you with tasks like meal prep plans or to recommend furniture brands — answering questions that are a little too complex to just Google 🔎 Want to browse the web privately? 🌎 Or appear as if youre in another country?Get a huge 86% off Surfshark with this special techco offer But the secret here is that “Microsoft Copilot” can refer to multiple different applications depending on where youre accessing them The version on the search engine Bing has been around since February 2023 as “Bing Chat” and was recently rebranded On Windows 11 Copilot has appeared since late September as a button that you can click to pull up a righthand sidebar that hosts the chatbot It works the same way on Windows 10 as of November 16 Microsoft Copilot functions in Windows 10 with a sidebar as it does on Windows 11 Image source: Microsoft Like any massive multinational technology corporation Microsoft has so many different products and services often gained through a long history of acquisitions that establishing a single throughline can be difficult or even impossible in some cases Calling all its AI applications “Copilot” helps the company to spackle over these differences Weve mentioned the Bing version and the Windows version Here are all the other applications: Of these all Github Copilot is the odd one out as its functions arent anchored in the same “foundational LLMs” that the other tools rely on No matter which version you use youre getting an AI tool that typically functions as a chat bot delivering answers fine-tuned to the needs of the product youre using The search engine AI gives general answers the 365 AI helps pull out insights from your company data and in 2024 the Viva Insights AI will analyze employee data to deliver business-specific insights Microsoft Copilot is more of an add-on than a standalone service so its “pricing” is tough to quantify: Enterprise pricing for Microsoft 365 starts at $3600 per user per month with an annual commitment and its the only way to get Copilot on Microsoft 365 But youll also be getting a huge licensing package that includes Word Outlook Microsoft Teams and way more A GitHub Copilot subscription costs $10 per month or $100 per year when billed annually although businesses must pay $19 per user per month Copilot for Sales Service or Viva Insights is bundled with the cost for those services Some versions of Microsoft Copilot — but not all — wont cost you a cent Head over to Bing and youll get that version of Copilot for the low low cost of zero dollars You can also get Copilot on Windows 10 and 11 for free: Just download the most recent software updates and theyll be included In sharp contrast ChatGPT pricing is easy to explain: Theres a free GPT-3 version and theres a paid $20-a-month version that opens up access to third-party ChatGPT plugins a newer GPT-4 model and integrations with the image-based AI DALL-E 3 Theres an enterpise tier of ChatGPT as well which lets businesses train their own version with custom data The large language models (LLM) behind ChatGPT were trained on a vast range of data publically available on the internet scraping everything from artists oeuvres to entire libraries and news archives However both the GPT-35 and GPT-4 models only use data from prior to September 2021 meaning that current news stories wont be in the mix Copilot once again is hard to explain since it refers to different models Heres what to know about Copilot data sources for GitHub Copilot and the other Microsoft services Microsoft says that its “AI-powered LLMs are trained on a large but limited corpus of data” and while this is a little vague Microsoft works closely with OpenAI (which it has invested billions into) and draws on ChatGPT to at least some extent So if you use ChatGPT you get ChatGPT and if you use a Microsoft Copilot tool you get ChatGPT plus all the data available on your Microsoft products One thing we can confirm for sure: No version of Microsoft Copilot is trained on its customers proprietary data — it will use your data locally in order to deliver tailored business insights but customer data wont be added to the pool of data that the AI itself learns from ChatGPT is owned by OpenAI one of the biggest brands in AI companies right now The LLM that powers ChatGPT is considered the best in the business beating even a new coding-centric LLM Microsoft was working on this last summer Meanwhile GitHub Copilot is powered by the OpenAI Codex owned by you guessed it OpenAI Even the platform that launched the entire suite of Microsofts Copilot AI products was powered by the company behind ChatGPT Theres no better way to start trying out Microsoft Copilot than with its free chatbot iterations: Hop over to the search engine Bing or download the latest version of Windows 11 Theyre both free and theyre both great ways to hold a conversation with the version of AI

resources and more Learn More Microsoft (MSFT -015%) is back on top of the tech world these days but its easy to forget that the company was left in the hinterlands for much of this century While Microsoft was an early pioneer in personal computing with operating systems like DOS and then Windows it missed the mobile transition falling behind Apple after the iPhone was released A decade ago Microsoft was regarded as a laggard in technology known for a lack of innovation and underperforming the stock market though it continued to generate profits from its entrenched personal computing and enterprise software ecosystem However its legacy of underperformance changed when Satya Nadella took over as CEO nearly 10 years ago on Feb 4 2014 Image source: Getty Images Nadella overhauled Microsoft philosophically and strategically He ended the companys war against Apple allowing Microsoft Office products to be used on Apple devices Nadella also invested heavily in Microsoft Azure the companys cloud infrastructure business which has grown to become the companys biggest profit driver Azure is now the second-largest cloud infrastructure business behind Amazon Web Services though its growing significantly faster than its larger rival The Microsoft chief has made key acquisitions like LinkedIn GitHub and Activision Blizzard diversifying the company and strengthening its pipeline upstream and downstream in areas like advertising and open-source code development However Nadellas biggest coup now seems to be the partnership he forged with OpenAI of which Microsoft now owns nearly 50% That partnership has made Microsoft a leader in generative artificial intelligence (AI) and OpenAIs technology has been incorporated across a range of products including Azure its Office software suite Bing search and others Thats helped make Microsoft a winner in 2023 and since Nadella took over the stock gained 934% outperforming the S&P 500 by a wide margin as the chart below shows MSFT data by YCharts According to those results $10000 invested in Microsoft when Nadella took the helm would now be worth $123000 with dividends reinvested or $103400 without dividends That would give you a compound annual return of 29% with dividends reinvested or 27% without which is roughly triple the historical average of the S&P 500 with dividends reinvested Thats a pretty stellar track record over a decade By comparison Microsoft stock increased just 34% in the decade before then which compared to a 55% gain in the S&P 500 as that decade included the crash during the financial crisis Nadellas record as Microsofts CEO shows the power of a CEO to breathe new life into a company The CEO is ultimately responsible for corporate strategy capital allocation and other key decisions and a bad CEO like predecessor Steve Ballmer can be equally damaging Leadership could be especially important these days in the tech industry as the AI revolution takes off Though each company competing in the generative AI race comes with a different set of strengths the choices and investments that CEOs like Satya Nadella are making could make a difference in billions of profits over the long term Nadella has also succeeded in making Microsoft much more resilient than it was a decade ago thanks to the growth of its Azure cloud infrastructure business the integration of its Office suite in Apple products and acquisitions like LinkedIn and GitHub That diversification also gives the company an advantage over its big tech rivals as it can deploy new generative AI across a wide range of products Microsoft stock jumped more than 50% in 2023 and its valuation has gotten a bit expensive at a price-to-earnings ratio of 36 However Microsoft executed effectively in 2023 and it strengthened its competitive advantages by incorporating its new AI Copilot into a wide range of products including its office productivity software Demand for those products should continue to ramp up in 2024 and Microsoft investors are in good hands with Nadella -- especially as the company continues to leverage its partnership with OpenAI which also gives it an edge in AI Although the stock might be pricey Microsofts stock still looks like a smart buy in 2024 John Mackey former CEO of Whole Foods Market an Amazon subsidiary is a member of The Motley Fool’s board of directors Jeremy

these stocks and be prepared to leverage potential breakouts or reversals As always stay alert and ready to adjust your tactics based on the markets pulse to optimize your trading gains Now lets dive into the stock analysis: SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY The SPY is currently near 46917 Bulls are looking for an upward push starting at 47063 targeting a follow-through to 47140 Maintaining strength above this could lead to higher levels with aspirations for 47268 and eventually reaching a days high target of 47340 If support at 46917 fails bears will likely aim to lower prices first testing 46816 A breach below could lead to further declines at 46751 and if the downtrend continues targets may extend down to 46680 with an end-of-day bearish aim at 46535 Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 QQQ The Qs are trading around 39967 For bulls holding above 40095 is crucial aiming next for 40231 and then 40308 If momentum sustains a push towards 40359 could occur with a bullish daily high at 40476 Conversely if the Qs cannot maintain above 39967 bears may drive the market to test 39857 With continued weakness a further decline to 39681 might ensue potentially leading to 39504 and a bearish extreme at 39396 for the day Apple Inc AAPL Apples trading level is around 18338 In a bullish scenario holding this as support would be key aiming for an upward trajectory through 18459 and further to 18496 Should the buying persist the days high target for Apple could be 18586 Should Apple fail to maintain 18338 as support the bears might look to push the stock lower first testing 18296 Continued bearish sentiment could lead to further declines at 18125 and 18060 with a bearish end-of-day target set at 18010 Microsoft Corp MSFT Microsoft is around the 37203 mark For bulls sustaining above this level is crucial aiming for an initial rally to 37348 and then on to 37511 A strong bullish day might conclude at a high target of 37593 If 37203 doesnt hold up as support bears might take the opportunity to push down to 37010 Continued pressure could lead to further declines at 36879 and 36698 with the bearish day target at 36535 Tesla Inc TSLA Tesla is currently trading near 23992 Bulls will be eyeing an upward move to 24249 hoping to continue the rally to 24398 and possibly further to 24616 The ambitious target for a bullish day is set at 24837 On the other hand if Tesla fails to hold 23992 the bearish trajectory might lead to 23850 Further selling could bring the stock down to 23574 and in a more aggressive downtrend the price might fall to a bearish days target of 23349 Alphabet Inc Class A GOOGL Alphabets position is around 13946 In a bullish market the focus would be on climbing past 14005 and extending gains to a high target of 14057 If support at 13946 breaks the bearish outlook would see Alphabets price moving down to 13839 possibly extending losses to 13779 and in a heavy sell-off reaching a low bear target of 13694 Meta Platforms Inc META Meta is auctioning near 34504 A bullish scenario involves holding above 34767 advancing towards 35018 and further aiming for a high target of 35360 Conversely if 34504 doesnt hold bears might lead the price down to 34289 With sustained selling pressure the stock might descend to 34185 aiming for a bearish days low at 34066 NVIDIA Corporation NVDA NVIDIAs current level is around 47867 Bulls will aim for 48127 and hope to extend gains up to 48343 with an optimistic target of 48593 for the day If the price fails to hold 47867 bears may target lower levels at 47694 With increased selling the price could drop further to 47381 and in a bearish market down to a days low of 46734 Final Word: Todays trading activity is likely to be influenced by significant employment data released in the premarket which may

EU officials signaled Tuesday The European Commission which is the executive arm of the EU said it was embarking on a competition investigation looking at the markets for virtual worlds and generative artificial intelligence As part of its assessment the commission said it wants to understand how competitive these markets are currently and gain insight on how competition law can help these fields The European Commission also said it is looking into some of the agreements that have been concluded between large digital market players and generative AI developers and providers and singled out the Microsoft-OpenAI tie-up as a particular deal it will be studying The European Commission is checking whether Microsofts investment in OpenAI might be reviewable under the EU Merger Regulation the commission said in a statement on Tuesday Microsoft did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment The commission said it has sent requests for information to several large digital players and is also seeking views from interested parties which have until March 11 to submit responses Virtual worlds and generative AI are rapidly developing Margrethe Vestager European commissioner for competition said in a statement Tuesday It is fundamental that these new markets stay competitive and that nothing stands in the way of businesses growing and providing the best and most innovative products to consumers Microsoft has put billions of dollars into OpenAI the firm behind the popular AI chatbot ChatGPT The company has integrated some OpenAI technology into its Office Bing and Windows products and provides OpenAI with its own Azure cloud computing tools The Redmond Washington-based technology giant first invested in OpenAI in 2019 contributing $1 billion in cash The company then grabbed headlines last year when it reportedly poured a further $10 billion into OpenAI with its total investment to date reportedly swelling to $13 billion News of the EU review comes after the UKs Competition and Markets Authority announced in December that it was launching an initial review into Microsofts investment The US Federal Trade Commission is also reportedly assessing the tie-up according to Bloomberg News The CMA said it is assessing whether Microsofts stake in AI created a relevant merger situation citing a number of developments in the governance of OpenAI some of which involved Microsoft as a primary source of concern Earlier in the year OpenAI faced a period of tumult when its CEO Sam Altman was ousted from the board in a shock move In a dramatic turn of events ex-Twitch CEO Emmett Shear briefly took the top job before being removed and replaced with Altman while the board was given a makeover As part of that refresh Microsoft added its own observer to sit on the board leading to concerns that the company may be exerting control over OpenAI For its part Microsoft has sought to stressed that its designated board observer who was recently named as Dee Templeton is a nonvoting member At the time of the CMA announcement Microsoft said that it did not in any way hold equity ownership in OpenAI while OpenAI said that it remained independent and operates competitively Their non-voting board observer does not provide them with governing authority or control over OpenAIs operations an OpenAI spokesperson told CNBC via email in December While details of our agreement remain confidential it is important to note that Microsoft does not own any portion of OpenAI and is simply entitled to share of profit distributions Frank Shaw Microsoft chief communications officer said in a December statement At the heart of concerns is Microsofts close partnership and investment in OpenAI which gives the US titan access to one of the most advanced developers of AI tools today OpenAIs GPT-4 large language model can handle a rumored 25000 words of input text — a big step up from the existing ChatGPT limit of 4096 characters Academics have said that GPT-4 has demonstrated human-level performance in various academic exams while some AI researchers and technologists have speculated GPT-4 may come close to artificial general intelligence or AGI which is meant to be as smart or smarter than humans OpenAI which was set up with the express purpose of developing artificial general intelligence has said its committed to ensuring the technology is developed safely and limiting harms to society In a February 2023 blog post the company said it believes in a gradual transition to world with AGI rather than a sudden one and that the best way to solve challenges posed by AI was through a feedback loop between policymakers and the private sector We expect powerful AI to make the rate of progress in the world much faster and we think its better

Nope The hedge fund manager (and Carolina Panthers owner) probably doesnt factor dividends into his thinking much if at all when picking stocks However that doesnt mean Tepper doesnt own plenty of dividend stocks There are more of them in the billionaires Appaloosa Management hedge fund than you might think Hes invested 38% of his portfolio in these five dividend stocks Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) ranks as the top holding in Teppers Appaloosa hedge fund As of Sept 30 2023 it owned 195 million shares -- more than 115% of the overall portfolio at the time Until recently Meta wouldnt have made a list featuring Teppers dividend stocks However the social media leader announced on Feb 1 2024 that its initiating a quarterly dividend of $050 per share This translates to a dividend yield of around 044% Its not great but its a start Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) trails Meta as Teppers second-largest position Appaloosa owned 164 million shares of the technology giant at the end of the third quarter of 2023 enough to make up nearly 102% of the hedge funds portfolio Many big tech companies dont pay dividends Microsoft though initiated a dividend program way back in 2003 Its dividend currently yields 074% The company has increased its dividend payout by an impressive 168% over the last 10 years Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) isnt the third-largest position for Tepper That honor belongs to Amazon However the graphics processing unit (GPU) maker is the billionaires No 4 holding comprising 88% of his total portfolio Appaloosa owned 102 million shares of Nvidia at the end of Q3 Unlike Amazon Nvidia pays a dividend Granted its not a huge one: The chipmakers dividend yield is only 002% Still the company has increased its payout by 88% since initiating a dividend program in 2015 With a dividend payout ratio of barely over 2% the company could easily boost its dividend a lot more if it chooses Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) is Appaloosas ninth-largest holding lagging behind several stocks that dont pay dividends At the end of the third quarter of 2023 the hedge fund owned 625 million shares of Intel representing nearly 44% of its portfolio Ordinarily Intels dividend yield of close to 12% wouldnt be anything to get excited about Compared to most of Teppers top holdings though this yield looks fantastic However theres a yellow flag to note: Intel slashed its dividend payout by more than 65% last year as part of a larger cost-cutting effort Not every dividend stock that Tepper owns is in the tech sector Federal Express (NYSE: FDX) ranks as his 10th largest position As of Sept 30 2023 Teppers hedge fund owned 650000 shares of FedEx making up 34% of its portfolio FedExs dividend yield of over 21% is quite respectable So is the companys payout ratio of under 29% Arguably the best thing about FedExs dividend program is its track record of dividend increases Over the last 10 years the shipping and logistics giant has boosted its dividend payout by a whopping 740% I wouldnt recommend buying any of these stocks solely for their dividends However several of them should deliver strong growth over the next decade and beyond If I had to pick just one as the best of the bunch Id go with Meta Platforms I like Microsoft and Nvidia too but Meta has been underrated by Wall Street in my view The companys recent blowout quarterly results underscore how much potential it has Should you invest $1000 in Meta Platforms right now?

875,"Microsoft CEO Nadella: GitHub Code Pilot tool is companys most mature GenAI product","2/1/2024","https://www.crn.com.au/news/microsoft-ceo-nadella-github-code-pilot-tool-is-companys-most-mature-genai-product-604688","Microsoft Chairman and CEO Satya Nadella suggested an end to a prolonged period of new-business slowdown and longer “optimisation cycles” by customers that increased tech spending during the height of the global pandemic while telling analysts he is starting to see generative artificial intelligence become “standard issue” for some customers particularly when it comes to coders On Tuesday’s quarterly earnings call for the Redmond Wash-based tech company–Microsoft’s second fiscal quarter ended Dec 31–Nadella said that two months into Microsoft 365 Copilot’s general availability period adoption has been “much faster” compared with other product suites including E3 and E5 He attributed that growth to AI’s ease of adoption: “It shows up in your apps you click on it … and it becomes a daily habit” he said “It reminds me a little bit of … PC adoption” Nadella said “It first starts off with few people having access There are many companies that are doing standard issue So just like PCs became standard issue at some point after PCs being adopted by early adopters I think that’s the cycle that at least we expect” He pointed to Microsoft’s GitHub Copilot code generation tool as the most mature GenAI product at Microsoft saying that its necessity for programmers is akin to spelling and grammar checks in Microsoft Word “This is the place where it’s most evolved in terms of its economic benefits or productivity benefits” Nadella told analysts on the call “We see it inside of Microsoft We see it in all the case studies … It is the one place where it’s become a standard issue for any developer … It’s like if you take away spell check for Word Ill be unemployable” As for the trend of customers slowing down spending on new tech workloads and projects to focus on getting the most out of existing spend—a trend that saw mass layoffs at Microsoft itself and other tech vendors and solution providers—Nadella suggested a return to normality “That period of massive—I’ll call it ‘optimisation only and no new workloads start’–that I think has ended at this point” Nadella said “So what you’re seeing is much more of that continuous cycle by customers both when it comes to AI or whether it comes to the traditional workloads” Microsoft CFO Amy Hood appeared to echo Nadella’s comments “Whether you use the word ‘lapping’ [for] these optimisation comparables or the comparables easing—it’s all sort of the same thing—that were getting to that point in H2 [Microsoft’s second half of its fiscal year] that’s absolutely true” Hood said “We like to talk about the contribution of AI specifically for the reasons Satya talked about This is starting to be the application of AI at scale And we want to be able to show people this is how that’s going to look” Microsoft has about 400000 channel partners worldwide according to the CRN US 2023 Channel Chiefs Microsoft’s lift of the 300-minimum-seat requirement for M365 Copilot—an adjustment that could open Copilot access to more solution providers and more solution provider customers—was meant to appeal to customers who “want to do a land with a smaller group see the productivity gains and then expand” Hood said “Being able to lift some of the seat requirements that we did earlier this month is really going to allow customers to be able to use that approach” she said Nadella said that two months into Microsoft 365 Copilot’s general availability adoption has been “much faster” compared with other product suites including E3 and E5 Nadella shared a series of product growth highlights to show more use of AI and cloud offerings from the vendor Those highlights included: Nadella suggested that so far the main use of AI has been summarisation including summarising Teams meetings during the meeting or even after it plus summarising Word documents emails and other content “Summarisation has become a big deal” he said Drafting content chats and actions with AI are other common uses so far he said He compared the changes in work and workflow with Copilot as akin to the changes after people started using Microsoft Excel and email “Anytime you want to start something that blank page thing goes away and you start by prompting and drafting” Nadella said “Chat to me the most powerful feature is now you have the most important database in your company which happens to be the database of your documents and communications is now queriable by natural language in a powerful way … Actions one of the most used things is here is a Word document go create a PowerPoint So those are the [things] that are also beginning” As for early AI revenue and use cases Nadella said that Microsoft’s Azure AI revenue is mostly from customer inferencing—the process of running live data through a trained AI model to make a prediction or solve a task And even after customers build an AI workload they will continue to optimize the workload over time Nadella said Nadella repeated his opinion that AI will “have a very foundational impact” on computer architecture “Everything from power power density to the data center design to what used to be the accelerator now is sort of the main CPU so to speak or the main compute unit” Nadella said “And the network the memory architecture all of it” He said that AI is also “redefining what … the cloud looks like both at the infrastructure level and the app model” Hood said that Copilot revenue will show up in Microsoft’s average revenue per user (ARPU) measure rather than in seat growth She highlighted positive activity in moving customers to more expensive product suites which partners play a role in “Seat growth as we talk about is primarily from at this point small medium-sized businesses and really frontline worker scenarios” she said “A very separate thing is being able to add ARPU And traditionally and again this quarter that’s come over time from E3 and from E5 And we’re continuing to see very healthy suite momentum and … very good renewal … You’re going to see Copilot revenue will land there as ARPU That won’t show as seat growth So you’ll have E3 E5 transitions Copilot all show up in ARPU over time” When asked if he is looking at changing pricing for GitHub Copilot Nadella said that he still finds Microsoft’s ARPU measure low “Even though we’ve had a lot of success its not like we are a high-priced ARPU company” he said “I think what you’re going to start finding is—whether it’s Sales Copilot or Service Copilot or GitHub Copilot or Security Copilot—theyre going to fundamentally capture some of the value they drive in terms of the productivity of the Opex … Then even the horizontal Copilot … The Office 365 or Microsoft 365 level even there you can make the same argument Whatever ARPU we may have with E5 now you can see incrementally as a percentage of the Opex how much will you pay for a Copilot to give you more time savings for example” Nadella said that “all up I do see this as a new vector for us in what I call the next phase of knowledge work and frontline work … I never thought of the tools business as fundamentally participating in the operating expenses of a company’s spend on let’s say development activity And now you’re seeing that transition It is just not tools It’s about the productivity of your dev team” When asked about how Microsoft is investing so much into AI without a larger hit to margins Hood pointed to consistent investing across the technology stack and said that Microsoft hasn’t needed to add a “material number of people to the workforce” “Think about it as building that consistency without needing to add a lot of resources to do that” Hood said “It’s been a real pivot of our entire investment infrastructure to be working on this work And I think that’s important because it means you’re shifting to an AI-first position not just in the language we use but in what people are working on day to day That does obviously create a leverage opportunity” On chip and data center supply Hood said the vendor feels “really good about where we have been in terms of adding capacity” Microsoft has built its own capacity and worked with third parties “You started to see the acceleration in our capital expense starting almost a year ago and you’ve seen it scale through that process” she said “And that is going toward as we talked about servers and also new data center footprints to be able to meet what we see as this demand and really changing demand as we look forward … Looking forward you’ll tend to see … accelerated capital expense to continue to be able to add capacity in the coming quarters given what we see in terms of pipeline” Nadella also shared some product highlights showing the growth in Microsoft’s cloud communications and security businesses Microsoft Cloud revenue for the quarter was US$337 billion up 22 per cent year over year ignoring foreign exchange Microsoft saw US$62 billion in revenue during the quarter a 16 per cent increase year over year ignoring foreign exchange Hood cited “strong execution by our sales teams and partners” for share gains in the quarter Commercial bookings grew 9 per cent ignoring foreign exchange Commercial remaining performance obligation (CRPO) increased 16 per cent to US$222 billion About 45 per cent will be recognised in revenue in the next 12 months up 15 per cent year over year she said The vendor’s operating income was US$27 billion up 33 per cent Net income was US$219 billion up 33 per cent The productivity and business processes segment which includes Office Commercial Office Consumer LinkedIn and Dynamics brought in US$192 billion for the quarter up 12 per cent ignoring foreign exchange Office Commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 13 per cent year over year Office 365 Commercial revenue grew 16 per cent Office Consumer products and cloud services revenue increased 4 per cent And Microsoft 365 Consumer subscribers grew to 784 million up 16 per cent year over year Dynamics products and cloud services revenue increased 19 per cent year over year Dynamics 365 revenue grew 24 per cent year over year Microsoft’s “intelligent cloud” segment which includes Azure SQL Server Windows Server Visual Studio Nuance GitHub enterprise and partner services Microsoft Partner Network and learning brought in US$259 billion for the quarter up 19 per cent ignoring foreign exchange rates Server products and cloud services revenue increased 20 per cent year over year Azure and other cloud services revenue grew 28 per cent with 6 points of growth from AI services “Both AI and non-AI Azure services drove our outperformance” she said The per-user business the Enterprise Mobility and Security installed base grew 11 per cent to more than 268 million seats Microsoft’s “more personal computing” segment which includes Windows OEM devices Xbox content and news advertising brought in US$169 billion for the quarter an increase of 18 per cent ignoring foreign exchange Windows revenue grew 9 per cent year over year Windows OEM revenue grew 11 per cent Windows Commercial products and cloud services revenue grew 7 per cent Devices revenue decreased 10 per cent Hood said that “PC market volumes continued to stabilise at pre-pandemic levels” Microsoft’s cash flow from operations was US$189 billion up to 69 per cent and driven by strong cloud billings and collections Hood said Free cash flow was US$91 billion up 86 per cent year over year Microsoft’s stock traded at about US$408 a share after hours about the same as before market close Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage should decrease about 1 point year over year in the third fiscal quarter Hood said Third-quarter cloud gross margin percentage will be about flat Capital expenditures should “increase materially on a sequential basis driven by investments in our cloud and AI infrastructure” Hood said Microsoft expects the productivity and business processes segment to see revenue of US$193 billion to US$196 billion growth between 10 and 12 per cent year over year Office 365 revenue growth should be about 15 per cent The on-premises business should decline in the low 20s Office consumer revenue should grow in the mid to high single digits Dynamics revenue should grow in the midteens The intelligent cloud segment should bring in revenue between US$26 billion and US$263 billion up 18 per cent

878,"Microsoft Will Use Intel to Manufacture Home-Grown Processor","2/22/2024","https://tech.hindustantimes.com/tech/news/microsoft-will-use-intel-to-manufacture-home-grown-processor-71708544952561.html","Copyright © HT Media Limited All rights reserved Intel Corp has landed Microsoft Corp as a customer for its made-to-order chip business marking a key win for an ambitious turnaround effort under Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger Microsoft plans to use Intels 18A manufacturing technology to make a forthcoming chip that the software maker designed in-house the two companies said at an event Wednesday They didnt identify the product but Microsoft recently announced plans for two homegrown chips: a computer processor and an artificial intelligence accelerator Intel has been seeking to prove it can compete in the foundry market where companies produce custom chips for clients Its a major shift for the semiconductor pioneer which once had the worlds most advanced chipmaking facilities and kept them to itself These days Intel is racing to catch up with companies like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co which leads the foundry industry Microsoft meanwhile is looking to secure a steady supply of semiconductors to power its data-center operations — especially as demand for AI grows Designing its own chips also lets Microsoft fine-tune the products to its specific needs “We need a reliable supply of the most advanced high-performance and high-quality semiconductors” Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in a statement “Thats why we are so excited to work with Intel” Read More: Microsoft Unveils Its First Custom-Designed AI Cloud Chips The broader industry has struggled to get enough advanced silicon — particularly Nvidia Corps highly prized accelerator chips which help develop chatbots and other AI services For Intel securing a large customer for its foundry business should help reassure investors that Gelsingers comeback bid remains on track His plan involves building out the chipmakers factory operations to handle the increased load — a costly gamble — as well as restoring Intels once-dominant technological prowess The company is looking to governments in the US and Europe to help defray the costs and seeing Microsoft on board may help that effort Intel has held talks with the Biden administration to secure more than $10 billion in subsidies under the Chips and Science Act Bloomberg reported last week Microsoft and cloud-computing rivals Amazoncom Inc and Alphabet Incs Google are among the largest buyers of advanced chips which they use to power their data centers Theyve increasingly turned toward using their own designs — a trend thats hurt Intel in its most lucrative business Acting as a foundry for Microsoft and others could help grab back at least a portion of that lost revenue Most so-called chipmakers dont actually own plants and instead outsource their production mainly to TSMC and Samsung Electronics Co Intel is far behind both companies in the foundry market but it aims to at least overtake Samsung by the end of the decade Last year Intel had less than $1 billion of revenue from outsourcing compared with almost $70 billion at TSMC which has a market share of nearly 60% Samsung has about 15% of the business according to Bloomberg Intelligence Gelsinger also has promised that he will have the worlds best production technology again by 2025 — a timeline that remains on track the company said Intel also has a new product that uses the 18A process showing that the technology is ready for adoption by outside customers And it announced an even more advanced approach called 14A The Santa Clara California-based company is also separating its design and product groups from Intels manufacturing and process development arms Thats another major shift Throughout most of Intels 55-year history the old arrangement had been touted as a key advantage: Designers worked closely with production teams to make sure that Intels products got the best transistors in the industry But the new approach makes it easier to work with designers from outside customers And it helps ensure that Intel doesnt favor its own production needs over those of clients according to Stu Pann who runs the foundry division Customer orders will be “sacrosanct” he said in an interview ahead of the event Pann said Intel will hold separate staff meetings and take all other steps required to keep its production teams at arms length And unlike manufacturers concentrated in East Asia Intel will be able to offer customers a geographically diverse factory network he said That helps reduce the risk of supply chain snags “From our board on down people understand what were getting into” Pann said “There is no going back This is a zero tolerance business The minute we make a visible mistake we will burn the bridges weve made” AI-created images and audio are so good most people cant tell them from the real thing But we can rely on critical thinking instead

902,"Microsoft: Retail AI Operations Indicate Continued Growth Amid Valuation Risk","1/17/2024","https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-retail-ai-operations-indicate-190017625.html","Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) recently briefly surpassed Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) as the highest-valued company in the world; it has very sound management focused on shareholder returns which is elicited in the financial statements Its largest contributor to growth will likely be artificial intelligence which places it in direct competition with Alphabets (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google as a peer with the most advanced capabilities in the industry Particularly both companies are focusing on artificial intelligence integrations for retailers creating tension over market share Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with MSFT While Microsoft has valuation risks it remains a strong growth stock considering its operational strengths However its above-index returns are largely dependent on AI success with considerable regulatory risks that could inhibit stock growth and create volatility Nonetheless the company remains one of the safer ways to gain exposure to AI Microsoft has introduced generative AI and data solutions for retailers with a focus on personalized shopping experiences A copilot template for Azure OpenAI Service assists with engaging customer interactions As an example Canadian Tire Corp (CDNAF) is launching an AI shopping assistant to aid customers in purchasing automotive products The company is also integrating generative AI into tools used by store associates and managers with the intention of enhancing productivity and customer service Voice-enabled task creation and real-time access to insights and information should further improve retail efficiencies Microsoft Fabric is a unified analytics platform for unlocking retail data improving the planning and design of data solutions and driving forward AI-driven retail analytics The company is also integrating models of GPT-4 Turbo on Azure OpenAI Service increasing the broad range of applications due to the partnership with OpenAI To counter Microsofts retail AI progress Google Cloud has launched new GenAI products which are aimed at personalizing online shopping experiences and making back-office operations more efficient Conversational Commerce Solution and Catalog and Content Enrichment use advanced AI models to enhance engagement and automate content creation Additionally Google introduced an AI Hypercomputer which integrates software hardware and machine learning It improves productivity and efficiency and includes support for various machine learning tools such as PyTorch and TensorFlow Its recent launch of Gemini a new AI model that is statistically the most advanced in the world right now accompanied its AI Hypercomputer developments Both Microsoft and Google seem to be competing directly but taking nuanced approaches to their respective projects As such the competitive risk to Microsoft is both arguably enhanced and reduced by Googles abilities as larger traction in the AI market will drive awareness of Microsofts tools as well As I mentioned statistically based on 30 out of 32 academic benchmarks Gemini is above OpenAIs ChatGPT at current in terms of technical proficiencies Microsoft is arguably strongest in the area of profitability with industry-leading margins that should increase further as operational efficiencies get stronger due to AI This is largely expected due to reduced headcount in specific sections of the business as automation takes over human labor The companys net margin is 3532% at the moment which is better than 9728% of companies in the software industry according to GuruFocu data The gross margin is also an impressive 6944% Google has a net margin of 2246% significantly lower than Microsofts and Googles gross margin is only 5588% This positions Microsoft in a very strong position to invest further in advanced AI For its first quarter of fiscal year 2024 Microsoft reported $565 billion in revenue which is a 13% year-over-year increase Its operating income was $269 billion a 25% increase Its net income was $223 billion with diluted earnings per share of $299 Revenue for the companys Intelligent Cloud segment increased 19% year over year with server products and cloud services revenue increasing 21% due to Azure; other cloud services growth was 29% The companys Intelligent Cloud segment largely responsible for its AI initiatives is the greatest component of the organizations revenues: Microsofts balance sheet is also quite strong with 5049% of its total assets balanced by total liabilities and 4951% balanced by total equity for the last trailing 12 months Total equity has risen from 3196% in 2018 showing considerable financial prudence on the part of the management team The company has also issued more debt in the last 12 months with $22515 billion in net issuance However its total cash flow from financing over the period is -$18291 billion largely due to dividend payments and stock repurchases showing continued investment in shareholder returns The largest weakness with an investment in Microsoft is its valuation which is no surprise as it briefly became the worlds most valuable company with a market cap of around $289 trillion surpassing Apples market cap of around $287 trillion Microsoft has a forward price-earnings ratio of around 35 compared to Apples ratio of 28 and Googles ratio of 21 Assuming Microsoft maintains its strong annual earnings per share without NRI growth rates which have increased from 1750% as a 12-year average to 22% as a five-year average and 1940% as a three-year average the stock could be considered moderately overvalued at present based on my discounted cash flow calculation By taking a moderate estimate of a 19% annual earnings per share without NRI growth rate for the next 10 years which I think is conservative but would price in inhibitions such as regulatory constraints on progress in AI the fair value of the stock is around $336 approximately a 155% downside on the current stock price of around $388 The discounted cash flow analysis assumes a 4% growth rate for a 10-year terminal stage following the 19% growth period and a 10% discount rate By a different method the GF Value chart shows the stock to be fairly valued and so investors must realize they are not allocating capital to undervalued shares but instead to a high-growth enterprise that particularly shines on profitability and has operational strengths already priced in The company might see significant inhibition to its earnings and revenue growth if regulatory hurdles slow down retail AI operations In addition there are severe security risks associated with the transfer and collection of data crucial to advanced AI practices in retail and other workplaces As a company focused intently on artificial intelligence for its continued growth I think investors should expect periods of slower growth as markets accustom themselves to new technologies related to AI Microsoft will potentially be at the forefront of case studies related to policy and regulation in jurisdictions around the world In addition even if the stock is fairly valued this means there is no margin of safety if the AI industry performs less promising than expected The hopes and estimates for the industry are well-founded and Grand View Research estimates an annual growth rate of 373% for the sector from 2023 to 2030 By 2030 the AI market is projected to be worth over $13 trillion but some volatility on the way to this high estimate is likely and should be expected in my opinion I think Microsoft is one of the most stable ways to gain exposure to AI particularly as it is also diversified beyond these operations The companys venture into retail AI and its partnership with OpenAI make a strong foundation to compete with Google to become the dominant player in the field Its financials are sound with exceptional margins and the main real risk to consider is a potentially overvalued stock My rating for the stock is buy This article first appeared on GuruFocus Related Quotes"

follows: Investors cheered Microsofts first-quarter results reported in late October as it beat Wall Streets estimates and promised future product offerings infused with AI With copilots we are making the age of AI real for people and businesses everywhere said Satya Nadella Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Microsoft We are rapidly infusing AI across every layer of the tech stack and for every role and business process to drive productivity gains for our customers Within the details Microsoft reported the following highlights During Q1 Microsoft experienced a notable acceleration in its Azure cloud revenue growth marking a significant shift after two years of slowing momentum This uptick has captured the attention of analysts who anticipate a continuation of this trend in the upcoming Q2 Earnings Report Additionally theres a growing interest in the performance of the Microsoft 365 CoPilot AI add-on which was launched last year and is available on a subscription basis Despite its innovative approach the add-on has so far received mixed reviews Microsofts recent completion of the $687 billion acquisition of video game publisher Activision Blizzard is set to influence Q2 earnings This acquisition finalised in mid-October is expected to be a topic of discussion by Microsoft executives particularly in regards to its impact on the financial guidance for Q3 Another point of interest is the managements perspective on the recent developments at OpenAI along with their viewpoints on the current structure of the OpenAI board which has been the subject of much discussion Building on an almost 57% gain in 2023 Microsofts share price has surged over 6% in the opening weeks of 2024 as investors began the new year with renewed enthusiasm for tech stocks

orderly pullbacks The RSI is now pushing into overbought territory which offers hope that a pullback may not be too far away providing an opportunity to buy Microsoft shares at better levels Near-term horizontal support comes in at $380/378 and below that at around $360 coming from July highs/ December lows Medium-term support is strong in the $350/335 area coming from the uptrend drawn from January 2023s $21935 low and the 200-day moving average at $33700 To note a sustained break below $335 would negate the uptrend and warn that a deeper pullback is underway This information has been

915,"None","1/2/2024","https://seekingalpha.com/article/4660676-microsoft-stock-worth-holding-onto-long-term-investors","David Becker David Becker Microsoft Corporation’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) presence in enterprise software and cloud services has strengthened and the company may be able to recoup its increased spending on generative AI technology by attracting new customers and adjusting pricing for its offerings MSFT’s 2024 sales-growth estimates are trending upward which I expect to continue into 2025 driven partly by a rebound in cloud growth and monetization of various AI copilots Although the stock is currently trading at the higher end of its three-year range I remain optimistic on the companys growth prospects and assign a buy rating to the stock Microsoft reported significant improvements during Q1 2024 with revenue beating across the three major segments highlighted by Azure reaccelerating to 28% in cc and beating the high end of the guide Microsoft Azures fiscal 1Q24 expansion was about 200 bps ahead of consensus with AI workloads contributing about 300 bps to the growth rate This metric is encouraging for Microsofts cloud growth over the next 12 months even as the guidance of 26-27% indicates a slight deceleration from 1Q24 which I attribute to conservatism amid rising geopolitical tensions globally The company provided guidance for 2Q24 with top-line guidance coming in mostly in-line with consensus expectations for PBP and IC and notably higher for MPC mostly driven by Activision Also profitability came in better than expected for both gross margins and operating margins with the company taking a prudent approach to spending in the coming fiscal year and still a relatively easy y/y comp in Q2 Microsoft is not only incorporating generative AI into its Azure cloud services but also across its various software applications The company has introduced AI assistants called Copilot to enhance productivity for its users Despite the rising costs associated with increased AI usage Microsoft expects to maintain a flat operating margin for the year and believes that the investments in AI will lead to higher revenues in the future Gartner Gartner Microsofts M365 which encompasses most of its productivity software from Office (Excel Word etc) to Outlook is emerging as a far more stable and dependable source of growth while other key areas like cloud and PC sales have slowed in the past 12 months Microsofts Office suite plays a crucial role in the companys financial stability especially when other business segments are affected by geopolitical and economic challenges The introduction of enhanced security features in Microsofts premium E5 suite priced at $57 per month per user is expected to motivate enterprises to upgrade from the E3 suite priced at $36 per month I anticipate that sales growth for Office products and cloud services will continue at a low-double-digit rate over the next two years regardless of the economic conditions Currently less than 15% of the total Office user base is using the premium E5 suite indicating a potential for steady growth over several years The segment represents about 23% of Microsofts total sales and I expect it to experience modest double-digit sales growth in the next year This growth will be supported by various factors including recent price increases including for the companys Copilot generative AI which can assist with cloud usage and appeals to customers looking to control expenses Microsofts collaboration tool Teams has expanded its reach by making its software accessible to front-line workers such as retail employees and factory staff who traditionally didnt use Microsoft Office The company has introduced the Microsoft 365 F3 suite tailored for front-line workers priced at $8 per user per month Microsoft’s bundling of various offerings has been a key driver of this growth Usage of teams among corporations have continued to increase with 91% of the Fortune 100 companies using Microsoft Teams for collaborations Moreover corporations have started to build custom applications using Teams as a communications tool which I anticipate will make Teams a stickier product as it will then make it a product with high switching costs The consensus estimates for Microsoft Azures sales for FY 2024 have risen following strong first-quarter results driven by increased AI workloads and some stabilization in clients managing the overall cloud spending In the first quarter Microsofts operating margins expanded by approximately 470 basis points driven by improved gross margins and effective cost management This indicates that the company can handle the higher processing costs associated with AI workloads as the year progresses I expect the pace of hiring to remain modest despite the potential for higher organic sales growth Additionally the acquisition of Activision may temporarily impact operating margins However I anticipate that this impact will be offset by rigorous cost control measures Microsofts stock is up 57% YTD The forward 12-month P/E ratio now stands at 332x compared to around 24x at the same time last year The multiple is also at a premium to its tech comps that include AMZN ADBE INTU and META MSFT’s premium multiple is justified in my view given the company’s relatively stickier & more recurring enterprise software revenue streams as well as long-term upside revenue potential being unlocked by AI capabilities; and materially less exposure to advertising eCommerce compared to the peer group While MSFT’s current multiple is slightly above the three-year median of 293x it falls within the range of 20-35x over the past three year I expect margins and earnings growth to improve in 2025 especially once the financials of the Activision acquisition complete a full year Moreover MSFT continues to benefit significantly from increased enterprise spending on generative AI which could potentially drive sales growth even higher than what the market currently expects Hence I remain positive on the company and assign a buy rating to the stock Capital IQ Capital IQ There are several downside risks to investing in Microsoft at the moment Microsofts AI practices and copyright policies might face substantial regulatory and media scrutiny due to the companys significant investment in OpenAI and recent European Union regulations Stricter regulations around AI might be a hindrance to the companys progress in AI which may fizzle the hype around the stock Moreover increased competition particularly from major tech giants like Google Facebook and Amazon and the possibility of margin compression due to investments in Azure and OpenAI are also additional risks that the stock faces I remain optimistic on Microsoft due to the ongoing growth opportunities in substantial IT spending categories the potential to capitalize further on its strong presence in various markets and a robust financial profile characterized by consistent margin expansion Microsofts stock is currently trading at the higher end of its range I believe the premium is justified due to the companys early leadership in AI and its dominant position in a competitive market which is especially advantageous in the current economic climate Hence I remain optimistic on the company and assign a buy rating to

Microsoft has a solid growth driver in the form of artificial intelligence (AI) pushing it higher Microsoft stock did see a dip in its stock price following the release of the companys fiscal 2024 second-quarter results on Jan 30 It seems investors had some concern about an increase in its operating expenses What those investors seemed to ignore however is that Microsofts fiscal Q2 revenue jump was the fastest since 2022 Lets take a closer look at the factors that have led to an acceleration in Microsofts growth and check how much upside this Magnificent Seven stock could deliver over the next three years Microsofts fiscal Q2 revenue (for the three months ended Dec 31 2023) was up 18% year over year to $62 billion The companys non-GAAP net income increased at a faster pace of 33% from the prior-year period to $293 per share The numbers were well ahead of consensus expectations of $277 per share in earnings on revenue of $611 billion Microsofts cloud business played a key role in powering its growth last quarter The companys Intelligent Cloud business segment which includes revenue from the Azure cloud platform increased 20% year over year to $259 billion Whats more Microsofts Azure cloud revenue increased an impressive 30% year over year exceeding the 277% increase that Wall Street was looking for Microsoft management pointed out on the latest earnings conference call that AI services accelerated Azures growth by 6 percentage points last quarter That was an improvement over the 3 percentage point increase seen in the first quarter of the fiscal year and Microsoft claims that the integration of AI-focused services into its cloud offerings is helping it gain market share CEO Satya Nadella said on the earnings call: We now have 53000 Azure AI customers Over one-third are new to Azure over the past 12 months He pointed out that the Azure platform gives customers access to a wide range of large language models (LLMs) and small language models (SLMs) which they can use to run AI training and inference applications with the help of accelerators from Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices As a result multiple corporations are lining up to use Microsofts Azure OpenAI service and the company is witnessing larger and more strategic Azure deals with an increase in the number of billion-dollar-plus Azure commitments This explains why Microsofts cloud business grew at a faster pace when compared to rivals Alphabets Google Cloud for instance saw a 26% year-over-year increase in revenue last quarter Amazon Web Services on the other hand saw a 13% year-over-year jump in revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023 This makes it clear that Microsoft is indeed gaining share in the lucrative cloud computing market Mordor Intelligence estimates that the size of the AI-based cloud computing market could grow from $67 billion in 2024 to $275 billion in 2029 at a compound annual rate of 32% So Microsofts growing share of the cloud computing market should allow it to capitalize on this huge opportunity and boost its growth Analysts anticipate Microsoft will finish the current fiscal year with $244 billion in revenue an increase of 15% over the previous year That points toward a nice acceleration over the 7% revenue growth Microsoft delivered in fiscal 2023 More importantly Microsoft is expected to sustain its healthy growth rate over the next couple of years as well MSFT Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year data by YCharts If Microsofts revenue indeed jumps to $319 billion at the end of fiscal 2026 and it maintains its current price-to-sales ratio of 135 at that time its market cap could jump to just over $43 trillion That points toward a 43% jump within the next three years However Microsoft could deliver stronger growth if it continues to capture a bigger share of the cloud computing market thanks to AI which is why investors can still buy this AI stock even after the impressive returns it has clocked in the past year Suzanne Frey an executive at Alphabet is a member of The Motley Fools board of directors John Mackey former CEO of Whole Foods Market an Amazon subsidiary is a member of The Motley Fools board of directors Harsh Chauhan has no position in any of the stocks mentioned The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Advanced Micro Devices Alphabet Amazon Microsoft and Nvidia The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy Invest better with The Motley Fool Get stock recommendations portfolio guidance and more from The Motley Fools premium services Making the world smarter happier and richer © 1995 - 2024 The Motley Fool All rights reserved Market data powered by Xignite and Polygonio"

925,"Does this Mark the End of the Windows Mixed Reality?","2/12/2024","https://www.xrtoday.com/mixed-reality/does-this-mark-the-end-of-windows-mixed-reality/","Home → Mixed Reality Following no mention during a fiscal year earnings call Microsoft drops MR support on latest Windows 11 update Published: February 12 2024 Rory Greener With the debut of Vision Pro and spatial computing hitting the mainstream audiences could reasonably assume that firms with established XR projects and products such as Microsoft or Snap would re-establish their investments in XR However it appears that despite using the spatial computing term before Apple Microsoft is dropping more support for Windows Mixed Reality – a framework for enabling consumer-based desktop-powered MR experiences Recent reports highlight how in its most recent Windows 11 24h2 update Microsoft is removing some support frameworks for its MR hardware and software portfolio The update sees Windows Mixed Reality hit the firm’s “Deprecated Features” list which congregates features that Microsoft is no longer working on Profoundly suggesting that Microsoft is dropping support for the product However the list description notes “occasionally new versions also remove features and functionality often because they’ve added a newer option” so there could be a new version of the Mixed Reality product coming – this is not confirmed though Still currently MR support appears to have been dropped Microsoft is stopping development on MR functions on Windows 11 and according to reports Microsoft is stopping compatibility on 1 November 2026 for Windows Home and Pro users and 1 November 2027 for Windows Commercial Moreover if Windows Mixed Reality users need support for their XR products Microsoft will no longer provide it However despite lacking support for Mixed Reality on Windows 11 Microsoft notes that “this deprecation doesn’t affect HoloLens We remain committed to HoloLens and our enterprise customers” Microsoft recently shared details about its Fiscal Year 2024 Second Quarter earnings call The call covered various topics including genAI However it’s interesting to note that despite Microsoft’s increased focus on developing XR solutions since mid-2023 they did not mention their MR/spatial applications HoloLens 2 or industrial metaverse roadmap during the call While Microsoft’s primary focus is providing diverse digital solutions beyond immersive technologies the complete absence of XR in the call is notable This is especially true considering that less than a year ago the company shifted its investment away from XR in favour of genAI before picking it up again midway through the year Microsoft continues to roll out its immersive solutions to enterprise end-users worldwide including clients such as the US Army Boeing and SNC-Lavalin “We’re also using this AI moment to redefine our role in business applications” said Nadella The emerging AI landscape is proving fruitful for Microsoft with tangible financial benefits compared to its rocky road with XR over the past two years Therefore it’s understandable that Microsoft may be shifting its attention away from XR again despite the renewed interest in the space “In 2024 AI will become a first-class part of every PC” Nadella explained Microsoft appears to be entirely focused on AI which has proven successful thanks in part to their partnership with leading genAI firm OpenAI Even during the gaming segment of the earnings call the most traditional use case for XR Microsoft did not mention XR Instead they understandably referred to the power of AI in this space In the latter half of 2023 Microsoft was actively working on strengthening the support system for Windows Mixed Reality and the industrial Metaverse roadmap despite the recent decrease in interest and investment As part of this effort Microsoft partnered with Magic Leap and Qualcomm in 2023 and together they invested in scaling Microsoft’s Mixed Reality Toolkit 3 (MRTK3) an XR content creation platform for developers and enterprise partners This partnership allowed the MRTK3 framework to transition to an independent organization within GitHub which Microsoft owns This move made MRTK3 easily accessible to a broader range of users and hardware developers opening it to further investment Robin Seiler the Corporate Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of the Windows + Devices organization Microsoft explained: We believe that to be a true multi-platform toolkit that enables greater third-party collaboration MRTK needs to be recognized as an independent organization that expands beyond Microsoft’s sole jurisdiction That’s why we have moved MRTK3 Open-Source Software (OSS) outside of Microsoft into its own independent organization within GitHub From MRTK’s inception Seiler noted that Microsoft built it to “be cross-platform and open-source to benefit the entire ecosystem not just HoloLens 2” Despite solid partnerships in 2023 the firm’s recent Windows update may mark the end of Mixed Reality on consumer Windows devices; however as Microsoft states the move does not affect enterprise clients Mixed

Microsoft","2/20/2024","https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/industry/blog/financial-services/2024/02/20/from-exploration-to-innovation-4-key-stages-of-ai-adoption-for-insurers/","When it comes to AI insurers no longer need much convincing about the potential value of the technology to their business What they need is help partnership and a path to adoption that recognizes the unique demands of the insurance industry Some of the world’s largest insurance companies are busy innovating on early use cases to help them evaluate the potential impact of generative AI on their operations and businesses Most other insurers are not far behind Use cases that transform the industry With the recent availability of Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365 which integrates the magic of the technology into everyday applications like Microsoft Teams and Excel insurers understand that their employees and customers alike will welcome generative AI into their operations (if not demand it) Most insurers want to innovate quickly but carefully deriving maximum value from even the earliest steps while incurring minimal risk to the business Helping insurers unlock business value and deepen customer relationships through technology is what Microsoft Cloud for Financial Services is all about In our work with early AI adopters we have identified a set of progressive milestones that can help insurance companies explore generative AI so that its value can be assessed and scaled as quickly and productively as possible Unlock business value and deepen customer relationships Today most of the insurance companies we work with are evaluating projects at what we call the “exploring” phase—the early horizon where the technology is deployed on a limited basis While these use cases tend to focus on internal business scenarios they are executed with an eye to the far horizon of opportunity beyond improving operations to being central to new product development and reimagined processes To help insurance manage this long-term approach we recommend following a four-level maturity model that describes the AI adoption journey from early consideration to innovation at scale In a remarkable way generative AI can feel almost too appealing Brainstorming ideas for use cases can produce lists that are quite lengthy So it is important to prioritize The north star in this phase is speed to value which can be achieved by building use cases that are relatively simple to design and easy to deploy Use design thinking techniques to ideate use cases and map them in a two-by-two “value versus implementation” matrix to find the ones that will deliver higher business value Early use case scenarios are often designed to help employees do their jobs more efficiently For example in underwriting it can take the form of an internal chatbot to answer agent questions or help triage submissions Claims managers can realize immediate benefits using generative AI to transcribe first notice of loss conversations In marketing it can speed the process of developing presentations or drafting new content We work together with insurers by first conducting envisioning workshops choosing the most strategic options then building and deploying rapid prototypes This is where leveraging your technology partner or service provider can reap great benefits Keys to success in this phase: With the learnings from early efforts in hand insurers can gain the confidence to move up to more substantive use cases Business value is the key criterion and so every candidate should be evaluated on scalability (for example if it won’t scale don’t do it) Use cases can also include more than just text-based with visuals or audio incorporated for richer experiences Already we are seeing insurers building on early success to generate an innovation flywheel that generates speed scale and learning through experience To move to this next level the IT landscape needs to be made AI-ready The most important step is to prepare your data estate by migrating to a modern platform such as Microsoft Fabric which unifies data and analytics and has generative AI built in This positions the company to build custom copilots chatbots and other AI enhancements using Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service and other cutting-edge solutions It also ensures that critical concerns such as privacy security and compliance are fully addressed This is also the point to consider the organizational implications of AI not only identifying how roles will be impacted but also ensuring that frameworks and training are in place to ensure responsible AI over the long term Keys to success in this phase: Early adopters of AI in insurance are already building solutions designed to directly impact their operational efficiencies and increasingly the products and services they deliver It won’t be long before deeper innovation with AI will create significant differentiation among competitors and that has implications for every organization To enable the greatest competitive advantages with AI insurers will require a comprehensive cloud foundation that identifies and manages data from many sources and ensures that AI tools integrate smoothly with existing systems This is key to enabling AI development to scale as quickly as business requirements demand You want to be sure that cloud and AI are being provided responsibly and that it meets the industry’s stringent requirements for data privacy and protection microsoft responsible ai practices Organizationally business processes will change to ensure safety and responsibility We advocate creating committees or offices to define company values for using AI ensuring guardrails in operations and managing pipelines of use cases and measurement across the company Finally you want to ensure that your people are ready Roles will change over time and the workforce will accommodate this evolution best with training to build on their skill sets A great step you can take today is to put AI in their hands now with Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365 which integrates powerful capabilities into the productivity tools they use every day Keys to success in this phase: Building a foundation for AI success: Technology and data strategy As your organization considers how best to embrace generative AI we invite you to reach out to your Microsoft representative or technology partner for insights and ideas to move forward with confidence You can learn more about how Microsoft Cloud for Financial Services is helping our customers realize the future of insurance in the era of AI unlocking business value and deepening customer relationships Transcend boundaries with tailored industry solutions Accelerate time to value speed up innovation

938,"Microsoft Will Be One Of The Biggest Beneficiaries Of Artificial Intelligence (NASDAQ:MSFT)","2/24/2024","https://seekingalpha.com/article/4673167-microsoft-will-be-one-of-the-biggest-beneficiaries-of-artificial-intelligence","LIONEL BONAVENTURE/AFP via Getty Images LIONEL BONAVENTURE/AFP via Getty Images I think Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is in a very attractive position to capitalize on the AI opportunities that lie ahead Because Satya Nadellas foresight has ensured that Microsoft has a lot of synergy between its existing products and what AI can do The co-pilots available for Microsoft 365 and GitHub will help people be more productive by enabling them to work faster and more efficiently Additionally they help automate the tedious repetitive tasks so customers can focus on the creative tasks As a result Azure has gained market share in the second quarter thanks to this AI advantage with Azure AI and its LLM and SLM access And just how important the Copilot is to Microsoft can be seen by the fact that the Windows keyboard now has a Copilot button the first major keyboard change in 30 years And to put that in perspective GitHubs Copilot was a major contributor to GitHubs 40% year-over-year revenue growth And with OpenAI Dall-E and especially Soras impressive showcases of the last few days Microsoft has a lot going for it I also believe that generative AI will disrupt the search market and could threaten Googles dominance And the fact that OpenAI with its Transformers technology could be responsible for this is remarkable since it originally came from the Google Research Labs Microsoft has a fortress-like balance sheet $80 billion in cash and only $44 billion in long-term debt So the cash position is almost twice the long-term debt and they also generated $82 billion in net income over the last 12 months In this way it provides liquidity and protects the downside of the balance sheet Additionally the Azure growth story continues The Server Products and Cloud Services segment which includes Azure SQS Server Windows Server and GitHub had the following revenue growth rates since the second quarter of 2023: However if you look at Azure alone Azure is actually growing faster than the segment and is being dragged down by the server products which in some cases had negative growth rates And datacenter and server revenue will most likely benefit from the current AI trend and probably see better growth numbers over the course of 2024 and 2025 So Microsoft is well positioned to take advantage of the growth opportunities Then there are also the Dynamics products which include intelligent cloud-based applications This segment also grew 22% and 21% in the first two quarters of the current fiscal year So Microsoft has several fast-growing segments Data by YCharts Microsoft has a very favorable ROIC-WACC spread as their WACC is around 9% Therefore the spread is 31% - 9% = 22% Many companies would be happy if their ROIC was 22% which is already a very good value but Microsoft simply achieves this value as a spread This is a testament to the fact that Microsoft is one of the highest quality companies in the world Without significant competitive advantages this would not be possible Data by YCharts For comparison lets look at the ROICs of Google / Alphabet (GOOG) Meta / Facebook (META) Tesla Inc (TSLA) TSMC (TSM) and Broadcom (AVGO) all of which are incredibly strong and leading companies in their respective fields but have a ROIC that is roughly the same as Microsofts ROIC-WACC spread Microsoft Investor Relations Microsoft Investor Relations Plus Microsoft is a truly shareholder-friendly company The cash returned to shareholders through buybacks and dividends increases almost every year Microsofts dividend CAGR over the past 20 years has been about 13% and the annual dividend growth rate has typically been about 10% since 2017 From 2004 to 2024 the average annual return on MSFT stock is approximately 1467% and increases to 1696% with drip so you can see that the increasing dividends when reinvested have increased the total return by approximately 2% per year This is another sign that Microsofts dividend policy is working for shareholders DRIP Returns Calculator Dividend Channel DRIP Returns Calculator Dividend Channel It also shows that Microsoft has outperformed the S&P 500 by nearly four times over a 20-year period assuming an investment of $10000 Author Author I think it is always important to know what the market is pricing in and a reverse DCF is probably the best way to find out And right now based on the TTM diluted EPS of $1106 the market is pricing in EPS CAGR of about 12% to 13% over the next 10 years Historically the EPS growth rate has been as follows: 10Y: 1514% 5Y: 2074% and 3Y: 1814% All of these numbers are higher than what the market is pricing in So if Microsoft can continue this trend and deliver a CAGR in line with its track record the stock looks undervalued There are plenty of growth opportunities in generative AI and cloud and share buybacks should also help EPS So lets look at the guidance for EPS to get a better picture Seeking Alpha Earnings Estimates Seeking Alpha Earnings Estimates Microsofts earnings estimates for Jun 2028 are $2052 in EPS which at a 30x multiple gives a share price of about $615 Which represents an upside of ~50% over the period However looking at EPS beats and misses since June 2015 Microsoft has only missed yearly estimates once and beaten them eight times Therefore it is not unlikely that Microsoft will beat EPS estimates in the future as estimates tend to be conservative Now if we assume that Microsoft will continue to beat earnings for the next several years and that it will do so in 4 out of 5 years EPS of $23-$24 is realistic which would put the stock between $690 and $720 Data by YCharts I used a multiple of 30x as this is roughly the 10Y median and mean P/E ratio However I would not be surprised if the multiple is closer to 35x in 5 years due to generative AI and all the new opportunities But to be more conservative I used a 30x multiple That way I have a margin of safety I really think that AI is going to change our lives a lot probably more than smartphones did But the big question will be which companies will benefit the most And right now it looks like Microsoft will be one of the big beneficiaries because they have OpenAI and Sam Altman Plus they also have a kind of first mover advantage However I think this advantage is often overestimated as we have seen with Google and Yahoo In the end the best product usually wins And just as generative AI threatens to disrupt traditional search engines A new technology could pose a threat to generative AI in the future as our world becomes more fast-paced Additionally the first results of Microsofts Copilot are mixed and leave room for improvement But we have to keep in mind that this is only one of the first versions and that much will be improved On the other hand many companies have succeeded in streamlining and optimizing their work processes with the help of Microsoft and its AI offerings In the near future Microsoft Copilot will allow you to create your own GPTs with a simple set of prompts to further personalize the AI experience And multimodal search which combines GPT 4 with vision is likely to change the search experience enough to allow Microsoft to take more market share from Google Similarly the Deep Search feature is designed to improve search results It is designed to help answer complex and very specific questions that todays generation of search engines can only partially answer This combined with Azure AI and the AI capabilities of the various Office products should ensure that Microsoft has tremendous opportunities for future growth The impact on workflow is enormous when you can create a Word or PowerPoint document from a data set with a single click And ideally the data is analyzed immediately and key conclusions are presented If Microsoft comes up with a satisfactory solution it will shake up a lot of areas and probably will have a very positive impact on Microsofts future profits Therefore I firmly believe that Microsoft will be a stronger company in five years

per cent jump in quarterly revenue its best growth in nearly two years as rising adoption of its products infused with generative AI fuels demand for its cloud services Thanks to its early lead in artificial intelligence Microsoft is likely to cement its lead as the biggest company by market value this year The software giant snagged the top spot on Friday with a valuation of $3 trillion toppling by a small margin Apple (AAPLO) the most valuable company since 2011 Results on Tuesday from Microsoft which has committed to invest more than $10 billion in generative AI posterchild and ChatGPT maker OpenAI will set the tone for expectations from AI this year after investors poured billions of dollars into the technology in 2023 Any boost to companies’ toplines will still be small for the next few months analysts have said Nevertheless Wall Street will watch closely to see if these investments are starting to show returns “Gen AI has emerged as the top priority for (chief information officers) and Microsoft is uniquely well positioned with the majority of CIOs expecting to use a Microsoft AI product in the next 12 months” Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss said in a note dated Jan 11 The Windows-maker over the last three months has widely rolled out its main AI tool – the $30-a-month “Copilot” for its Microsoft 365 service that can draft emails make presentations and collate meeting highlights “We expect AI contribution to Azure growth to increase with our checks pointing to strong demand for Azure AI services” said Jefferies analyst Brent Thill in a research note “It’s worth highlighting that we expect the situation at OpenAI will have a minimal impact if any on Azure’s AI contribution in (the second quarter)” he said Growth in Microsoft’s cloud business is also picking up as customers buy computing power in anticipation of using its AI services This has helped Azure win market share as it competes with Amazoncom’s (AMZNO) AWS and Alphabet’s (GOOGLO) Google Cloud Microsoft forecast 26 per cent to 27 per cent growth for Azure in the second quarter ended Dec 31 Analysts from Visible Alpha expect Azure to grow 277 per cent “It’s too early to be modeling revenue contribution from GenAI before 2025 for any software company not named Microsoft” said RBC Capital Markets analyst Rishi Jaluria Microsoft said in October it expects its December-quarter gross margin for the cloud business to be mostly flat from a year earlier as it spends to expand its AI infrastructure to meet growing demand Second-quarter operating expenses are expected to surge the most in five quarters according to LSEG A recovery in the personal computers market is expected to lift revenue growth in the company’s Windows and devices business to the most in four years For its Windows-based business segment which includes its recent acquisition of gaming firm Activision the company forecast second-quarter sales growth of about 16 per cent to 19 per cent Last week Microsoft said it would let go of 1900 employees at Activision Blizzard and Xbox representing about 8 per cent of the overall Microsoft Gaming division Microsoft’s shares climbed 57 per

Don’t get Pushing Buttons delivered to your inbox? Sign up here Something big is about to happen to Xbox On Monday Phil Spencer the head of Microsoft’s gaming division revealed that the company will share its “vision for the future of Xbox” next week What has brought this about? In January reports started to emerge that Microsoft was considering porting its excellent first-party title Hi-Fi Rush on to other hardware platforms with the Nintendo Switch widely named as the recipient At the time rumours were also swirling that multiplayer pirate adventure Sea of Thieves may be coming to Switch and PS5 On Sunday Verge suggested that Microsoft was considering a multiplatform release for the forthcoming Indiana Jones and the Great Circle (below) with a “short” period of exclusivity on Xbox A day later the story widened News site XboxEra claimed that Microsoft is planning to bring Starfield its biggest Xbox exclusive of 2023 to PlayStation 5 soon after the game’s expansion pack for Xbox and PC According to XboxEra the decision has caused “fierce internal debate” within the Xbox division So what is Spencer about to announce and why? The problem he is contending with is that Xbox has become almost unmanageable as a brand It started as a console the Xbox which sold 24m units but failed to make an impact in the Asian market The Xbox 360 followed in 2005 shifting 85m units but still falling just behind PS3 on 87m Then came the Xbox One which sold a reported 58m units half of PS4 partially due to an ill-advised attempt to market the console as an all-round media platform while Sony stuck with its “PlayStation is a games machine” motto Now Xbox is also a software application that runs on PC phones and some TVs and it’s a streaming platform that consists of both Game Pass for downloads and the Xbox Cloud Gaming service for playing classic games over the internet The company also went through an arduous anti-monopoly investigation to complete a vast $68bn purchase of Activision Blizzard a company whose major series Call of Duty must remain multiplatform Then you have the fact that the Xbox hardware has been consistently outsold by PlayStation machines for more than a decade The latest figures suggest that the PS5 outsold the Xbox Series X by three to one last year bolstered by the huge success of Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 Microsoft stopped reporting console sales in 2015 saying it doesn’t consider those numbers to be a key indicator of the brand’s success due to its other platform manifestations; instead pointing toward Game Pass subscriptions But since January it also hasn’t been reporting those numbers which are believed to stand at around 30-33m worldwide but may well have plateaued Microsoft has effectively backed itself into a corner from which no escape route is totally desirable In many ways the smart thing would be to combine the business models of Sega which abandoned console development after the failure of Dreamcast and became a third-party games publisher and Valve which stopped being a developer and became a digital platform holder with Steam In effect it could abandon the Xbox hardware and concentrate on bringing Microsoft exclusives to other platforms while maintaining the Xbox name for a streaming service accessible via PC phones and smart devices But that would leave a lot of extremely unhappy Xbox fans The worry is that Microsoft will opt for a series of half measures: porting some smaller games to PS5 and Switch but not all; bringing out a new Xbox machine but perhaps only as an elite option; trying to get Game Pass on more platforms while still attempting to ringfence key exclusives To ask a brutal question: has it ever really mastered the console hardware market in the way Sony and Nintendo have? Is it time to let go? But my goodness the backlash from the Xbox fanbase would be vast and that alone may be enough to keep Microsoft’s hand in console manufacturing Whatever the case it’s all a bit of a mess and it symbolises the strange slightly uncomfortable role Xbox has always had in the Microsoft empire When Xbox gets it right it really gets it right The whole Xbox 360 era with its revolutionary online multiplayer infrastructure; the legacy of Halo Gears of War Forza Horizon Sea of Thieves Minecraft Fable; the sheer bargain of Game Pass Xbox has been a necessary third runner in the console race putting money into big ideas and pushing the technical agenda Now we must wait for this announcement regarding Spencer’s “vision for the future” And fans of the console will just have to hope it isn’t blurred beyond recognition Imagine Streets of Rage crossed with the Michael Douglas movie Falling Down and you have Rising Up a pixel-art brawler about an office worker losing it when the printer malfunctions and going on a destructive equipment smashing rampage Created by a tiny team led by Erik H Jørgensen and Laurent Gehin the art style tone and simple kick-punch-jump action perfectly recall the classic scrolling beat-em-ups of the late 1980s and it’s filled with ridiculous comic moments You can play for free on the indie gaming site Itchio Available on: PC/iOSEstimated playtime: One hour I loved this Eurogamer piece about the origins of Die Hard Trilogy and how UK developer Probe set out to make three games in one – and largely succeeded But I also like how the article starts as a profile of Simon Pick developer of 8bit classic Daredevil Dennis You have to read it to see how they’re connected Kotaku has a really interesting article on ageism in the games industry talking to industry veterans about the challenges of staying active in the business when you pass your 30s “The difficulty of the work the low pay drives even young developers away” says legendary designer Warren Spector But to mature as a culture older voices are definitely needed And finally a nice positive piece from Polygon entitled “Palworld is the culmination of every game I’ve ever loved” a review of the unexpected smash hit which combines elements of Pokémon and online shooters and now has around 19 million players Sign up to Pushing Buttons Keza MacDonalds weekly look at the world of gaming after newsletter promotion Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League review – straddles the brilliant and the banal Tekken 8 review – 3D fighter packs more punch than ever ‘It’s rotting young people’s brains’: the murky world of gambling in video games Video games can teach us more about philosophy than books – if only they’d dare Dominik Diamond The man who owes Nintendo $14m: Gary Bowser and gaming’s most infamous piracy case This week’s question comes from Pushing Buttons’ own Keza MacDonald who is on sabbatical but slid into my DMs to ask: “What Xbox game from history would you like everyone to experience?” I will always feel guilty for giving Sea of Thieves a three-star rating but it was fair at the time as I just couldn’t get a stable game and there was a slight lack of content – although when everything worked it was magical Now I think that everyone should play it ; it’s such a joyful rich and hilarious experience and there is so much to do From further back the Ninja Gaiden games were ruthlessly brilliant Gears of War 2 was enthralling and I loved the digital titles such as Trials and Geometry Wars Oh and Forza Horizon 4 And Minecraft Always always Minecraft If you’ve got a question for Question Block – or anything else to say about the newsletter – email us on pushingbuttons@theguardiancom"

most valuable brand with 74% growth in its brand value in just one year Both Apple and Microsoft are slated to report their new set of quarterly earnings in the coming weeks The picture of how each company is performing—and what is becoming more valuable to forward-looking investors—will come into sharper focus then As the year begins it’s also a time to take stock of security threats I talked to Omkhar Arasaratnam general manager of the Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) in the Linux Institute about some of the threats that will present themselves in 2024 as well as how AI might be used to make systems and the code behind them more secure Samsung Galaxy S24 series smartphones at a media preview event in Seoul (Photo by JUNG YEON-JE/AFP via Getty Images) While Apple may now have the title as the world’s top cell phone manufacturer the more-than-decade-long champion Samsung is nipping at Apple’s heels with a new launch that has AI at its core The Galaxy S24 unveiled this week brings AI to consumers by marrying some of the potentially most helpful features for everyday users with a popular smartphone interface The Galaxy AI feature has a new translation function which performs real-time translations of phone calls texting and in-person conversation across 13 languages Users can circle anything that appears on their screen to perform a Google search AI-enabled transcription and note-taking features can help users organize their conversations and thoughts And AI photo editing features can help fill in backgrounds move subjects in the frame and erase items Forbes senior contributor Ewan Spence talked to Samsung UK Vice President and Head of MX James Kitto about the company’s vision for Galaxy AI “We can change the rules” Kitto said “We can leverage Samsung’s scale with over a billion users We can present the worlds first mobile AI use case to [a massive] market” AI capabilities are not just coming to smartphones At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas last week many manufacturers showed off their forthcoming “AI PCs” which are essentially PCs with built in GPU or NPU units to be able to handle the sophisticated processing needed to operate artificial intelligence Forbes senior contributor Barry Collins spoke to several of the manufacturers of these new AI PCs who all said the new processors would add much more power to their machines There weren’t many concrete examples of what they would do but when it comes to upgrading enterprise systems the promise of more power and greater efficiency could be enough to seal a business deal Nvidia headquarters in Santa Clara California (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) In the last couple of years Nvidia has become one of the hottest tech companies in the US Its top-of-the-line GPUs which are commonly seen as some of the best to facilitate the current AI boom has increased the focus and amped up the importance in what it does And that means Nvidia is putting together a new lobbying and policy team Last year Nvidia had only spent $350000 on lobbying next to nothing compared to tech giants Alphabet ($109 million) and Meta ($146 million) and a fraction of rival chip makers AMD ($27 million) and Intel ($5 million) according to OpenSecrets figures Nvidia’s new policy arm reported on by Forbes’ Richard Nieva includes at least four government affairs staffers in Washington DC with experience at agencies including the Treasury Department State Department and Homeland Security As the need for AI regulations becomes a bigger topic for discussion as

launched its Claude 20 chatbot last summer and is known for its work to prevent the “dark side” of AI from taking over also has massive investments from Google and Amazon getty Omkhar Arasaratnam has spent most of his career working in the realm of cybersecurity As the general manager of the Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) which is part of the Linux Foundation he works to combat security threats to open source software which he estimated comprises about 90% of commercial software out there I talked to him about the threats—and solutions—in front of us in 2024 This conversation has been edited for length and clarity Where are the biggest cybersecurity threats coming from now? Arasaratnam: If we’re to fast forward December 31 2024 and we’ve got the balance beam out what you’re going to see is the majority of breaches are going to be these rather pedestrian well-known security exploits Maybe there will be a little bit of sizzle in terms of some really novel attacks …If we go back to something like the MOVEit security vulnerability it was spring of last year that we first started seeing that exploit That was a SQL injection SQL injection was first discussed as a novel security issue more than 25 years ago If I recall it was Christmas Day of 1998 There was a post to a security mailing list saying ‘Hey this kind of thing could be a problem’ What I come back around to is absolutely as technology evolves there’s going to be all these other interesting areas that we need to protect that maybe weren’t as much of a concern before But I think where the majority of issues are going to continue to occur in 2024 is going to be in the basics: authentication good patch management practices And the incidence will occur as a result of those protections not being in place Does AI play a role in cybersecurity? Arasaratnam: One of the ways that we believe artificial intelligence and large language models can help us is by leveraging them to help secure open source software August of last year we launched a challenge with DARPA—the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency who brought us such things as the internet who are apt to facilitate these kinds of moonshot challenges—to challenge the community and say ‘Hey we think this new technology could be used to secure and eliminate entire classes of problems in open source software’ That SQL injection that keeps cropping up for the last 25 years If we could figure out how to use large language models to eliminate those classes of vulnerability from the open source code base that would be really cool How do you think this would be done? Arasaratnam: We rely on three big buckets The most basic…is called a linter It’s called a linter because much like a lint brush would pick up lint on clothing it just gets rid of the basic crusty stuff Think of that as almost an automated editor that goes through and makes sure that everything conforms to the right style Much like writing prose when you write code everyone’s got a different style It makes sure that all the stylistic things like putting an enter before an open bracket is conformed to in a way that’s consistent Over and above that we have static analysis Static analysis is a little more sophisticated When your code is being compiled it’ll go in and say ‘Ah you know what? That looks like a potential security exploit’ and give you a warning So you the developer can correct the code Beyond that there are some things that can only be determined at runtime Not when the code is being compiled but when it’s executing on a computer That’s called dynamic testing There’s a number of different methods of doing dynamic testing including things called fuzzers which are used to just send random input and see how the program will react My prediction [and] DARPA’s prediction is that there’s going to be an even more sophisticated set of analysis that large language models will be able to perform Whether it be static analysis or dynamic analysis computers themselves are kind of constrained to understand what good looks like Our belief is that with similar benefit to what we’ve seen from Gemini or ChatGPT our assumption is leveraging these large language models there’s even more novel approaches to understand the code and how the code will run One of the most vexing challenges that we get into in software engineering to pick a very specific problem is a kind of error condition called a race condition In a race condition you basically have all of these multiple kinds of events that could be occurring at the same time but to observe that effect everything has to line up just right Maybe it could be a scenario like that that large language models are able to quickly identify that some of our traditional security error checking may not be able to You’ve talked about good things that AI could do for cybersecurity Are there any risks? Arasaratnam: The way that LLMs can be used to more effectively run social engineering campaigns whether that be trickery of an AI-generated video Whether it be an AI-generated voice that sounds like your child or your mother or another loved one calling you up and expressing a ransom has to be paid in gift cards Whether that be LLMs crafting the proverbial scam emails en masse but with much better accuracy and better command of the English language I think we’re already seeing a lot of these right now and I think that’ll continue to occur I think the same analysis that I just mentioned in terms of LLMs being able to perform this analysis of open source software with the intent of correcting it can also use LLMs to find holes in open source software that haven’t yet been identified Or to pore over vast quantities of data that hasn’t yet been analyzed to understand ways of exploiting that data or being able to glean trend analysis things like that Criminals are no longer the proverbial smash-and-grab punks It’s not people that are taking a crime of opportunity on the internet They operate like businesses We’ve seen evidence that they operate 9 to 5 in their local time zone and have management hierarchies …Bad people may try to exploit the LLMs themselves so they can engineer the large language model to produce a bad result If it’s an LLM that’s focused on secure code generate to manipulate it in such a way that it generates insecure code whether it is by manipulating the training data manipulating how the LLM runs at runtime It’s what we call a watering hole attack If you can make a central place that is accountable for producing an artifact to a large quantity of people if you can manipulate that to be an outcome that’s insecure and one that you can exploit I suspect that people are going to start looking to do that as well What kinds of outcomes are you hoping to see in the DARPA Challenge? Arasaratnam: One of the challenges that we’ve seen in software engineering especially for those of us who’ve been around a couple of decades like myself is some of the languages that we historically use for a lot of low-level programming …like C and C++ are particularly fragile when it comes to what we would call now memory safety There was a study by CISA [Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency] in DHS that said [almost] 70% of recent security exploits … had been memory safety failures Were they everything? No Were they a disproportionate amount? Absolutely Because of that especially when it comes to low-level programming there’s been a lot of popularity and interest around languages like Rust Rust has this opportunity to be able to perform: very high performance very low-level environments that were previously the domain of C and C++ but to do so in a memory-safe manner How does this apply to AI and LLMs? As much as software engineers would like not to admit it every time a human touches code there’s the potential for a bug to be introduced It would be incredible if large language models could come in and rewrite legacy C code as Rust or at least do so for what I’d say are security sensitive code paths where you’re taking input from a user where you’re handling cryptographic keys where you’re handling authorization And in doing so you balance the potential that even an LLM could make a translation mistake with benefit of recoding and a memory-safe language How can you utilize AI and keep your system secure? Arasaratnam: When it comes to AI in particular the learnings that I would take from previous technologies is to really be considerate about making it a risk-based approach There are tons of ways that AI LLMs and all the new artificial intelligence technologies can benefit your business Whether that is being able to understand sentiment from text or to be able to better handle your call center or to be able to do image analysis It can benefit your business’s bottom line and that’s really why we invest in these technologies—not just for the sake of technology But for each of these business advantages there’s also a business risk …You should be making those decisions eyes wide open If you are going to use an LLM to secure your codebase against security vulnerabilities you should have some confidence in the LLM’s ability to do that If there isn’t maybe keep a human in the mix to make sure that something inappropriate hasn’t been added I do think that there’s going to be some novelty in terms of the exploits we see I think that the controls that we have at our disposal don’t necessarily have to be novel They need to be common sense They need to be risk-based Sheryl Sandberg former chief operating officer of Meta announced yesterday she will leave the company’s board of directors when her term ends in May 12 years: Length of time she served on Meta’s board $19 billion: Forbes estimate of Sandberg’s net worth It ‘feels like the right time to step away’: Sandberg’s Facebook post announcing her decision Forbes Chinese search engine giant Baidu saw its Nasdaq shares drop more than 12% this week Why?

analyst recommendations in-depth research investing resources and more Learn More Microsoft (MSFT -015%) stock has turned many shareholders into millionaires over the past few decades After all the software giants climb toward $3 trillion of market capitalization has been fantastic punctuated recently by its overtaking Apple as the worlds most valuable business It pays well to be along for that kind of ride even if you were relatively late to the growth party The software giants business looks much different today than it did 25 years ago and tech trends will surely change many more times over the next several decades Yet the big question for investors going forward is whether the stock can still produce market-beating returns given Microsofts lofty valuation perch today Lets look at the factors that could make this stock a positive force in the long run for your retirement portfolio While investors cant know which tech trends will dominate the industry in several years they can feel reasonably confident that Microsoft will continue to be a leading player as those trends emerge It already has excellent exposure to many growth niches including cloud enterprise services video games cybersecurity and artificial intelligence That diversity also boosts its value to large customers who are increasingly looking for a comprehensive software solutions provider Sure you might see much faster growth by owning a specialist like cybersecurity expert Palo Alto Networks that is at an earlier chapter in its growth story This maker of powerful firewalls and cloud security products is targeting many years of above-average sales gains ahead as more businesses look to protect their digital assets and workflows Yet Microsoft already has a valuable relationship with most of the worlds largest enterprises Its not a stretch to believe the software titan can build on that formidable market share position in the coming years and decades Microsofts financial strength is another huge factor in its favor The company is sitting on over $140 billion of cash as of late September It generated $30 billion of operating cash flow in just the last quarter too as operating profit jumped a healthy 26% higher year-over-year MSFT Cash from Operations (TTM) data by YCharts TTM = trailing 12 months A lot of value is conferred by those ample financial resources All that cash means Microsoft can more easily survive a market downturn than its smaller peers It can invest aggressively in tech innovations as it has been doing with AI lately And if it misses any emerging opportunity it can use cash to fund acquisitions or partnerships that keep it in the leadership position in the next computing era Most tech companies dont have anything approaching that level of flexibility As you might expect Microsofts stock is priced at a premium that reflects most of the key advantages detailed above An investor must pay over 13 times annual sales for its shares which isnt far from the pandemic high that investors saw back in early 2022 In comparison you could own Amazon for a relative steal of about 3 times revenue although the e-commerce giants profit margins arent nearly as lucrative as Microsofts Microsofts high valuation and market capitalization mean investors returns from here will necessarily be constrained Yet the stock could still play a positive role in a retirement portfolio that aims to crack the $1 million mark Microsoft investors can expect the company to lead the tech shifts ahead while capitalizing on its entrenched position in the massive global software industry In other words the tech giant has a good shot at producing more millionaire shareholders in the coming decades John Mackey former CEO of Whole Foods Market an Amazon subsidiary is a member of The Motley

Generative AI was first made popular through the launch of OpenAIs Chat GPT When this platform took the world by storm in late 2022 it amazed people with what it could do but it wasnt refined enough to be useful for typical productivity tasks With the integration of generative AI in tools like Copilot weve finally reached the stage where this technology can increase productivity With Copilot it can search an inbox full of emails to summarize a topic take notes in a meeting create incredible PowerPoint presentations and provide the formulas you need for your worksheet But Microsoft isnt going to give this add-on away for free Copilot for Microsoft 365 costs an additional $30 per month for business licenses On the consumer side Copilot Pro is available for $20 per month giving its users even more tools than the base Copilot product Copilot Pro gives users access to OpenAIs latest generative AI model: GPT-4 It also boasts a better image creation tool (DALL·E 3) than the standard Copilot If businesses want this additional functionality it will also cost them an extra $20 per month bringing the total to $50 for Copilot Pro With Microsofts global customer base these figures can easily transform into a massive revenue stream But what can investors reasonably expect? As of 2022 about 345 million people were using Microsoft 365 While Microsoft hasnt updated that figure in a while its safe to assume its probably growing a fair amount (in its first-quarter fiscal-year 2024 earnings report Microsoft stated its paid 365 seats rose 10%) So Ill assume paid seats are currently around 380 million If 10% of these users adopt Copilot on the business side and 5% use Copilot Pro on the consumer side that would provide $1368 billion and $456 billion annually respectively For reference Microsofts trailing-12-month revenue is $218 billion so this would provide an 8% revenue boost Thats not growth that can be ignored even if the adoption figures are lower than that Furthermore this would be a massive profit boost as Microsoft has already spent significant money on engineers to build the product and data centers to crunch the workloads But does this overcome Microsofts already expensive price tag?

The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises as it hasnt missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters In its last earnings report on October 24 2023 Microsoft reported EPS of $299 versus consensus estimate of $265 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 39% For the current fiscal year Microsoft is expected to post earnings of $1114 per share on $24241 billion in revenues This represents a 1356% change in EPS on a 1439% change in revenues For the next fiscal year the company is expected to earn $1270 per share on $27528 billion in revenues This represents a year-over-year change of 1402% and 1356% respectively Valuation Metrics Microsoft may be at a 52-week high right now but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself On this front we can look at the Zacks Style Scores as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security) These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value Growth and Momentum while there is a combined VGM Score as well Investors should consider the style scores a valuable tool that can help you to pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style Microsoft has a Value Score of D The stocks Growth and Momentum Scores are A and B respectively giving the company a VGM Score of B In terms of its value breakdown the stock currently trades at 358X current fiscal year EPS estimates which is a premium to the peer industry average of 336X On a trailing cash flow basis the stock currently trades at 34X versus its peer groups average of 276X Additionally the stock has a PEG ratio of 231 This isnt enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective Zacks Rank We also need to consider the stocks Zacks Rank as this supersedes any trend on the style score front Fortunately Microsoft currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B it looks as if Microsoft fits the bill Thus it seems as though Microsoft shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) - free report >> Our experts picked 7 Zacks Rank #1 Strong Buy stocks with the best chance to skyrocket within the next 30-90 days Recent stocks from this report have soared up to +675% within 30 days See our reports 7 new picks today - its really free!

971,"Governing AI in Africa: Policy frameworks for a new frontier - Microsoft On the Issues","1/28/2024","https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2024/01/28/governing-ai-in-africa-policy-framework/","Jan 28 2024 Lillian Barnard - President Microsoft Africa Embracing the transformative power of artificial intelligence (AI) is central to our vision for Africa’s future AI will revolutionize the way we do business across the African continent This revolution transcends mere technological advancement; it marks a strategic turning point wherein AI will be leveraged as a catalyst for sustainable growth and chart a course towards a future brimming with innovation and boundless opportunity for Africa Indeed it is forecasted that AI could have a significant impact on Africa’s economic prospects A recent report suggests that the technology could increase Africa’s economy by a remarkable $15 trillion – a figure that equals half of the continent’s current gross domestic product (GDP) – if African businesses could capture 10% of the global and rapidly expanding AI market This isn’t just a figure; it represents the possibility for AI to make a genuine difference On a continent that already has the youngest population in the world and will soon be home to one in five of the world’s consumers the ability to leverage such a powerful tool to help businesses understand and better cater to the unique needs of Africa’s burgeoning consumer base through data analytics could be game changing It could also empower a young workforce with AI-driven educational tools enhancing their skills and future employability From agriculture to health care AI is expected to enable faster and more profound progress in nearly every field of human endeavor and help address some of society’s most daunting challenges The potential for widespread transformation in Africa is only just beginning to be realized In health care for example AI is expected to improve clinical experiences and support better health care delivery Already in Rwanda and Ghana AI-powered diagnostic solutions are being deployed to improve medical imaging analysis These tools assist in the early detection of diseases such as breast cancer and tuberculosis Companies like Zipline are using AI to optimize drone delivery routes for medical supplies and vaccines significantly enhancing access to essential medications in remote areas The impact of these AI applications in the health care sector has been predicted to be profound having the potential to lead to earlier diagnosis and treatment improved patient outcomes and an overall strengthening of health care systems In the agricultural sector AI is emerging as a supportive tool that can aid in managing resources more efficiently For instance by providing data-driven recommendations for fertilizer application AI has the potential to help farmers reduce unnecessary expenditure and increase profitability thereby enhancing their economic resilience In countries like Nigeria and Kenya startups such as UjuziKilimo and Farmcrowdy are using AI to analyze soil and weather data to provide farmers with personalized advice on crop cultivation and optimized usage enabling them to make evidence-driven decisions and improving crop yields Ultimately this has led to increased productivity and enhanced food security directly benefiting smallholder farmers and the broader community Education finance urban development and city planning are other key areas where AI can offer innovative solutions customized to Africa’s specific needs In South Africa where the past 10 years have been characterized by substantial investment in AI technology local government municipalities such as the eThekwini Municipality in KwaZulu-Natal have leveraged AI to become a data-driven smart city and provide pragmatic and innovative water and sanitation services to its growing population which other municipalities have started to emulate Already we have witnessed AI play a crucial role in fostering financial inclusion In East Africa particularly in Kenya and Tanzania mobile banking platforms like M-Pesa are leveraging AI to offer credit scoring and microloan services AI algorithms analyze transaction data to assess creditworthiness enabling a broader range of individuals and small businesses to access financial services This AI-driven approach to finance has revolutionized banking in the region providing financial services to the unbanked and underbanked populations and fostering economic growth and stability As an early adopter of AI the financial services industry in South Africa is exploring various applications for the technology For instance Investec in South Africa has created ZebraGPT a tool designed to streamline repetitive tasks explore new ways of working and boost overall productivity To date the company has identified around 64 use cases for generative AI in the wealth and investment space alone At Microsoft we are witnessing the AI revolution firsthand through our collaborative efforts across the continent In Egypt Microsoft is working with government business and startups to implement AI solutions to reimagine government services expand business and instill innovation in the society In Kenya Microsoft is working with leading partners in food and water security and wildlife conservation to help address climate and sustainability challenges In Morocco AI is being used to improve water conservation efforts a critical resource for the country’s agriculture and human consumption needs In South Africa where AI utilization is already advanced Microsoft’s partnership with key players in the public and private sectors are reshaping public service delivery and addressing multifaceted business and societal challenges particularly in the areas of health care system optimization and innovative urban infrastructure management However amid this wave of excitement and potential Africa is faced with a critical mandate: As we navigate this AI-powered future our journey must be underpinned by responsible and sustainable innovation ensuring that our progress remains aligned with the human values societal norms and the needs that define Africa’s vastly diverse cultures This involves a deep engagement with the continent’s unique challenges recognizing their complexity and prioritizing those that AI could help solve Collaborating with relevant stakeholders will be key to ensuring that AI solutions are not just technologically advanced but also culturally attuned and genuinely beneficial to African societies A thoughtful approach to regulation is also key to ensuring that our exploration of AI’s vast potential is conducted with responsibility and ethical foresight taking Africa’s unique socioeconomic and cultural context into account Legislation should consider issues such as protecting data privacy ethical AI use and minimizing bias with the utmost care while simultaneously nurturing the opportunity this revolutionary technology presents Given the varied stages of AI adoption and regulations across the continent’s 54 countries a cooperative and thoughtful approach is needed to standardize data and address these challenges effectively As AI usage expands more African countries are expected to introduce regulations to guide its development and deployment responsibly A crucial step towards countries effectively developing deploying and managing AI technologies and paving the way for technological advancement and economic growth relies on the adoption of cloud-first policies that can provide the scalable cost-effective infrastructure essential for handling AI’s computational demands and large data sets Cloud computing democratizes access to advanced AI technologies while fostering an environment of innovation and collaboration With a view to providing more organizations with the capacity to drive progress Microsoft has invested in datacenters on the continent in Cape Town and Johannesburg as well as in five edge sites and subsea cables and gateway colocation deployments We are not just a technology provider but a partner on this journey dedicated to accelerating the continent’s trajectory towards an AI-enabled future Already as part of our strategy to enable AI to truly benefit all people Microsoft has embedded large foundational AI models in our services including Bing Office 365 Dynamics 365 Power Platform GitHub and LinkedIn In addition to making AI available within the products people are familiar with Microsoft has developed a range of AI Copilots to help users in specific areas These virtual assistants will augment the work that people do by freeing up time for more creativity imagination and human ingenuity It’s these savings that can lead to significant innovation leaps and give people more time to solve pressing challenges at work or even in their community However as we recognize the immense potential of AI in Africa and celebrate our continued partnership with various governments and organizations in their digital transformation journeys we are also keenly aware of the potential challenges and complexities that lie ahead With responsible regulation and collaborative effort AI can be a force for good – enriching lives empowering communities and steering the continent towards a future filled with limitless possibilities Our vision extends beyond economic growth and technological advancements; we aim for a sustainable inclusive future where everyone can benefit from the digital revolution To this end our commitment to leverage AI for societal benefit extends beyond technology development to include capacity building and education Over the past five years Microsoft has helped upskill over four million young people across Africa through a variety of skilling and employability programs Recognizing the need to nurture the next generation of African innovators we are investing in training and resources to develop digital skills and AI literacy This effort is encapsulated in our recent AI Skills Initiative which offers new and free courses for workers to learn about how to harness the power of AI and drive Africa’s growth in the digital age In parallel with our educational initiatives Microsoft’s multidisciplinary teams comprising researchers engineers and policy experts are committed to collaborative partnerships with governments and policy stakeholders Our goal is to jointly identify and tailor policy interventions for cloud and AI technologies ensuring they align with the specific needs and policy landscapes of African countries This collaborative approach helps us integrate local insights into our technological initiatives fostering solutions that are both effective and contextually relevant While we don’t have all the answers to the questions that this new AI era brings with it Microsoft’s commitment to Africa is unwavering We are dedicated to being a responsible steward of AI technology ensuring that it is developed and used in ways that benefit all Africans and we look forward to continuing to engage with policymakers business leaders grassroot movements and community stakeholders across the continent to help shape a future where AI is a tool for empowerment innovation and positive change The AI revolution in Africa is not just a possibility; it is already underway With responsible regulation partnerships and a steadfast commitment to responsible and ethical AI we are poised to unlock a future with unprecedented opportunities We look forward to walking this journey with you and leveraging AI to create a continent that is more connected empowered and forward-looking than ever before Read the whole blueprint at https://akams/AfricaAI Tags: Africa agriculture AI artificial intelligence city planning economy education finance

Liberation From Leprosy And Other Infectious Diseases In a bid to debunk widespread myths and misconceptions about Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its applications and how it would take over jobs Microsoft Corporation has provided insights into how it approaches AI development and ethics Speaking during a virtual session of Microsoft Africa AI Journalists Academy organised by the leading global vendor of computer software Ayanda Ngcebetsha Director Data and AI Microsoft South Africa and Trusha Vanmali Business Program Manager Microsoft South Africa who spoke at the AI Journalist Academy organised by Microsoft stressed that AI would only improve productivity rather than take over jobs “The importance of AI tools in summarising reports carrying out accurate research imputing language translation and coordinating several meetings in one day while making the best use of the available time cannot be underestimated” they explained The duo noted that although 2023 was the year AI went mainstream 2024 would be the year in which AI tools would help free up time for more creative and fulfilling cognitive work Ngcebetsha said that AI was around us yet invisible and working aside from us to enhance creativity rather than working against creativity He said copilot which is an AI tool could help content developers in writing coding summarising and searching for specific information like charts and tables that would help them develop good reports in less time According to her copilot is like a personal assistant that works alongside the user in all sorts of digital applications helping with things like writing coding summarising and searching It can also help the user to make decisions and understand lots of data The recent development of large language models made copilots possible allowing them to comprehend natural human language and provide answers create content or take action as people work within different computer programs According to him Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) are more interested in using AI to increase productivity than to cut headcount The Microsoft director said that from the data available to the corporation reducing headcount was last on the list of what leaders would value from AI “After ‘increasing productivity’ leaders’ top hopes for AI are to help employees with necessary but repetitive tasks and increase employee wellbeing “They also want to eliminate employee time spent on low-value activities enhance employees’ capabilities and accelerate employees’ pace of work” he said According to him “If we make AI our friend we will be more productive in what we do and what we know how to do best AI was about working alongside humans as an everyday companion” He said that AI could help lift the burden on humans adding that to date AI had mostly been on autopilot but the next-generation copilots would work alongside people “Organisations that embrace AI will unleash creativity and unlock productivity for everyone ushering in a new wave of productivity growth and value creation” he added Also speaking at the virtual session Business Programme Manager Trusha Vanmali highlighted the benefits of AI as a copilot especially to journalists Vanmali said that AI as a copilot had a conversational assistant tool that enhanced creativity and helped with more specific results in search engines She said that as journalists AI helped to improve productivity enhance creativity and provide the workflow that was needed The Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Microsoft Satya Nadella described AI and more specifically generative AI as leading the technology charge He said that 2023 was the year AI went mainstream but 2024 was the year in which AI tools would help free up time for more creative and fulfilling cognitive work Speaking recently at Microsoft Ignite 2023 Nadella noted: “We’re about to enter this fascinating new era of AI where it’s no longer just a novel and fascinating technology AI

Of course it’d be nice to have gotten MSFT stock at a lower multiple (let’s say closer to 25-30 times price-to-earnings) However I’d argue 372 times trailing price to earnings isn’t all too absurd given its earnings growth prospects Up next we have railway giant CP Rail (TSX:CP) which could be nearing a breakout with shares now going for $112 and change Indeed the railroad stock could really benefit as the North American economy gets running back to full speed I have no idea when it will happen but it’s less of a concern if you’re going to be in the name for at least five years The stock goes for 266 times trailing price to earnings with a 068% yield It’s not a low price to pay for a stock that’s not exactly bountiful on the dividend front Regardless I like the firm as a (dividend) growth play for the next 10 years and beyond The rail network looks virtually unmatched following the Kansas City Southern deal — an asset that could pay major dividends for decades to come!

resources and more Learn More When a company starts paying a dividend to its shareholders it is often seen as a signal of confidence that the company is at a stage where it can produce stable and growing earnings and cash flow But when a tech growth company like Microsoft (MSFT -015%) starts paying a dividend its often seen as a sign that the high-growth days are over Thats a signal for some that its time to invest elsewhere In reality a dividend is mostly just a signal that management may not see as many investment opportunities so instead of wasting the money or letting it sit in its coffers they return funds to shareholders That should be a signal for investors to get into the stock When talking about tech companies particularly software companies this is the point where their high operating leverage generates more and more revenue every year without a significant increase in operating expenses So when a tech company starts paying a dividend its more often a signal that its reached escape velocity so to speak and that leverage will start producing a lot more free cash flow and earnings well into the future Thats been quite evident in the returns Microsoft has produced since it first declared a dividend in 2003 Image source: Getty Images Microsoft declared its first dividend for shareholders on Jan 16 2003 alongside its second-quarter earnings report for that year The dividend paid annually was $016 per share or just $008 per share after the stock split in February of that year A lot has changed at Microsoft since then In 2003 Microsoft was generating the bulk of its revenue from sales of the Windows operating system and Office suite The two combined to account for about 60% of sales in the first six months of fiscal 2003 Its server platform business was focused on providing software tailored toward different enterprise applications It also had a burgeoning home and entertainment segment bolstered by Xbox Total revenue in the first six months of fiscal 2003 was $163 billion which resulted in a profit of $53 billion and $89 billion in cash from operations Microsoft looks a lot different today Microsofts biggest segment these days contains that server platform business It also added Github a code repository for software developers However the biggest driver of the segment is its Azure cloud computing platform The product didnt even exist in 2003 but its become the driving force behind Microsofts business over the past decade The segment accounted for over 40% of revenue through the first half of the year and its the fastest-growing reporting segment at the company Meanwhile Microsoft has seen shifts in its Office business which is now largely a software-as-a-service subscription business Windows is lumped in with its devices and gaming segment which recently added Activision Blizzard to the mix In the first six months of fiscal 2024 (July to December 2023) Microsoft generated almost $119 billion resulting in $44 billion in net income and $49 billion in cash from operations Thats a sevenfold increase in sales and an eight-fold increase in net income since 2003 If you bought shares of Microsoft the day after it announced its dividend (since it was announced after the bell) the most youd pay would be $53 per share Lets say you bought 19 shares for $1000 After the stock split in February 2003 youd have 38 shares Those 38 shares are now worth about $15700 But thats just the half of it Microsoft also paid you a dividend every year Total dividends received from those 38 shares would amount to $1067 in that time Thats right youd have received more in dividends than your original investment But if youd chosen to reinvest those dividends instead youd have seen your total investment climb to about $24800 Thats over $8000 more than if you took your dividends in cash Microsofts total return over the last 21 years blew away the S&P 500 $1000 invested an S&P 500 index fund wouldve turned into a respectable $8300 but thats just one-third of what youd have today by investing in Microsoft MSFT Total Return Level data by YCharts Microsoft continues to show strong momentum producing tons of profit and cash flow for shareholders Its consistently raised its dividend most years now paying $3 per share annually The outlook remains strong as its investment in OpenAI put it in a leading position in drawing AI developers to its Azure platform Its one reason shares remain attractive even as they trade around their all-time high But theres a broader lesson for investors in Microsofts story Investing in a tech company when it declares a dividend can be a great idea as the company begins leveraging fixed costs and growing earnings Whats more its not an admission that it has no better way to invest cash to grow the company -- see the growth of Azure the transformation of Office and the acquisitions of LinkedIn GitHub and Activision Blizzard That should point investors to take a closer look at Meta

Applications This item in japanese Feb 12 2024 4 min read by Bruno Couriol Microsoft recently announced the low-code tool Microsoft Copilot Studio at Ignite 2023 Copilot Studio users can both build standalone copilots and customize Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365 — thus using AI-driven conversational capabilities for ad-hoc enterprise use cases Copilot Studio is an end-to-end conversational AI platform that empowers IT professionals and makers to create and customize copilots using natural language or a graphical interface Copilot Studio users can design test and publish copilots that can later be leveraged within a Microsoft 365 context or for custom enterprise purposes Standalone copilots are applications that address users’ natural language queries through a conversational interface Besides handling the dialog with the user copilots may need to retrieve information from authorized databases or execute actions on behalf of the user on external systems Copilot Studio uses the same authoring canvas as Microsoft Power Virtual Agent which it supersedes Makers implement conversational dialogs as a tree of nodes each node representing an action (eg displaying information to the user prompting the user with a question calling an API running a Power Automate flow) Part (or all) of a dialog tree can be constituted into topics Oftentimes a topic has a set of trigger phrases— phrases keywords and questions that end users are likely to use to express needs handled by the topic The Copilot Studio AI analyzes an end user’s natural language input and assign a confidence score to each configured topic The topic confidence score reflects how close the user input is to the topic’s trigger phrases In case of several topics with a confidence score above a confidence threshold (eg 85%) the end user may be asked to select the topic that applies (disambiguation mechanism) If only one topic clears the confidence threshold the dialog for that topic is executed immediately Microsoft Copilot Studio can also delegate the natural language understanding to Azure AI Language Studio’s suite of tools Makers can use the generative capabilities of large language models inside topic dialogs Gary Pretty principal product manager at Microsoft demonstrated how a prospective customer of Holland America Line could query a standalone bot for information on a cruise (eg “Do I need a passport for my cruise?”) A maker would create that bot with just a few clicks simply by referencing wwwhollandamericacom as a key source of information The bot would pass the end user input on to a generative model that would use the referenced content to answer the query (eg “Yes you will need a passport for your cruise […]”) The conversation continues with the bot keeping track of the context and conversation history so the user can implicitly or explicitly reference past information This use case corresponds to what has been seen extensively with generative models like ChatGPT However this time the bot answer is grounded in the referenced content Such grounding may help reduce erroneous answers from the bot Copilots can also provide a natural language interface to an application programming interface for example pretty detailed tasks such as the “Get Excursions” topics in which the bots asks a user whether he has an existing booking The user subsequently provides a booking number After that the bot calls the relevant API (through Power Automate) and displays its results Goal-oriented applications may however require an amount of domain-specific handcrafting that correlates with the goal complexity (eg number of steps conditions and branches management of errors and edge cases) David Conger principal product manager at Microsoft provided at Ignite 2023 an example of complex orchestration of APIs to achieve users’ goals Microsoft 365 Copilot can create Power Point presentations from a text document and subsequently modify that document on command Conger explained that to ensure the correct identification of steps to go through the safe execution of identified actions and to recover from errors Microsoft resorted to a domain-specific language for Office (ODSL) that would be LLM-friendly Microsoft 365 Copilot dynamically constructs a prompt within the token limit with relevant information to help the LLMs produce the correct ODSL program The ODSL program is then parsed validated — with automatic code correction and transpiled to native Office APIs which are then executed Arguably many enterprise use cases will be far simpler and fit a no-code approach Generative AI coupled with no-code authoring tools make for attractive demos for the simplest use cases However technology buyers may want to relate the licensing configuration and no-code development costs attached to the technology with concrete and valuable use cases for their specific entreprise Copilots can be distributed through miscellaneous channels including Microsoft Teams a website or even Skype Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365 can additionally leverage copilots created with Copilot Studio Makers can also use multilingual copilots which can communicate with customers in different languages while keeping all the content in a single copilot In many cases such copilots can automatically detect the desired language based on the user’s web browser setting and respond in the same language Capabilities of Microsoft Power Virtual Agents (also known as Power VA) are fully included in Microsoft Copilot Studio Copilot Studio integrates with Microsoft Azure

996,"Will Nvidia Surpass Microsoft in Market Value by 2025?","2/24/2024","https://pc-tablet.com/will-nvidia-surpass-microsoft-in-market-value-by-2025/","As we look toward the horizon of 2025 speculation abounds regarding the potential shifts in market capitalization among the titans of the tech industry With Nvidia’s remarkable ascent in recent years fueled by its groundbreaking advancements in graphics processing units (GPUs) and artificial intelligence (AI) the question arises: could Nvidia outpace Microsoft a longstanding leader in software and cloud computing in market value by 2025? To dissect this question we delve into the current financial standings and growth trajectories of both corporations Key Highlights: Market Dynamics and Growth Prospects Nvidia’s Ascendancy: Nvidia’s foray into AI deep learning and autonomous driving technologies has positioned it as a pivotal player in the tech industry Its GPUs are not only the backbone of gaming and professional visualization but also play a crucial role in data centers powering complex computations for AI research and applications This diversification has propelled Nvidia’s growth making it one of the fastest-growing tech companies Microsoft’s Stalwart Position: Microsoft’s market cap of $3049 trillion as of February 2024 underscores its enduring strength in the tech landscape​​ With its expansive suite of software products including the ubiquitous Windows operating system and Office productivity suite combined with its leading cloud platform Azure Microsoft has cemented its role as a cornerstone of both consumer and enterprise computing The company’s strategic investments in AI gaming (with Xbox) and professional networking (through LinkedIn) further diversify its revenue streams and growth potential Analyzing the Competitive Landscape To determine whether Nvidia could eclipse Microsoft in market value by 2025 one must consider several factors including innovation trajectories market demand for their respective products and services and broader economic conditions that influence tech investments Nvidia’s groundbreaking work in AI and the increasing reliance on cloud computing and data centers may offer significant growth opportunities However Microsoft’s entrenched position in software its expansive cloud infrastructure and diversified business model provide a robust foundation for sustained growth Future Outlook and Strategic Considerations While predicting the exact market cap of companies in the dynamic tech sector is challenging the trajectory suggests intense competition and innovation from both Nvidia and Microsoft Nvidia’s pioneering efforts in AI and expansion into new tech frontiers present a compelling case for its upward trajectory Conversely Microsoft’s diversification and deep integration into the fabric of global computing infrastructure make it a formidable contender for maintaining or even expanding its market lead In the race towards 2025 while Nvidia exhibits strong potential for growth surpassing a behemoth like Microsoft in market value is an ambitious target Microsoft’s diversified portfolio substantial revenue streams and strategic positioning across multiple tech sectors offer a significant advantage However in the rapidly evolving tech landscape fueled by breakthroughs in AI and computing Nvidia’s specialized focus and innovative edge could narrow the gap making the next few years critical in shaping the future market dynamics Jamie Davidson is the Marketing Communications Manager for Vast Conference a meeting solution providing HD-audio video conferencing with screen sharing and a mobile app to easily and reliably get work done"

998,"Why Is Nvidia Stock So High and Can NVDA Become the Biggest US Company?","2/26/2024","https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/stocks/MSFT/pressreleases/24354072/why-is-nvidia-stock-so-high-and-can-nvda-become-the-biggest-us-company/","After its well-received earnings report last week Nvidia (NVDA) joined the ranks of $2 trillion companies albeit briefly Nvidia stock soared above $800 which makes it the most expensive “Magnificent 7” stock in absolute terms The breathless rally in Nvidia stock has now given it a realistic chance of becoming the biggest US company Currently only Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL) have a market cap larger than Nvidias now that the semiconductor designer has surpassed both Amazon (AMZN) and Alphabet (GOOG) in size Why is Nvidia stock so high and could it soon become the biggest US company? The key reason Nvidia stock is trading so high in absolute terms is because of the artificial intelligence (AI)-fueled price action over the last year The stock has risen 61% this year adding to its 240% rise in 2023 The shares have risen 481% over the last three years which means NVDA is now above the levels where it was trading in 2021 when it split four-for-one Nvidia has seen a major rerating since the beginning of 2023 thanks to its position as the preeminent supplier of AI chips While a section of the market might be perplexed by the rise in Nvidia stock its share price performance has been backed by solid financials Nvidia forecast revenues of $24 billion at the midpoint for its fiscal Q1 2025 and Wall Street analysts expect its revenues to surpass $100 billion in this fiscal year and $130 billion in the next To put that in perspective the Jensen Huang-led company posted revenues of just under $11 billion in fiscal 2020 The company’s revenues have risen six-fold over the last four years while the commensurate rise in profits has been even higher In a market where most other credible growth stories – including Tesla (TSLA) – look tarnished in the short term Nvidia brings to the table prospects of strong double-digit revenue growth with a long track record of execution Those looking for Nvidia stock to go down meaningfully must have been disappointed as the stock has continued to make newer highs almost every other day Notably despite having risen significantly from its 2022 lows Nvidia’s valuation still looks far from stretched based on some metrics NVDA currently trades at a next 12-months (NTM) price-to-earnings multiple of 321x and among its “Magnificent 7” peers only Meta Platforms (META) and Apple trade at a lower multiple Wall Street analysts also expect Nvidia’s rally to continue and it has a consensus rating of “Strong Buy” from analysts According to Reuters at least 17 brokerages raised Nvidia’s target price after the company reported its fiscal Q1 earnings last week UBS however was a notable exception as the brokerage cut Nvidia’s target price from $850 to $800 on “some potential slowing in revenue growth Nvidia’s new Street-high target price of $1400 (via Rosenblatt Securities) implies its market cap rising to $35 trillion which is higher than the current market cap of Microsoft – the reigning largest US company While you might have been ridiculed just a few years back for talking about the possibility of Nvidia becoming the world’s biggest company it looks like a real possibility now A cursory look at how the biggest US companies have evolved would tell us that winners have changed over the years in line with their financial performance as well as shifting market sentiments For instance at the beginning of 2000 Microsoft was the biggest US company - but soon lost that position to General Electric (GE) Between 2005 and 2011 oil major ExxonMobil (XOM) was the biggest US company for the most part Apple became the world’s most valuable company in 2011 and the iPhone maker has largely held on to that position since then aside from a few brief incursions However Apple lost its $3 trillion market cap and status as the world’s largest company to Microsoft last month and has failed to reclaim the top position as of yet Incidentally CEO Elon Musk believes that Tesla will someday become the world’s biggest company While Musk is known for his flamboyant claims including about Tesla’s roadmap to full autonomy the fact remains that stock market winners have changed and will continue to do so in the future Nvidia currently has momentum and the market sentiments are even more positive after the fiscal Q4 earnings call last week At the same time a section of the market – which includes valuation guru Ashwath Damodaran – believes that the rise in Nvidia stock has gone too far While the “dean of valuation” believes almost the entire “Magnificent 7” is overvalued he singled out NVDA in particular To be sure the kind of multiples that Nvidia now trades at dont make the stock a good fit for value investors like Damodaran However for those chasing growth I believe Nvidia is a long-term buy-and-hold story that has a chance to become the biggest company someday Provided Content: Content provided by Barchart The Globe and Mail was not involved and material was not reviewed prior to publication How much is Microsoft Corp stock worth?

1004,"Will Microsoft Disable Your Computer If You Share Fake News?!","2/4/2024","https://www.techarp.com/facts/microsoft-disable-computer-facts/","Is Microsoft planning to disable your computer if you post or share fake news / misinformation?! Take a look at the viral claim and find out what the facts really are! People are sharing an article (archive) by The People’s Voice (formerly NewsPunch) which claims that Microsoft is planning to disable your computer if you post or share fake news / misinformation! Microsoft To Disable Computers of Users Who Share ‘Non-Mainstream Content’ Online Microsoft has announced plans to disable the computers of people who share ‘non-mainstream’ content online in an attempt to combat so-called ‘misinformation’ in the run-up to the 2024 election During an interview with NBC’s Lester Holt Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella was questioned about how AI might either assist or endanger the future election Reclaimthenetorg reports: However Nadella’s response seemed to imply a willingness to use technology for censoring content in pursuit of fighting what he identified as disinformation Nadella stated “This is not the first election where we dealt with disinformation or propaganda campaigns by adversaries and election interference “We’re doing all the work across the tech industry around watermarking detecting deep fakes and content IDs There is going to be enough and more technology quite frankly in order to be able to identify the issues around disinformation and misinformation” Recommended : Is Interpol Investigating Bill Gates For Murder?! This is yet another example of FAKE NEWS created / promoted by The People’s Voice and here are the reasons why… Fact #1 : Microsoft Did Not Announce Plans To Disable Computers Let me start by pointing out that Microsoft did not announce any plans to disable computers of people who share “non-mainstream” content online in an attempt to combat “misinformation” in the run-up to the 2024 US Presidential election If Microsoft actually announced such plans it would have been major news covered by news outlets all over the world It would also have gone viral on social media with conservative and right-wing personalities criticising those plans Microsoft certainly made no such announcement and The People’s Voice offered no evidence to back up its “fact checked” claim Fact #2 : Satya Nadella Is Microsoft CEO Not Bill Gates Interestingly The People’s Voice article used a photo of Bill Gates even though he handed over day-to-day operations at Microsoft more than 15 years ago He also stepped down as Microsoft Chairman when Satya Nadella was appointed as CEO in February 2014 If Microsoft does indeed plan to disable computers to fight fake news that decision would have to be approved by its CEO and Chairman Satya Nadella Not its former founder Bill Gates How is Bill Gates involved in this “story”? Nothing in the article even remotely suggests that Bill Gates is in any way involved in Microsoft affairs or the non-existent plan to disable computers of people who share fake news / misinformation Recommended : Is Bill Gates Planning To Kill Billions Using Turbo AIDS?! Fact #3 : Satya Nadella Never Said Anything About Disabling Computers The People’s Voice article used a video of Lester Holt from NBC News interviewing Satya Nadella as evidence that Microsoft plans to disable computers of people who share misinformation However that’s completely nonsensical The NBC News video only shows Satya Nadella saying that the tech industry is using technological solutions like watermarking [AI created content] detecting deep fakes and implementing content IDs to fight disinformation and misinformation This is not the first election where we dealt with disinformation or propaganda campaigns by adversaries and election interference We’re doing all the work across the tech industry around watermarking detecting deep fakes and content IDs There is going to be enough and more technology quite frankly in order to be able to identify the issues around disinformation and misinformation Fact #4 : Microsoft Can’t “Magically” Disable Computers Remotely Even if Microsoft is so inclined disabling a computer remotely isn’t like waving a magic wand or chanting “Abracadabra”! With the possible exception of specifically hacking into your computer to gain access or tricking you into installing malware it is not possible for Microsoft to remotely disable your computer simply because you shared fake news or misinformation The People’s Voice article certainly offered no explanation of how Microsoft might conceivably disable your computer remotely… like magic! Recommended : Is Bill Gates Facing Life Behind Bars For Child Rape?! Fact #5 : The People’s Voice Is Known For Publishing Fake News The People’s Voice is the current name for NewsPunch which possibly changed its name because its brand has been so thoroughly discredited after posting numerous shocking but fake stories Founded as Your News Wire in 2014 it was rebranded as NewsPunch in November 2018 before becoming The People’s Voice A 2017 BuzzFeed report identified NewsPunch as the second-largest source of popular fake news on Facebook that year Its articles have been regularly debunked as fake news so you should never share anything from NewsPunch / The People’s Voice Here are some of its fake stories that I fact checked earlier: Please help us FIGHT FAKE NEWS by sharing this fact check article out and please SUPPORT our work!

1013,"Microsoft vs Apple: Who Will Win The Market Cap Race?","1/12/2024","https://www.ccn.com/analysis/microsoft-apple-market-cap-race/","Microsofts market capitalizion briefly surpassed Apples: who will be the most valuable company? Key Takeaways In the realm of technology two titans stand head and shoulder above the rest: Microsoft and Apple These tech giants have been locked in an epic battle for years vying for supremacy in the market capitalization race While Apple held the top spot for much of the past decade Microsoft has been making a strong comeback and the two companies are now neck and neck The question is: who will ultimately emerge victorious? In a stunning reversal of fortunes Microsoft (MSFT) briefly reclaimed its throne as the world’s most valuable company on Thursday overtaking Apple (AAPL) for the first time in three years This seismic shift in the tech landscape is attributed to Microsoft’s surging generative artificial intelligence (AI) business spearheaded by its investment in ChatGPT-maker OpenAI Microsoft’s stock price soared by 05% boosting its market capitalization to a staggering $2859 trillion The company’s shares even briefly touched the $2903 trillion mark marking a significant victory in its ongoing battle for supremacy with Apple Despite this setback Apple remains a formidable force in the tech industry with a market capitalization of $2886 trillion However concerns over iPhone demand and slowing growth have weighed on its stock price allowing Microsoft to seize the moment DA Davidson analyst Gil Luria told Reuters: “It was inevitable that Microsoft would overtake Apple since Microsoft is growing faster and has more to benefit from the generative AI revolution” The battle for market dominance between these tech giants is far from over but Microsoft’s recent surge in value indicates that it is firmly on the offensive With its investments in cutting-edge AI technologies Microsoft will solidify its position as a leader in the next generation of computing A significant contributor to Microsoft’s notable gains last year was its early foray into the generative AI market The company headquartered in Redmond Washington strategically invested $10 billion in the startup OpenAI in late 2022 The impact of OpenAI’s ChatGPT chatbot was instrumental in igniting the current surge of interest in generative AI Microsoft is now methodically incorporating AI into its expansive consumer and enterprise technology portfolio In a recent announcement the company unveiled plans to introduce an AI key on its Windows PC keyboard This innovative button is designed to activate Microsoft’s AI assistant named Copilot marking the first substantial modification to the keyboard in three decades Before this development Microsoft had integrated Copilot services into its enterprise Office suite of apps on November 1 of the previous year Leveraging generative AI the tool provides suggestions and automates tasks within software applications such as Word and Excel Microsoft has reported that offering businesses access to generative AI tools has significantly contributed to increased sales for its Azure cloud-computing business as highlighted in the company’s October earnings call Jefferies analyst Brent Thill recently designated Microsoft as a top pick for 2024 In a client note Thill expressed confidence that applications in generative AI will play a pivotal role in reaccelerating growth for Azure and the introduction of AI PCs could potentially stimulate a refresh cycle for personal computers Echoing this sentiment Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives in a December note characterized the Copilot feature as a “game changer” He underscored the transformative impact Microsoft’s AI initiatives will have in the industry Microsoft has seamlessly integrated OpenAI‘s technology across its suite of productivity software contributing to a resurgence in its cloud-computing business during the July-September quarter In contrast Apple is contending with weakened demand Particularly for its flagship product the iPhone which has historically been its primary revenue driver Challenges in China a critical market persist as the country’s economy gradually recovers from the pandemic and competition from resurgent Huawei erodes Apple’s market share As of the most recent close Apple’s shares have dipped by 33% in January so far while Microsoft has seen a 18% rise This reflects a discrepancy in their market performance Both technology giants currently carry a relatively high share price-to-earnings (PE) ratio a common metric for valuing publicly listed companies Apple trades at a forward PE of 28 notably exceeding its 10-year average of 19 according to data from LSEG Meanwhile Microsoft is trading around 31 times forward earnings surpassing its 10-year average of 24 Yesterday Microsoft [@Microsoft ] overtook Apple [@Apple ] as the worlds most valuable company: pictwittercom/upT3HFNVQi — Mwango Capital (@MwangoCapital) January 12 2024 Despite Apple’s market capitalization peaking at $3081 trillion on December 14 the company closed the previous year with a gain of 48% trailing behind Microsoft’s impressive 57% rise Microsoft has intermittently surpassed Apple as the most valuable company a trend observed since 2018 It also notably occurred in 2021 amid concerns about COVID-induced supply chain disruptions affecting Apple’s stock price Currently Wall Street sentiment favors Microsoft with the absence of any “sell” rating Furthermore an overwhelming 90% of brokerages covering the company recommend a “buy” In contrast Apple faces two “sell” ratings and only two-thirds of analysts covering the company rate it as a “buy”"

1017,"None","1/16/2024","https://www.microsoft.com/insidetrack/blog/optimizing-microsofts-sap-environment-with-microsoft-azure/","How Microsoft does IT Jan 16 2024 Inside Track staff At Microsoft we use SAP enterprise resource management software to run our mission-critical business functions like finance and human resources In an on-premises model physical computing resources are costly and may go unused But by moving our SAP systems to Microsoft Azure we avoid maintaining unused resources—we scale our systems up and down for current and short-term needs By doing this we’ve fine-tuned our capacity management processes for lower costs and more agility scalability and flexibility Like many enterprises our company uses SAP—the enterprise resource planning (ERP) software solution—to run most of our business operations We’re running SAP on Microsoft Azure the preferred platform for SAP and the optimal platform for digital transformation We’ve optimized our SAP on Microsoft Azure environment to gain business and operational benefits that make our SAP instance agile efficient and able to grow and change with our business needs Optimizing our Microsoft Azure environment has allowed us to: As of 2018 Microsoft’s instance of SAP is 100 percent migrated to Microsoft Azure By optimizing SAP on Azure we’re positioning our SAP environment to grow and change with our business needs Additionally we’re positioned to lead our digital transformation and empower everyone in our organization to achieve more Azure makes SAP better [Discover how we’re protecting Microsoft’s SAP workload with Microsoft Sentinel Learn how Microsoft moved its SAP workload to the cloud Find out how we’re transforming how we monitor our SAP instance with Microsoft Azure] Each SAP system or app in our overall SAP landscape uses servers and hardware computing resources (like CPU and memory) and storage resources Each system also has separate environments like sandbox and production The resources required to run SAP can be costly in an on-premises model where you have physical or virtualized servers that often go unused Consider a typical on-premises system The IT industry often sizes on-premises servers and storage infrastructure for the next three to five years based on the expected maximum utilization and workload during the life span of an asset But often the full capacity of the hardware isn’t used outside of peak periods—or isn’t needed at all Maintaining these on-premises systems is costly With Microsoft Azure we avoid infrastructure underutilization and overprovisioning We quickly and easily scale up and scale down our SAP systems for current and short-term needs not for maximum load over the next three to five years By managing capacity and sizing our SAP systems on Microsoft Azure we’ve experienced improvements in several areas: Optimizing involves calculating our hardware requirements like CPU resources storage space memory input/output (I/O) and network bandwidth When we optimize we size for today We assess our infrastructure resources and costs and then size our systems as small as possible We also ensure that sufficient space to run business processes without causing performance issues during expected events like product releases or quarterly financial reporting This capability provides us with the ability to optimize our storage and computing power giving us flexibility and on-demand agility Sizing is an ongoing task because your load business requirements and behavior patterns can change at any time The following are some considerations and tips based on the process that we use: We used two common strategies for sizing SAP systems each in a different way and at different points in the optimization process We used the SAP Quick Sizer at the start of our optimization process because it had a simple web-based interface and it allowed us to prepare our sizing strategies from the start We used reference sizing later after we determined some context around our virtual-machine sizing and could provide virtual machines in Microsoft Azure for reference If you don’t yet have systems or workloads in Microsoft Azure start with SAP Quick Sizer—it’s an online app that guides you on sizing requirements based on your business needs Quick Sizer is helpful for capacity and budget planning The app has a questionnaire where you indicate the number of SAP users how many transactions you expect and other details The SAP system recommends a number for the SAP Application Performance Standard (SAPS) a measurement of processing requirements that you need such as for a database server If the recommended number is 80000 you need to leverage servers with SAPS that add up to 80000 You can find more information about SAPS for Azure virtual machines in SAP Note #1928533 SAP Applications on Azure: Supported Products and Azure VM types (SAP logon required) You should keep a few considerations in mind when you’re using SAP Quick Sizer There can be customization and variations of SAP systems depending on business processes which could change system behavior Or you might have capabilities enabled for new SAP deployments or custom code for which no Quick Sizer exists Also in the past hardware vendors guided customers on the servers that they needed and how to install them With Azure customers make their own decisions—for example how to grow storage as data volume grows or how to adjust CPU compute resources After systems are live in Microsoft Azure reference sizing is the recommended method With this approach you need to look at the performance of systems you’ve already moved to Azure that have a similar load to the systems that you want to move This comparison helps you estimate your sizing requirements accurately For example if you have an on-premises system that you want to move to Microsoft Azure and it’s three times larger than one of the systems that you already have on Azure adjust the sizing based on systems you’ve already deployed in Azure and then deploy the new system If it turns out that your estimate wasn’t accurate it’s much easier and quicker to adjust CPU and memory resources in Microsoft Azure than on-premises by switching to a different virtual machine size Adjusting the database on-premises is more difficult because you might need to buy servers with more CPU and memory For on-premises you must look at what you have add a buffer and consider the additional load that you’ll have in the next few years When we integrate SAP with Windows Server and SQL Server our main considerations are cost of ownership and low complexity When you plan your integration and reference architecture make sure that the technical landscape is easy and cost effective With business-critical systems it’s difficult to scale when you have an architecture whose maintenance requires highly skilled individuals or when there are emergencies where you need business continuity For easy administration and operations we use the same app design in all SAP production systems We only adjust VM sizes and numbers based on the system-specific requirements Also to avoid issues for customers who run SAP workloads on Azure Microsoft certifies only certain Microsoft Azure VM types These VMs must meet memory CPU and ratio requirements and they must support defined throughputs To learn more about Azure VM types certified for SAP review SAP certifications and configurations running on Microsoft Azure The graphic below shows the Microsoft SAP ERP/ECC production system in Microsoft Azure By moving to Azure we’ve gained agility and scalability on the SAP Application layer We can scale the SAP Application layer up and down by increasing and decreasing the size and number of the VMs The design and architecture have high-availability measures against single points of failure So if we need to update Windows Server or Microsoft SQL Server perform infrastructure maintenance or make other system changes it doesn’t require much if any downtime We implement infrastructure in Azure for our production systems with standard SAP SQL Server SAP HANA Windows Server and SUSE Linux high-availability features To ensure high availability we are leveraging Microsoft Azure Availability Zones: We distribute our VMs in multiple zones The graphic above includes an example of how we use Azure Availability Zones If a problem arises in one zone the system is still available All single points of failure are secured with clustering: Windows Server Failover Cluster for the Windows operating system and Pacemaker cluster for SUSE Linux For databases we use SQL Server Always On and SAP HANA System Replication (HSR) The databases are configured for a synchronous commit on both local HA nodes (no data loss occurs and automatic failover is possible) and an asynchronous commit to the remote disaster recovery node If an issue arises with the main database server SAP will automatically reconnect to the local high availability node Because we can use the secondary database we can upgrade software and SQL Server roll back to previous releases and do automatic failovers with no or minimal risk For scalability and high availability of the SAP application layer multiple SAP app server instances are assigned to SAP redundancy features such as logon groups and batch server groups Those app server instances are configured on different Microsoft Azure virtual machines to ensure high availability SAP automatically dispatches the workload to multiple app-server instances per the group definitions If an app server instance isn’t available business processes can still run via other SAP app server instances that are part of the same group The scale-out logic of SAP app server instances is also used for rolling maintenance We remove one virtual machine and the SAP app server instances running on it from the SAP system without affecting production After we finish our work we add back the virtual machine and the SAP system automatically uses the instances again If high load occurs and we need to scale out we add additional virtual machines to our SAP systems To ensure that VM costs are managed we’ve established new policies for nonproduction SAP systems: Default setting for a system is that’s unavailable Users can start systems on demand by using a snooze application build on top of Microsoft Power Apps The system will be available for 12 hours and then automatically shut down again unless the availability time was extended Additionally systems that are used regularly are assigned to a fixed availability schedule For example the schedule might be: Systems will be shut down Friday evening and started again on Monday morning without user interaction In the event that the system is needed over the weekend users can start the system by using the snooze application Moving SAP systems to Microsoft Azure enabled easy integration with various Microsoft Azure Monitor services for enhanced telemetry and monitoring We approached telemetry by using a multilayer concept: 1) SAP Business Process layer 2) SAP Application Foundational layer 3) SAP Infrastructure layer and 4) SAP Surrounding API layer Microsoft Azure Log Analytics offers many standard metrics for the SAP Infrastructure layer and it’s easy to integrate with SAP to collect custom metrics from the Application Foundational layer Implementing telemetry for the SAP business process and API layers is relatively challenging because doing so requires custom development We use tools in the ABAP SDK to integrate and export data from SAP to Microsoft Azure Monitor Application Insights Learn more about end-to-end telemetry for SAP on Microsoft Azure and find out additional information about how Microsoft’s internal SAP workload has received a telemetry boost from Microsoft Azure We keep learning and iterating as we optimize SAP for Microsoft Azure in our environment Here are some important lessons that we’ve learned: We’re excited about the decreased costs and increased agility that we’ve experienced so far in optimizing SAP for Microsoft Azure In the future we plan to share more lessons that we learn as we move forward with post-migration improvements For information on designing a migration initiative review Strategies for migrating SAP systems

covering Microsoft PC gaming console and tech He founded WinRumors a site dedicated to Microsoft news before joining The Verge in 2012 Microsoft is laying off 1900 employees at Activision Blizzard and Xbox this week While Microsoft is primarily laying off roles at Activision Blizzard some Xbox and ZeniMax employees will also be impacted by the cuts The cuts work out to roughly 8 percent of the overall Microsoft Gaming division that stands at around 22000 employees in total The Verge has obtained an internal memo from Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer that confirms the layoffs: It’s been a little over three months since the Activision Blizzard and King teams joined Microsoft As we move forward in 2024 the leadership of Microsoft Gaming and Activision Blizzard is committed to aligning on a strategy and an execution plan with a sustainable cost structure that will support the whole of our growing business Together we’ve set priorities identified areas of overlap and ensured that we’re all aligned on the best opportunities for growth As part of this process we have made the painful decision to reduce the size of our gaming workforce by approximately 1900 roles out of the 22000 people on our team The Gaming Leadership Team and I are committed to navigating this process as thoughtfully as possible The people who are directly impacted by these reductions have all played an important part in the success of Activision Blizzard ZeniMax and the Xbox teams and they should be proud of everything they’ve accomplished here We are grateful for all of the creativity passion and dedication they have brought to our games our players and our colleagues We will provide our full support to those who are impacted during the transition including severance benefits informed by local employment laws Those whose roles will be impacted will be notified and we ask that you please treat your departing colleagues with the respect and compassion that is consistent with our values Looking ahead we’ll continue to invest in areas that will grow our business and support our strategy of bringing more games to more players around the world Although this is a difficult moment for our team I’m as confident as ever in your ability to create and nurture the games stories and worlds that bring players together Phil Alongside the layoffs Blizzard president Mike Ybarra has decided to leave the company “As many of you know Mike previously spent more than 20 years at Microsoft Now that he has seen the acquisition through as Blizzard’s president he has decided to leave the company” says Microsoft’s game content and studios president Matt Booty in an internal memo Microsoft plans to name a new Blizzard president next week Allen Adham Blizzard’s chief design officer is also leaving the company “As one of Blizzard’s cofounders Allen has had a broad impact on all of Blizzard’s games His influence will be felt for years to come both directly and indirectly as Allen plans to continue mentoring young designers across the industry” says Booty Blizzard’s previously announced survival game has also been canceled as part of these changes Booty says Microsoft will be “shifting some of the people working on it to one of several promising new projects Blizzard has in the early stages of development” The layoffs come the same month Riot Games Google Discord Twitch Unity eBay and others announced cuts Microsoft completed its $687 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard in October following 20 months of battles with regulators in the UK and US Former Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick stepped down at the end of December with Microsoft not appointing a direct replacement Instead a suite of Activision Blizzard executives now report up to Matt Booty Today’s layoffs come just a few months after some big Xbox leadership changes saw Sarah Bond promoted to Xbox president leading all Xbox platform and hardware work Booty was also promoted to president of game content and studios which includes overseeing Bethesda ZeniMax studios and Activision Blizzard Microsoft last announced big layoffs a year ago affecting 10000 employees The software maker is due to report its fiscal Q2 2024 earnings next week which for the first time will include results from the impact of the Activision Blizzard acquisition Here’s Matt Booty’s internal memo in full: Blizzard team As you may have read in Phil’s note today is a challenging day as we say goodbye to some of our colleagues This is a difficult process but it is one that will best enable Blizzard and Xbox to deliver ambitious games for our players on more platforms and in more places than ever before We are moving forward with a more focused strategy across Microsoft Gaming that sets us up for sustainable growth and aligns our talent and resources to our top priorities In addition to the events today Mike Ybarra and I have been discussing his future and some of his personal passions for some time As many of you know Mike previously spent more than 20 years at Microsoft Now that he has seen the acquisition through as Blizzard’s president he has decided to leave the company As we move forward we will continue to build on the positive momentum that Mike created and strive to continue exceeding the expectations of Blizzard’s players I want to thank Mike for his leadership and for his partnership and counsel since the deal closed I know he plans to travel and spend more time with his family We wish him the very best Additionally Allen Adham Blizzard’s Chief Design Officer is leaving the company As one of Blizzard’s cofounders Allen has had a broad impact on all of Blizzard’s games His influence will be felt for years to come both directly and indirectly as Allen plans to continue mentoring young designers across the industry The new Blizzard President will be announced next week What Happens Next Those who are impacted are being informed in meetings starting today Given the challenging day ahead anyone who is set up to work from home and would prefer to can work remotely today Due to time zones and local holidays some impacted employees in APAC and EMEA will be informed later this evening and into early next week After the notifications are complete leaders will bring their teams together Please be mindful of this process in your conversations and outreach during these next few days Details on Today’s Actions The changes announced today reflect a focus on products and strategies that hold the most promise for Blizzard’s future growth as well as identified areas of overlap across Blizzard and Microsoft Gaming Today’s actions affect multiple teams within Blizzard including development teams shared service organizations and corporate functions As part of this focus Blizzard is ending development on its survival game project and will be shifting some of the people working on it to one of several promising new projects Blizzard has in the early stages of development No matter the reason behind these decisions they are never made lightly Changes like these affect the lives of colleagues and friends and we are all grateful for their meaningful contributions to Blizzard and its world class lineup of games As Phil stated we will provide our full support to those who are impacted during the transition including severance benefits informed by local employment laws I understand that this is a challenging time and that it can be a lot to process I haven’t met many of you yet and hearing about these decisions from me may be difficult Today I am here on Blizzard’s Irvine campus and I am personally committed to supporting you as teams and individuals keeping you informed and approaching this transition period with care and transparency Thank you for working through these changes with us Together we will continue to create amazing games for our players with a culture that empowers everyone to be their most authentic selves and do

beat market estimates for quarterly profit and revenue on Tuesday as new artificial-intelligence features helped attract customers to its Azure cloud service as they built out their own AI services But Microsoft shares were down 1% after-hours as investors absorbed news about rising costs to develop these AI features The company forecast operating expenses of $158 billion to $159 billion in the current quarter up from $154 billion in the previous one It also said it expects capital expenditures to increase materially on a sequential basis Microsoft in collaboration with ChatGPT creator OpenAI has pushed chatbots into its core products such as its Office software and Bing search engine over the past year attracting business customers eager to try the tech industrys next breakthrough Investor buzz over AI helped Microsofts shares rise by 57% in 2023 But this has also increased Microsofts costs and investors are watching growth in its Azure and Office business closely to see if that keeps up with the massive investments it plans to pour into data centers this year to deliver generative AI Weve moved from talking about AI to applying AI at scale CEO Satya Nadella said in a statement By infusing AI across every layer of our tech stack were winning new customers and helping drive new benefits and productivity gains across every sector Brett Iversen Microsofts vice president for investor relations told Reuters that 6 percentage points of the growth rate of cloud-computing platform Azure in the second quarter was attributable to AI That is double the 3 percentage points in the first quarter There are now 53000 Azure AI customers a third of whom were new to the service in the past 12 months Nadella told analysts on a conference call Overall we are seeing larger and more strategic Azure deals with an increase in the number of billion dollar plus Azure commitments he said without giving a time frame Total revenue grew 18% to $62 billion in the quarter ended Dec 31 compared with the average analyst estimate of $6112 billion according to LSEG data Adjusted profit of $293 per share beat an average estimate of $278 per share Revenue at Microsofts Intelligent Cloud unit which houses the Azure cloud computing platform grew 20% to $259 billion Sales of Azure grew 30% - its best growth rate in four quarters - compared with a 277% consensus estimate from Visible Alpha and outstripping a 257% growth in Google Cloud Sales at Microsofts More Personal Computing segment which includes its Windows operating system and gaming business grew 19% to $169 billion powered in part by the close of its $69 billion purchase of Call of Duty maker Activision Blizzard Analysts had expected $168 billion Microsofts Productivity and Business Process segment which contains the LinkedIn social network in addition to Office sales reported that sales rose 13% to $192 billion just beating estimates The software giant has delivered a healthy set of results but not in a strong enough dose to appease the market said Sophie Lund-Yates lead equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown AI-related companies lost $190 billion in stock market value late on Tuesday after Microsoft Alphabet GOOGLO and Advanced Micro Devices AMDO delivered quarterly results that failed to impress investors who have sent their stocks soaring AI-POWERED SURGE While analysts have said that any meaningful gains from AI may not come before next year investors have rewarded the companys push into AI and strategic partnership with Silicon Valley startup OpenAI In November Microsoft started selling Copilot an AI assistant that can summarize an email inbox or craft a slide show for $30 per month which analysts say is a premium price Early sales of the product showed up in the firms commercial sales of Office software where revenue grew 17% compared with analyst expectations of commercial Office sales growth of 142% according to data from Visible Alpha Microsoft does not provide an absolute dollar figure for the sales Microsofts Iversen said on Tuesday that Offices commercial offerings where Copilot is being sold now stand at 400 million paid seats up from 382 million in April 2023 The companys capital expenditures grew by $300 million from the previous quarter to $115 billion putting the company on track to spend more than $46 billion this fiscal year Thats a sign of the customer demand that were seeing Iversen said Microsofts stock surge has helped it topple Apple AAPLO as the worlds most valuable listed company in the past few trading sessions That was undented by a power struggle within OpenAI that highlighted the software giants lack of direct control over its important partner Microsoft also faces some legal and regulatory challenges Reporting by Yuvraj

Well I believe so I wouldnt expect Microsofts total returns to be almost 24000% in the next 30 years as they were over the past 30 years but consistent investments in the company could lead to substantial growth MSFT data by YCharts One of Microsofts fastest-growing segments is its Intelligent Cloud division which includes its cloud platform Azure Although Azure trails Amazon Web Service (AWS) in market share -- 19% of cloud spending in the third quarter of 2023 compared with AWSs 31% -- it has made considerable progress in the past few years In 2016 Azures market share was around 11% As of the end of 2023 the global cloud computing market is estimated to be around $626 billion By 2028 its expected to be over $126 trillion a compound annual growth rate of around 15% As the overall cloud pie gets larger Microsoft has a chance to continue gaining market share as its growing faster than the current leader AWS Microsoft should see a boost to its profits as Azure grows because its a much higher-margin business than other segments involving physical products such as PCs or Surfaces MSFT Net Income (Quarterly) data by YCharts Microsofts partnership with ChatGPTs creator OpenAI could prove to be a game-changer for the company The partnership first started in 2017 when Microsoft invested $1 billion in OpenAI giving it capital to fuel its research and development Since then Microsoft has introduced two additional phases to its long-term partnership with OpenAI The deals essentially combine the AI expertise of OpenAI with the vast resources and cloud computing power of Microsoft Thats a match made in AI heaven For Microsoft being able to leverage OpenAIs language models like GPT-4 and integrate it into its products and services will allow them to become even more efficient and competitive against other options Current examples include using Copilot in GitHub to suggest code improvements and making developers more productive as well as using GPT-4 in Azure Short of generational returns or a large lump-sum to invest at once the only way a stock could be a millionaire-maker is if it has continued success over a long period Given the robustness of Microsofts product and service ecosystem there may not be another big tech stock built for this sustained success quite like Microsoft Microsoft operates in productivity (Office) professional networking (LinkedIn) gaming (Xbox) the cloud (Azure) operating systems (Windows) and a handful of other markets Having this diversification is key to weathering economic storms because it reduces reliance and encourages long-term stability If the iPhone struggles Apple struggles And if Google advertising struggles Alphabet struggles In addition if e-commerce struggles Amazon struggles And so by no means is Microsoft exempt from struggles but there isnt a single product service or segment that Microsoft leans on too much Making consistent investments in Microsoft is the most effective way to let it lead you to millionaire land John Mackey former CEO of Whole Foods Market an Amazon subsidiary is a member of The Motley Fool’s board of directors Suzanne Frey an executive at Alphabet is a member of The Motley Fool’s board of directors Stefon Walters has positions in Apple and Microsoft The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Alphabet Amazon Apple and Microsoft The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy Invest better with The Motley Fool Get stock recommendations portfolio guidance and more from The Motley Fools premium services Making the world smarter happier and richer © 1995 - 2024 The Motley Fool All rights reserved Market data powered by Xignite and Polygonio"

in-depth research investing resources and more Learn More As the worlds second most valuable company with a market cap of $28 billion its hard not to be bullish about Microsoft (MSFT -015%) The company is a leader in productivity software with millions of businesses worldwide relying on its platforms Meanwhile it emerged as one of the biggest threats in artificial intelligence (AI) in 2023 thanks to a lucrative partnership with ChatGPT developer OpenAI Shares in Microsoft have risen more than 380000% since it went public in 1986 which could suggest the best time to buy its stock was long ago However the tech industry is an ever-expanding market known for offering innovative companies consistent gains over the long term As one of its leaders Microsoft likely still has much to offer new investors in the coming years So heres why its not too late to buy Microsoft stock An economic downturn caused a dramatic sell-off in 2022 with tech stocks hit particularly hard Spikes in inflation led to reductions in consumer and commercial spending reflected in multiple quarters of dismal earnings from several companies While Microsoft was not unscathed it outperformed many of its peers during the challenging year illustrating the lack of vulnerabilities in its business compared to the competition Data by YCharts This chart shows Microsofts stock experienced a more moderate decline than many of the most prominent tech firms and was one of the few to outperform the Nasdaq Composite in 2022 While many of these companies relied heavily on economically vulnerable industries like digital advertising and the consumer sector Microsofts larger focus on software fortified its business against the worst market declines Easing inflation and excitement over budding sectors like AI have triggered a recovery for the tech market over the last year with the future bright for many companies in 2024 However its still worth dedicating a significant portion of your portfolio to a reliable stock like Microsoft which you can confidently hold no matter the economic climate In the first quarter of 2024 (which ended September 2023) Microsoft posted revenue growth of 13% year over year as it beat analysts expectations by almost $2 billion Meanwhile its free cash flow topped $63 billion As a result the company is on a promising growth path with the funds to fuel its research and development (R&D) and overcome any potential headwinds Microsoft had the foresight of the decade when it invested $1 billion in OpenAI in 2019 The company has since extended its partnership with the start-up achieving a 49% stake in its business and gaining exclusive access to some of the most advanced AI models available Microsofts headstart in AI gave it a leg up on competitors like Amazon and Alphabet using OpenAIs technology to bring upgrades across its product lineup Over the last year Microsoft added new AI tools to its cloud platform Azure updated Bing with ChatGPT-like features and boosted efficiency on its various Office productivity services with the help of AI The company has built immense brand loyalty with its substantial user base over the years giving it almost endless earnings potential in AI Microsoft is already making moves to monetize its AI offerings introducing an AI assistant called Copilot on Microsoft 365 last year The assistant is a chatbot that can be used in apps such as Word Excel PowerPoint Outlook and more Microsoft 365 members can add Copilot to an existing subscription for an extra $30 per month According to Grand View Research the AI market is projected to develop at a compound annual growth rate of 37% through 2030 exceeding a value of $1 trillion Meanwhile Microsoft is setting itself up to be the go-to for anyone seeking AI services whether their purposes are business educational or lifestyle Microsofts stock looks slightly expensive with a forward price-to-earnings ratio of around 34 However hard-hitting brands like Office Azure and Xbox a history of resilience and significant cash reserves suggest the company has earned its premium price Microsoft is nowhere near hitting its ceiling and with the power of AI it could have a long lucrative future that you wont want to miss out on As a result its certainly not too late to invest in this tech giant John Mackey former CEO of Whole Foods Market an Amazon subsidiary is a

So I’d like to use today’s Market 360 to shine the spotlight on Super Micro Computer and explain what’s behind its explosive rally I’m proud to say that I found the company well before it turned into the hottest AI stock on Wall Street So I’ll also share why I recommended the stock back in 2022 – and if it’s still a buy today Here’s what you need to know about Super Micro Computer and its massive rally… The company primarily develops computer servers and infrastructure for data centers and the cloud It has experienced robust demand for these technologies and also for its AI platform Now SMCI’s rally started on Thursday January 18 Super Micro announced preliminary results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2024 The numbers from the preview were simply stunning and it was thanks to strong demand for AI servers Wall Street cheered the news – driving the stock more than 30% higher on Friday January 19 But that was just the beginning On Monday January 29 SMCI released its full quarterly results During its second quarter in fiscal year 2024 total sales more than doubled year-over-year to $366 billion and earnings jumped 715% year-over-year to $559 per share The consensus estimate called for earnings of $493 per share on $306 billion in sales so Super Micro posted a 134% earnings surprise and a slight sales surprise Thanks to continuing demand Super Micro also increased its outlook for fiscal year 2024 again! The company now expects full-year revenue between $143 billion and $147 billion compared to previous estimates for $100 billion to $110 billion In turn the analyst community has continued to increase earnings estimates for the third and fourth quarters Third-quarter earnings are now forecast to soar 2497% year-over-year to $570 per share up from previous estimates for $430 per share a month ago Since then it’s been off to the races for SMCI Super Micro Computer first hit my screens back in June 2022… well before it caught Wall Street’s attention At the time it had just achieved record results for its third quarter in fiscal year 2022 Third-quarter revenue jumped 51% year-over-year to $136 billion which topped analysts’ estimates for $132 billion Earnings soared 210% year-over-year to $155 per share compared to $050 per share in the third quarter of 2021 Analysts expected earnings of $112 per share so SMCI posted a 384% earnings surprise When I saw that SMCI also earned an A-rating in Portfolio Grader for both its Fundamental and Quantitative Grades I knew it was time to buy So I recommended that my Accelerated Profits subscribers scoop up shares of SMCI while it was still trading around $50 Since then SMCI is up an incredible 1332% on my Accelerated Profits Buy List! Given SMCI’s incredible run this year I know some folks have started to wonder… is SMCI still a good buy? Well according to my Portfolio Grader that’s a big yes As you can see in the report card above SMCI still holds an A-rating and although its Fundamental Grade has dropped to a B-rating it’s still a good buy Now SMCI does trade at 216 times forecasted median earnings but it also has 204% forecasted sales growth and 2497% forecasted earnings growth In other words as long as earnings continue to work SMCI could easily continue to rally The bottom line: SMCI is a great stock (it’s one of my favorite AI stocks) with huge upside potential I also think SMCI will continue to lead the market In fact I believe many of my Accelerated Profits stocks will continue to emerge and lead the market higher Currently my Buy List is characterized by 368% average forecasted sales growth and 2046% average forecasted earnings growth And the stocks on my Buy List have also benefited from positive analyst revisions My Accelerated Profits Buy List stocks are the crème de la crème of the stock market – the stocks that are primed to post strong earnings results If you join me at Accelerated Profits you’ll get immediate access to my Buy List today Not only that but you will also get access to my Monthly Issues Weekly Updates Special Market Podcasts – and much more Click here to sign up for Accelerated Profits now (Already an Accelerated Profits member?

recommendations in-depth research investing resources and more Learn More As the cloud leaders serving a growing market for artificial intelligence (AI) Microsoft (MSFT -015%) and Amazon (AMZN 040%) are the two Magnificent Seven stocks I would feel the most comfortable buying and holding in almost any economy They are experiencing growing demand in their cloud service businesses that make them relatively low-risk bets right now Most importantly Microsoft and Amazon are producing growing free cash flow that can fuel investments in new AI tools for many years These two have tremendous customer followings that make them look unstoppable as long-term investments Heres more about why I would feel safe owning these two stocks in 2024 and beyond The interest in AI only seems to be placing a bigger spotlight on the advantages that large tech companies bring to the table with their enormous profitability and cash resources Smaller software start-ups in AI are losing money but Microsoft can deliver new AI features while raking in profits It says it now has 53000 customers using AI in its Azure cloud business with over a third of those new to Azure in the last year Azure is rapidly gaining share of the cloud market and might give the cloud leader Amazon Web Services (AWS) a run for its money soon enough The early success of Microsoft 365 Copilot which uses generative AI to bring information to users gives management confidence in future revenue opportunities The company is already very profitable generating $67 billion in free cash flow on $227 billion of revenue over the last four quarters But analysts at Goldman Sachs expect Microsofts AI Azure service alone to reach $200 billion in annual revenue in the next five years The emergence of AI plays right to the strengths of the companys leadership in software Adding AI to its productivity suite (eg in Word Excel) and cloud services spells significant upside potential for Microsofts revenue and stock performance over the next decade Amazon is seeing the same demand for AI in its cloud business as Microsoft is These two companies along with Alphabets Google Cloud are the big three that will likely continue to dominate the market for AI services over the long term What makes Amazon stand out is its dominant e-commerce business where the company can use its AI capabilities to bolster its advantages over competing retailers In its fourth-quarter earnings report management said that generative AI will continue to be an area of focus New AI tools such as the recently announced Rufus shopping assistant could enhance the browsing experience by allowing customers to find exactly what they are looking for increasing traffic and order frequency and therefore solidifying its competitive position Amazons cloud business gives it enormous advantages that will allow it to use AI to transform the retail business in ways other retailers wont be able to keep up with Its already reworking its cost structure to boost its cash resources for future investment Amazon has been streamlining its inventory assortment across its regional fulfillment centers to lower costs and boost profits Over the last four quarters it generated $32 billion in free cash flow on $574 billion of revenue Theres more coming beyond Rufus Amazon has a massive amount of customer data that will lead to more tools to enhance the shopping experience In noting the opportunities to transform the customer experience with AI CEO Andy Jassy said We believe it will ultimately drive tens of billions of dollars of revenue for Amazon over the next several years Its for these reasons the stock is surging back toward its previous peak and will almost certainly hit new highs over the next decade The

businessline apps on Connect with us TO ENJOY ADDITIONAL BENEFITS Connect With Us Get BusinessLine apps on By K V Kurmanath Comments READ LATER On February 4 ten years ago Satya Nadella took charge as the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Microsoft The company was at cross roads It lost its rhythm over the year and was unable to keep pace with the radically transforming technology space Google Apple and Amazon the tech companies much younger to it were on a growth trajectory Amazon primarily an e-commerce company made giant strides in the cloud space while Google could further cement its position in the digital space and Apple became a rage globally with its phones and tabs The company which turned 40 in 2014 made an attempt to find some space in the phone segment Its multi-billion dollar acquisition of Nokia’s phone business failed The Office suite was found to be too restrictive as its users were unable to get a seamless experience Nadella made some quick decisions as he took over the Redmond (US)-based tech giant The $76 billion acquisition of Nokia’s phone business was written off within a year after his taking over as the CEO It meant heavy job losses Admitting that the job losses were painful Nadella defended the decision Consequently LinkedIn the professional networking site was acquired Gaming company Minecraft which has huge application in sectors like education construction and technology was also added to the portfolio The company turned its focus on the cloud Though a late start Microsoft invested heavily under his leadership and emerged as a key cloud player globally Nadella saw opportunity in AI too The company invested in OpenAI the US-based startup that wowed the world with its Large Language Model (LLM) solution ChatGPT Being a majority stakeholder in the startup Microsoft has launched ‘CoPilot’ and is integrating it across all its platforms offering its customers the power of an LLM Nadella wrote the book ‘Hit Refresh’ a kind of autobiography of his self and the company post 2014 Nadella initiated a strategic shift in the company’s business emphasising a Mobile-First and Cloud-First’ approach focusing on expanding the cloud business The tech behemoth initiated collaborations with startups As he focussed on rebuilding the company culture he fostered a growth mindset and emphasised on the importance of customer obsession diversity and inclusivity “The reason I talk about empathy is that I believe this is the leading indicator of success Innovation comes only when you are able to meet unmet unarticulated needs—and this comes from a deep sense of empathy we all have” Nadella articulates “But you can’t go to work and say “turn on the empathy button” Your life’s experience will give you that passion and understanding for a particular customer a particular use case How you can connect (your life experience) to your work is what we want to invoke in the 100000 people who work at Microsoft” he says B Ashok Director of Applied Sciences and Engineering at Microsoft Research in Bengaluru says the last 10 years have been completely different “Nadella brought in a completely new culture in the company with a focus on collaboration and openness One of the first strategic moves he made was to make Microsoft Office suite available on iOS and Android platformsand offering Office on subscription model” Joined a little ahead of Satya in Microsoft Ashok who’s better known as Bash said that Nadella ensured all of the top executives received Non-Violent Communication training (a communication technique advocated by Marshall Rosenberg) He did away with ‘precision questioning’ which was designed to try and destroy the ideas proposed and encouraged a different way of questioning that promoted creative ideas “Another key aspect that he brought in was a growth mindset a learn-it-all attitude as opposed to a fixed mindset or a know-it-all attitude” he said These changes are evident in the way the company operates today As it completes 50 years in 2025 the company faces fresh challenges The New York Times which filed a case against OpenAI over copyright issues has made Microsoft too a respondent The company needs to find an answer to this question as it is actively integrating the Co-Pilot across all of its products and services The copyright petition could open a Pandora’s box as there is a chance that more and more content-led organisations might seek part of the revenues from LLM companies It also faces serious challenges in the cloud space and nimble-footed startups that are coming up with productivity and collaboration solutions challenging its leadership Comments BACK TO TOP Comments have to be in English and in full sentences They cannot be abusive or personal Please abide by

over $300 billion A decade later Microsofts valuation has swelled tenfold to $306 trillion making it the worlds most valuable public company ahead of Apple Its firmly entrenched as a leader in key areas such as cloud and artificial intelligence As Nadella marks his 10-year anniversary at the helm hes widely praised across the tech industry for changing the narrative at Microsoft whose stock fell 30% during Ballmers 14 years at the top In that era the company was squelched by Google in web search and mobile and was completely left behind in social media Many tech industry analysts and investors would say that thanks largely to Nadella Microsoft is now set up to be a powerhouse for the foreseeable future Nadella is special and someone to be considered as one of the GOATs among tech CEOs said Aravind Srinivas co-founder and CEO of AI startup Perplexity which has the backing of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos The acronym GOAT stands for greatest of all time There are plenty of obstacles in Nadellas way as he pursues further growth Regulators are concerned about Microsofts power Rivals are jealous Some clients are skeptical about spending even more money on the companys AI tools when they already allocate so much budget to so many Microsoft products And Microsoft along with its tech peers has dealt with mass layoffs of late cutting 10000 jobs in early 2023 and eliminating 1900 in January from its gaming division One of Microsofts biggest sore spots when Nadella took over was the closed nature of its products Microsoft was known to defend its proprietary Windows and Office software and denounce open-source alternatives Interoperability wasnt the most popular word There was a little bit of a take-it-or-leave-it culture said Aaron Levie co-founder and CEO of cloud storage vendor Box which spent its early years going directly after one of Microsofts products Nadella has made the company more attentive to customers needs Levie said The two companies now have multiple product integrations Nadellas Microsoft has also formed partnerships with some of its fiercest rivals In 2023 Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison visited Microsofts headquarters in Redmond Washington for the first time as the companies made a joint cloud announcement In a 2020 interview Pat Gelsinger then CEO of VMware said offering his companys software on Microsofts Azure cloud was akin to a Middle East peace treaty Gelsinger now runs Intel which makes chips for PCs running Microsoft Windows and clouds such as Azure In the Nadella age Microsoft has also contributed to open-source projects released software under open-source licenses and released a version of its Teams communications app for Linux Nadella has surprised people in other ways Michael Nathan was a senior director at Microsoft until 2016 when he left for a job in venture capital Nathan said he told Nadella about the opportunity after the two of them left a customer meeting in Silicon Valley Instead of getting angry or making the situation awkward Nadella told him to take what hed learned at Microsoft and share it I was like What? Nathan said That was amazing He totally lifted the burden of having that conversation Hes also decisive In 2018 Nadella came to believe in the idea of buying GitHub just 20 minutes after Nat Friedman then a Microsoft corporate vice president started pitching him on it Right away Nadella suggested that Friedman become GitHubs new CEO Friedman said Microsoft paid $75 billion for the code-storage startup Microsoft declined to provide a comment for this story Nobody would mistake Nadella for Ballmer the showman His predecessor was known for dancing on stage at conferences and hyping up crowds of thousands Ballmer is now the owner of the NBAs Los Angeles Clippers and can frequently be seen behaving similarly courtside While Nadella may not bring as much entertainment value hes proven to be more effective than Ballmer when it comes to dealmaking In addition to GitHub Nadella has made pricey acquisitions such as LinkedIn Minecraft parent Mojang and Nuance Communications that have contributed to Microsofts top line Ballmer was not so lucky His aQuantive and Nokia deals were disastrous More recently Nadella helped Microsoft land the $75 billion acquisition of game publisher Activision Blizzard a deal that investors wont know how to assess for a while And in AI Nadella is credited for investing billions of dollars in startup OpenAI leading to product enhancements and cloud revenue from customers both new and old and giving Microsoft a leadership position in an emerging market Nadella is perhaps best known in the tech industry for pushing Microsoft deeper into cloud computing Azure which delivered 30% revenue growth in the most recent quarter was started during the Ballmer years But Nadella brought it to life transforming it from a research project into a product said Kevin Dallas CEO of database software company EDB and a 24-year Microsoft veteran Im shameless in saying I look at him as a leader that Ive learned from grown from Dallas said I continue to watch him In looking at the road ahead for the 56-year-old Nadella here are some of the biggest challenges in his way: Microsoft looked at buying TikTok in the US in 2020 but nothing came of those discussions While some in the younger generations have Microsoft software at work its not necessarily what they grew up using and may not be what they prefer The company must prepare for the era when Gen Z is in charge of IT budgets OpenAIs ChatGPT which some students use could be a start Some Microsoft employees have been there for over 20 years Many will leave after far less time For years employees have said they can make more money at other big tech companies Some have received higher compensation after leaving and then returning Microsoft has $81 billion in cash and might want to use more of the stash to keep talent — especially the top tier — around for longer Microsoft critics often say the company rarely gets it right the first time with new hardware or software and that its best to wait for the third version Reviewers didnt take kindly to the original 2012 Surface tablet for example Todays Surface gets better marks but its nowhere near the most popular tablet on Amazon — the iPad is Microsoft remains weak when it comes to building products in new categories a former executive said The companys dual-screened Surface Duo phones running Android havent caught on and Microsoft Loop a response to modern productivity apps such as Notion has yet to catch fire in app stores Antitrust officials have recently blocked acquisitions at Adobe and Amazon They tried and failed to squash Microsofts purchase of Activision But Microsofts big push in AI has come through an investment not a purchase The Federal Trade Commissions Lina Khan said in January that the agency will examine cloud providers investments in AI startups Microsoft has also drawn inquiries in Europe over its cloud practices Regulatory crackdowns are nothing new at Microsoft which infamously changed some of its behavior following a high-profile case brought by the US Justice Department in the 1990s In regulatory filings Microsoft calls OpenAI our strategic partner The unusual nature of the arrangement was on display in November as Nadella worked overtime to get Sam Altman back on top at the startup after the board fired Altman suddenly Microsoft and OpenAI compete to sell AI services to companies and have a relationship that can cause internal tension In allocating graphics processing units to OpenAI for example Microsoft is sometimes depriving its other departments of them two people familiar with the matter told CNBC Altman told Nadella onstage at an event in November that the two companies have the best partnership in tech However OpenAI isnt always satisfied relying on Microsoft as its cloud supplier one of the people said Following the November brouhaha Nadella was at least able to get Microsoft a seat on OpenAIs board An OpenAI spokesperson told CNBC that the company views Microsoft as a very good partner Nadella is constantly searching for the next category that can generate revenue and profit The companys HoloLens augmented reality headset announced in 2016 hasnt become a big hit Nadella hoped that an AI Copilot added to the Bing search engine in February 2023 would convert into share gains but Google remains the clear leader in that category Nadella did say on a conference call this week that Bing gained share in the fourth quarter While AI might be Microsofts next big thing the company will have to continue to find new ways to drive growth Nadella has plenty to keep himself busy for now Analysts on average see enough expansion to project a 12% gain in the stock price over the next year according to FactSet WATCH: Microsoft

Microsoft is not looking to convert consumers who are convinced AI is a negative force “It’s to show there’s a ton of really useful goodness that can happen that isn’t threatening or scary or worrisome at all” said Hall Copilot was used to generate the goals featured within the ad: the chatbot was asked what people’s hopes and dreams are and responded with themes like “start my own business” “get my degree” and “write my story” Microsoft was a last-minute entrant to the Super Bowl this year It decided on the theme of its spot in November and bought the last 60-second spot available in CBS’ broadcast in early December Hall said Navigating production around the holidays was a challenge “It’s been quite a sprint” she said Thead will air during fourth quarter of the game While some major brands have told Campaign US they managed to negotiate CBS down from the roughly $7 million per 30-seconds of ad time the broadcaster was charging for the Big Game Microsoft wasn’t in a position to haggle “What happens when you’re late is that you don’t have a lot of negotiating power so I would not say we got a bargain But based on our analysis its worth the investment” said Hall She said there are “very few if any” opportunities for marketers to gain immediate reach at such a scale as the Super Bowl “There used to be more opportunities for communal experience of messaging — the final episode of Mash or Seinfeld — and that gave marketers an opportunity for really broad exposure really quickly” Hall said “There aren’t many left; football is one of them So if you’re looking to change perceptions and reach a mass audience with immediacy it’s the thing to do” This is Microsoft’s fifth Super Bowl spot; it first entered the Big Game a decade ago with an ad showing how its software products can “empower” humans by transforming medicine education and everyday life — a theme the brand continues to adopt today The brand also ran ads in the 2015 2019 and 2020 game Its 2019 spot focused on the Xbox Adaptive Controller designed for gamers with disabilities This year’s Super Bowl spot will be supported by search ads across Bing and Google YouTube ads and paid organic and influencer ads across TikTok Meta and X Dentsu’s Carat was responsible for media buying and planning Despite the continuous stream of negative headlines about the safety of Elon Musk’s X as a platform for consumers and advertisers Hall said “we have had no issues with X” “We are super diligent in reviewing brand safety and brand safety measures” she said “We’re very satisfied with the boundaries that they have in place as it relates to brands” She said the “immediacy of the conversation” that happens on X around major events is what continues to attract Microsoft to the platform an element that competitors like Threads have struggled to replicate The Super Bowl spot will eventually be translated into 30 markets to form a global campaign marketing Copilot that will run throughout the year Get the very latest news and insight from Campaign with unrestricted access to campaignlivecom plus get exclusive discounts to Campaign events Don’t miss your daily fix of breaking news latest work advice and commentary Elmo stars in mental health PSA following social media trauma dump The Guggenheim says it was ‘not informed’ it would be part of Beyoncé’s album promotion Movers & Shakers: Solo Stove Hard Mtn Dew Republica Havas and more Brands weigh in on Kate Middleton controversy on social media Moving beyond one-dimensional multicultural representation The politics behind the US TikTok ban is not what you think The habits of highly effective women"
